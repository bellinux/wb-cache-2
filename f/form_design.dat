50|$|Closed-core {{transformers}} {{are constructed}} in 'core form' or 'shell form'. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings {{are surrounded by}} the core, the transformer is shell form. Shell <b>form</b> <b>design</b> may be more prevalent than core <b>form</b> <b>design</b> for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils. Core <b>form</b> <b>design</b> tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell <b>form</b> <b>design</b> for high voltage power transformer applications {{at the lower end}} of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230 kV or 75 MVA). At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent. Shell <b>form</b> <b>design</b> tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage.|$|E

5000|$|Items in {{document}} notes represent user-entered or computed data. An item named [...] "Form" [...] in {{a document}} note {{can be used}} to bind a document to a <b>form</b> <b>design</b> note, which directs the IBM Notes client to merge the content of the document note items with the GUI information and code represented in the given <b>form</b> <b>design</b> note for display and editing purposes. However, other methods {{can be used to}} override this binding of a document to a form note. The resulting loose binding of documents to design information is one of the cornerstones of the power of IBM Notes. Traditional database developers used to working with rigidly enforced schemas, on the other hand, may consider the power of this feature to be a double-edged sword.|$|E
50|$|The GUI <b>form</b> <b>design</b> (see GUI toolkit) {{is widely}} adopted across the {{software}} industry {{and allows the}} programmer to specify a prescriptive description of the appearance of GUI widgets within a window.
