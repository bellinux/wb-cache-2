5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{surprised}} {{that men have}} been noticing her, instead of resenting or ignoring her as they usually do. Her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>off</b> as more confident since starting {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). Liz decides to use her new-found confidence to help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) with a problem he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Liz visits him in the editing room and hopes to convince him to get TGSs show's opener footage finished as soon as possible in which she is successful after flirting with Ritchie. Later, Liz learns that Ritchie is spreading a rumor that the two are sleeping together. She confronts Ritchie about it, he admits to starting the rumor {{in order to get the}} attention of his assistant editor Donna (Joanna Adler). Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie.|$|E
25|$|The Bangladeshi cricket team toured Sri Lanka {{for three}} One Day International cricket matches and two Test cricket matches in August and September 2005. The Bangladeshi team <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>off</b> a {{moderately}} successful tour of England, by their standards, as they pushed Australia close in one ODI and beat them in another. However, they still lost {{five out of}} six matches in the NatWest Series, and both of the Test matches, and remain {{at the bottom of}} both the ICC Test Championship and ICC ODI Championship. The hosts Sri Lanka, meanwhile, are undefeated in home ODI tournaments since February 2004, and in home Test series since March 2004, both against the top-ranked Australia. Their win in the Indian Oil Cup a month before this series saw them into second place in the ODI Championship, but they are only ranked sixth in Tests.|$|E

Anyhow, whether I go or not, you may be quite sure that I shall keep the matter to myself." ...|$|E

I expected to stay a week or so, but a battle <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>off</b> sooner than we imagined, so I'm away again to-morrow. As I'm not likely ever to come back, I {{just wanted to ask}} you to stand by poor Kate when I'm finished, and to say good-by to you, Belle, before I go."

[...] "Why, {{if you had}} asked anyone else I should have made a {{personal}} matter of it with him, and have given him the option of resigning the position or going out with me. But your other plans are foolish, and I shall take the matter into my own hands; I shall insist upon the two ladies coming down to the Park, and I will get my aunt to come and preside generally over things. I shall fill up the house with bridesmaids, and shall have a dance the evening before. You can put up at the hotel if you like, but {{you know very well}} that there are a dozen houses where they will be delighted to have you; {{there is no doubt that}} when they know what <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>off</b> you will get a dozen invitations, and then after church all those invited will drive off to the Park to the wedding breakfast. After that is over you can start in a post chaise to Canterbury or Dover, wherever you may decide to make your first halt." ...|$|E

What [...] he does now makes little difference to me, of course, as I had already [...] given warning, but I shall stick to him like a Briton in spite of it. [...] He has to-day made me a present, and a further five pounds for [...] yourself, expecting you to hold your tongue on every matter connected [...] with Mrs. P.'s friends, and to say nothing to any of them about this [...] marriage until it is over. His lordship impressed this upon me very [...] strong, and familiar as a brother, and of course we obey his [...] instructions to the letter; for I need hardly say that unless he keeps [...] his promise to help me in setting up the shop, our nuptials cannot be [...] consumed. His help depends upon our obedience, as you are aware. [...] .' ...|$|E

60|$|Seeing no escape, Scriggs fell on {{his knees}} before the Captain, and confessed the charge of the boy. Observing the fellow {{to be in an}} agony of fear {{at the sight of the}} boat-swain's mates and their lashes, and all the {{striking}} parade of public punishment, the Captain must have thought this a good opportunity for completely pumping him of all his secrets. This terrified marine was at length forced to reveal his having been for some time an accomplice in a complicated system of underhand villainy, the head of which was no less a personage than the indefatigable chief of police, the master-at-arms himself. It appeared that this official had his confidential agents ashore, who supplied him with spirits, and in various boxes, packages, and bundles--addressed to the Purser and others--brought them down to the frigate's boats at the landing. Ordinarily, the appearance of these things for the Purser and other ward-room gentlemen occasioned no surprise; for almost every day some bundle or other <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>off</b> for them, especially for the Purser; and, as the master-at-arms was always present on these occasions, it was an easy matter for him to hurry the smuggled liquor out of sight, and, under pretence of carrying the box or bundle down to the Purser's room, hide it away upon his own premises.|$|E
6000|$|Kind, just, serene, impartial, his fortitude {{not tried}} beyond easy endurance, his {{affections}} not much used, for his books were his family, and his society was in public; admirably wiser, wittier, calmer, and more instructed than almost every {{man with whom}} he met, how could Addison suffer, desire, admire, feel much? I may expect a child to admire me for being taller or writing more cleverly than she; but how can I ask my superior to say that I am a wonder when he knows better than I? In Addison’s days you could scarcely show him a literary performance, a sermon, or a poem, {{or a piece of}} literary criticism, but he felt he could do better. His justice must have made him indifferent. He didn’t praise, because he measured his compeers by a higher standard than common people have.(75) How was he who was so tall to look up to any but the loftiest genius? He must have stooped to put himself on a level with most men. By that profusion of graciousness and smiles, with which Goethe or Scott, for instance, greeted almost every literary beginner, every small literary adventurer who came to his court and went away charmed from the great king’s audience, and cuddling to his heart the compliment which his literary majesty had paid him—each of the two good-natured potentates of letters brought their star and ribbon into discredit. Everybody had his majesty’s orders. Everybody had his Majesty’s cheap portrait, on a box surrounded with diamonds worth twopence a-piece. A very great and just and wise man ought not to praise indiscriminately, but give his idea of the truth. Addison praises the ingenious Mr. Pinkethman: Addison praises the ingenious Mr. Doggett the actor, whose benefit <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>off</b> that night: Addison praises Don Saltero: Addison praises Milton with all his heart, bends his knee and frankly pays homage to that imperial genius.(76) But between those degrees of his men his praise is very scanty. I don’t think the great Mr. Addison liked young Mr. Pope, the Papist, much; I don’t think he abused him. But when Mr. Addison’s men abused Mr. Pope, I don’t think Addison took his pipe out of his mouth to contradict them.(77) ...|$|E
