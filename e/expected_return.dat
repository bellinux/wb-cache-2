5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the <b>expected</b> <b>return</b> on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted <b>expected</b> <b>return</b> on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and then on to the London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E

25|$|In finance, {{standard}} deviation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk {{is an important factor in}} determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the <b>expected</b> <b>return</b> on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the <b>expected</b> <b>return</b> and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.|$|E

However, the volatility in cattle feeding returns is extremely high.

25|$|In finance, {{a common}} problem is to choose a {{portfolio}} when there are two conflicting objectives — the desire to have the expected value of portfolio returns {{be as high as}} possible, and the desire to have risk, often measured by the standard deviation of portfolio returns, be as low as possible. This problem is often represented by a graph in which the efficient frontier shows the best combinations of risk and <b>expected</b> <b>return</b> that are available, and in which indifference curves show the investor's preferences for various risk-expected return combinations. The problem of optimizing a function of the expected value (first moment) and the standard deviation (square root of the second central moment) of portfolio return is called a two-moment decision model.|$|E

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate in the {{literature}} about the apparent weak or negative relation between risk (conditional variance) and <b>return</b> (<b>expected</b> <b>returns)</b> in the aggregate stock market.

We also explicitly model the e. ect of shocks to <b>expected</b> <b>returns</b> on ex post returns and use implied volatility from aded options to increase estimation e. ciency.

40|$|The {{focus of}} our paper is on the {{implications}} of model uncertainty for the crosssectional properties of returns.

In particular, the cross-sectional distribution of <b>expected</b> <b>returns</b> can be formally described by a two-factor model, where <b>expected</b> <b>returns</b> are derived as compensation for the asset’s marginal contribution to the equilibrium risk and uncertainty of the market portfolio. Thus, the standard result that <b>expected</b> <b>returns</b> are related only to systematic, and not diversifiable risk, carries over to economies with model uncertainty as well. Our two-factor pricing model also illustrates that model uncertainty in financial markets may be distinguished from risk, addressing some of the observational equivalence issues raised in the literature...|$|R

When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E
