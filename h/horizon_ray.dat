40|$|Rays {{propagating}} through strongly laterally varying media exhibit chaotic behaviour. This {{means that}} initially close rays diverge exponentially, rather than {{according to a}} power law. This chaotic behaviour is especially pronounced if the medium contains laterally varying interfaces. By studying simple 2 -D and 3 -D versions of models with laterally varying interfaces, the importance of chaotic ray behaviour is determined. A model of the Moho below Germany produces sharp variations with epicentral distance {{of the number of}} arrivals. In addition, the number of caustics grows dramatically: up to 1200 caustics are present between a distance of 0 and 800 km. Using the theory of Hamiltonian systems, a more in-depth study of the chaotic character of the ray equations is obtained. It is found that for realistic heterogeneous models most of the relevant rays will exhibit chaotic behaviour. The degree of chaos is quantified in terms of predictability horizons. Beyond the predictability <b>horizons</b> <b>ray</b> tracing cannot be carried out accurately. For the models under consideration, the length from the source to the predictability horizon has an order of magnitude of 1000 km. The chaotic behaviour of the rays makes it necessary to use extensions of asymptotic ray theory, such as Maslov theory, to compute seismic waveforms. It is shown that pseudo-caustics, an important obstacle in computing Maslov synthetics, are a generic feature of the 2 -D laterally varying models that are studied. Eventually, the use of asymptotic methods is restricted because of the inaccuracy in the computation of the ray paths. Key words: chaos, layered heterogeneous media, Lyapunov exponent, ray tracing, regional seismology. ...|$|R

40|$|Violating Lorentz invariance, and so implicitly {{permitting}} {{some form}} of super-luminal communication, necessarily alters {{the notion of a}} black hole. Nevertheless, in both Einstein-æther gravity and Hořava-Lifshitz gravity, there is still a causally disconnected region in black-hole solutions, now being bounded by a “universal horizon,” which traps excitations of arbitrarily high velocities. To better understand the nature of these black holes, and their universal <b>horizons,</b> we study <b>ray</b> trajectories in these spacetimes. We find evidence that Hawking radiation is associated with the universal horizon, while the “lingering” of ray trajectories near the Killing horizon hints at reprocessing there. In doing this we solve an apparent discrepancy between the surface gravity of the universal horizon and the associated temperature derived by the tunneling method. These results advance the understanding of these exotic horizons and provide hints for a full understanding of black-hole thermodynamics in Lorentz-violating theories...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{lack of a}} {{significant}} large scale anisotropy in the angular distribution of GRBs argues in favor of their cosmological origin. Assuming they are all standard candles, the observed number of bursts at a given flux directly relates {{to a number of}} sources at a given redshift. The maximum redshift sampled by BATSE under these assumptions is z max ¸ 2 (1). As a direct consequence absorption of the high energy gamma rays by diffuse background radiation becomes important at photon energies ? 30 GeV. In this work we calculate the expected burst rate as a function of photon energy accounting for cosmic absorption and compare the result with experimental limits. We will start with the computation of the gamma <b>ray</b> <b>horizon</b> which in a second step will be used to determine the number of bursts at a given detection threshold. Finally, we determine the experimental sensitivity required for the detection of all GRBs within the ga...|$|R

Any secondary-to-primary cosmic ray nucleus was predicted to be essentially flat above 10 GeV/u since 1997, as the data presently available confirm. The focus of this presentation is on two areas related to the quoted measure-ments: (1) the spatial distribution of primary cosmic rays does not differ from that of secondary nuclei; (2) the acceleration process of galactic cosmic rays is not localized in any particular class of celestial bodies but it is distributed almost uniformly in the disc volume as the distribution of the interaction points of heavy nuclei with the interstellar matter...|$|R

50|$|When light {{passes through}} Earth's atmosphere, photons {{interact}} with it through scattering. If the light does not {{interact with the}} atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see {{if you were to}} look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the <b>horizon,</b> the Sun's <b>rays</b> pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.|$|R

The scheme is robust and efficient {{in the presence of}} complex earth structures. To efficiently represent a 3 -D complex earth structure, a 3 -D tetrahedral model as well as an auxiliary Cartesian cubic grid is used. In each layer, the "sloth " (the square of the slowness) is required to vary continuously, and specifically, in each cell, the sloth gradient is constant. The layers are separated by smoothly varying horizons. The tetrahedral model representation is based on the triangulation of the smooth <b>horizons.</b> WF <b>ray</b> tracing is used in the scheme. In WF ray tracing, rays are traced step-wise in traveltime through the model and are maintained by a triangular net-work, (i) to form the wavefront at each traveltime step, (ii) to evaluate quantities, such as traveltimes and ray paths at the receivers, and (iii) to interpolate new rays, whenever certain criteria are met. The quantities, such as traveltimes and ray paths, evaluated on a Cartesian cubic grid, are useful for depth imaging. For our kinematic ray tracing, which gives correct traveltimes and ray paths, an efficient alternative for dealing with caustics is presented.

40|$|This thesis explores two avenues into {{understanding}} {{the physics of}} black holes and horizons beyond general relativity, via analogue models and Lorentz violating theories. Analogue spacetimes have wildly different dynamics to general relativity; this allows the possibility of non-Killing horizons in stationary solutions. In the case of non-Killing horizons different definitions of surface gravity are truly different quantities. This also has application to modified theories of gravity, {{where there is no}} reason to expect all horizons to be Killing horizons. In Lorentz violating theories, the situation becomes even stranger, as Killing horizons are at best low energy barriers, but for superluminal dispersion relations a true causal barrier, the universal horizon, may be present. We investigate the nature of these universal <b>horizons</b> via a <b>ray</b> tracing study, and delve into what happens near both the universal and Killing horizons. From this study we determine the surface gravity of universal horizons by the peeling properties of <b>rays</b> near the <b>horizon</b> and discuss whether, and at what temperature these horizons radiate. Finally, we combine our investigations of universal horizons and analogue spacetimes, and ask why we have not seen a universal horizon in studies of analogue gravity.

On the horizon the intensifying tone of the rapidly increasing light harmonised with the varying greens and yellows of the herbage. Here and there one or two uplands in the far distance caught the sheen of day and relieved the prospect with streaks of varied hue. Still nearer a few clumps of low shrubbery increased this diversity a little. In the middle-distance the varied colours and forms of the grasses became distinct enough to invest the scene with character, while in the immediate foreground additional force and interest were given to the landscape by the person of Quashy lying flat on his back, with his great eyes closed and his huge mouth open.|$|R
