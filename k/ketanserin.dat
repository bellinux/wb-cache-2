5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug <b>ketanserin.</b> Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © Walter de GruyterObjective: To compare {{maternal}} and perinatal outcome {{with the use}} of either intravenous <b>ketanserin</b> or dihydralazine in treatment of women with preeclampsia. Methods: The records from January 1989 to January 1997 of all patients receiving intravenous <b>ketanserin</b> or dihydralazine as first line antihypertensive therapy were reviewed and standardized data forms were completed. 315 charts of patients were identified and evaluated for effects on blood pressure, laboratory parameters, {{maternal and}} perinatal outcome. Results: During the study interval 169 patients received <b>ketanserin</b> and 146 dihydralazine. Significantly fewer antepartum (27 % versus 38 %, p = 0. 04) and postpartum (25 % versus 39 %, p = 0. 01) maternal complications were noted in patients receiving <b>ketanserin.</b> Occurrence of HELLP syndrome was significantly lower among patients who received <b>ketanserin</b> (20 %) than among those who received dihydralazine (40 %, p = 0. 0001). Side-effects were reported with significantly higher frequency in patients receiving dihydralazine (60 %) as compared to those receiving <b>ketanserin</b> (17 %, p < 0. 0001). Perinatal outcome was comparable, however, umbilical cord arterial pH values (mean ± SD) were higher with <b>ketanserin</b> compared to dihydralazine (7. 25 ± 0. 07 vs 7. 23 ± 0. 09, p = 0. 038).

40|$|Background As the {{etiology}} of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy remains unclear, treatment is directed at lowering blood pressure and preventing complications for mother and child. <b>Ketanserin,</b> a selective serononin 2 -receptor antagonist, is an antihypertensive agent used {{for the treatment of}} severe hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. There is evidence of transplacental transmission of <b>ketanserin.</b> The high concentration found in umbilical cord blood and long half-life time of <b>ketanserin</b> in infants, suggest pharmaceutical effects in infants. Research directed at the effect of <b>ketanserin</b> on the infant is lacking. By this study we aimed to analyze the effect of <b>ketanserin</b> exposure on the circulation of the infant. Methods From May, 2007, through December, 2009, we prospectively studied 57 infants admitted to the high care of our secondary hospital because of in utero exposure to <b>ketanserin.</b> We used 15 values of blood pressure and heart rate recorded during the first day of life. We analyzed the effect of gestational age, birth weight, gender, <b>ketanserin</b> aspects (cumulative dosage, duration of therapy, last dosage rate), maternal diagnosis and other maternal drug use on blood pressure of the infant and the occurrence of hypotension. Results A total of 12. 3 % of our study population became hypotensive during the first day of life with need for treatment. All of these infants had been in utero exposed to a last dosage rate of 8 mg/hour or higher. Maternal HELLP-syndrome was related to hypotension of the infant. Last dosage rate and mean dosage rate of <b>ketanserin</b> were negatively correlated with blood pressure and associated with hypotension. In hypotensive infants, blood pressure dysregulation started in the first eight hours after delivery. These infants did not show a natural rise in blood pressure during delivery. Discussion This research provides evidence for the blood pressure lowering effect of <b>ketanserin.</b> HELLP-syndrome is the main causal factor in developing hypotension besides last dosage rate of <b>ketanserin.</b> Our results show that monitoring of blood pressure after delivery is only necessary when an infant is exposed to a last dosage rate of at least 8 mg/hour or when a mother suffers from HELLP-syndrome and is treated with <b>ketanserin.</b> Monitoring can be shortened to 12 hours when no problems arise during the first half day of life. ...|$|E
