5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than swords, swords <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than axes, and axes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than lances. In magic, fire <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than wind, wind <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than thunder, and thunder <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than axes and bows, axes and bows <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|R

5|$|Starlings {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds. Their flight <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> and direct {{and they are}} very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country. They eat insects and fruit. Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> {{evidence}} of extensive declines in extant populations since the introductions of humans, {{particularly among the}} larger and more specialized lemurs. As long as habitats continue to shrink, degrade and fragment, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E
5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception.

Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

The game engine used in Langrisser III is a considerable departure {{from the rest of}} the series, relying on mass battles between a commander's entire platoon against his enemy's.|$|R

5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> enough to allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> enough to replace the other.

There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E

The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space.

5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E
