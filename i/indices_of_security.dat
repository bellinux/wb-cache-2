40|$|The author {{considers}} security a key {{value in}} present societies {{all around the}} world due to the general change in values {{since the end of the}} 20 th century, which is characterized by a certain return to more materialistic values and a reduction of personal and economic security under the globalization. The article provides two different but complementary theoretical frameworks for the sociological study <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> The first theoretical frame was developed in the late 1970 ’s as a reaction to the excessive optimism generated by the high levels and rates of economic development during the previous years. Within this conceptual frame the author groups 59 countries into seven geo-cultural world regions, and identifies the change in values not only as a reduction of post-materialist values, but also as an increase in desires for greater authority in the future, particularly in more developed societies. In the second theoretical scheme all forms of social organization (political, economic, family, educational, etc.) including value systems, are instruments of adaptation of human societies to their environment. Thus, the main hypothesis here is that values change because of the levels <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in society, both personal and economic security: as security levels rise or decline, values change. The author considers both theoretically and empirically four <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> - personal, community, national and total. According to the European surveys data, developed countries seem to feel subjectively more secure than less developed countries, but variation even among countries within the same world geo-cultural region is very wide. On the basis of three sets of variables used to explain the four <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> (socio-demographic, attitudinal, national defence and a combination of the previous three) the author shows that the combined set seems to be the most robust to explain all four <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> However, there is a great variation in the levels of the four types <b>of</b> <b>security</b> among the seven geo-cultural world regions, and among the countries within each region. This implies that the country continues to be the most important unit of analysis in international comparisons, which should take into account both subjective and objective measures <b>of</b> <b>security...</b>|$|R

It uses an aggregate index, based on security {{from the economic}} risks imposed by four key factors – unemployment, illness, old age, and single parenthood – to examine trends in {{economic security}} in both Nova Scotia and Canada from 1981 to 2007. It also examines provincial and national trends in four additional indicators (minimum wage levels, social assistance levels, child benefits, and {{the adequacy of the}} minimum wage in relation to the poverty line) of the adequacy of Nova Scotia’s social safety net. The basic conclusions: • Economic security in Nova Scotia decreased during the 1981 - 2007 period, as it did nationwide. In 2007, the overall <b>index</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>security</b> in Nova Scotia was 0. 581, a decline of 12. 9 per cent from its level of 0. 667 in 1981. Nationwide the economic security index declined from 0. 666 to 0. 555, a decline of 16. 7 per cent. • The increased economic risks associated with illness, due to sharp increases in direct private health care expenditures as a proportion of disposable income, were the main driving forces behind this development.

40|$|We report {{evidence}} that bank liquidity ratios (liquid assets {{as a percentage}} of total assets) decrease during the process of economic development. To reconcile this observation with (i) the increasing importance of financial markets and (ii) the increasing direct participation of individual investors in them, we build a neoclassical growth model with banks and markets. In this environment, banks engage in cross-subsidization of the impatient depositors {{to keep up with the}} competitive pressure from the markets. Moreover, as the economy grows, it becomes easier for the individuals to access the market, and the banks react to this by lowering their liquidity ratios. In a panel of 45 countries, we find {{evidence that}} such a mechanism is into place: a one-unit increase in an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> market liberalization leads to a drop in the bank liquidity ratio between 15 and 22 per cent. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} growth model with banks and markets to {{reconcile}} the observed decreasing trend in the relative liquidity of many financial systems {{around the world with}} the increasing household participation in direct market trades. At low levels of economic development, the presence of fixed entry costs prevents the agents from accessing the market, and pushes them towards the banks, which provide high relative liquidity. We characterize the threshold after which the agents are rich enough to access the market, where the relative liquidity is lower, and show that the relative liquidity of the whole financial system (banks and markets) drops because of the increasing market participation. We provide some evidence consistent with this theoretical prediction: a one-unit increase in an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> market liberalization leads to a drop in the relative liquidity of between 17 and 27 per cent...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{financial}} constraints of very small firms is scarce {{because it is}} difficult to observe and measure their transactions. Previous studies on small enterprises in post-communist countries have focused either on the effect of financing constraints on business growth (Budina et al., 2000, Economics of Transition 8 (2), 453 – 475; Bratkowski et al., 2000, Economics of Transition 8 (1), 101 – 116) or on the effect of property rights (Johnson et al., 2002, American Economic Review 92 (5), 1335 – 1357). This paper provides evidence on both. It turns out that financing constraints and property rights considerations affects investment in firms of different age differently. Younger firms face higher information costs and their expansion is more dependent on the availability of internal funds than is the expansion of older firms. This paper also finds that while the financial sector did not channel funds to the most successful businesses, there is evidence that loans were given to firms that had more transparent transactions. Results also indicate that the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> property rights does not influence investment in young firms, which is interpreted to mean that only the most efficient entrepreneurs entered the market. In older small firms, investment is negatively influenced by the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> property rights suggesting that these firms might have “secured” their property rights by bribes. Improvements in the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> property rights, therefore, would help more micro enterprises to be born as well as decrease transaction cost of established enterprises.
