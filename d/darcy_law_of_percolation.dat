40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{predicting}} saturation-dependent electrical conductivity σ in packings of spheres during drainage and imbibition. The effective-medium approximation (EMA) and the universal power <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> for σ are used, respectively, at higher and low water saturations to predict the conductivity, with the crossover between the two occurring at some intermediate saturation Swx. The main input to the theory is a single parameter that we estimate using the capillary pressure data. The predictions are compared with experimental, as well as numerical data for three distinct types of packings. The results for drainage in all the packings indicate that the universal power <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> is valid over the entire range of Sw.

40|$|First, I {{present a}} brief and compact {{overview}} {{of the theory of}} flow along GC packed columns using: the <b>Darcy’s</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> flow through porous media, the continuity equation for the carrier gas (assuming stationary flow), and the continuity equation for the trace gas of interest with a diffusion term and a source/sink term due to the transfer of trace gas molecules between the mobile and the stationary phases (it is assumed that this transfer obeys a linear partition isotherm). Using these equations, the pressure profile, the compressibility factor, the relation between the retardation factor and the distribution constant, and the relation between plate height and diffusivity are easily obtained. Second, I present a study (new in the scientific literature) of the behaviour of two packed columns (precolumn and maincolumn) GC systems after a sample injection and the subsequent applied carrier gas pressure ramp.

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} {{liquid water}} distribution in cement mortar mixtures during water absorption was determined using a proton {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} imaging (NMRI) technique. The variation of the material water diffusion coefficient with the water content was established {{on the basis of}} these results. Eight different mortar mixtures were prepared and tested. Test variables included water/binder ratio (0. 60, 0. 40 and 0. 25), type of cement (an ASTM Type 1 cement and a commercial white cement) and the use of silica fume. In addition, the effect of drying treatments on the water transport properties was also investigated. The absorption of water in dry mortars is found to be well described by a non-linear diffusion equation based on the extended <b>Darcy's</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> continuum mechanics.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} flow, through a model {{two-dimensional}} porous medium, of Newtonian fluids, power-law fluids, and viscoplastic fluids in the laminar regime and with moderate or dominant {{effects of the}} yielding term. A numerical technique able to take properly into account yielding effects in viscoplastic flows without any regularization is {{used to determine the}} detailed flow characteristics. We show that as soon as the distance between the disks forming the porous medium is sufficiently small, the velocity field and in particular the distribution function of the velocity of these different fluids {{in a wide range of}} flow regimes are similar. Moreover, the volume fraction of fluid at rest is negligible even at low flow rate. Thus the non-Newtonian character of a fluid flowing through such a complex geometry tends to be broken. We suggest that this is due to the fact that in a flow through a channel of rapidly varying cross section, the deformation, and thus the flow field, is imposed on the fluid, a situation that is encountered almost everywhere in a porous medium. These results make it possible to deduce a general expression for <b>Darcy's</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> these fluid types and estimate the parameters appearing in this expression...|$|R

And for the salinized soil, water, heat, and salt interact in the freezing process, because salinized soil has soluble salt. In this paper, a one-dimensional mathematical coupled model of hydraulic-thermal-salt is established. In the model, <b>Darcy’s</b> <b>law,</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> conservation <b>of</b> energy, and <b>law</b> <b>of</b> conservation of mass are applied to derive the equations. Consider that a saturated salinized soil column is subjected to the condition of freezing to model the moisture migration and salt transport.

The result indicates that simulation matches well with the experiment data, and after 96 hours, the temperature distribution becomes stable, freezing front reaches a stable position, and a lot of unfrozen water has time to migrate. Besides, the excess salt precipitates when the concentration is greater than the solubility, and the precipitation is distributed discontinuously.
