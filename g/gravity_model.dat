25|$|The energy {{problem has}} also been {{considered}} {{in relation to the}} idea of mass accretion in connection with the Expanding Earth theory. Among the early theorists to link mass increase in some sort of push <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> to Earth expansion were Yarkovsky and Hilgenberg. The idea of mass accretion and the expanding earth theory are not currently considered to be viable by mainstream scientists. This is because, among other reasons, according to the principle of mass-energy equivalence, if the Earth was absorbing the energy of the ultramundane flux at the rate necessary to produce the observed force of gravity (i.e. by using the values calculated by Poincaré), its mass would be doubling in each fraction of a second.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{formalism}} {{to calculate the}} non-linear matter power spectrum in modified <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> that explain the late-time acceleration of the Universe without dark energy. Any successful modified <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> should contain a mechanism to recover General Relativity (GR) on small scales {{in order to avoid}} the stringent constrains on deviations from GR at solar system scales. Based on our formalism, the quasi non-linear power spectrum in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porratti (DGP) braneworld models and $f(R) $ <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> are derived by taking into account the mechanism to recover GR properly. We also extrapolate our predictions to fully non-linear scales using the Parametrized Post Friedmann (PPF) framework. In $f(R) $ <b>gravity</b> <b>models,</b> the predicted non-linear power spectrum is shown to reproduce N-body results. We find that the mechanism to recover GR suppresses the difference between the modified <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> and dark energy models with the same expansion history, but the difference remains large at weakly non-linear regime in these models. Our formalism is applicable to a wide variety of modified <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> and it is ready to use once consistent <b>models</b> for modified <b>gravity</b> are developed.

40|$|Continuous {{tracking}} of geodetic satellites using the Satellite Laser Ranging technique has provided unprecedented opportunity in long- to medium-wavelength <b>gravity</b> field <b>modelling.</b> Numerous <b>gravity</b> field <b>models</b> have been derived from such observations {{and have been}} made freely available to the science community for research purpose. The accuracy {{of most of the}} latest <b>gravity</b> field <b>models</b> in terms of precise orbit determination is currently at cm level. Improvement in the Earth <b>gravity</b> field <b>modelling</b> is anticipated as quantitative and qualitative data (in particular from low earth orbit satellites) become available in the future. Such expectations require that the accuracy and precision of existing <b>gravity</b> field <b>models</b> be assessed. The validation of <b>gravity</b> field <b>models</b> in terms of satellite orbit determination is often based on the difference between the observed and computed range.

In this contribution we investigate the general improvement in <b>gravity</b> field <b>modelling</b> over a period of 15 years.

50|$|Elhanan Helpman and Paul Krugman {{asserted}} that the theory behind comparative advantage does not predict the relationships in the <b>gravity</b> <b>model.</b> Using the <b>gravity</b> <b>model,</b> countries with similar levels of income {{have been shown to}} trade more. Helpman and Krugman see this as evidence that these countries are trading in differentiated goods because of their similarities. This casts some doubt about the impact Heckscher-Ohlin has on the real world. Jeffrey Frankel sees the Helpman-Krugman setup here as distinct from Linder’s proposal. However, he does say Helpman-Krugman is different from the usual interpretation of Linder, but, since Linder made no clear model, the association between the two should not be completely discounted. Alan Deardorff adds the possibility, that, while not immediately apparent, the basic <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> can be derived from Heckscher-Ohlin as well as the Linder and Helpman-Krugman hypotheses. Deardorff concludes that, considering how many models can be tied to the <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> equation, it is not useful for evaluating the empirical validity of theories.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the deceleration, jerk and snap parameters {{to distinguish between}} the dark energy and modified <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> by using high redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae (SNe). We first derive the expressions of deceleration, jerk and snap parameters in dark energy and modified <b>gravity</b> <b>models.</b> In order to constrain the cosmographic parameters, we calibrate the GRB luminosity relations without assuming any cosmological models using SNe Ia. Then we constrain the models (including dark energy and modified <b>gravity</b> <b>models)</b> parameters using type Ia supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. Finally we calculate the cosmographic parameters. GRBs can extend the redshift - distance relation up to high redshifts, because they can be detected to high redshifts. We find that the statefinder pair (r,s) could not be used to distinguish between some dark energy and modified <b>gravity</b> <b>models,</b> but these models could be differentiated by the snap parameter. Using the model-independent constraints on cosmographic parameters, we conclude that the model is consistent with the current data.
