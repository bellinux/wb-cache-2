With this configuration the armature is through-bolted through the door and oriented to mate with the face of the electromagnet. The armature plate and electromagnet must touch in order to provide locking holding force.|$|R

50|$|A storey pole (or story pole, storey rod, story stick, jury stick, scantling, scantillon) is {{a length}} of narrow board usually cut to the height of one storey. It {{is used as a}} layout tool for any kind of {{repeated}} work in carpentry including stair-building, framing, timber framing, siding, brickwork, and setting tiles. The pole is marked for the heights from (usually) the floor platform of a building for dimensions such as window sill heights, window top heights (or <b>headers),</b> exterior <b>door</b> heights (or <b>headers),</b> interior <b>door</b> heights, wall gas jet heights (for gas lamps) and the level of the next storey joists. It makes for quick, repeatable measurements without the need of otherwise calibrated measuring devices or workers skilled in using them.|$|R
