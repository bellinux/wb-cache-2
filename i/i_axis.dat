Two samples of patients seeking treatment for TMD (clinic cases, N[*]=[*] 1, 312) and a sample of general population subjects (community cases, N[*]=[*] 211) underwent a thorough assessment in accordance with the RDC/TMD version 1. 0 [1] guidelines to receive both <b>axis</b> <b>I</b> and <b>axis</b> II diagnoses. Spearman’s test was performed to assess the level of correlation between <b>axis</b> <b>I</b> diagnoses and Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) pain-related disability. A stepwise multiple logistic regression model was used to identify the significant associations between 12 clinical and psychosocial predictors and the presence of high pain-related disability. <b>Axis</b> <b>I</b> findings were related with pain-related impairment (GCPS scores) in the overall study sample including both clinic community cases (Spearman correlation[*]=[*] 0. 129, p[*]=[*] 0. 000), but the results of the correlation analyses performed on the clinic sample alone were not significant (Spearman correlation[*]=[*]− 0. 018, p[*]=[*] 0. 618).

Identification of such molecular defects is very recent and dependent on new findings on the physiology of GHRH-GH-IGF-I axis: for example the pituitary-specific transcription factors and their mutations have only been described {{in the last few}} years. The epidemiological importance of the identified molecular defect depends on the level of the axis involved, but the prevalence of some of these genetic defects is probably underestimated.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. As {{the primary}} link between {{environmental}} change and physiological response, the neuroendocrine {{system is a}} critical part of osmoregulatory adaptations. Cortisol has been viewed as ‘the ’ seawater-adapting hormone in fish and prolactin as ‘the ’ fresh water adapting hormone. Recent evidence indicates that the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor <b>I</b> <b>axis</b> is also important in seawater adaptation in several teleosts of widely differing evolutionary lineages. In salmonids, growth hormone acts in synergy with cortisol to increase seawater tolerance, at least partly through the upregulation of gill cortisol receptors. Cortisol under some conditions may promote ion uptake and interacts with prolactin during acclimation to fresh water. The osmoregulatory actions of growth hormone and prolactin are antagonistic. In some species, thyroid hormones support the action of growth hormone and cortisol in promoting seawater acclimation. Although a broad generalization that holds for all teleosts is unlikely, our current understanding indicates that growth hormone promotes acclimation to seawater, prolactin promotes acclimation to fresh water, and cortisol interacts with both of these hormone...|$|E

40|$|Strain {{can be used}} as an {{effective}} tool to tune the crystal structure of materials and hence to modify their electronic structures, including topological properties. Here, taking Na 3 Bi as a paradigmatic example, we demonstrated with first-principles calculations and k·p models that the topological phase transitions can be induced by various types of strains. For instance, the Dirac semimetal phase of ambient Na 3 Bi can be tuned into a topological insulator (TI) phase by uniaxial strain along the h 100 <b>i</b> <b>axis.</b> Hydrostatic pressure can let the ambient structure transfer into a new thermodynamically stable phase with Fm- 3 m symmetry, coming with a perfect parabolic semimetal having a single contact point between the conduction and valence bands, exactly at Γ point on the Fermi level like α-Sn. Furthermore, uniaxial strain in the direction can tune the new parabolic semimetal phase into a Dirac semimetal, while shear strains in both the and directions can take the new parabolic semimetal phase into a TI. k·p models are constructed to gain more insights into these quantum topological phase transitions.

40|$|Renal {{proximal}} tubules play a {{vital role}} in phosphorus (P) homeostasis. It is well known that dietary P restriction up-regulates the activities of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 - 1 α-hydroxylase (1 -OHase), an enzyme that is involved in activation of vitamin D and thereby maintaining P balance. However, the mechanism involved in such regulation is not known. In the present study, we aim to identify proteins that might be involved in the renal adaptation to dietary P restriction using a proteomic approach. Renal proximal tubules were harvested from young rats fed either normal P diet or low P diet (LPD) for 1 to 7 days. Western blotting analysis of 1 -OHase and signaling proteins in insulin-like growth factor <b>I</b> <b>axis</b> indicated an increase in expression of these proteins upon dietary P restriction.

Maybe due to the research sample no evidence was found for an association of autonomy-connectedness with externalizing psychopathology.

40|$|In the {{transient}} receptor potential (trp) mutant of Drosophila, the receptor potential appears almost {{normal in}} response to a flash but quickly decays to baseline during prolonged illumination. Photometric and early receptor potential measurements of the pigment suggest that the pigment is normal and that the decay of the trp response during illumination does not arise from a reduction in the available photopigment molecules. However, there is reduction in pigment concentration with age. Light adaptation cannot account for the decay of the trp response during illumination: in normal Drosophila a dim background light shortens the latency and rise time of the response and also shifts the intensity response function (V-log I curve) to higher levels of light intensity with relatively little reduction in the maximal amplitude (Vmax) of response. In the trp mutant, a dim background light or short, strong adapting light paradoxically lengthens the latency and rise time of the response and substantially reduces Vmax without a pronounced shift of the V-log I curve along the <b>I</b> <b>axis.</b> The effect of adapting light on the latency and V-log I curve seen in trp are associated with a reduction in effective stimulus intensity (reduction in excitation efficiency) rather than with light adaptation.

In particular, SHG emission components along the <b>i</b> <b>axis</b> (I_ 2 ω,i) (i[*]=[*]x,y,z), the induced SHG emission deviation angle γij, and the detected SHG signals (I 2 ω,ij) in the ij plane by rotating the applied polarizer angle φij have been investigated (i[*]=[*]x, x, y; j[*]=[*]y, z, z). Results show that under our simulation model, SHG emission in the xy plane, such as I 2 ω,x,I 2 ω,y,γxy and I 2 ω,xy varying as polarization angle (α) under collimated and focused light, presents no significant difference. The reverse of the fibril polarity has induced great impact on I 2 ω,x,γxy and I 2 ω,xy in both collimated and focused light. I 2 ω,x and γxy show similarity, but I 2 ω,xy at α = 30 ° demonstrates a slight difference in focused light to that in collimated light. Under focused light, the reverse of fibril polarity causes obvious changes of the collected SHG intensity I 2 ω,xz and I 2 ω,yz at a special polarization angle α = 60 ° and γxz, γyz along α...|$|E
40|$|Growth hormone (GH) {{is known}} to {{regulate}} peripheral components of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis, but it remains unclear whether GH exerts a significant influence on {{the activity of the}} hypothalamo-pituitary components of the HPG axis. In this study, we investigated the development of HPG axis function in the male transgenic growth retarded (Tgr) rat, a model of moderate systemic GH deficiency caused by hypothalamic expression of human (h) GH. Impaired postnatal somatotroph expansion and moderate GH deficiency in male Tgr rats were accompanied by a two- to three-fold increase in pituitary gonadotrophin content, but without a significant change in the pituitary gonadotroph population. A three- to nine-fold elevation in basal circulating luteinising hormone concentration was seen in postpubertal Tgr rats, with a smaller increase in follicle-stimulating hormone. Despite this hypergonadotrophism, there was no corresponding increase in steroidogenic (circulating testosterone and seminal vesicle weights) or gametogenic (spermatozoa counts in seminiferous tubules) activity in the postpubertal Tgr testis. Following puberty, the plasma leptin concentration also became progressively elevated in Tgr males. Circulating gonadotrophin and leptin levels were normalised in Tgr rats by peripheral physiological replacement of rat GH, but plasma testosterone concentration was unaffected. These results confirm that hGH exerts a positive influence on the central control of gonadotrophin secretion in the Tgr rat, but the absence of a corresponding elevation in the steroidogenic or gametogenic function of the Tgr testis implies that the peripheral GH/insulin-like growth factor <b>I</b> <b>axis</b> may also exert a permissive influence on testicular function. The relative contribution of somatogenic and lactogenic mechanisms and the potential influence of elevated leptin and decreased sensitivity to androgen feedback to the development of postpubertal hypergonadotrophism in Tgr males remain to be determined.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{comorbidity}} of personality disorders (PDs) and <b>Axis</b> <b>I</b> disorders and discusses implications for assessment and treatment. Pros {{and cons of}} various assessment methods are discussed. The co-occurrence of PDs with <b>Axis</b> <b>I</b> disorders is considerable; roughly half of patients with anxiety disorders, depressive disorders or eating disorders received a PD diagnosis. Comorbidity models are discussed and implications for assessment and treatment are provided. Regarding the impact of PDs on cognitive-behavioral treatment outcome for <b>Axis</b> <b>I</b> disorders, conflicting results are found {{due to differences in}} assessment methods, treatment strategies, and patient samples. It is argued that additional <b>Axis</b> <b>I</b> pathology should be taken into account when studying the impact of PDs on treatment outcome for the target <b>Axis</b> <b>I</b> disorders. Finally, it is argued that the interpersonal behavior of the PD patient and the therapeutic relationship deserve more attention in the assessment and treatment of patients with PDs.
