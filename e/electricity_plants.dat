5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} to the ships by five <b>electricity</b> <b>plants.</b> Each plant consisted of four diesel generators and eight turbo-generators. The four diesel generators {{were divided into}} pairs: two provided 150kilowatts each and two supplied 300kW each. The eight turbo-generators were also of mixed capacity; six ran supplied 460kW each and the remaining two provided 230kW each. Total power output was 4,120kW at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to achieve further growth, Enron pursued a {{diversification}} strategy. The company owned and operated a variety of assets including gas pipelines, <b>electricity</b> <b>plants,</b> pulp and paper plants, water plants, and broadband services across the globe.

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single rudder. Admiral Hipper and Blücher were equipped with three <b>electricity</b> <b>plants</b> with four diesel generators and six turbo-generators each; the diesel generators supplied 150kW apiece, {{four of the six}} turbo-generators provided 460kW, and the final pair provided 230kW. Total electrical output was 2900kW. Prinz Eugen, Seydlitz, and Lützow were equipped with three 150kW diesel generators, four 460kW turbo-generators, one 230kW turbo-generator, and one 150kW AC generator, for a total of 2870kW.

25|$|Following World War II, {{oil heating}} boilers took over from coal burners along the Eastern Seaboard; diesel {{locomotives}} took over from coal-fired steam engines under dieselisation; oil-fired <b>electricity</b> <b>plants</b> were built; petroleum-burning buses replaced electric streetcars in a GM driven conspiracy, {{for which they}} were found guilty, and citizens bought gasoline powered cars. Interstate Highways helped make cars the major means of personal transportation. As oil imports increased, US foreign policy was inexorably drawn into Middle East politics, supporting oil-producing Saudi Arabia and patrolling the sea lanes of the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|Mismanagement and {{corruption}} resulted in major economic problems. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the economy was deteriorating because of a combination of overspending on a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the regime, overspending to purchase privately owned sugar mills and <b>electricity</b> <b>plants,</b> and a decision to make a major investment in state sugar production that proved economically unsuccessful. In 1956, Trujillo's agents in New York murdered Jesús María de Galíndez, a Basque exile who had worked for Trujillo but who later denounced the Trujillo regime and caused public opinion in the United States to turn against Trujillo. In August 1960, the Organization of American States (OAS) imposed diplomatic sanctions against the Dominican Republic as a result of Trujillo's complicity in an attempt to assassinate President Rómulo Betancourt of Venezuela.|$|E
