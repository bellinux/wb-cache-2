5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the <b>grantor</b> and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E
25|$|In England {{the statute}} Quia Emptores, passed in 1290, made subinfeudation impossible, {{as the new}} holder simply effaces the <b>grantor,</b> holding by the same title as the <b>grantor</b> himself.|$|E
25|$|Publicly traded <b>grantor</b> trusts, such as Merrill Lynch's HOLDRs securities, are {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} ETFs, although they lack many {{of the characteristics of}} other ETFs. Investors in a <b>grantor</b> trust have a direct interest in the underlying basket of securities, which does not change except to reflect corporate actions such as stock splits and mergers. Funds of this type are not investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940.|$|E

25|$|An {{exchange-traded}} <b>grantor</b> trust {{was used}} to give a direct interest in a static basket of stocks selected from a particular industry. Such products have some properties in common with ETFs—low costs, low turnover, and tax efficiency:but are generally regarded as separate from ETFs. The leading example was Holding Company Depositary Receipts, or HOLDRs, a proprietary Merrill Lynch product, but these have now disappeared from the scene. SPDR Gold Shares is a <b>grantor</b> trust.|$|E
25|$|Dynasty trust (also {{known as}} a generation-skipping trust): A type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantor's grand{{children}}, not the grantor's children. The children of the <b>grantor</b> never take title to the assets. This allows the <b>grantor</b> to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred {{to his or her}} children first. Generation-skipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantor's children, however, because any income generated by the trust's assets can be made accessible to the grantor's children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren.|$|E
25|$|In the {{recording}} system, {{each time a}} land title transaction takes place, the parties record the transfer instrument with a local government recorder located in the jurisdiction (usually the county) where the land lies. The government indexes the instrument by {{the names of the}} <b>grantor</b> (transferor) and the grantee (transferee) and photographs it so any member of the public can find and examine it. If such a transaction goes unrecorded for any reason or length of time, an unscrupulous <b>grantor</b> could sell the property to another grantee. In many states, the grantee whose transaction is recorded first becomes the legal owner, and any other would-be buyers are left without recourse..|$|E

5000|$|During the <b>grantor's</b> lifetime, he pays {{income taxes}} any {{increase}} in value of the assets in the trust. The trust grows, but its [...] "value" [...] for estate tax purposes is [...] "frozen" [...] {{at the time of}} the transfer. If the trust grows substantially, the increase is not subject to estate tax (which is usually at a higher rate than the <b>grantor's</b> marginal income tax rate).|$|R
25|$|Implied trust: An implied trust, as {{distinct}} from an express trust, is created {{where some of the}} legal requirements for an express trust are not met, but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist. A resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for. In such a case, the law may raise a resulting trust {{for the benefit of the}} <b>grantor</b> (the creator of the trust). In other words, the <b>grantor</b> may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} that followed, Penn State grew significantly, {{becoming}} the state's largest <b>grantor</b> of baccalaureate degrees and reaching an enrollment of 5,000 in 1936. Around that time, a system of commonwealth campuses was started by President Ralph Dorn Hetzel to provide an alternative for Depression-era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.|$|E
25|$|For {{a living}} trust, the <b>grantor</b> may retain {{some level of}} control to the trust, such by {{appointment}} as protector under the trust instrument. Living trusts also, in practical terms, tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations. If a living trust fails, the property will usually be held for the grantor/settlor on resulting trusts, which in some notable cases, has had catastrophic tax consequences.|$|E

25|$|Cases {{became so}} {{complicated}} that a special assize, the Assize of Utrum {{was established in}} the middle of the 12th century. Jurisdiction would normally lie in the Ecclesiastic Courts. The Assize of Utrum, especially as defined in the Constitutions of Clarendon, 1164, gave the Crown a chance to clarify difficult questions of ownership and duty in a non-religious, secular court. Often, ownership was of less importance than in determining who had rights to grain, knight service, marriage penalties and the like. These duties were defined in the manner in which the land had been granted, and by whom in the feudal chain. Frequently land would be donated to a church organization and re-let to the <b>grantor</b> to avoid feudal services to the great lord.|$|E
25|$|Pass-through {{securities}} {{are issued}} by a trust and allocate the cash {{flows from the}} underlying pool to the securities holders on a pro rata basis. A trust that issues pass-through certificates is taxed under the <b>grantor</b> trust rules of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these rules, the holder of a pass-through certificate is taxed as a direct owner of {{the portion of the}} trust allocatable to the certificate. In order for the issuer to be recognized as a trust for tax purposes, there can be no significant power under the trust agreement to change the composition of the asset pool or otherwise to reinvest payments received, and the trust must have, with limited exceptions, only a single class of ownership interests.|$|E
25|$|About {{the same}} time he adopted Universalism, which he viewed as a logical {{consequence}} of the universal efficacy of the death of Christ. He settled in London as a preacher at Coachmakers' Hall, Addle Street, Wood Street. In 1764 a chancery action was brought against him by a Yorkshire lady, who had given him a sum of money and executed a deed securing to him an annuity of £5. It was alleged that Relly had fraudulently obtained these benefits while the <b>grantor</b> {{was in a state of}} religious frenzy. Under an order of the court the deed was cancelled and the money refunded. Shortly afterwards Relly removed to a meeting-house in Bartholomew Close (formerly presbyterian), which had just been vacated by Wesley. Here he remained till midsummer 1769, when the lease expired. He then secured (October 1769) a meeting-house in Crosby Square (formerly presbyterian), where he continued to preach till his death, but his cause did not thrive, and he had no immediate successor in this country.|$|E

This is called the grantor-grantee index. Also included are the dates the instruments are recorded. Many, if not most, such systems keep separate indexes for deeds and mortgages. There are also systems for indexing judgment liens in which the judgment debtor and the judgment creditor are listed {{in the same way as}} <b>grantors</b> and grantees, respectively.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} that occurs between <b>grantors</b> and grantees in the grant-making process may be complicated by numerous factors, {{among them a}} reluctance by independent foundation <b>grantors</b> to communicate with their potential grantees. Yet a willingness to communicate—to engage in building dialogue as suggested by Kent and Taylor (2002) —and provision of transparent information to grantees could alleviate some frustrations inherent in the grant making process for both <b>grantors</b> and grantees. This study investigates {{the extent to which}} independent foundation <b>grantors</b> are willing to engage in dialogue with potential grantees as indicated through transparent web site features. Through analysis of 106 independent foundation web sites, the study examined features that correspond with the five elements of dialogic communication proposed by Kent and Taylor (2002). Each of these features, in turn, was examined for level of transparency, for example, was the information clear, easy to find, and located on the homepage or further into the site. In general, independent foundations with web sites had a greater than 50 % propensity for dialogue (52. 6 %). Results indicate that independent foundation web sites contain many of the design features and information that can help build more effective and efficient grantor-grantee relationships through propensity for dialogue...|$|R
