The Provicaire is of opinion that the missionaries were attacked by orders of the ex-Dalai Lama, as the nearest Europeans on whom he could avenge his disgrace. He {{is good enough to}} say that he will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> further information which he may receive.|$|E

500|$|... {{came off}} as {{peculiar}} [...] Not a typical relationship. A lot of macho men {{see the movie}} and like Guy's character, because he doesn't <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> special treatment. I think we come off as a couple that has that has a genuine and deep connection. He is always there for me, but he's not impressed. I feel like we are sort of The Honeymooners, only I'm the Jackie Gleason character. Obviously, he irritates me on a significant basis, as everyone's significant other does.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' {{replied the}} dog; 'though I have served you long, you never <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> bread. He has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> {{as much as}} I want. Let him go in peace.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The one you {{struck in}} British Columbia? You have {{mentioned}} him, but, {{so far as}} I remember, you never <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> particulars about the thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is sagely counselled, most {{equitable}} sir," [...] replied Nigel, [...] "and such restraint {{would be}} a fit meed for her folly that <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> power over her." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Nothing will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> peace. I've lost a son. And I'll go to {{my grave}} without any peace over that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Officially, {{the county}} said {{the change was}} made to [...] "improve the {{identity}} and to better integrate the Orbital campus." [...] But supervisors were less formal when discussing the issue, which had originally been on a consent agenda. Several cast their votes with catchphrases from [...] [...] "To Orbital, live long and prosper," [...] said Steven Miller, who lived in Dulles. [...] "Can you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> speed, Scotty?", incorrectly using a Scottish accent as he did so.|$|E
2500|$|I think General Lyon acted very unwisely in not {{accepting}} Governor Jackson’s proposals, and Mr. Lincoln may {{send him}} orders to accept them. [...] Governor Jackson in his proclamation makes a merit of having proposed them; now if I agree to send Confederate troops into Missouri at your request, can you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> guarantee that Mr. Lincoln may not propose and Governor Jackson assent {{to the agreement}} rejected by General Lyon, and compel those troops to retire before their joint forces? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And it {{does not}} seem to me," [...] said Olive, [...] "that you have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> {{definite}} counsel, and I know that is what you came here to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grizel," [...] he declared, [...] "I {{have tried}} hard to like him. I have thought and thought about it, and I can't see that he has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> just cause to dislike him." ...|$|R
60|$|About {{the middle}} of January I left Milan and came to Genoa, from thence by sea to Leghorn, then to Naples, Rome, and Venice, but saw nothing in Italy that <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> diversion.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next day}} the constabulary began raiding other central Taranaki Māori {{settlements}} in search of arms, and within days the raids, accompanied by destruction and looting, had spread to Waitara. On 11 November, 26 Whanganui Māori were arrested and Bryce, frustrated {{in his attempt to}} identify those from outside central Taranaki, telegraphed Hall to advise he intended destroying every whare in the village. He told Hall: [...] "Consider, here are 2000 people sitting still, absolutely declining to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> indication of where they belong to; they will sit still where they are and do nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was largely}} raised by her {{maternal}} aunt Effie Pattillo, {{who moved to}} Karnack after her sister's death. Lady Bird also visited her Pattillo relatives in Autauga County, Alabama, every summer until {{she was a young}} woman. As she explained, [...] "Until I was about 20, summertime always meant Alabama to me. With Aunt Effie we would board the train in Marshall and ride to the part of the world that meant watermelon cuttings, picnics at the creek, and a lot of company every Sunday." [...] According to Lady Bird, her Aunt Effie [...] "opened my spirit to beauty, but she neglected to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> insight into the practical matters a girl should know about, such as how to dress or choose one's friends or learning to dance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brando and Simmons were paired {{together}} {{again in the}} film adaptation of the musical Guys and Dolls (1955). Guys and Dolls would be Brando's first and last musical role. Time found the picture [...] "false to the original in its feeling", remarking that Brando [...] "sings in a faraway tenor that sometimes tends to be flat." [...] Appearing in Edward Murrow's Person to Person interview in early 1955, he admitted to having problems with his singing voice, which he called [...] "pretty terrible." [...] In the 1965 documentary [...] "Meet Marlon Brando", he revealed that the final product heard in the movie {{was a result of}} countless singing takes being cut into one and later joked, [...] "I couldn't hit a note with a baseball bat; some notes I missed by extraordinary margins... They sewed my words together on one song so tightly that when I mouthed {{it in front of the}} camera, I nearly asphyxiated myself". Relations between Brando and costar Frank Sinatra were also frosty, with Stefan Kanfer observing, [...] "The two men were diametrical opposites: Marlon required multiple takes; Frank detested repeating himself." [...] Upon their first meeting Sinatra reportedly scoffed, [...] "Don't <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> of that Actors Studio shit." [...] Brando later famously quipped, [...] "Frank is the kind of guy, when he dies, he's going to heaven and give God a hard time for making him bald." [...] Frank Sinatra famously called Brando [...] "the world's most overrated actor", and referred to him as [...] "mumbles". The film was commercially though not critically successful, costing $5.5million to make and grossing $13million.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{very glad}} {{you have come}} to-day," [...] said Jones, with much gravity. [...] "He never <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> of that when I'm alone with him; and he never, by any means, brings it out for company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's quiet here," [...] he said; [...] "you mustn't {{come down}} {{if you find}} it dull. But it's a {{pleasure}} to see you. My little sweet is the only face which <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> pleasure, except yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps because I like Hugh," [...] Lady Conyers went on quietly, [...] "perhaps, too, because I am {{not sure}} that you have done wisely. You haven't <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> reason yet, have you, for {{breaking}} your engagement?" ...|$|R
60|$|DAWKER. He mustn't <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> of his sauce; I've had enough.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Casby, could you, for the {{satisfaction}} of the friends I have mentioned, and under any obligation of secrecy that you may consider it your duty to impose, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> information at all touching Miss Wade? I have seen her abroad, and I have seen her at home, but I know nothing of her. Could you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> account of her whatever?' ...|$|E
60|$|Mem. My {{charge is}} 2 boxes free. Not the choicest--sell the choicest, and <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> 6-seat boxes you please.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head gravely. [...] "My {{possessions}} have never <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> happiness," [...] he remarked. [...] "I would much rather be in a humble rank of life. Live where I like, and--and marry whom I like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you expect}} me to remain all my life an ignorant child. You've never <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> freedom. You've hemmed me in with every imaginable barrier. You've put me on a leading-string, and thanked God that I did not stray." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl, with her unsparing honesty, [...] "if you had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> hint, I {{would not have}} told for the world. Of course I did not think--a girl wouldn't--of the effect it {{would have on the}} property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{motives are}} beside the question," [...] Rochester answered. [...] "Do I {{understand}} that you decline to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> account of yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Brooke became {{suddenly}} intent, and Devine {{noticed the}} little gleam {{in his eyes}} as he said, [...] "If you can <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> particulars----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Jules, can you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> advice {{whatever}} {{as to how}} to {{set about}} my scheme of getting them both out of prison?" ...|$|E
60|$|What was {{the secret}} {{that had kept}} it so long vacant, I inquired. Mrs Bowater had never <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> {{coherent}} answer to this question. My words dropped into the silence, like a pebble into a vast, black pool of water.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} to do with Captain Forster at all, Mr. Wilson; I--" [...] and she hesitated. [...] "I said {{something}} at which he had the right to feel hurt and offended, and he has never <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> opportunity since of saying that I was sorry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither {{my master}} nor <b>any</b> other person <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> arsenic to destroy rats at any time. No such thing was wanted. I declare, on my oath, that I {{never saw any}} rats in or about the house, or ever heard of any rats infesting it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{know not}} what reply Westervelt whispered; nor did Zenobia's {{subsequent}} exclamation <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> clew, {{except that it}} evidently inspired her with horror and disgust.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose it}} will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> trouble. Of course, {{it must be}} {{embarrassing}} to feel you had a helpless young woman on your hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rocky grub. But I ain't kicking. Say--can you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> {{pointers}} about managing that--affair? It's {{my first}} deal in {{that line of}} business, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|But it was Maqueda {{who first}} <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> {{definite}} hope. On the third evening she came and sat by Orme for awhile, her attendants {{standing at a}} little distance. When she left him {{there was a new}} look upon her face--a very joyful look--which caused me to ask her what had happened.|$|R
5000|$|Cole loves {{being asked}} about her two children. [...] "Whenever Holly (her daughter) said or did {{anything}} brattish, I'd just go, 'Is there a problem, Veruca? Can I help you?' That always snapped her out of it. But I didn't call Barnaby (her son) anything {{because there was no}} need; he never <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>any</b> such trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Ib.)
