On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio and Fantasia, the company had debts of $4million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss {{the future of the}} company, the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told his executives, [...] "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> lending them money far above the financial risk.... They're good this year, they're good next year, and they're good the year after.... You have to relax and give them time to market their product." [...] Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E
2500|$|Newman {{had written}} some songs for the album: [...] "My method of writing songs, which I hadn't used for 30 years, {{is to write}} them on {{acoustic}} guitar. They take an average of five minutes each. If it's not written in five minutes, it's {{not going to get}} written. I'd sit on the couch, play a bit, if I had some words from Graham, jam 'em in, record it to my iPhone, then I'd present a bunch of songs to Rob and Graham. Rob said , 'It sounds like the '70s' and Graham said, 'I hate acoustic guitar,' so <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> onto a winner. That's so classic Wire." ...|$|E

Once he had decided upon making deeper cuts than he promised, Chrétien proved to be firm supporter of the new course, and supported Martin's cuts to other departments despite the complaints of the other ministers. Chrétien's advisor Eddie Goldenberg later recalled that Chrétien was unyielding {{in the face of}} efforts by other ministers to [...] "spare" [...] their departments, and that Chrétien kept on saying [...] "If I change anything, everything will unravel". In a 2011 interview, Chrétien recalled about the 1995 budget that: [...] "There would have been a day when we would have been the Greece of today. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in a bind and we had to do something." [...] In order to silence objections from left-wing Liberal backbenchers and Cabinet ministers, Chrétien ensured that the Program Review Committee chaired by Marcel Massé that would decide what programs to end and which to cut had a majority comprising the leftist MPs Brian Tobin, Sheila Copps, Sergio Marchi and Herb Gray, people who would not normally supporting cutting programs, and thereby underlined the seriousness of the crisis. It was only with the budget that Martin introduced on February 27, 1995, that the Chrétien government began a policy of cuts designed to eliminate the deficit in order to reassure the markets.|$|E

Although {{he was on the}} roster of its farm club, Milwaukee manager Charley Grimm later stated, [...] "From the start, he did so well <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to have to carry him." [...] On March 13, 1954, Milwaukee Braves left fielder Bobby Thomson fractured his ankle while sliding into second base during a spring training game. The next day, Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves' major league team, playing in left field and hitting a home run. This led Hank Aaron to a major league contract, signed {{on the final day of}} spring training, and a Braves uniform with the number five. On April 13, Aaron made his major league debut and was hitless in five at-bats against the Cincinnati Reds' left-hander Joe Nuxhall. In the same game, Eddie Mathews hit two home runs, the first of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as teammates. On April 15, Aaron collected his first major league hit, a double off Cardinals' pitcher Vic Raschi. [...] Aaron hit his first major league home run on April 23, also off Raschi. Over the next 122 games, Aaron batted [...]280 with thirteen homers before he suffered a fractured ankle on September 5. He then changed his number to 44, which would turn out to look like a [...] "lucky number" [...] for the slugger. Aaron would hit 44 home runs in four different seasons, and he hit his record-breaking 715th career home run off Dodgers pitcher Al Downing, who coincidentally also wore number 44.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, at age 13, vocalist Hayley Williams {{moved from}} her {{hometown}} Meridian, Mississippi to Franklin, Tennessee, {{where she met}} brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro at a weekly supplemental program for home-schooled students. Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with Brett Manning. Prior to forming Paramore, Williams and bassist Jeremy Davis, along with friend Kimee Read, {{took part in a}} funk cover band called The Factory, while Josh and Zac Farro had practiced together after school. The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been [...] "edgy about the whole female thing" [...] of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were good friends, she started writing for them. Williams said of the members when she first met them, [...] "They were the first people I met who were as passionate about music as I was." [...] The band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Davis (bass guitar) and Williams (lead vocals) in 2004, with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum (rhythm guitar). When Davis showed up, he was stunned to find out the drummer was only twelve years old. He admitted [...] "I had very, very, very, little faith in everyone in the band because of their age. I remember thinking, 'This {{is not going to work}} because this kid is way too young,' but that first day of practice was amazing. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on to something." [...] According to Williams, the name [...] "Paramore" [...] came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players. Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone [...] "" [...] ("secret lover"), they decided to adopt the name, using the Paramore spelling.|$|E

Rather, it uses small fragments of mined gems, which are then used as seeds to re-crystallize liquid into larger gemstones.
