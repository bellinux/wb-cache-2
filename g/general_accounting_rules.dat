40|$|Present study {{investigated}} the gap between accounting practices and the magnitude role of accounting information in the agricultural sector. Problem statement: Factors for this gap are: Current <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> {{do not reflect the}} particularities of farming, the need of farm management, rural development and sustainability. The introduction of International Accounting Standard 41 (IAS 41) by International Accounting Standard Committee, Approach: With the Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) in Europe, could be key elements to improve the use of agriculture accounting. Results: After mandatory and optional adoption for listed and non-listed small size companies, of IASs respectively, by EU at 2005, we conclude that the main contribution of IAS 41 is to provide a strong conceptual framework in agricultural accounting practice. Conclusion: FADN is an experienced data network, which could be a guide for implementing of IAS 41.

40|$|This paper {{starts out}} {{to observe that}} there is a gap between the {{importance}} given to accounting and the low level of bookkeeping and accounting practice in the agricultural sector. Reasons for this gap are that current <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> do not adapt very well to the particularities of farming and are difficult and expensive to implement. We then suggest that the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and the recently issued International Accounting Standard on Agriculture (IAS 41) could be key elements to improve the use of accounting in European farms. We review the main contributions of IAS 41 and conclude that it provides a strong conceptual framework but might need further instruments for its implementation in practice, given the limitations of the agricultural sector. We continue to explain that FADN is an experienced network that has elaborated very detailed farm accounting procedures, and suggest that these procedures could be turned into a guide for implementing IAS 41. We report empirical data which indicate that current FADN reports are already considered useful by farmers for different purposes. Finally, we analyse in detail the compatibility of IAS 41 and FADN, identifying changes in the FADN procedures that would become necessary if the FADN procedures were to be used for implementing IAS 41 and some aspects of FADN that might have been worthwhile to consider for the final version of IAS 41. ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{new techniques}} called abductive generalization and abductive specialization in logic programs. Abductive generalization {{enables us to}} abduce not only specific facts but <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> <b>accounting</b> for positive observations. It is achieved by generalizing abductive explanations and incorporating them in a knowledge base. On the other hand, abductive specialization refines a knowledge base to recover consistency wrt negative observations. It is done by abductively finding the sources of inconsistency and specializing them with additional abductive hypotheses. A unique feature of our approach is that each procedure computes inductive generalization and specialization through abduction.

40|$|This study {{intends to}} explain {{the problem with the}} {{implementation}} of new Swedish accounting rules called K 2. The rules are simplifications of the <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> and the purpose is {{to make it easier for}} small companies to account. Despite this, few small companies have adopted the rules. This study seeks {{to explain the}} weak response to the K 2 -rules using institutional theory. The research objects of this study are Burger King, McDonald’s and two audits and accountants. The data is collected through telephone interviews and interviews where we visited the respondents. The interviews were semi-structured and the questions were designed so that the respondents were able to speak free. The collected data were related to the institutional theory to seek dependent variables who can explain the weak response of K 2. The conclusion is that small companies are dependent of auditors and accountants when it comes to accounting. They lack knowledge about accounting, instead they purchase the service externally. The audits and accountants are in turn affected by the public opinion of K 2 and they have trouble to depart from previous learning from the educational system. The explanation to the weak response of K 2 is that small companies are dependent of audits and accountants who have a negative attitude towards K 2 because of its illegitimacy...|$|E

To ensure that the information companies share in their annual reports will be reliable and useful for its users, it is required that certain regulations are in place {{to ensure that they}} are established correctly based on laws and regulations. On the first of January 2014, new rules regarding the preparation of the financial reports were established in Sweden. In other words, new rules were introduced by Bokföringsnämnden regarding category 2 and category 3 <b>accounting</b> <b>rules.</b> Problem: The companies had to make their choice between the two different <b>accounting</b> <b>rules.</b> The new rules introduced on the first of January 2014 "forced" companies classified as small according to ÅRL to make their decision on which <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> submit to, K 2 or K 3. Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to create an understanding of the factors that affected the companies in their choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>rules.</b> Frame of reference: In the theoretical framework addressed theories and previous research on the factors that may have affected the firm's choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>rules,</b> and a presentation of the two <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> K 2 and K 3. 7 Method: We have chosen to use a quantitative approach through a web survey with qualitative elements that companies have been able to leave their own comments and some e-mail contact occurred with accounting specialist to confirm factors that may have influenced companies in their choice between <b>accounting</b> <b>rules.</b> Empiricism: Empirical research is divided into eight parts based on the questions we have selected for our quantitative study. Analysis: In the analysis we presented how our quantitative study is linked to previous research and theories. Conclusion: All the elements that we asked about in the survey had some form of impact on the companies’ crucial decision between <b>accounting</b> <b>rules.</b> However, we have seen that it is mainly two factors affecting their choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>rules.</b> These two are "the economic adviser" and " company size"...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary and incomplete. Comments welcome. We {{characterize}} {{the properties of}} optimal <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> in a sig-naling game where an impatient entrepreneur sells shares to competitive investors. The entrepreneur can signal her private information about the fundamental of the rm by retaining {{a fraction of the}} shares. In addition, she can commit to disclosing information according to a set of <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> chosen ex ante. Information disclosure reduces signaling cost so that perfect diclosure is optimal. However, perfect disclosure requires disclos-ing innite amount of information (measured by reduction of Shannon's entropy), which is usually unrealistic. When disclosure can only reveal nite amount of information, the optimal <b>accounting</b> <b>rule</b> features an in-mum and a summary statistic of the fundamental. The inmum can be interpreted as being consistent with various conservative <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> while the statistic summarizes the most relevant information determined by the signalling game.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} {{ways in which}} inertia obstructs the adoption of new management <b>accounting</b> <b>rules.</b> Drawing on the view of management <b>accounting</b> as organisational <b>rules</b> and routines, it aims to suggest various ways in which inertia can become more pronounced when new <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> challenge existing routines. Design/methodology/approach – A longitudinal case study was conducted {{at one of the}} largest banks in The Netherlands. This bank introduced a program called “Results Oriented Management”, which produced various new management <b>accounting</b> <b>rules.</b> Findings – The paper identifies various ways in which inertia manifested itself when new management <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> were introduced. Moreover, the paper shows that ambiguity and contradictions {{play an important role in}} the presence of inertia. Research limitations/implications – The identification of individual-level habits and scripts is a difficult undertaking. Through a focus on the performative and ostensive aspects of routines, some of the processes of inertia and change on an individual level are identified. This is a relevant method for students of management accounting change. Originality/value – Although it is well known that routines can produce inertia, the process by which this inertia is manifested and how this affects the adoption of new management <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> is still unclear.

If we take into consideration the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the only reason cannot be mortgage loans. But the mortgage issue continued to advance and created several other problems. Definitely, the source of mortgage loans problem also had many roots. One of the reasons was the lack of correct use of accounting principles and auditing. This is a strong proof and indicator that, there are many accounting based reasons behind the occurrence of the financial crises. Many examples can be given showing moving away from the basic principles of <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> and the <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> concepts. Moreover, institutions being not fully independent, running creative accounting practices, having problems with fair valuation and transparency issues, presenting unreal financial reports, and sharing misleading audit reports are all related to financial crises. Furthermore, specific businesses and people abuse <b>accounting</b> <b>rules,</b> standards and related legislation for the sake of their own interests. Accounting and finance history has shown us that, even audit institutions, credit institutions and rating agencies are getting unfair advantages and generating unethical cash by making intentional accounting and finance errors, which is actually categorized as fraud.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters. Chapter 1 examines the ex-ante optimality of repricing and rescission of executive stock options while considering dilution effects and the tax effects of new <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> associated with repricing and rescission. Traditional repricing lowers the exercise price of outstanding options to match the declined {{market value of the}} stock. Rescission allows employees to cancel already-exercised options when share prices fall, which was not an issue until 2000 when the stock market plummeted. To my best knowledge, this study is the first research on examining the possible optimality of traditional repricing and rescission while considering the economic impact of changing <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> in an ex-ante contracting setting. Chapter 2 examines the ex-ante optimality of repricing alternatives and derives an optimal repricing-triggered policy, which specify how deeply the options are under water before repricing takes place. In practice, traditional repricing practices have become obsolete since new <b>accounting</b> <b>rules</b> took effect in July 2000. To avoid associated variable accounting charges that cause uncertainty in future reported earnings, companies have tried several repricing alternatives as solutions to rescuing underwater options. This study not only justifies the occurrence of some repricing alternatives but also quantifies the impact of the marking-to-market feature imbedded in the new <b>accounting</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R
