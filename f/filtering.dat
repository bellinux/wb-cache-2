5|$|The northwestern and {{northern}} {{portions of the}} Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of}} the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. This limestone geology results in most rainwater <b>filtering</b> directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone, from whence it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs. Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes. The <b>filtering</b> of rainwater through the limestone has caused the formation of extensive cave systems. These cave rooves are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes; if the bottom of the cave is deeper than the groundwater level then a cenote is formed.|$|E

5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased.

In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install <b>filtering</b> equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing <b>filtering</b> equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The frequency-response masking {{approach}} for highspeed recursive infinite-impulse response (IIR) digital <b>filters</b> is introduced. In this approach, the overall <b>filter</b> {{consists of a}} periodic model <b>filter,</b> its power-complementary periodic <b>filter,</b> and two masking <b>filters.</b> The model <b>filters</b> are composed of two all-pass <b>filters</b> in parallel, whereas the masking <b>filters</b> are linear-phase finite-impulse response (FIR) <b>filters.</b> The transfer functions of the all-pass <b>filters</b> are functions of which implies that the maximal sample frequency for the overall <b>filter</b> is {{times that of the}} corresponding conventional IIR <b>filter.</b> The maximal sample frequency can be increased to an arbitrary level for arbitrary bandwidths. The overall <b>filter</b> can be designed by separately optimizing the model and masking <b>filters</b> with the aid of conventional approximation techniques. The obtained overall <b>filter</b> also serves as a good initial <b>filter</b> for further optimization. Both nonlinear-phase and approximately linear-phase <b>filters</b> are considered. By using the new approach, the potential problems of pole–zero cancellations, which are inherent in algorithm transformation techniques, are avoided. Further, robust <b>filters</b> under finite-arithmetic conditions can always be obtained by using wave-digital all-pass <b>filters</b> and nonrecursive FIR <b>filters.</b> Several design examples are included illustrating the properties of the new <b>filters.</b> I...|$|R
