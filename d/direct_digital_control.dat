[...] In 1970, the company moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba because of business incentives. In 1974, the company moved to Minnesota, and, in 1978, the company moved manufacturing operations to its present location in New Paris, Indiana. In 1989, {{the research and}} development side of the business (then known as Kreuter Engineering) made the transition from Minnesota to Indiana as well in order to consolidate all company operations. In 1995, Kreuter Manufacturing Company, Inc. began doing business as KMC Controls, Inc., a name change that better reflected its business.

Digital inputs are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device.

50|$|The DCS largely {{came about}} {{due to the}} {{increased}} availability of microcomputers {{and the proliferation of}} microprocessors in the world of process control. Computers had already been applied to process automation for some time in the form of both <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> (DDC) and setpoint control. In the early 1970s Taylor Instrument Company, (now part of ABB) developed the 1010 system, Foxboro the FOX1 system, Fisher Controls the DC2 system and Bailey Controls the 1055 systems. All of these were DDC applications implemented within minicomputers (DEC PDP-11, Varian Data Machines, MODCOMP etc.) and connected to proprietary Input/Output hardware. Sophisticated (for the time) continuous as well as batch control was implemented in this way. A more conservative approach was setpoint control, where process computers supervised clusters of analog process controllers. A workstation provided visibility into the process using text and crude character graphics. Availability of a fully functional graphical user interface was a way away.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 <b>Direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> is {{becoming}} quite {{common in the}} control of industrial processes. However, due to the relatively high accuracy of both analog and conventional digital systems for controlling {{the speed of a}} dc motor, there has been a reluctance to try DDC for this purpose. This thesis describes a <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> system for speed control of a dc motor, and shows the significant advantages it has over the more conventional methods. The system consists of a dc tachometer, an A/D converter, a clock, a time shared PDP- 8 minicomputer, interface logic, and a resistor switching circuit.

40|$|Oregon {{school districts}} are {{experiencing}} problems with <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>controls</b> (DDC) in new and existing schools. Errors in the design, installation and operation of DDC systems cause occupant discomfort (thermal and IAQ), are time consuming to fix and waste energy. Schools that fix their DDC problems can save substantially on energy costs. One new school that fixed its controls is saving $ 10, 000 annually or 13 percent of its energy budget. The Oregon Office of Energy implemented a systematic approach to address DDC problems. A broad service delivery strategy is required because many schools have multiple DDC systems and school construction is booming. The office uses three key components in its systematic approach. First, office staff uses trouble-shooting tools to identify DDC problems and suggest solutions for installed systems. Second, the office developed construction bid specification guidelines for DDC systems. They include an explicitly stated sequence of operations, accountability for system deficiencies by trade, and a detailed training agenda. Anticipated results include consistent bids from multiple vendors, reduced contractor callbacks, appropriate system design, energy efficient operation, and a functional DDC system. Third, the office is developing a DDC circuit rider program because individual school districts can not afford control experts and local control vendors often do not provide adequate service. Under the program, the school system employs control experts who circulate among school districts to provide trouble-shooting, repair, and general operation and maintenance services...|$|R
40|$|Controllers {{that have}} {{adjustable}} parameters, and an update law for adjusting these parameters, are called ``adaptive controllers''. Adaptive controllers typically entail {{assumptions about the}} dynamic order, relative degree or transmission zeros of the system, {{and may not be}} applicable to systems that are not positive real, passive, or minimum phase. In 1980 s, the fragility of adaptive controllers to violations in these assumptions has been demonstrated through various counterexamples. This motivated the development of robustness modifications for adaptive controllers, which is the main goal of this dissertation. In this dissertation, we focus on retrospective cost adaptive control (RCAC), which is a <b>direct,</b> <b>digital</b> adaptive <b>control</b> algorithm. RCAC is applicable to MIMO, nonminimum-phase (NMP) systems, but it assumes that the NMP zeros of the plant, if any, are known. The main contribution of this work includes theory and analysis for retrospective cost adaptive control of nonsquare systems and development of a modified, robust RCAC update law for maintaining stability and convergence in the presence of unmodeled NMP zeros...|$|R

40|$|The Central Utility Plant (CUP) at D/FW Airport is a {{facility}} that was first placed in operation during the Fall of 1973 and has continuously operated since that time. The original plant produced steam for heating and for chilled water generation via condensing turbine type centrifugal chiller drives. Its original service area was 1. 4 million square feet. The original utilities costs were 27 cents per MCF for natural gas and 0. 85 cents per KWH for electricity. The 1974 energy budget was slightly less than $ 500, 000. 00. Currently this same plant, after a continuous series of improvements, serves over 3 million square feet utilizing less chiller capacity and less boiler capacity than was used in 1974. The energy usage per square foot of facility served has been reduced by at least 65 % {{and the value of}} the accumulated annual energy cost avoidances from January 1, 1975 to present exceeds $ 17, 000, 000. 00 The present value of those cost avoidances would be $ 21, 718, 000. 00 if treasury bill interest rates were applied to these cost avoidances as they were being accumulated. The total cost of capital improvements to achieve these savings was less than 2 million dollars of which 1. 5 million has been spent during the last two years. In 1984 the total utility cost for operating this plant was less than 1. 5 million dollars. The {{bottom line is that the}} service area has increased by a factor of 2. 15, the cost of natural gas has increased by a factor of 15, the electric service cost increased by a factor of 6 and the utility service cost to the tenant has increased less than 25 % on a per square foot basis. The cost avoidances were generated primarily by the elimination of reheat for space conditioning and modifications and improvements to the central heating and cooling equipment. The remainder of this paper will deal with the latter and more specifically with the implementation and utilization of variable frequency drives (VFD) and <b>direct</b> <b>digital</b> <b>controls</b> (DDC) to improve the efficiency of chilled water generation and distribution systems...|$|R
