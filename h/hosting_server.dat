5000|$|Hit-and-run DDoS {{is a type}} of denial-of-service (DDoS) {{attack that}} uses short bursts of high volume attacks in random intervals, {{spanning}} a time frame of days or weeks. The purpose of a hit-and-run DDoS is to prevent a user of a service from using that service by bringing down the <b>host</b> <b>server.</b> This type of attack is to be distinguished from a persistent DDoS attack which continues until the attacker stops the attack or the <b>host</b> <b>server</b> is able to defend against it.|$|R
40|$|Phishing is {{an online}} scam used to dupe {{people out of}} their {{personal}} information for the purpose of defrauding them. This paper presents a conceptual design for removing phishing pages that have been uploaded on a Web site, potentially without knowledge of the Web site owner or <b>host</b> <b>server.</b> Initially the system is alerted to the presence of a phishing page upon receiving the Phisherpsilas solicitation e-mail. Next the system retrieves the location, IP address and contact information of the <b>host</b> <b>server</b> using a tracking program. Finally, the system sends notification to the Administrator about the phishing page on its server. It is then up to the <b>host</b> <b>server</b> Administrator to remove the phishing page from its server, or face the possibility of criminals continuing to use their site. This approach acts as the basis for further development into proactively (or aggressively) attacking Phishers directly, rather than being a reactionary approach that is common to most email filters and anti-virus software...|$|R

30|$|The Adaptive Replication scenario: The University server {{manages the}} web {{services}} replication process. If it detects {{the failure of}} a web service or a <b>host</b> <b>server,</b> the framework automatically replicates the consumed service on another server (i.e. a Secondary server) located inside the University campus based upon certain Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) including their performance and availability. Moreover, if the University server detects the overloading of a web service or <b>host</b> <b>server,</b> the framework automatically replicates the consumed service on another server then uses the Round Robin load balancing algorithm (Silberschatz et al. 2010) to balance the requests on the replicas.|$|R
50|$|Internet Protocol (IP) address blocking: Access to {{a certain}} IP address is denied. If the target Web site is hosted in a shared <b>hosting</b> <b>server,</b> all {{websites}} on the same server will be blocked. This affects IP-based protocols such as HTTP, FTP and POP. A typical circumvention method is to find proxies that {{have access to the}} target websites, but proxies may be jammed or blocked, and some Web sites, such as Wikipedia (when editing), also block proxies. Some large websites such as Google have allocated additional IP addresses to circumvent the block, but later the block was extended to cover the new addresses. Due to challenges with geolocation, geo-blocking is normally implemented via IP address blocking.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Architecture=== In using {{cloud based}} architecture, the server {{takes on the}} {{processing}} load of several client sessions, acting as a host for each endpoint device. The client software is narrowly purposed and lightweight; therefore, only the host server or server farm needs to be secured, rather than securing software installed on every endpoint device (although thin clients may still require basic security and strong authentication to prevent unauthorized access). One of the trade-offs of using cloud architecture and thin clients is that the host becomes a single point of failure. If the <b>hosting</b> <b>server</b> crashes, for example, all users lose their session unless a fail-over process is predefined. This risk can be mitigated by building redundancies into the host environment. Redundancy provides reliable host availability but adds cost to the cloud computing model. Redundancy can be provided {{in the form of}} networked servers, clustered file systems, load balancing, etc.|$|E
50|$|In jurisdictions that heavily {{restrict}} access or outright ban pornography, various {{attempts have}} been made to prevent access to pornographic content. The mandating of Internet filters to try preventing access to porn sites has been used in some nations such as China and Saudi Arabia. Banning porn sites within a nation's jurisdiction does not necessarily prevent access to that site, as it may simply relocate to a <b>hosting</b> <b>server</b> within another country that does not prohibit the content it offers. The United Kingdom's Digital Economy Act 2017 includes powers to require age-verification for pornographic Internet sites and the government accepted an amendment to allow the regulator to require ISPs to block access to non-compliant sites. As the BBFC are expected to become the regulator, this has caused discussion about ISPs being required to block content that is prohibited even under an R18 certificate, the prohibition of some of which is itself controversial.|$|E
50|$|Endpoint {{security}} systems {{operate on a}} client-server model with the security program controlled by a centrally managed <b>host</b> <b>server</b> pinned with a client program which is installed on all the network drives. There is yet another model called the software-as-a-service (SaaS), the security programs and the <b>host</b> <b>server</b> are maintained remotely by the merchant. In the payment card industry, the contribution from both the delivery models is that the server program verifies and authenticates the user login credentials and performs a device scan to check if it complies with a designated corporate security standards prior to permit network access.|$|R
