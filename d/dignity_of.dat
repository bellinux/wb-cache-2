40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> plays a {{foundational}} role in {{the more}} recent versions of Martha Nussbaum's capabilities theory. However, despite its centrality to her theory, Nussbaum's conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> remains under-theorised. In this paper we critically examine the role that dignity plays in Nussbaum's theory by, first, developing {{an account of the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and introducing a distinction between two types <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> status dignity and achievement dignity. Next, drawing on this account, we analyse Nussbaum's conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and contrast it with Kant's conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity.</b> On the basis of this comparison between Nussbaum and Kant, we highlight tensions between Nussbaum's Aristotelianism, which is central to her conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> and her commitment to political liberalism. This leads us to conclude that Nussbaum's claim that her conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> is only a partial political conception is implausible and that her conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> seems to commit her to a satisficing form of perfectionist liberalism. 18 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Van der Weyden {{may have}} drawn {{influence}} from Stefan Lochner's c.1435 Last Judgement, {{and a similar}} c.1420 painting now in the Hotel de Ville, Diest, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a Great Deësis of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven and the gates of Hell. In both earlier works Christ perches on a rainbow; in the Deësis panel he also is above a globe. While these two earlier works are filled with dread and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the same sorrowful, but self-controlled <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> his best works. This is most evident {{in the manner in}} which the oversized and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene from Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{reason for the}} creation of an archbishopric at Lichfield relates to Offa's son, Ecgfrith of Mercia. After Hygeberht became archbishop, he consecrated Ecgfrith as king; the ceremony took place within a year of Hygeberht's elevation. It is possible that Jaenberht refused to perform the ceremony, and that Offa needed an alternative archbishop for that purpose. The ceremony itself is noteworthy for two reasons: it is the first recorded consecration of any English king, and it is unusual in that it asserted Ecgfrith's royal status while his father was still alive. Offa would have been aware that Charlemagne's sons, Pippin and Louis, had been consecrated as kings by Pope Adrian, and probably wished to emulate the impressive <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> the Frankish court. Other precedents did exist: Æthelred of Mercia is said to have nominated his son Coenred as king during his lifetime, and Offa may have known of Byzantine examples of royal consecration.|$|E
5|$|Liechtenstein {{formally}} {{came into}} existence on 23 January 1719, when Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor decreed the lordship of Schellenberg and the countship of Vaduz united and raised to the <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> a principality. Liechtenstein {{was a part of}} the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Pressburg was signed on 26 December 1805; this marked Liechtenstein's formal independence, though it was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine and the German Confederation afterwards. While Liechtenstein was still closely aligned with Austria-Hungary until World War I, it realigned its politics and its customs and monetary institutions with Switzerland instead. Having been a constitutional monarchy since 1921, Hans-Adam II demanded more influence in Liechtenstein's politics in the early 21st century, which he was granted in a referendum held on 16 March 2003, effectively making Liechtenstein a semi-constitutional monarchy again. However, the constitutional changes also provide for the possibility of a referendum to abolish the monarchy entirely. The current monarch is Hans-Adam II, who turned over the day-to-day governing decisions to his son and heir Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein on 15 August 2004.|$|E

5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin {{to assume the}} <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E
