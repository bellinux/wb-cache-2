50|$|Channel flow {{describes}} the {{process through which}} hot, viscous crustal material flows horizontally between the upper crust and lithospheric mantle, and is eventually pushed to the surface. This model aims to explain features common to metamorphic hinterlands of some collisional orogens, most notably the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau system. In mountainous areas with heavy rainfall (thus, high erosion rates) deeply <b>incising</b> <b>rivers</b> will form. As these rivers wear away the Earth's surface two things occur: (1) pressure is reduced on the underlying rocks effectively making them weaker and (2) the underlying material moves closer to the surface. This reduction of crustal strength, coupled with the erosional exhumation, allows for the diversion of the underlying channel flow toward the Earth's surface.|$|R

Anthropogenic alterations to landscapes, such as agriculture, {{can lead to}} accelerated erosion in <b>incising</b> (or <b>incised)</b> <b>rivers</b> threatening infrastructure and property, and causing unnaturally high sediment loads, which threaten ecosystems. Steep bluffs and ravines are characteristic landforms in <b>incising</b> <b>river</b> systems, and by understanding erosion on these landforms {{we can begin to}} mitigate the impacts of the altered landscape. The Le Sueur River watershed, in southern Minnesota, provides an ideal location for studying the impacts of agricultural land-use on erosion in an <b>incising</b> <b>river.</b> Agriculture in this watershed is made possible through the use of tile drains, which remove water from the uplands and route it directly into ravines or the river, reducing the water that pools on the landscape and increasing flows in the river. Using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and aerial photographs, bluff erosion rates in the Le Sueur River were measured and used to develop a watershed scale sediment budget. In the Le Sueur River bluffs account for 56 ± 12 % of the 2000 - 2010 average measured total suspended solids load. These data were also used to interpret how changes in land-use and climate have accelerated bluff retreat in this watershed. The data collected paired with field observations show that over-steepening at the bluff toe drives bluff retreat, yet weakening due to groundwater seeps and freeze-thaw also contributes to erosion. The increases in flow rates and volumes brought on by tile drainage in this watershed have resulted in increased bluff erosion. To study ravine response to changing overland flow hydrology, brought on by tile drainage, small physical experiments were used to measure how changing the delivery rate of a fixed volume of water impacts erosion. The results of these experiments showed that regardless of flow rate the volume of sediment removed remained the same, suggesting that the tile drains installed in the Le Sueur River watershed may have decreased ravine growth. Results of each of these projects independently improves our understanding of bluff erosion and ravine growth processes, yet combined they provide insight into how changing hydrology impacts erosion throughout an incising watershed. While agricultural landscape alterations, especially tile drains, have decreased ravine growth they have resulted in increased bluff erosion. Because bluffs in the Le Sueur River watershed account {{for more than half of}} the total sediment load, there is a net increase in sediment loads as a result of anthropogenic landscape alterations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{stream power}} {{incision}} model (SPIM) is {{a cornerstone of}} quantitative geomorphology. It states that river incision rate {{is the product of}} drainage area and channel slope raised to the power exponents m and n, respectively. It is widely used to predict patterns of deformation from channel long profile inversion or to model knickpoint migration and landscape evolution. Numerous studies have attempted to test its applicability with mixed results prompting the question of its validity. This paper synthesizes these results, highlights the SPIM deficiencies, and offers new insights into the role of incision thresholds and channel width. By reviewing quantitative data on <b>incising</b> <b>rivers,</b> I first propose six sets of field evidence that any long-term incision model should be able to predict. This analysis highlights several inconsistencies of the standard SPIM. Next, I discuss the methods used to construct physics-based long-term incision laws. I demonstrate that all published <b>incising</b> <b>river</b> datasets away from knickpoints or knickzones are in a regime dominated by threshold effects requiring an explicit upscaling of flood stochasticity neglected in the standard SPIM and other incision models. Using threshold-stochastic simulations with dynamic width, I document the existence of composite transient dynamics where knickpoint propagation locally obeys a linear SPIM (n= 1) while other part of the river obey a non-linear SPIM (n> 1). The threshold-stochastic SPIM resolves some inconsistencies of the standard SPIM and matches steady-state field evidence when width is not sensitive to incision rate. However it fails to predict the scaling of slope with incision rate for cases where width decreases with incision rate. Recent proposed models of dynamic width cannot resolve these deficiencies. An explicit upscaling of sediment flux and threshold-stochastic effects combined with dynamic width should take us beyond the SPIM which is shown here to have a narrow range of validity...|$|R

50|$|River {{phenomenon}} describes distinctive, deeply <b>incised</b> <b>river</b> valleys in {{the landscape}} of Central Europe {{in the sense of}} their biotic, geomorphologic and climatic features. This term is used mainly in the Czech Republic, where it was introduced by several studies in 1960s. Distinctiveness of deep river valleys is based on their sharp contrast to softly undulating landscape, prevailing in middle elevations of Czech. Steep slopes, exposed rocks pronouncing the effect of geological substrate on vegetation, contrast between the sunny and warm southerly oriented slopes and shaded cold northerly oriented slopes, high diversity of various extreme habitats situated next to each other, specific microclimatic conditions causing frequent temperature inversions, the main feature for existence of river phenomenon. The main biotic consequences are: (1) high biodiversity located in deep river valleys, (2) concentration of relict species, resulting from the fact, that deep river valleys served as a refugia for plant and animal species during the era of ice age, (3) function of river valley as a corridor for migration of plants and animals, connecting mountain areas with lowlands, and (4) preservation of the vegetation relatively unaffected by human activities for its inaccessibility.|$|E

40|$|Interpretations of the {{allogenic}} and autogenic {{controls on}} dryland alluvial successions are commonly hampered by incomplete {{knowledge of the}} sedimentology of modern dryland river floodplains, {{in part because of}} the limited subsurface sediment exposures available in typically stable or aggrading riverine settings. Along many valleys in the South African interior, however, river incision and associated formation of ?dongas? (gullies and badland-type settings) provides extensive exposures of Cenozoic alluvial successions, which enable assessment of the controls on their genesis, sedimentary architecture, and preservation potential. This paper focuses on the <b>incised</b> Modder <b>River</b> at Erfkroon, Free State, located ?? 1480 km (river distance) inland from the Atlantic Ocean. At Erfkroon, numerous dongas have formed in an ?? 15 -m-thick alluvial succession deposited within a narrow (<? 500 m) valley carved predominantly in erodible, fine-grained sedimentary rocks (?shales?). Facies associations include channel deposits that vary in texture from sandy gravel to silty sand, and overbank deposits consisting predominantly of sandy mud to muddy sand that have varying degrees of pedogenic overprinting. Younger deposits are stacked upon, crosscut, or onlap older deposits, indicating a complex history of cut and fill. Changing assemblages of associated fossil fauna and archaeological artifacts, luminescence ages, and paleosol characteristics demonstrate net sediment accumulation over at least the last 42 ka under humid to arid climatic conditions. By contrast, the present-day situation of deep channel and donga incision into bedrock appears to represent a new phase of sediment evacuation and valley deepening. Comparison with other <b>incising</b> dryland <b>rivers</b> in the South African interior suggests that: 1) while phases of cut and fill are driven largely by climatic fluctuations, major phases of incision into bedrock are controlled by breaching of downstream resistant rock barriers; 2) long-term sediment preservation is limited in narrow valleys that are subject to extended periods of base-level stability followed by episodic, major incisional phases, but is greater along broader valleys where rivers are undergoing lateral migration and more progressive long-term incision. Study of <b>incising</b> <b>rivers</b> such as the Modder can yield important insights into the controls on alluvial successions in stable continental interiors beyond the range of sea-level changes, which may help with the interpretation of inland alluvial valleys preserved in the geological record.

Field research focused on the investigation of debris flows that occur on the sides of <b>incised</b> <b>river</b> valleys where colluvium and till overlie grus, saprolite, and bedrock. The debris flows are complex events, which begin as thin translational slides or slumps and quickly evolve into debris flows. They are long and consistently narrow (< 20 m), commonly initiate just below the intersection of the valley wall and the Cape Breton Highlands peneplain, fail on slopes ranging from 27 ° to 48 °, and denude no more than 1. 5 m of the surface. Failed slopes are commonly unvegetated, with no observed association with large-scale surface depressions or gullies. Two common stratigraphic relationships on failed slopes are: 1) highly compacted, impermeable clay-rich lodgement till overlain by highly permeable colluvium and 2) impermeable weathered bedrock in the form of saprolite overlain by permeable colluvium. Both contact boundaries act as slip surfaces. Ground water accumulates at the colluvium/till interface within the activation zone producing an effective glide plane for initial translational movement.
