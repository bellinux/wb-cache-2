40|$|The paper {{presents}} a study aimed at developing an indigenous {{moisture measuring device}} from locally available materials for grains {{based on the principle}} of resistance change of the material with corresponding change in moisture during drying. The developed device has four copper <b>electrode</b> <b>cups</b> positions in which both gauging and dummy copper <b>electrode</b> <b>cups</b> were placed to form Wheatstone bridge circuits of full, half and quarter for four, two and one gauging copper <b>electrode</b> <b>cups</b> respectively, while the remaining positions were used as dummies. These circuits were used to measure the resistances and hence obtaining the moisture content of the grains used. Grains of paddy rice, guinea corn and millet were used to test the device and it was observed that for full bridge circuits of each of the grains, paddy rice have a negative coefficient of correlation of - 0. 95, - 0. 99 for guinea corn and - 0. 99 for millet. The results obtained from predictive empirical equations when compared with the direct oven method, showed that the device can be used to predict or measure moisture content once calibrated...|$|R

2500|$|Bloodletting, the {{surgical}} removal of blood, {{was used to}} cure a patient of bad [...] "humours" [...] considered deleterious to one's health. A phlebotomist performing bloodletting on a patient drained the blood straight from the veins. [...] "Wet" [...] cupping, a form of bloodletting, was performed by making a slight incision in the skin and drawing blood by applying a heated <b>cupping</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] The heat and suction from the glass caused the blood {{to rise to the}} surface of the skin to be drained. “Dry cupping”, the placement of a heated <b>cupping</b> <b>glass</b> (without an incision) on a particular area of a patient's body to relieve pain, itching, and other common ailments, was also used. Though these procedures seem relatively easy for phlebotomists to perform, there were instances where they had to pay compensation for causing injury or death to a patient because of carelessness when making an incision. Both cupping and phlebotomy were considered helpful when a patient was sickly.|$|R

60|$|After {{the first}} {{excitement}} of arrival was over, the Eskimos built igloes {{on the shore}} and settled down to dismantle the vessel and take possession of her stores, and of all that could be of use to them. They built an elongated oval igloe on the shore as a store to receive the lighter and, as they esteemed them, more valuable articles. Among these were included all the axes, hoop-iron, and other pieces of manageable metal that could be easily carried. There were also numbers of tin cans, iron pots, <b>cups,</b> <b>glass</b> tumblers, earthenware plates, and other things of the kind, which were esteemed a most valuable possession by people whose ordinary domestic furniture consisted chiefly of seal-skin bowls and shallow stone dishes.|$|R
