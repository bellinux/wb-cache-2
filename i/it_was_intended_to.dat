5|$|In 1924, Los Angeles imposed height {{restrictions}} {{throughout the}} city, effectively prohibiting {{the construction of}} any building taller than Los Angeles City Hall (454ft/138 m). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> address local concerns about growing congestion and overdevelopment at the time.

5|$|Maverick Hunter is the codename for a {{cancelled}} first-person shooter {{video game}} in the Mega Man franchise {{that would have been}} developed by Armature Studio and published by Capcom. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be a darker entry in the Mega Man X series. Mega Man artist and producer Keiji Inafune was responsible for establishing the western-designed game and Adi Granov was responsible for X's new design. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be the first of a trilogy of games, where players controlled its protagonist X {{in the first two games}} and then as Zero for the third. The game would have had similar platform elements found in earlier Mega Man X titles. It had a lifespan of about six months in 2010 before it was ultimately cancelled due to the aforementioned internal disagreements around the same time as Inafune departed from Capcom and other Mega Man titles were cancelled.|$|E

5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month.

5|$|Despite {{the engine}} issues, the SO2U-1 was {{considered}} overall {{to be superior}} to the competing Curtiss XSO3C-1; however, Vought's production capacity was already taken up by manufacture of the OS2U Kingfisher scout and F4U Corsair fighter. As a result, the XSO3C was declared {{the winner of the}} contract, and was ordered into production. Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy, and Seamew by the Royal Navy, the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service, and was retired before the SOC biplane which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> replace.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E
