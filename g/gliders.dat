5|$|However, landing paratroopers, and {{especially}} <b>gliders,</b> without {{the cover of}} darkness left them exceedingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The official history of the British Airborne Divisions highlights {{the cost of this}} trade-off, stating that of the 416 <b>gliders</b> that landed, only 88 remained undamaged by enemy fire, and that between 20–30percent of the glider pilots were casualties. Another historian argues that the <b>gliders</b> landing in daylight was a calamity, with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment having two-thirds of their <b>gliders</b> hit by ground fire and suffering heavy casualties as they landed. The casualty rates were worsened by the slow rates of release and descent of the <b>gliders</b> themselves, and the fact that each aircraft towed two <b>gliders,</b> slowing them even further; as the time to release a glider unit was 3–4 times longer than a parachute unit, the <b>gliders</b> were vulnerable to flak.|$|E

5|$|All {{but one of}} the ten <b>gliders</b> {{carrying}} the airborne troops assigned to Group Iron were able to land next to their objective, the bridge at Kanne. Due to a navigation error by the pilots of the transport aircraft towing the <b>gliders,</b> one of the <b>gliders</b> was dropped in the wrong area. The other nine <b>gliders</b> were towed through heavy anti-aircraft fire and released at 05:35. As the <b>gliders</b> began to descend towards their objective, the bridge was destroyed by several demolition explosions set off by the Belgian garrison. Unlike the garrisons of the other two bridges, the Belgian defenders at Kanne had been forewarned, as the German mechanized column heading for the bridge to reinforce Group Iron arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Its appearance ruined any chance of a surprise assault and gave the defenders sufficient time to destroy the bridge. As the <b>gliders</b> came in to land, one was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into the ground killing most of the occupants. The remaining eight landed successfully, and the airborne troops stormed the Belgian positions and eliminated the defenders.|$|E

5|$|For {{reasons of}} security, Sturmabteilung Koch was {{dispersed}} around several {{locations in the}} Rhineland until it received orders for the operation against Fort Eben-Emael and the three bridges to begin. Preliminary orders were received on 9 May, ordering the separated detachments {{to move to a}} pre-arranged concentration area, and shortly afterwards a second order arrived, informing the assault force that Fall Gelb was to begin at 05:25 on 10 May. At 04:30, forty-two <b>gliders</b> carrying the 493 airborne troops that formed the assault force were lifted off from two airfields in Cologne, the armada of <b>gliders</b> and transport aircraft turning south towards their objectives. The aircraft maintained strict radio silence, forcing the pilots to rely on a chain of signal fires that pointed towards Belgium; the radio silence also ensured that senior commanders of the assault force could not be informed that the tow-ropes on one of the <b>gliders</b> had snapped, forcing the glider to land inside Germany. The pilot of a second glider released his tow-rope prematurely, and was unable to land near its objective. Both <b>gliders</b> were carrying troops assigned to Group Granite and were destined to assault Fort Eben-Emael, thereby leaving the group understrength; it also left it under the command of Oberleutnant Witzig's second-in-command, as Witzig was in one of the <b>gliders</b> forced to land. The remaining <b>gliders</b> were released from their tow-ropes twenty miles away from their objectives at an altitude of , which was deemed high enough for the <b>gliders</b> to land by the three bridges and on top of the fort, and also maintain a steep dive angle to further ensure they landed correctly. After the Ju-52's released the <b>gliders</b> and began turning away, Belgian anti-aircraft artillery positions detected them and opened fire. This alerted the defences in the area to the presence of the <b>gliders.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered <b>gliders</b> are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a safety margin for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered <b>gliders</b> may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered <b>gliders</b> will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — An {{underwater}} <b>glider</b> {{is a type}} of an unmanned {{underwater vehicle}} (UUV). The movement of an underwater <b>glider</b> in the water is based on the buoyancy-propelled for float and fixed-winged for stabilizing the <b>glider’s</b> body. However, a fixed wing underwater <b>glider</b> has limitation to avoid hitting the obstacle in front of it. To overcome this problem, the application of fin system in underwater <b>glider</b> is needed. In this project, a methodology was introduced which is design a flexible fin system of an underwater <b>glider</b> for obstacle avoidance purpose. This final year project mainly focused on SolidWorks’s simulation and analysis of- 30 °,- 45 °,- 60 ° for submerge and rise up at 30 °, 45 °, 60 ° to get the most suitable angle for the <b>glider’s</b> fin system to submerge and rise up. The UTeM underwater <b>glider</b> is modified from fixed to flexible wing. Hence, Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) is used to program the movement of the <b>glider’s</b> wings for upward at 45 °and downward at- 45 °in the water. Thus, a flexible fin system for obstacle avoidance is designed and applied in UTeM underwater <b>glider.</b> Index Terms—Underwater <b>glider,</b> fin system, obstacle avoidance. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the dynamic model and motion simulation for propeller-driven USM underwater <b>glider</b> with independently controllable wings and rudder. The underwater <b>glider</b> {{is a highly}} efficient autonomous underwater vehicle which glides through the ocean water column in saw-tooth pattern. It uses buoyancy for propulsion by controlling ballast pump and internal moving mass. However, in our research work, we attempt to design an underwater <b>glider</b> which can be driven by buoyancy or propeller, and the external actuators (wings and rudder) can be controlled independently. We have designed the mathematical model and studied the dynamic characteristics of USM underwater <b>glider.</b> The simulation results demonstrate the motion of propeller-driven USM underwater <b>glider</b> based on different angles of wings and rudder. The results show the position of <b>glider,</b> linear and angular velocities of the <b>glider,</b> angle of attack and <b>glider</b> speed. With the resulting <b>glider</b> behavior in this open loop control output, we will extend the control approach {{in order to create}} an efficient biologically inspired control algorithm for an optimized hybrid-driven USM underwater <b>glider...</b>|$|R
