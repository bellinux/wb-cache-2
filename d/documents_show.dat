5|$|British <b>documents</b> <b>show</b> {{that the}} British {{government}} was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused {{about whether or}} not to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.|$|E

5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary <b>documents</b> <b>show</b> that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Declassified wartime <b>documents</b> <b>show</b> that Simonds, {{along with}} several others in the Allied high command, had likely been {{notified}} on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with {{the lives of his}} men. Terry Copp and John A. English, wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made.|$|E
5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the <b>documents</b> <b>show</b> torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E

5|$|No prototypes for the {{painting}} are known in Sweden, and while {{the painting}} is occasionally associated with the Danube school, much about its stylistic and iconographic history remains to be investigated. A possible stylistic prototype is the illustrated Bible of Erhard Altdorfer (brother of the more famous Albrecht Altdorfer). Begun in 1530, it {{was inspired by the}} works of Cranach and Dürer, but also renewed the genre by combining commonplace details with an undertone of approaching disaster. In particular, Altdorfer's apocalyptic illustrations for the Revelation to John deliver an evangelic message {{similar to that of the}} Vädersolstavlan. Historical <b>documents</b> <b>show</b> that Olaus Petri, who commissioned the painting, combined biblical quotations related to the Apocalypse with the painting hanging in the church. Copies of Erhard Altdorfer's apocalyptic woodcuts may have been available in Stockholm through the German merchant Gorius Holste who lived by Järntorget square and who was a friend of both Petri and Martin Luther.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{controversy}} surrounding Welter's claims for success in nocturnal aerial combat with the Me 262 stems from a memorandum written by Welter on 29 May 1945 for his British captors. In this memorandum Welter stated that between December 1944 {{and the end of}} January 1945, as the sole pilot of Kommando Welter, he flew seven Me 262 sorties and achieved three victories against Mosquito aircraft and two victories against Lancaster aircraft. Welter further stated that from the formation of 10./NJG11 on 28 January 1945 {{to the end of the}} war, 10./NJG11 flew around another 63 operational sorties and claimed a further 38 victories against Mosquito aircraft at night and five victories against Mosquito aircraft by day; his share being 20 Mosquitos at night and two during the day. Thus, according to the memo, a total of 25 Mosquitoes and two Lancasters were claimed in aerial combat by Welter, flying the Me 262 with the Kommando/Staffel, while other pilots of the Staffel claimed a further 21 kills (of which three were achieved with the two-seater Me 262). Official Luftwaffe <b>documents</b> <b>show</b> that by 4 April 1945, 10./NJG11 had claimed 34 aerial victories, of which only one was claimed in a two-seater Me262. Research of RAF records show that at most 15 Mosquitoes could have been possibly destroyed by Kommando Welter—10./NJG11.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court <b>documents</b> <b>show</b> that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E
