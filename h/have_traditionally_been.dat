5|$|Stauromedusae, small sessile cnidarians with stalks and no medusa stage, <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> {{classified}} {{as members of}} the Scyphozoa, but recent research suggests they should be regarded as a separate class, Staurozoa.|$|E
5|$|They have a docile {{temperament}} and the milk {{has a high}} butterfat content, so <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> used as house cows. They are generally good-natured animals but very protective of their young.|$|E

5|$|Buttons <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> {{made from}} a variety of {{freshwater}} and marine shells. At first they were used decoratively rather than as fasteners and the earliest known example dates back five thousand years and was found at Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley.|$|E
5|$|Leek's home colours <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> all blue, {{and their}} away colours all yellow, both colours which reflect the town's coat of arms, which is {{predominantly}} blue and gold. The club has also used {{a blue and}} white kit {{similar to that of}} Blackburn Rovers, and a red and black away kit.|$|E
5|$|Winter sports <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> {{second to}} summer pursuits in Australian {{sporting}} culture, but interest and {{support in the}} former has grown. The decision-making bodies of the Australian Olympic Federation (AOF) allowed winter sports to be represented, but their representatives were usually overruled by their summer counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> {{considered}} {{most closely}} related to the tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E
5|$|Mercury dissolves {{many other}} metals such as {{gold and silver}} to form amalgams. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> used to trade mercury. Several other first row {{transition}} metals {{with the exception of}} manganese, copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October 2014, Key {{created a}} new ministerial {{portfolio}} called the Minister of National Security and Intelligence to serve the newly established Cabinet National Security Committee. The Prime Minister assumed the new portfolio while the Attorney General Christopher Finlayson became Minister Responsible for the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) and Minister in Charge of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS), portfolios which <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> held by a prime minister.|$|E

5|$|The second-largest {{denomination}} is the Community of Christ (first {{named the}} Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) from 1872 to 2001), a Missouri-based, 250,000-member denomination. Though {{members of this}} church <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> called Latter Day Saints (without the hyphen), the Community of Christ has more recently stated that it rejects {{the use of the}} term Saints as a designation for its members in any official reference or publication.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, she {{was ranked}} sixth {{among women in}} the prize money year-end rankings {{with a total of}} $36,251 in earnings. That year, she won the May 1420, 2006 BCA Open Nine-ball Championship women's division, {{defeating}} the UK's Allison Fisher and earning $20,000. She has competed in what <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> regarded as men's tournaments, especially while participating in the EuroTour. She placed 5th in the men's World Straight Pool Championship in 2006, which was won by Thorsten Hohmann. She also finished 3rd in the women's World Pool 10-ball Championship in Manila, Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Like sponges and cnidarians, ctenophores {{have two}} main layers of cells that {{sandwich}} a middle layer of jelly-like material, {{which is called}} the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence ctenophores and cnidarians <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell layer, {{and as a result}} some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, while others still regard them as diploblastic.|$|E

5|$|London {{has been}} the setting for many works of literature. The {{literary}} centres of London <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers {{closely associated with the}} city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, {{regarded as one of the}} foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E

50|$|Though a non-partisan office, in {{territorial}} {{days the}} office of Attorney General <b>has</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> appointed from the political party of the sitting President of the United States who appoints the territorial governor.

5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> puritanical genres {{aimed at a}} male readership, and can be more {{restricted}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} techniques <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> applied {{exclusively to}} proteins, {{as the primary}} biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales <b>have</b> <b>traditionally</b> <b>been</b> {{used by the}} {{indigenous}} peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the North Atlantic right whale is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean acidification. It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They have rarely been kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members {{of one of the}} smallest species.|$|E
