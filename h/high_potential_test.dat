50|$|Electrical safety {{testing is}} {{essential}} to ensure safe operating standards for any product that uses electricity. Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide. In most markets it is mandatory for a product to conform to safety standards promulgated by safety and standard agencies such as UL, CE, VDE, CSA, BSI, CCC and so on. To conform to such standards, the product must pass safety tests such as the high voltage test (also called as Dielectric voltage-withstand test or <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> <b>test),</b> Insulation Resistance Test, Ground (Earth) Bond & Ground Continuity Test & Leakage Current Test (also called as Line Leakage Test, Earth Leakage Current Test, Enclosure Leakage Current Test or Patient Leakage Current Test). These tests are described in IEC 60335, IEC 61010 and many other national and international standards.|$|E

A. c. power frequency tests are becoming common, but such tests are difficult because of the large kVAr requirement to charge the stator insulation capacitance.

Recently the authors were required to test a stator with just over 1 㯀F in capacitance to a test voltage of 32 kV, requiring a single-phase controllable high voltage source rated to 286 kVAr prior to considering losses. It is not easy to locate a distribution board to supply this at a power-station site. Resonant circuits are normally applied to complete these tests and minimise the distribution board loadings.

The system {{consists of two}} radial bearings, one thrust bearing, two radial catcher bearings and one motor. The purpose {{of this research is}} to develop one of the critical components of the system, namely, the High Temperature Permanent Magnet motor. A novel High Temperature Permanent Magnet (HTPM) Brushless DC(BLDC) motor capable of operating at 1000 degrees F (538 degrees C) is designed. HTPMs developed at Electron Energy Corporation are buried into the rotor. The high temperature motor is designed to produce 5. 1 kw of power at a top running speed of 20000 rpm. The numerical values of the motor voltage, power and torque output are predicted from calculations of the nonlinear finite element model of the motor. The motor stator is wound, potted, cured and <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tested</b> at 1000 degrees F. A servo amplifier from Advanced Motion Control is used to drive the high temperature motor. High temperature displacement sensors are set up for sensing the rotor position to form a closed loop motion control.

Measurement of absolute concentrations of selected biomarkers indicates that changes in biomarker ratios reflect synthesis of new material rather than selective destruction.

In this study, humanized-camel VHHs to genotype 3 a HCV serine protease were produced and were linked molecularly to a cell penetrating peptide, penetratin (PEN). Human hepatic (Huh 7) cells transfected with the JFH- 1 RNA of HCV genotype 2 a and treated with the cell penetrable nanobodies (transbodies) had a marked reduction of the HCV RNA intracellularly and in their culture fluids, less HCV foci inside the cells and less amounts of HCV core antigen in culture supernatants compared with the infected cells cultured in the medium alone. The PEN-VHH-treated-transfected cells also had up-regulation of the genes coding for the host innate immune response (TRIF, TRAF 3, IRF 3, IL- 28 B and IFN-β), indicating that the cell penetrable nanobodies rescued the host innate immune response from the HCV mediated-suppression. Computerized intermolecular docking revealed that the VHHs bound to residues of the protease catalytic triad, oxyanion loop and/or the NS 3 N-terminal portion important for non-covalent binding of the NS 4 A protease cofactor protein.

Selective oxidation of sulphides is a straightforward method of preparation of organic sulphoxides and sulphones, which are important chemical intermediates and building blocks of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Oxidation of methylphenyl sulphide (MPS), diphenyl sulphide (Ph 2 S), and dibenzothiophene (DBTH) over lamellar titanosilicate catalysts with the MFI and UTL-derived topology was investigated with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Lamellar titanosilicates combine the advantages of crystalline zeolites and mesoporous molecular sieves due to accessible active sites located on the external surface of their layers.

A methylphenyl sulphoxide selectivity of 95 % at 40 % conversion was achieved using the Ti-IPC- 1 -PI catalyst together with an outstanding TONtot = 1418 after 30 min.

It {{has been shown that}} circulating fluidized bed combustion of semicoke could be a promising technology allowing utilization of its <b>high</b> residual energy <b>potential.</b> <b>Tests</b> in combustion of pure semicoke and semicoke with a small addition of oil shale (up to 20 %) were carried out using a fluidized bed device with a thermal capacity of 50 kWth. The main parameters of combustion process and the additional heat produced were determined and calculated. The experiments indicated that semicoke with low moisture content (below 10 %) could be burnt in fluidized bed without adding of oil shale. For the combustion of semicoke with higher moisture content (over 10 %) about 10 % of oil shale must be added. One possibility for utilizing residual carbon present in semicoke could also be production of carbon-rich materials in order to obtain, for example, activated carbon. A series of experiments accompanied by SEM X-Ray and EDAX analysis was carried out in order to elucidate the distribution of carbon and mineral part in semicoke and to find possibilities for their separation and subsequent enrichment. Different separation methods – selective grinding and subsequent screening, pneumatic separation and triboelectroseparation method were analyzed. It was shown that due to close integration of mineral and organic part in semicoke, the separation of carbon-rich ingredients by the methods used was not enough effective to obtain enriched products suitable for the production of activated carbon...|$|R

Two low mid-point redox potential electron carriers, cytochrome c' and cytochrome c, are detected. A <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> iron-sulfur protein is the only <b>high</b> mid-point redox <b>potential</b> electron transfer component present in the periplasm. Analysis of light-induced absorption changes shows that this <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> iron-sulfur protein acts in vivo as efficient electron donor to the photo-oxidized <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> heme of the Ectothiorhodospira sp. reaction center...|$|R
40|$|Test {{selection}} in psychological assessment is guided, both explicitly and implicitly, by how informative tests are {{with regard to}} a trait of interest. Most existing formulations of test information are sensitive to subpopulation variation, {{with the result that}} test information will vary from sample to sample. Recently, measures of test information have been developed that quantify the potential informativeness of the test. These indices are defined by the properties of the test, as distinct from the properties of the sample or examinee. As of yet, however, measures of potential information have been developed only for unidimensional tests. In practice, psychological tests are often multidimensional. Furthermore, multidimensional tests are often used to estimate one specific trait among many. This study develops measures of <b>potential</b> <b>test</b> information for multidimensional tests, as well as measures of marginal <b>potential</b> <b>test</b> information [...] -test information with regard to one trait within a multidimensional test. In Study 1, the performance of the metrics was tested in data simulated from unidimensional, first-order multidimensional, second-order, and bifactor models. In Study 2, measures of marginal and multidimensional <b>potential</b> <b>test</b> information are applied to a set of neuropsychological data collected as part of Rush University 2 ̆ 7 s Memory and Aging Project. In simulated data, marginal and multidimensional <b>potential</b> <b>test</b> information were sensitive to the changing dimensionality of the test. In observed neuropsychological data, five traits were identified. Verbal abilities were most closely correlated with probable dementia. Both indices of marginal <b>potential</b> <b>test</b> information identify the Mini Mental Status Exam as the best measure of that trait. More broadly, greater marginal <b>potential</b> <b>test</b> information calculated with regard to verbal abilities was associated with greater criterion validity. These measures allow for the direct comparison of two multidimensional tests that assess the same trait, facilitating test selection and improving the precision and validity of psychological assessment...|$|R
