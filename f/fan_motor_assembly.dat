An electronically controlled proportional valve is located in the gas conduit. A <b>fan</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>assembly</b> are in the enclosure for distributing heated air from the burner when gas is communicated through the conduit and to the burner for combustion. A control system and a PC interface of a PC are located in the support enclosure to receive a data processing card having a predetermined temperature set point relating to temperature conditions within the building. A control means comprises a part of the control system and is connected to the PC to be responsive to temperature sensors in the building to cause or cease ignition of gas at the burner when any of the temperature conditions in the building varied with the predetermined temperature set point to permit the production of heat by the burner to automatically bring the varied temperature conditions in the building back towards the temperature of the predetermined temperature set point...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{presents}} work {{is based}} on the working of dryers, the basic aim of this experiment is to design a dryer which meets the basic requirements of dryer which are improved by a modification in the design of indirect forced solar dryer. The concept behind the construction of a dryer is energy conservation and food preservation by the moisture removal process in solar dryer. In this experiment the dryer which is designed works by using solar energy as well as electrical energy that is why the name of the dryer is ‘Hybrid Solar Dryer’. In this hybrid solar dryer a recirculating duct is added from the <b>motor</b> <b>fan</b> <b>assembly</b> to the drying chamber that the hot air which goes through the passage of air flow that is firstly hot air passes through the rectangular duct then in divergent duct and finally reaches in the drying chamber but in between them some amount of hot is wasted but by the recirculating duct this air is reutilized for heating the food product in drying chamber. After working on this dryer the drying time reduces, drying rate increases,removal rate of moisture content increases in comparison to indirect solar dryer without air recirculation.

40|$|Abstract − In {{order to}} provide a low cost system of thermal comfort, a common model of home fan, 40 cm {{diameter}} size, had its manual four-button control system replaced by an automatic speed control. The new control system has a temperature sensor feeding a microcontroller that, by using an optic coupling, DIAC or TRIAC-based circuit, varies the RMS value of the <b>fan</b> <b>motor</b> input voltage and its speed, according to the room temperature. Over {{a wide range of}} velocity, the fan net power and the <b>motor</b> <b>fan</b> input power were measured working under both control system. The temperature of the motor stator and the voltage waveforms were observed too. Measured values analysis showed that the TRIAC-based control system makes the <b>fan</b> <b>motor</b> work at a very low power factor and efficiency values. The worst case is at low velocity range where the higher <b>fan</b> <b>motor</b> stator temperatures were registered. The poor power factor and efficiency and the harmonics signals inserted in the motor input voltage wave by the TRIAC commutation procedure are correlated...|$|R

40|$|Evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> used in {{commercial}} refrigeration applications are fractional horsepower in size, {{are responsible for}} moving air across the evaporator coil, and typically run at one speed. Historically, shaded-pole motors {{have been the most}} commonly used evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> {{in commercial}} refrigeration equipment and beverage vending machines. These motors, a type of single-phase AC induction motor, are the simplest and least expensive type of fractional-horsepower motor. They are also the least efficient, with the common 9 â€“ 12 W sizes exhibiting an efficiency of approximately 20 %. Electronically commutated (EC) motors, also known as brushless DC motors, became widely commercialized in the late 1980 s, and their use in commercial refrigeration applications has increased within the last 10 to 15 years because of economic incentives and regulatory requirements. Another motor type, the permanent split capacitor (PSC) motor, offers a mid-point between shaded-pole and EC motor price and efficiency levels. Typically for commercial refrigeration evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motor</b> applications, EC motors are 66 % efficient and PSC motors are usually about 29 % efficient. Â A new motor technology, a type of permanent magnet synchronous AC motor that can directly use grid-supplied AC current without the need to rectify to DC, has recently been commercialized. This new motor has the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption of evaporator fans in commercial refrigeration equipment. Previously, synchronous motors have been prohibitively expensive for evaporator fan applications because of the high cost of the electronic control circuit that is required to bring the synchronous motor up to synchronous speed. However, this new motor technology makes use of a novel patent-pending controller that is simpler and lower in cost than previous synchronous motor controllers or EC motor controllers, making the new motor a cost-effective alternative in the commercial refrigeration market. Â In this paper, the results of field demonstrations, consisting of side-by-side measurements of the power consumption of the new motor technology versus shaded-pole, PSC, or EC evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> in identical refrigerated display cases, are presented. Measured quantities include <b>fan</b> <b>motor</b> power, current, and power factor, as well as display case discharge and return air temperatures and ambient store temperature. Currently, field demonstrations are being conducted at six supermarkets and commissaries located in Kansas City, MO, San Antonio, TX and San Diego, CA, with the duration of these tests ranging from approximately one month to over six months. Initial results from the field demonstrations indicate that the new synchronous AC motor technology is approximately 20 to 30 % more energy efficient than existing EC motors and nearly 80 % more energy efficient than shaded-pole motors. In addition, the new motor exhibits a power factor of approximately 0. 86, which is on average 40 % greater than that of existing evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors.</b> Analyses indicate that retrofitting the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> with the new motors would produce a 68 % evaporator fan site energy savings, or 4. 9 Ã— 109 Â kWh/year for the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors.</b> This would result in an annual cost savings of $ 516 million and reduce the annual CO 2 equivalent emissions by 8. 1 Ã— 109 Â lb...|$|R
