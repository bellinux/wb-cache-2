50|$|The {{more common}} {{species in the}} area include Pinus elliottii (Slash Pine), Myrica rubra (the Strawberry Tree), Schefflera octophylla (the Ivy Tree), Reevesia thyrsoidea (Reevesia), Phyllostachys aurea (<b>Fishpole</b> Bamboo), Enkianthus quinqueflorus (the Lunar New Year Bellflower) and species of Melastoma.|$|E
50|$|Phyllostachys aurea is {{a bamboo}} {{species of the}} 'running bamboo' type, {{belonging}} to the diverse Bambuseae tribe. It is native to Fujian and Zhejiang in China. It is commonly known by the names <b>fishpole</b> bamboo, golden bamboo, monk's belly bamboo and fairyland bamboo (Australia).|$|E
50|$|Bow {{was unable}} {{to get used to}} the {{microphone}}s. During her first line, the microphone reportedly exploded, which caused a technical problem at the studio. As Bow was very nervous about the new sound generation system, Arzner tried to comfort her by devising what is reputed to be the first <b>fishpole</b> microphone to allow flexibility of placement. Bow thereby had the freedom to move while filming.|$|E
60|$|While he was {{skinning}} {{the moose}} I proceeded to ascertain {{what kind of}} fishes were {{to be found in}} the sluggish and muddy outlet. The greatest difficulty was to find a pole. It was almost impossible to find a slender, straight pole ten or twelve feet long in those woods. You might search half an hour in vain. They are commonly spruce, arbor-vit√¶, fir, etc., short, stout, and branchy, and do not make good <b>fishpoles,</b> even after you have patiently cut off all their tough and scraggy branches. The fishes were red perch and chivin.|$|R
50|$|Chippewa Moraine Lakes is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area that {{comprises}} nine separate sites, {{spread out}} over roughly 30 square miles (78 km2). Each site features a primarily undisturbed lake located within the rough terminal moraine topography of northern Chippewa County. Each lake has its own unique species assemblage due to physical and chemical characteristics of the lake. The nine lakes are: Camp Lake, a 6-acre (2.4 ha) lake ringed by a floating sphagnum bog mat containing such plant species as white beak rush, narrow-leaved sundew, small cranberry, and grass pink orchid. Spence Lake, a 12-acre (4.9 ha), acidic bog lake that is the headwaters of Foster Creek. Conifer swamp surrounds {{the northern part of}} the lake, hardwood swamp surrounds the central part, while the southern part is largely a sedge meadow, impacted by beaver activity. Bass Lake #1, a 6-acre (2.4 ha) soft-water seepage lake, with at least one rare plant species present. Bass Lake #5, an 8-acre (3.2 ha), deep, hard-water seepage lake that is the main headwaters branch of Mud Creek. Deer Lake, a 6-acre (2.4 ha) seepage lake that is also part of the headwaters of Mud Creek. Burnt Wagon Lake, a 15-acre (6.1 ha) softwater seepage lake that is landlocked, with no development. <b>Fishpole</b> Lake, an 11-acre (4.5 ha) meromictic lake. Due to its size, shape, and depth, the lake's water column is permanently thermally stratified, unlike most Wisconsin lakes, leading to unique chemical and biological characteristics. Plummer Lake, a 41-acre (16.6 ha), deep, hard-water seepage lake. Little Plummer Lake, a 10-acre (4 ha) wild (no access roads or development) hardwater seepage lake that drains into Plummer Lake.|$|E
40|$|Shapes, motions, {{and forces}} {{developed}} in lamellipodia and ruffles at the leading edges of primary chick embryo heart fibroblasts {{were characterized by}} differential interference contrast microscopy and digital video enhancement techniques. The initial extension of the cell edge to form a thin, planar lamellipodium parallel to the substrate surface was analyzed in two dimensions with temporal and spatial resolution of 3 s and 0. 2 micron, respectively. An extension begins and ends with brief, rapid acceleration and deceleration separated by {{a long period of}} nearly constant velocity in the range of 4 - 7 microns/min. Extensions and retractions were initiated randomly over time. As demonstrated by optical sectioning microscopy, the extended lamellipodia formed ruffles by sharply bending upward at hinge points 2 - 4 microns behind their tips. Surprisingly, ruffles continued to grow in length at the same average rate after bending upward. They maintained a straight shape in vertical cross section, suggesting the ruffles were mechanically stiff. The forces required to bend ruffles of these cells and of BC 3 H 1 cells were measured by pushing a thin quartz <b>fishpole</b> probe against the tip of a ruffle 7 - 10 microns from its base either toward or away {{from the center of the}} cell. Force was determined by measuring the bending of the probe monitored by video microscopy. Typically the probe forced the ruffle to swing rigidly in an arc about an apparent hinge at is base, and ruffles rapidly, and almost completely, recovered their shape when the probe was removed. Hence, ruffles appeared to be relatively stiff and to resist bending with forces more elastic than viscous, unlike the cell body. Ruffles on both types of cells resisted bending with forces of 15 - 30 mudyn/microns of displacement at their tips when pushed toward or away from the cell center. The significance of the observations for mechanisms of cell locomotion is discussed...|$|E
