50|$|<b>Foam-in-place</b> {{is another}} method of using {{polyurethane}} foams. These fill the box, fully encapsulating {{the product to}} immobilize it. It {{is also used to}} form engineered structures.|$|E
50|$|Unlike many <b>foam-in-place</b> {{polyurethane}} foams, it is nonflammable and non-toxic. As it is water-based, it offgasses {{water vapour}} while curing, requiring ventilation {{and in some}} cases an dehumidifier. It cures more slowly than organic foams. However, it does not offgas volatile organic compounds as many organic foams do. Like cement, it is water-soluble until cured, but after curing it is water-resistant, but water-permeable.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of techniques for {{the preparation of}} Pyrrone structural foams for use as honeycomb filler is described. The feasibility of preparing foams from polymers formed by the condensation of 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine (DAB), or 3, 3 ', 4, 4 '-tetraaminobenzophenone (TABP), with 3, 3 ', 4, 4 '-benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) was investigated. Initially, most of the effort was devoted to preparing Pyrrone prepolymers with improved and more reproducible foaming properties for making chemically blown foams. When {{it became apparent that}} very high curing shrinkages would not allow the use of unfilled Pyrrone prepolymers in a <b>foam-in-place</b> process, emphasis was shifted from chemically blown foams to syntactic foams. Syntactic foam formulations containing hollow carbon microspheres were developed. Syntactic foams made from selected formulations were found to have very low coefficients of thermal expansion. A technique was developed for the emplacement of Pyrrone syntactic foam formulations in honeycomb core structures. "NASA CR- 2222. "Performing organization report no. : P 72 - 294. "March 1973.
