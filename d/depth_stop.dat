50|$|Transmission was 8 speed {{through a}} single clutch with {{the option of}} the Allis-Chalmers half shaft clutch to achieve 'live' power take-off. Converging three point linkage was powered by an engine mounted {{hydraulic}} pump giving hydraulic power whenever the engine was running regardless of transmission status. An hydraulic weight transfer system was built in to increase traction and a simple mechanical <b>depth</b> <b>stop</b> was provided on the earlier machines. Later machines, introduced mid-1963 and called 'Depthomatic' had a draught and position control system. Other modifications and options included improved gear ratios; a pick-up hitch; an increase in power through higher maximum revs and revised battery arrangement. An option on both models was the patent Allis-Chalmers PAVT rear wheels (Power Adjusted Variable Track),a system adopted by other manufacturers after patents expired. Production ended in 1968 and quite a few are still in use on farms in 2011. A few ED40s were exported to the USA. It's hard to say exactly how many {{made it to the}} US, but it seems most of them ended up in the Mid-Atlantic and South Eastern regions.|$|E

5000|$|Small (c. 1/4" [...] diameter) {{threaded}} {{drill bits}} and countersinks {{are common in}} aircraft metal work. Threaded drill bits may be held in drills meant to reach into very tight spaces, and threaded countersink cutters are widely used (along with finely adjustable <b>depth</b> <b>stops)</b> to create holes which put a matching rivet directly flush with the surface.|$|R
50|$|A third type also exists, {{a lighter}} machine, called a mill-drill, {{which is a}} close {{relative}} of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists. A mill-drill is similar in basic configuration to a small drill press, but equipped with an X-Y table. They also typically use more powerful motors than a comparably sized drill press, with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a drill press {{to deal with the}} lateral loading on the spindle that is created by a milling operation. A mill drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often on a dovetailed vertical, where a drill press motor remains stationary, while the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar. Other differences that separate a mill-drill from a drill press may be a fine tuning adjustment for the Z-axis, a more precise <b>depth</b> <b>stop,</b> the capability to lock the X, Y or Z axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting. Aside from size and precision, the principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled in basically the same fashion as drill press, where a larger vertical or knee mill has a vertically fixed milling head, and changes the X-Y table elevation. As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck, rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts collets. These are frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints and modest price tags.|$|E
40|$|Professor and Chairman, Department of Restorative Dental Sciences, and Head, Division of Fixed Prosthodontics, King Saud University College of Oenfetry, P. O. Box 60169, Riyadh 11545, Saudi ArabiaThe dentist must {{determine}} the gingival location and configuration of finish line during tooth preparation. Rotary instruments are selected to prepare teeth {{and to develop}} a well-defined smooth and uniform finish line. Subgingival finish lines damage and traumatize gingival tissues due to the contact with rotary or dental instruments used during preparation. Crown tooth junction enhance plaque accumulation and its harmful effect on the periodontium. Subgingival crown margins are difficult to clean, and the relation between gingival tissue and restoration can never be the same as with natural tooth. Supragingival margins that are fully exposed to cleaning action are easier to prepare and biologically acceptable. The efficacy of conventional diamond cutting instruments when used with high or low speed handpieces as compared to the Mohiddin R. Dimashkieh (MRD) rotary cutting instruments are reviewed. Conventional instruments may produce inaccurate finish lines or may remove more tooth structure than required and traumatize the gingival tissue due to doubtful running handpiece and operator’s ill judgement that half of the diameter of the conventional bur is outside the contour of the tooth during preparation. On the other hand the use of MRD instruments, designed by the author, with its <b>depth</b> <b>stop</b> tip and safe end will ensure that only half of the instrument will be embedded in the tooth, giving control of adequate and uniform tooth reduction and gingival safety...|$|E
40|$|The {{sampling}} of brain tissue in veterinary medicine usually underlies a freehand performance without exact localization. The {{aim of the}} project was the accuracy evaluation of a 3 D-printed subject specific system for brain biopsy in dogs. At the beginning of the procedure, three small bone screws were fixed (bilateral and occipital/frontal) to the dog skull. Subsequently, three MR-markers filled with contrast agent were adapted and MRI scans performed (layer-thickness 1. 0 mm). Within the MR images the coordinates of the target and entry point are determined by the surgeon. For evaluation an additional pre-CT (layer-thickness 0. 7 mm) was realized. After image recording the MR-markers were removed. Due to a self-made algorithm a patient individual template was constructed. The final biopsy device made of ABS M 30 was produced by a 3 D printer (FDM). To perform the biopsy the device was connected with the already embedded bone screws. Through a guidance track the skull was minimally invasive accessed at the intended location. Controlled by a <b>depth</b> <b>stop</b> the biopsy needle could be exactly moved in a desired direction up to the target point. A further post-CT (thickness 0. 7 mm) with inserted needle was performed to determine the final position of the biopsy needle tip. For receiving information about the difference between preoperative planned and achieved tip position the pre-CT was matched with the post-CT. Therefor 10 dog cadavers (n= 20 target points) were applied. The results showed an accuracy of 0. 58 mm ± 0. 34 mm (ranging from 0. 09 mm to 1. 17 mm) between the preoperative planned and the achieved needle position. A patient specific 3 D-printed biopsy system based on MR images was developed which enables a high precise brain biopsy. Moreover, the system matches up to current costly diagnosis techniques of image-guided neurosurgery and robot systems. Prospectively, it shall be transferred to human medicine...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the recent}} {{years we have}} {{performed}} various experiments on the collision dynamics of highly porous dust aggregates and although {{we now have a}} comprehensive picture of the micromechanics of those aggregates, the macroscopic understanding is still lacking. We are therefore developing a mechanical model to describe dust aggregate collisions with macroscopic parameters like tensile strength, compressive strength and shear strength. For one well defined dust sample material, the tensile and compressive strength were measured in a static experiment and implemented in a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. A laboratory experiment was designed to compare the laboratory results with the results of the SPH simulation. In this experiment, a mm-sized glass bead is dropped into a cm-sized dust aggregate with the previously measured strength parameters. We determine the deceleration of the glass bead by high-speed imaging and the compression of the dust aggregate by x-ray micro-tomography. The measured penetration <b>depth,</b> <b>stopping</b> time and compaction under the glass bead are utilized to calibrate and test the SPH code. We find that the statically measured compressive strength curve is only applicable if we adjust it to the dynamic situation with a “softness ” parameter. After determining this parameter, the SPH code is capable of reproducing experimental results, which have not been used for the calibration before...|$|R

40|$|Cyclotron line {{features}} {{from the}} polar cap plasmas of accreting magnetized neutron stars are modeled. The polar cap environment is modeled by a homogeneous isothermal plane-parallel slab threaded by a uniform superstrong magnetic field oriented orthogonal to the slab. Two physical cyclotron photon source functions are used. For conventional <b>stopping</b> <b>depths,</b> the emergent line spectra are fairly {{independent of the}} source functions. For hot atmospheres {{the details of the}} line transfer using relativistic kinematics differ substantially from those using nonrelativistic kinematics. Aside from finite recoil, both a finite natural linewidth and conventional <b>stopping</b> <b>depths</b> suppress the escape of photons blueward of line center and potential line features tend to be smeared out into the low-energy continuum.

50|$|The surface {{supplied}} diver {{is informed}} of the requirement for decompression stops, {{and if they are}} needed, the depths and durations of the stops, by the diving supervisor, who uses decompression tables, or software planning tools. The ascent is made at the recommended rate until the diver reaches the depth of the first stop. The diver then maintains the specified <b>stop</b> <b>depth</b> for the specified period, before ascending to the next <b>stop</b> <b>depth</b> at the recommended rate, and follows the same procedure again. This is repeated until all required decompression has been completed and the diver reaches the surface. Once on the surface the diver will continue to eliminate inert gas until the concentrations have returned to normal surface saturation, which can take several hours, and is considered in some models to be effectively complete after 12 hours, and by others to take up to, or even more than 24 hours.|$|R
