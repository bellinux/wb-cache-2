5|$|By April 1917 Heseltine had again {{tired of}} London life. He {{returned}} to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, {{and made a}} partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, {{with whom he had}} decided <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>after</b> all, in love.|$|E
5|$|Born in Metz, Custine was {{a son of}} Philippe-Joseph, comte de Custine, and Anne-Marguerite Maguin, {{daughter}} of Francois, comte d' Roussy and Marguerite de Walter. His father, the tenth count, had died at the Battle of Rossbach in 1757, one of six French generals killed in the engagement. Custine's other titles included Signeur de Guermagne and de Sareck, and <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>after</b> 1770, also the lord of Niderviller, a property he purchased. He married Adelaide-Celeste Louise Gagnat de Longny. In 1790 Custine's daughter, Adelaide-Anne-Philippe, married Henri Evrard, marquis de Dreux-Brézé, master of ceremonies for Louis XVI. She and her husband {{spent much of the}} early 1790s as refugees in Britain, although he returned to France several times to visit his estates; he was eventually confirmed as a peer of France, resumed his pre-Revolution position as master of ceremonies, this time for Louis XVIII, and was awarded military rank.|$|E
5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could have asked for more (<b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>after</b> all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E

25|$|Brock {{said that}} his former friends in right-wing {{politics}} shunned him because Seduction did not adequately attack the Clintons. Jonah Goldberg of National Review proposed another theory: since “no liberal source {{in the world would}} talk to Brock,” he could not collect the kind of information <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after.</b> Goldberg also maintained that while writing the book, Brock had been “seduced” by Sidney Blumenthal, a prominent champion and friend of the Clinton circle. Blumenthal would remain the subject of intense attention from anti-Clintonites two decades later.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of April 1632, after the Swedish victory in the Battle of Rain, the Imperial and Leaguist forces, {{altogether}} 23,000 men billeted in the area of Himmelpforten, Stade, Buxtehude, the Stade Geest and the Bremian Elbe Marshes, left the prince-archbishopric and with them the foreign Catholic clergy. Now the allied troops of Sweden, the city of Bremen and the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen under Achatius Tott captured the prince-archbishopric and John Frederick resumed his office as its Administrator regnant. Highly indebted as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> recruiting and arming his troops allied with the Swedes, he brought in a bill to confiscate all the monasteries in the prince-archbishopric. However, on 20 and 28May 1633O.S. on the diet in Basdahl the estates of the prince-archbishopric rejected that, but allowed the Administrator regnant to collect the revenues of the monasteries until the Thirty Years' War would end.|$|E
25|$|Wheldon was knighted in 1976. Following his {{retirement}} from the BBC he became Chairman of the Court of the Governors of the London School of Economics, {{where he had}} read economics before the war. He disarmed potential sponsors of the school by eschewing flattery and opening negotiations with the bald statement that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> was their cash. He was also a formidable and active President of the Royal Television Society (RTS). An RTS Memorial Lecture in his name by a distinguished broadcaster is televised annually. In 2011 Bettany Hughes gave the lecture, and Brian Cox gave the lecture in 2010. Other speakers have included David Attenborough, Jeremy Isaacs and, in 2005, the writer Paul Abbott. In addition to this, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) dispenses a Huw Wheldon Award for Specialist Factual Programme. There are also Wheldon bursaries and awards at the LSE and the University of Wales, Bangor.|$|E

25|$|In {{place of}} these, Gowen {{proposed}} his own reorganization plan based, one more time, upon optimistic earnings estimates {{and his ability}} to attract new money into the company. Also, one more time, his oration carried the audience into great enthusiasm. Such was the momentum generated by Gowen's overall campaign that Keim conceded the January 1886 presidential election in advance; Gowen and his Board of Managers slate were elected unanimously and adopted a resolution calling for a change in the receivership. Notwithstanding the optimistic reorganization plan Gowen rode back into the presidency, shareholder enthusiasm and a board resolution were insufficient to remove the Reading from its deeply troubled circumstance. Before Gowen was able to mobilize any of the money required to take action, Morgan reentered the arena, this time heading a syndicate that offered to return peace and prosperity to the company through a different means. An anonymous member of Morgan's syndicate described a central element of the proposed peace:In order to do this it has been found necessary to get rid of Mr. Gowen. We have all combined {{to get him out of}} railroad management, just as all the powers of Europe combined to crush Napoleon, and there will be no peace until Mr. Gowen is in St. Helena. He is an able and brilliant man and in some respects a veritable Napoleon, but he is no railroad manager.... The trouble with Mr. Gowen is that he wants to be fighting all the time. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> the Molly Maguires he was in his element, but as a railroad manager he is a failure.|$|E
500|$|According to Ausmus, Hoffman {{wanted his}} teams {{to feel like}} a family. He felt like he let his family down if he did not do his job on a {{particular}} night. Still, he was accessible and held himself accountable on the rare occasions that he failed. Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> successful ones. [...] "The people asking the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E
500|$|... "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" [...] has six verses and no chorus. The lyrics {{describe}} a nightmarish experience in Juarez, Mexico, where, in Shelton's words, [...] "our anti-hero stumbles amid sickness, despair, whores and saints." [...] He battles with corrupt authorities, {{alcohol and drugs}} before resolving to return to New York City. In this song, critics have heard literary references to Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano, Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" [...] and Jack Kerouac's Desolation Angels. The backing musicians, Bobby Gregg on drums, Mike Bloomfield on electric guitar, and two pianists, Paul Griffin on tack piano and Al Kooper on Hohner Pianet, produce a mood that, for Gill, perfectly complements the [...] "enervated tone" [...] of the lyrics. Heylin notes that Dylan took great care—sixteen takes—to get the effect <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after,</b> with lyrics that subtly [...] " [...] the edge of reason".|$|E

500|$|The Ehoie of Mestra closes {{with her}} {{returning}} to Athens {{to care for}} her father, but the poet's attention stays with Sisyphus, as he and his son are the male subjects of the Ehoie of Eurynome which immediately follows. She was wise and beautiful, having been taught womanly arts by Athena. Sisyphus attempted to cheat her of her cattle, but Zeus intervened. Although he did not get what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after,</b> Sisyphus did accomplish with Eurynome what he could not with Mestra: a marriage for Glaucus. The gods again got in the way, though, and she bore Bellerophontes to Poseidon, who gave his son the winged horse Pegasus with which Bellerophontes slew the Chimera. [...] In the Iliad this task was presented as the order of Proetus' father-in-law Iobates, and in the Catalogue it appears to be followed immediately by the marriage of Bellerophontes and a daughter of the Lycian king.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} in 1887 to England, where, although not officially divorced from Mary Ann Bryant, {{he married a}} music hall singer, Lily Enever. In 1895, for a fee {{of a few hundred}} pounds, he confessed in The People newspaper that <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>after</b> all, Arthur Orton. With the proceeds he opened a small tobacconist's shop in Islington; however, he quickly retracted the confession and insisted again that he was Roger Tichborne. His shop failed, as did other business attempts, and he died destitute, of heart disease, on 1 April 1898. His funeral caused a brief revival of interest; around 5,000 people attended Paddington cemetery for the burial in an unmarked pauper's grave. In what McWilliam calls [...] "an act of extraordinary generosity" [...] the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the name [...] "Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne" [...] to be placed on the coffin before its interment. The name [...] "Tichborne" [...] was registered in the cemetery's records.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Final Ending", Cosmo {{is angry}} with the Lead Eliminator, who {{constantly}} attacks his family and godchild, so he transforms into a giant creature named [...] "Cos-zilla", {{a reference to the}} Japanese movie monster Godzilla. During Timmy's and his fairies' revisit the Blue Moon, they run into Turbo Thunder, who tells them how alone in the universe <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> the rock guardian threw him over the planet's horizon. Since then, he made a personified friend, a rock with a happy face, similar to Chuck Noland's companion Wilson the volleyball in the 2000 drama film Cast Away. In his flashback, Turbo Thunder receives an invitation flyer to the [...] "Chosen One Competition" [...] in Fairy World. On the flyer, the phrase [...] "Chosen One" [...] is printed in American Idol font. At the competition venue, the four fairy elders sit as judges behind a table in front of the auditioners like the American Idol judges do.|$|E

500|$|The {{quest for}} 'purity' was {{retained}} in the zerg psyche, becoming a pseudo-religious concept to them. Through the quest for 'perfection' the zerg were set on a steady state of evolution and conflict. The core idea of this 'religion' {{was that there was}} a state that the zerg could reach where they no longer needed to evolve, that their evolutionary form would never have to change again because they could already adapt to any situation. Abathur accepts that the Overmind's instinctive desire for [...] "true perfection" [...] is impossible for the zerg swarm to achieve, yet reasoned that [...] "...chasing perfection was tactically sound regardless." [...] Instead, Abathur believed it is [...] "purpose" [...] which makes the zerg strong. Abathur states that without an overriding will, [...] "feral zerg" [...] are lesser than beasts, much like <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> the death of the Overmind. Abathur is personally responsible for the continuation of the zerg-species. He undertakes each experiment as though the survival of the species depends on it alone, and tolerates no genetic regression or evolutionary backstep. It is revealed in Heart of the Swarm that {{he was the one who}} designed the Queen of Blades.|$|E
500|$|Munroe {{stated in}} terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space, but {{eventually}} it just came back to New York City, and the theme of the family that had fallen apart. When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or [...] "less Cowabunga" [...] and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. [...] "I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny. I think that version of the movie could do really well, but we wanted to do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting!" [...] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> the feel of a comic book. Karai was one of Munroe's favoriite characters from the comics and he [...] "was the one who really pushed for Karai" [...] to appear in the film. TMNT co-creator Peter Laird stated it takes place in its own universe separate from the previous films. However, director Munroe says the film exists in the same continuity as the other films, which was supported by the memento wall {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head at the Gridiron Dinner [...] on January 27; {{the program}} showed {{cartoons}} of the leading attendees and accompanying verses. [...] Foraker's read [...] "All [...] look alike to me", suggesting his Brownsville stance was to attract the black vote. [...] According to Walters, [...] "the jests had been pointed and the cartoons biting"; Roosevelt was seen to be angry. [...] Nevertheless, when the President rose to speak, all that was expected was a few minutes of humorous comments. [...] Instead, in his speech, Roosevelt attacked Foraker and defended his own conduct in the Brownsville case. [...] Although it was not customary to permit anyone to follow a president's speech, Foraker was allowed to reply. [...] The Washington Post reported that Foraker [...] "gave the President the plainest talk he has probably ever listened to." [...] Foraker stated that [...] Sergeant Sanders had been dishonorably discharged [...] even though [...] "he was as innocent of any offense against the law of any kind whatever as the President himself"—and, he charged, Roosevelt was fully aware the soldiers had been wronged. [...] He denied that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> votes with his position, [...] "I was seeking to provide for those men an opportunity to be heard in their own defense, to {{give them a chance to}} confront their accusers and cross-examine their witnesses, and establish the real facts in the case." [...] Roosevelt spoke in angry rebuttal, but according to his biographer Morris, [...] "Never before, at the Gridiron or anywhere else, had a President been challenged before an audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|So far the {{advantage}} {{had been with}} the Confederates. Rosecrans had been driven back at all points, and night found his entire army except pickets inside the redoubts. Both sides had been exhausted from the fighting. The weather had been hot (high of 94°F) and water was scarce, causing many men to nearly faint from their exertions. During the night the Confederates slept within 600 yards of the Union works, and Van Dorn readjusted his lines for the attack the next day. He abandoned his sophisticated plans for double envelopments. Shelby Foote wrote, [...] "His blood was up; it was Rosecrans <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>after</b> him in the harshest, most straightforward way imaginable. Today he would depend not on deception to complete the destruction begun the day before, but on the rapid point-blank fire of his guns and the naked valor of his infantry." ...|$|E
