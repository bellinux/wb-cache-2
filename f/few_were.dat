5|$|African-Americans were enlisted during World War I, {{but this}} was halted in 1919 and they were mustered out of the Navy. Starting in the 1930s a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> {{recruited}} to serve as stewards in the officers mess. African-Americans were recruited in larger numbers only after Roosevelt insisted in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though <b>few</b> <b>were</b> successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia plan.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1919 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. There was no official packaging; a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, at face value, to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be sold at a premium {{to help pay for}} local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief.|$|E
5|$|As {{members of}} the Uand U1classes, rebuilds were used mainly on mixed-traffic as well as {{secondary}} passenger duties on lines between the main routes. They were used all over the Southern Railway network, but were little-used over the steep track gradients west of Exeter. The smaller-wheeled Nclass was preferred amongst crews for the same duties, as high-speed running was rare away from the main lines in the West Country. Heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid's Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within weight restrictions in this area. The 21 rebuilt locomotives entered British Railways service in 1948. From 1955 a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> given replacement frames at overhaul: these had a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and the smokebox.|$|E
5|$|Classic Entertainments {{acquired}} the overseas distribution {{rights of the}} film in late February 2015, for an amount of 81 million, which was the highest price that any Telugu film had commanded in the overseas market until then. By {{the second week of}} June 2015, distribution rights for most of the regions were sold out while negotiations for a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> ongoing. Global Cinemas, Aditya films, and Vintage creations {{acquired the}} distribution rights of the Nizam, West and East Godavari regions for 145 million, 32.5 million and 34.3 million respectively.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, and only a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were sympathetic to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E
5|$|Eckfeldt also {{produced}} a pattern disme, of which only a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> struck. When the Mint's first cents (produced in 1793) {{were found to}} be excessively crude and attracted public ridicule, Eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements. He placed a wreath {{on the back of the}} cent instead of the original chain, and placed a trefoil under Liberty's head on the obverse. He also engraved the first half cent dies later the same year.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iniki's {{high winds}} caused {{extensive}} damage in Kauai. 1,421houses were destroyed, and 63 were lost {{from the storm}} surge and wave action. A total of 5,152homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. On the south coast, hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well. A <b>few</b> <b>were</b> restored quickly, though some took several years to be rebuilt. One hotel—the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii—never reopened after the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, <b>few</b> <b>were</b> swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but {{were not required to}} be repeated by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> ever awarded for more than one year.|$|E
5|$|In his own time, Bede was as {{well known}} for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, {{as well as other}} {{theological}} works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> lost. It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum, and why he was made a saint.|$|E

In practice, most of the sejms were still held in Warsaw, which hosted 148 sejms, compared to 11 sejms hosted in Grodno.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several had even been judges), {{although}} only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception of}} Roger Sherman and William <b>Few,</b> <b>were</b> very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{becoming}} a tropical depression, Andres produced heavy rainfall in Oaxaca and Honduras, resulting in two deaths. Rough seas {{off the coast of}} Guerrero resulted in one fatality. Inland, flooding caused by heavy rains killed two additional people. An additional 20 people were injured. Several dozen structures were damaged and a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> destroyed. Total losses from the hurricane reached MXN 3million ($231,000USD) in Colima. Following the storm, roughly 350 people were left homeless.|$|E

5|$|Structure 4 {{is another}} pyramid-temple {{base on the}} west side of Plaza C. It has a low {{platform}} at its southeastern corner, where 48 severed heads were excavated immediately to the west. Schele and Mathews have speculated that these may be the heads of the K'iche' kings Tepupul and Itzayul together with other members of the K'iche' court who were captured by the Kaqchikels and decapitated. Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades. Most of the skulls had been individually buried in pits cut into the floor of the plaza, although a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> grouped into small lots.|$|E
5|$|The Alamanni, {{who were}} {{originally}} from the Main valley of central Germany, had colonised the Agri Decumates (roughly {{the modern state}} of Baden-Württemberg in SW Germany) when the region was evacuated by the Romans in the mid-3rd century after belonging to the Roman province of Germania Superior for over 150 years. The Alamanni established {{a series of small}} pagi ("cantons"), mostly strung along the East bank of the Rhine (although a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> in the hinterland). The exact number and extent of these pagi is unclear and probably changed over time. Pagi, usually pairs of pagi combined, formed kingdoms (regna) which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary.|$|E
5|$|The Code of Hammurabi was {{inscribed on}} a stele {{and placed in}} a public place so that all could see it, {{although}} it is thought that <b>few</b> <b>were</b> literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, Susa; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in Iran and is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by scribes on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.|$|E
