25|$|Theology in the Flesh {{shows that}} biblical writers used {{a wide array}} of metaphors to {{understand}} topics such as sin, salvation, and God. Salvation, for example, is thought of in terms of release from slavery, as friendship with God, as healing, as returning from the dead, and as <b>finding</b> <b>your</b> way home to list but a few. No single metaphor says everything that we can say about salvation and so multiple metaphors are needed. There are often several legitimate ways, within constraints, for Christians to understand a topic. The book provides lots of examples of how different Christian communities, over time and across cultures, use different metaphors for salvation and so arrive at conflicting theological positions.|$|E

Like La Cage aux Folles and Priscilla Queen of the Desert, it presents drag queens as the show’s official spirit lifters. And like Hairspray, the musical this production most resembles in tone, Kinky Boots is about <b>finding</b> <b>your</b> passion, overcoming prejudice and transcending stereotypes." [...] Brantley wrote that Lauper's [...] "love- and heat-seeking score" [...] wowed with her [...] "trademark ... mix of sentimentality and eccentricity", and that the costumes and boots courtesy of Gregg Barnes made for [...] "big red scene stealers". He also praised “Raise You Up/Just Be,” as [...] "one of the best curtain numbers since 'You Can’t Stop the Beat' sent Hairspray audiences dancing out of the theater.” Brantley, however, did not extend his praise to Fierstein's script, writing that his [...] "sticky, sermonizing side" [...] comes through in the second half, where [...] "all the clichés stand naked before you." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Through the Rain" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics; many complimented Carey's restrained vocal performance, {{as well as}} the song's simple instrumental accompaniment, while others criticized it for being overly-dramatic. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described it as [...] "inspirational", and felt that due to its vagueness, the song is would be applicable to all listeners, not just Carey. The Daily Unions David Germain commented how the song's simple musical arrangement and Carey's [...] "restrained" [...] vocal delivery aided it in becoming [...] "modest and reserved". Writing for Billboard, Michael Paoletta chose [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a top pick from the album, as did Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine. He described it as a song that was designed as [...] "'Vision of Love' meets 'Hero'", and wrote, [...] "Mariah is back in the adult contemporary camp, no longer trying to prove that she's real." [...] Cara DiPasquale from the Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "powerhouse ballad", while Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair wrote [...] "embellished with her trademark vocal pyrotechnics, it is one of those highly personal songs about <b>finding</b> <b>your</b> way out of an emotional wilderness, but it sinks in its own sodden sentimentality". Similarly, a writer from Newsday also described [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a [...] "powerhouse ballad", and felt it was reminiscent of Carey's previous single [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] (1995). Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis noted how the song was able to effectively take listeners right into Carey's personal struggles from the previous year. Tina Brown from Newsweek felt that while Carey's personal troubles may not have been fully solved, the song made her appear [...] "strong and triumphant".|$|E
