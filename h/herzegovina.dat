5|$|A ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> on 6 August 2017 {{decided that}} a disputed {{military}} facility in Han Pijesak is to be registered as property of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina.</b> It {{is expected to be}} a precedent for all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for Bosnia. An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Graz agreement, {{negotiated}} by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats aiming to partition Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> in early May, proclaimed {{cessation of hostilities}} between the two groups, heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern <b>Herzegovina</b> (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), {{in the north of}} Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina.</b>|$|E
5|$|In eastern <b>Herzegovina,</b> the KPJ {{had little}} impact until mid-August 1941, {{well after the}} initial revolt had been suppressed. During the lead-up to the mass uprising, the KPJ {{organisation}} in <b>Herzegovina</b> would not commit itself, as it was waiting for orders from the provincial organisation in Sarajevo, which was expecting direction from the KPJ Central Committee to launch a general uprising across Yugoslavia. Once they {{became aware of the}} German attack on the Soviet Union, the KPJ in <b>Herzegovina</b> voted to join the mass uprising, but this only occurred on 24 June, when the uprising was already in full swing. According to Milazzo, the rebels remained a threat throughout eastern <b>Herzegovina</b> well into July, although the uprising in <b>Herzegovina</b> did not advance until the Bosnia-wide revolt occurred at the end of July, by which time the KPJ was ready for active involvement in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|On 22 and 23 July 1942, Mihailović held {{a conference}} at Zimonjić Kula, near Avtovac in eastern <b>Herzegovina,</b> which was {{attended}} by Trifunović-Birčanin, Đurišić, Jevđević, Zaharije Ostojić, Radovan Ivanišević, Milan Santić {{and a group of}} Chetnik commanders from <b>Herzegovina.</b> The purpose of the meeting was to establish co-operation between the Herzegovinian and Montenegrin Chetnik leaders. Baćović was appointed as the Chetnik commander for eastern Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina,</b> replacing Boško Todorović, who had been captured and executed by the Partisans in late February 1942. Trifunović-Birčanin was appointed the Chetnik commander for Dalmatia, Lika and western Bosnia.|$|E

It established cooperation, albeit inharmonious, between the two {{and served as a}} basis for joint defense against Serb forces. It also placed the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) under the command of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> (ARBiH).|$|E

5|$|The Italians {{handed over}} the {{administration}} of eastern <b>Herzegovina</b> to the NDH government on 20 May 1941, following {{the signing of the}} Treaties of Rome, which ceded formerly Yugoslav territory along the Adriatic coast to Italy. The Italians did not immediately withdraw all their troops from the region. The NDH moved quickly to establish its authority in the towns and districts of eastern <b>Herzegovina,</b> which included appointing mayors and prefects, the creation of local units of the Ustaše Militia, and deploying hundreds of gendarmes, Croatian Home Guards and Ustaše Militia units from outside eastern <b>Herzegovina.</b> These forces were brought in to maintain order. The academic Professor Alija Šuljak was appointed the Ustaše commissioner for eastern <b>Herzegovina.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Split Agreement was {{a turning}} point in the Bosnian War as well as an {{important}} factor in the Croatian War of Independence. It led to a large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer '95. This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives in Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina,</b> supported by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO air campaign in Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina,</b> shifted the military balance in the Bosnian War, contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E

5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February 1 March 1992 referendum on independence of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina.</b> This declaration would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In {{the final days of}} March, the Bosnian Serb army bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the HV, which occasionally supported HVO operations.|$|E

On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. At the same time, the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April.|$|E
5|$|Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> began further {{cooperation}} with NATO within their Individual Partnership Action Plan in January 2008.

On 2 October 2009, Haris Silajdžić, the Bosniak Member of the Presidency, announced official application for Membership Action Plan. On 22 April 2010, NATO agreed to launch the Membership Action Plan for Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina,</b> but with certain conditions attached. Turkey is thought to be the biggest supporter of Bosnian membership, and heavily influenced the decision.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{is located}} in Central and Southeast Europe, {{bordering}} Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> to the southeast, Montenegro to the southeast, the Adriatic Sea to the southwest and Slovenia to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected {{to the rest of}} the mainland by territorial waters, but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> around Neum.|$|E
5|$|During 1992 and 1993, an {{estimated}} 225,000 Croats, {{as well as}} refugees from Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> and Serbia, settled in Croatia. Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated {{in the war in}} Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina.</b> In September 1992, Croatia had accepted 335,985 refugees from Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina,</b> most of whom were Bosniak civilians (excluding men of drafting age). The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure. The American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, tried to put the number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper perspective in an interview on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> and {{trying to set up}} a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These developments and the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic {{cleansing}} in Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> {{happened on}} a larger scale than in the RSK, and all the major ethnic groups became victims of ethnically motivated violence. The conflict produced a vast number of displaced persons. It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> outside VRS control at the end of 1994, while the area's total population was about 2.2 million. About 720,000 Bosniaks, 460,000 Serbs and 150,000 Croats fled the country. Croatia hosted {{a large proportion of the}} Bosniak and Croat refugees; by November 1992 there were around 333,000 registered, and an estimated 100,000 unregistered, refugees from Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> in Croatia. The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances. The ethnic violence committed by Bosnian Serbs against civilians resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war, culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, {{he became a}} Chetnik leader in <b>Herzegovina</b> and joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. Jevđević collaborated with the Italians and later the Germans in actions against the Yugoslav Partisans. Although Jevđević recognised the authority of Mihailović, who was aware of and approved of his collaboration with Axis forces, {{a number of factors}} effectively rendered him independent of Mihailović's command, except when he worked closely with Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin, Mihailović's designated commander in Dalmatia, <b>Herzegovina,</b> western Bosnia and southwestern Croatia.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Croat-Bosniak {{conflict}} {{erupted in}} Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina,</b> just as each was {{fighting with the}} Bosnian Serbs. The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops {{on one side and}} the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> (ARBiH) on the other, but by 1994, the Croatian Army had an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 troops involved in the fighting. Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing for the creation of Federation of Bosnia and <b>Herzegovina</b> and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E
