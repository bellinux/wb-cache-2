This version also greatly remixed the audio levels for the sound effects and music, and dropped the Danger: from the original English version's title due to using an Italian print. The audio masters for the original English version were eventually recovered by Kim Aubry of American Zoetrope, who produced Paramount's DVD release.|$|E
