ABSTRACT: This bachelor thesis deals {{with the issue of}} <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> and their effect on the nutrition of contemporary czech family, along with the possibilities how to handle the negative impact that allergies could have on the composition of the diet. The theoretical part predominantly concentrates on the <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> as a whole, their symptoms, types, prevention, diagnosis and treatment; the practical part uses a questionnaire survey to investigate the condition of allergies in czech families, knowledge of them among families with an allergic member and also in general public, and the attitude to diet in terms of its change in families with allergic members. In the practical part the thesis as well researches, if there is a positive or negative impact of <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> on the composition of czech families' diet, and evokes possible solutions, how the diversification of the diet considering the <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> could be attained.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityIntroduction: <b>Food</b> <b>allergies,</b> {{the second}} most common form of {{allergic}} disorders in Western countries, have been on the rise in the US {{over the past few decades}} especially in young children. As the exact causes of food sensitizations are still unknown, much research has been dedicated to solving the mystery of how and why individuals develop <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> in the first place. However, very few studies have focused solely on the prevalence of <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> in the adult population. Furthermore, the prevalence of <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> in expecting mothers and their potential impact on mother-baby health outcomes have barely been investigated. As such, this retrospective chart review study aimed at comparing the prevalence of <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> in pregnant women to that of the adult US population and investigated the potential effects of maternal <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> on perinatal maternal outcomes and infant health. Methods: A total of 595 maternal charts and 614 infant charts were reviewed for expecting mothers age 18 to 49 years old who gave birth at New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, NC, between November 15, 2011 and November 15, 2012. Mothers’ data collected included basic demographic information, presence and nature of <b>food</b> <b>allergies,</b> and if applicable, occurrence and length of High Risk Antepartum visits. In addition to basic infant demographic information, the infant health outcomes collected were, when applicable: gestational age at birth, birth weight, 1 and 5 minute APGAR scores, NICU admissions and length of stay, as well as infant death. All statistical tests were two-tailed and p values < 0. 05 were considered significant. Results: <b>Food</b> <b>allergies</b> were documented in 5. 6 % (N = 22) of the mothers, which was not significantly different from the national average reported by the FDA (Vierk et al., 2007). The most commonly reported allergy in the study’s pregnant women sample was seafood (42. 2 %), and the least common maternal food hypersensitivity disorder in the sample was egg allergy (2. 2 %). No significant relationship was found between the presence of maternal <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> and maternal or infant health outcomes. Conclusion: Our study found that the proportion of pregnant women with <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> was consistent with the FDA-reported percentage of US adult population affected by <b>food</b> <b>allergies.</b> Furthermore, we were unable to establish significant relationships between the presence of maternal <b>food</b> <b>allergies</b> and mother-baby health outcomes...|$|R
