25|$|The United Electric Car Company of Preston built 15 {{double deck}} balcony cars for Sheffield Corporation Tramways in 1907. Initially {{numbered}} 258272 they had wooden seats for 59 passengers, and were {{mounted on a}} four-wheel Peckham P22 truck with two Metrovick 102DR 60hp motors operated by BTH B510 controllers. The braking systems consisted of a handbrake acting on all wheels, an <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> for emergency use and a hand-wheel operated track brake. Between December 1924 and July 1927 they were rebuilt with a totally enclosed upper deck.|$|E
25|$|South Shields 196 {{was built}} in 1935 at the Boavista Works of Oporto Tramways Company of Oporto (Porto), Portugal. A small 4-wheel single decker, one of a batch of 77 similar examples, {{it was based on}} an American design dating from 1909. Mounted on a Brill 21E truck, it has two GE(USA) 270A 55hp motors with licensee-built B54E controllers, and brakes using air-brake, {{emergency}} <b>electric</b> <b>brake,</b> and a handbrake operated by distinctive vertical hand-wheels {{to the right of the}} driver’s position. After rebuild, it has seating arranged longitudinally for 28 passengers.|$|E
25|$|Electric-motor-driven {{mechanical}} sirens may draw 50 to 200 amperes at 12 volts (DC) when spinning up to operating speed. Appropriate {{wiring and}} transient protection for engine control computers {{is a necessary}} part of an installation. Wiring should be similar in size to the wiring to the vehicle engine starter motor. Mechanical vehicle mounted devices usually have an <b>electric</b> <b>brake,</b> a solenoid that presses a friction pad against the siren rotor. When an emergency vehicle arrives on-scene or is cancelled en route, the operator can rapidly stop the siren.|$|E

25|$|By 1910, an {{improved}} braking schedule had been introduced, known as AMRE. This setup, and all others to come after, permitted graduated {{release of the}} brakes for finer control of brake applications. Additionally, AMRE allowed for the electric synchronization of braking throughout an entire train, causing all brakes on all cars of the train to apply uniformly and simultaneously. This created a smoother braking effort throughout the train. In order for the electric synchronization to work, {{it was necessary to}} insert an <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> key to activate the feature. All of the older IRT cars, including the Composites, were refitted with the new AMRE system circa 1910.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield 264 {{was built}} by the United Electric Car Company of Preston for Sheffield Corporation Tramways, one of a batch of fifteen double deck open balcony cars {{delivered}} in 1907. It was built with wooden seats for 54 passengers, mounted on a 4-wheel Peckham P22 truck with two Metrovick 102DR 60hp motors using BTH B510 controllers, with braking systems being a handbrake acting on all wheels, an <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> for emergency use and a hand-wheel operated track brake. A 1926 rebuild included modification to a fully enclosed upper deck. Displaced to peak hour use in the 1930s, it was renumbered 342, but was not withdrawn until 1956.|$|E
25|$|AC {{traction}} still occasionally uses dual {{overhead wires}} instead of single phase lines. The resulting three-phase current drives induction motors, {{which do not}} have sensitive commutators and permit easy realisation of a regenerative brake. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss rack railways. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.|$|E

50|$|The {{electrical}} {{components in the}} locomotive are based upon Siemens' EuroSprinter design (second generation using water-cooled GTO inverters). The traction motors are asynchronous AC type, and are nose suspended on the axle, regenerative <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> is possible with a braking force of approximately 460 kN, and an <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> power of , overall efficiency of the machine is more than 85%.|$|R

2500|$|When it {{had been}} decided to {{transfer}} the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, the cars' braking was modernized further. In AMRE schedule braking, the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> must be activated at all times by use of the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> key to synchronize the train's braking effort electrically. If it was not [...] "cut in" [...] or failed en route, the system could still be manipulated to apply the brakes pneumatically. This would still allow the train to stop, but deceleration would take longer such as on the older AM(P) schedule braking. However, in AMRE, the notches in the brake stand to cause this pneumatic application are completely separate from the notches to cause an electric application. Therefore, if a motorman with a defective or inactive electric AMRE brake were to electrically apply the brakes, nothing would happen! Valuable seconds would be lost while he realized his <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> was inactive, before he could move to the pneumatic apply notch to begin slowing his train down (which would still take longer than usual without electric synchronization of the brakes). In a serious scenario, this could cause him to overshoot a station or an important stopping point, or overspeed. In a new braking schedule known as AMUE, however, the electric and pneumatic notches are joined together on the motorman's brake stand. Therefore, even if the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> is defective or inactive, his moving the brake handle to the apply position would still begin setting up a pneumatic application of the brakes, creating a much quicker response to the condition than possible under any other previous system. As part of the modifications for elevated service, the Composites were equipped with AMUE schedule braking from 1916 until their retirement.|$|E
2500|$|Lincoln (birth name: John Cromwell Lincoln) {{was born}} in Painesville, Ohio to William Edward Lincoln, [...] (1831 - 1920), an {{abolitionist}} minister and Frances Louise Marshall Lincoln (1839 - 1918), a physician. There he received his primary and secondary education. In 1888, he graduated from Ohio State University {{with a degree in}} Electrical Engineering and soon after became a construction superintendent. He trained under Charles F. Brush, who invented the arc light and engineered America’s first electric street car. In 1891,Lincoln patented his first invention, an <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> for street-railway cars.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1993, using bogies {{from class}} 110 units with numbers 110 287 and lower, all 20 {{of the class}} 114 {{locomotives}} were rebuilt as normal class 110.3 units and were inserted into inventory as 110 485-504. [...] 18 of the class 110, which lost their bogies to these [...] "new" [...] 110s, were rebuilt with bogies from retired class 140 locomotives, and were re-designated as members of class 139, with which class they were nearly identical in the first place, due to their <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> system. (The 2 remaining former class 114s received bogies from 2 other retired class 110.3 units). The concept of the Einheitslokomotive completely paid for itself in this swap exercise.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{makes use}} of either regenerative or rheostatic braking, as the situation demands. Both traction and <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> power are continuously variable with the <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> optimised {{to such an extent}} that maximum use will be made of the regenerative braking capacity of the 3 kV DC network, with the ability to automatically change over to rheostatic braking whenever the overhead supply system becomes non-receptive.|$|R
40|$|The DFKI iWalker is the {{prototype}} of a walker equipped with <b>electric</b> <b>brakes,</b> wheel encoders, a laser range sensor, and a small control PC.

By controlling the <b>electric</b> <b>brakes,</b> it can help the user keeping clear of obstacles. In addition, by using a laserscan-based self-localization algorithm, the iWalker can determine its position inside a building and provide location-based services. For instance, it can guide the user to a desired target location by displaying navigation instructions on the screen (as in a car navigation system) or by using the <b>electric</b> <b>brakes</b> to indicate the direction the user has to walk to. ...|$|R

50|$|Because more {{electric}} locomotives were required {{as a result}} of the expansion of the network and the increase in traffic, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft issued a follow-on order for twelve E 91s in 1927 to cover the most pressing requirements.

The <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> can slow the vehicles at a similar rate of 0.8 m/s², down to 20 km/h. At that point, the vehicle switches automatically to the electropneumatic brake, to compensate for the declining electric braking performance. The <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> is also designed for continuous loading, which occurs in applications such as persistent braking of a fully loaded train on a 4.5 ‰ slope (e.g. Davos - Küblis).

30|$|As a consequence, a {{considerable}} amount of the total brake effort should be distributed to traction motors, by performing regenerative or dissipative braking, according to the capability of the overhead line for managing the corresponding recovered power. In particular, not only regenerative but also dissipative <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> is quite attractive, considering the corresponding reduction of wear of friction braking components such as pads and disks. Since <b>electric</b> <b>braking</b> is applied in parallel with the conventional pneumatic one, an optimized mixing strategy in the usage of both systems, usually called blending, has to be performed.|$|R

50|$|Standard Lo-V cars also {{simplified}} braking for train crews. On IRT equipment, an <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> {{could be}} utilized to synchronize a braking effort and apply each car's brakes simultaneously and uniformly throughout the train.

On earlier IRT equipment, the braking notches were different for a motorman depending {{on whether or not}} he was operating electrically or pneumatically. On Lo-V cars, the notches were identical regardless of whether or not the <b>electric</b> <b>brake</b> was active. The braking system on a Lo-V car is known as AMUE.|$|E
