40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a vibration-induced air inflow can cause vigorous bubbling {{in a bed}} of fine particles and report the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs. When convective flow occurs in a powder bed {{as a result of}} vibrations, the upper powder layer with a high void ratio moves downward and is compressed. This process forces the air in the powder layer out, which leads to the formation of bubbles that rise and eventually burst at the top surface of the powder bed. A negative pressure is created below the rising bubbles. A narrow opening at the bottom allows the outside air to flow into the powder bed, which produces a vigorously bubbling fluidized bed that does not require the use of an <b>external</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> system...|$|E

The stroke length was maintained constant and equal to 8 diameters in all the reported data. The results obtained show a strong correspondence between the local heat transfer and air temperatures. The periodicity of the synthetic air jet flow characterise the surface heat flux and local fluid temperature behaviour in the stagnation region.

40|$|Abstract. An active {{flow control}} {{technology}} known as synthetic jet actuator (SJA) is a zero-net mass-flux device to create pulsed jet that produces momentum to its surroundings {{and uses a}} vibrating diaphragm inside the cavity to generate an oscillatory flow through a small orifice. The performance of SJA depends {{on the design of}} an orifice and cavity, and oscillating membrane. SJA design based on piezoelectric diaphragm used in this project because of their size, lightweight, no need for <b>external</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply,</b> without the pipe complex, fast response time and low power consumption. This paper describes the cavity effect to SJA designs and experiments were performed to determine the air jet velocity produced through the orifice using a hot-wire anemometer at a different cavity thickness. The results demonstrate that the jet velocity increase would be better if the cavity thickness is reduced. However, more studies are needed to optimize the size of cavity and orifice for appropriate applications...|$|E
40|$|The 6 -strut {{tensegrity}} robot(TR- 6) {{consists of}} 6 discrete rigid struts and 24 continuously elastic cables. The TR- 6 can roll, crawl or even jump by self-deformations. As the self-weight impacts {{the stability and}} deformability of the TR- 6, light-weight mechanism design is required, {{and most of the}} existing TR- 6 are driven by Pneumatic Muscle Actuators. However, the <b>external</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> and the tubes limit the mobility. Electric prototypes solve the problem above, yet they have to sacrifices the controllability by reducing the number of actuators to lower the self-weight. In this paper, an all actuated electric prototype is designed and three questions in the design of mechanism and motion control system are solved. Firstly, the internal batteries and motors increase the self-weight and requires greater driving torque. Servo motors are used to replace the DC motors for higher torque-weight ratio. Secondly, wireless modules are mounted on the independent struts to communicate between the discrete electric devices. Thirdly, the ratio of the elastic and nonelastic part of the cables and the elastic coefficient of the cables is taken into consideration to guarantee both the deformability and stability...|$|E
40|$|Results from {{a series}} of {{experiments}} to investigate whether centrifugal compressor stability could be improved by injecting air through the diffuser hub surface are reported. The research was conducted in a 4 : 1 pressure ratio centrifugal compressor configured with a vane-island diffuser. Injector nozzles were located just upstream of {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes. Nozzle orientations were set to produce injected streams angled at 8, 0 and + 8 degrees relative to the vane mean camber line. Several injection flow rates were tested using both an <b>external</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> and recirculation from the diffuser exit. Compressor flow range did not improve at any injection flow rate that was tested. Compressor flow range did improve slightly at zero injection due to the flow resistance created by injector openings on the hub surface. Leading edge loading and semi-vaneless space diffusion showed trends similar to those reported earlier from shroud surface experiments that did improve compressor flow range. Opposite trends are seen for hub injection cases where compressor flow range decreased. The hub injection data further explain the range improvement provided by shroud-side injection and suggest that different hub-side techniques may produce range improvement in centrifugal compressors...|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic {{particulate}} matter (PM) exposure is correlated to various health effects, even at low amounts. WHO has defined PM concentration limits as daily and annual mean values which were made legally binding in the European Union. While {{many studies have}} focused on PM concentrations in special environments, {{little is known about the}} average PM- exposure for both employees and passengers in the German public transportation system. Methods: Particulate matter (PM 10, PM 2. 5, PM 1) - concentrations were monitored for 30 minutes at 15 different areas in Frankfurt am Main with major public traffic. Maximum and mean concentrations and, as a surrogate for the inhaled dosage, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for 15 minutes of exposure were calculated. Results: The WHO limits for PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were exceeded at nearly all times and areas. Highest maximum concentrations were found at underground stations, subterranean railway stations and subterranean shopping arcades with much lower values obtained at surface points. In one measurement at a surface test point smokers who neglected the non-smoking policy could be identified as a major cause for a at least temporary strong increase of PM-load as seen in high maximum values and normal averages. Conclusions: Subterranean areas have high {{particulate matter}} contamination exceeding WHO limits. Improvement may be achieved by increased ventilation. Subterranean shops and kiosks, being workplaces with long term exposure, should be equipped with <b>external</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply.</b> The non- smoking policy of the "Deutsche Bahn" for public spaces should be enforced...|$|E

The TEB rotor (Fan 9) {{was designed to be}} aerodynamically similar to the previously tested Fan 1, and used the same stator and nacelle hardware. Fan 9 was designed with trailing edge blowing slots using an <b>external</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> directed through the rotor hub. The TEB flow was heated to approximate the average fan exit temperature at each fan test speed. Rotor root blockage inserts were used to block TEB to all but the outer 40 and 20 % span in addition to full-span blowing. A configuration with full-span TEB on alternate rotor blades was also tested. Far field acoustic data were taken at takeoff/approach conditions at 0. 10 tunnel Mach. Far-field acoustic results showed that full-span blowing near 2. 0 % of the total flow could reduce the overall sound power level by about 2 dB. This noise reduction was observed in both the rotor-stator interaction tones and for the spectral broadband noise levels. Blowing only the outer span region was not very effective for lowering noise, and actually increased the far field noise level in some instances. Full-span blowing of alternate blades at 1. 0 % of the overall flow rate (equivalent to full-span blowing of all blades at 2. 0 % flow) showed a more modest noise decrease relative to full-span blowing of all blades. Detailed hot film measurements of the TEB rotor wake at 2. 0 % flow showed that TEB was not every effective for filling in the wake defect at approach fan speed toward the tip region, but did result in overfilling the wake toward the hub. Downstream turbulence measurements supported this finding, and support the observed reduction in spectral broadband noise...|$|E

The internal structure, effective wind sent area and the shape of wind outlet small hole which affected the air outlet wind speed of <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder are researched. While compared with the simulated and measured result of the outlet velocity of the wind outlet small hole, the best feature parameters of wind speed in <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder has been gained. The result shows that: by changing the internal structure and decreasing the effective <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> area of the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder, the wind speed from the air-outlet on the small hole can be more reasonably distributed; although by increasing the effective <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> area and changing the shape of outlet hole on <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder will make the air outlet be more effectively distributed, its value is unreasonable.
