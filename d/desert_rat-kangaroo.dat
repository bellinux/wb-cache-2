5|$|In Australia, 2012 {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} there are more than 7.2million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it {{has become one of the}} continent's most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family Potoroidae including the <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo.</b> The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo</b> was {{declared}} extinct in 1994, {{making it the}} only mammal species to be recovered and then lost again.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} been {{directly}} {{implicated in the}} extinction and decline of populations of the family Potoroidae including the extinction of the <b>Desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo</b> {{lived in}} the desert regions of Australia, {{including}} clay pans, loamy flats, sand ridges, and gibber plain habitats. Its native habitat was very arid, cover is sparse, and consists of saltbush and other chenopods and emu bush.|$|E
5000|$|An {{animal was}} sighted in May 2011 off Peake Station and {{subsequently}} identified from a museum skin as a <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo.</b> The area was then surveyed in August the same year. An old nest with some small macropod like scats was found and some tracks {{were also found}} near a waterhole {{that might have been}} made by the <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo.</b> However DNA analysis of the scats failed to yield any usable DNA. No DNA was found in dingo and cat scats in the area as well. As such the sighting remains unconfirmed, but researchers Tony Robinson and Tiana Forrrest confirmed the possibility [...] "that a small population of Caloprymnus, generally considered to be extinct throughout its former range across the Lake Eyre Basin, may have been present in this area in May 2011".|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo</b> {{was mainly}} herbivorous, feeding on foliage and stems of desert vegetation, but {{has also been}} found to eat insects such as beetles and weevils. It was so {{independent}} of water, it even shunned the succulent plants of the sand hills. It was able to survive without any surface water while feeding on green plants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo</b> (Caloprymnus campestris), {{also called}} the buff-nosed rat-kangaroo, plains rat-kangaroo or oolacunta, is an extinct small hopping {{marsupial}} endemic to desert regions of Central Australia. It was discovered in the early 1840s and described by John Gould in London in 1843, {{on the basis of}} three specimens sent to him by George Grey, the governor of South Australia at the time.|$|E
50|$|In {{view of its}} amazing {{recovery}} {{following a}} 90-year period when it was not seen, the extinction of the <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo</b> is not certain; thus, sightings of this animal would not fall into the cryptozoology category. In similar cases, the broad-faced potoroo was last seen in the late 19th century and is considered extinct, Gilbert's potoroo was considered extinct for 120 years prior to its rediscovery in 1994, and the long-footed potoroo was only discovered in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Caloprymnus campestris {{was well}} {{adapted to the}} {{extremely}} barren and arid regions it inhabited; these traits saved it from competition by introduced species like the rabbit or sheep. However, {{as early as the}} 1930s, the red fox had spread to the areas inhabited by the desert rat kangaroo. Thus, the rapid decline of the <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo</b> shortly after its recovery in 1931 correlates with the invasion of its habitat by the fox. Predation by the red fox and cats, as well as variable seasonal patterns and overhunting by indigenous Australians, were blamed for the extinction of this species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>rat-kangaroo</b> was {{discovered}} in the early 1840s. However, after these early sightings, {{it was no longer}} recorded for 90 years (aside from an unconfirmed report in 1878), and was widely believed to be extinct. This species, even before European colonisation, was apparently never abundant.Following the relief of drought conditions which improved the local habitat, the animal was rediscovered in 1931 when Hedley Finlayson found a thriving colony of them. He made multiple returns, but after a few years, the population disappeared. The last confirmed record of the species came in 1935 from near Ooroowilanie, east of Lake Eyre.|$|E
