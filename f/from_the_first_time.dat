5|$|Traffic was {{originally}} {{going to be}} distributed by 20th Century Fox, but it was put into turnaround unless actor Harrison Ford agreed to star. Soderbergh began shopping the film to other studios, but when Ford suddenly showed interest in Traffic, Fox's interest in the film was renewed, and the studio took it out of turnaround. Fox CEO Bill Mechanic championed the film, but he departed from the studio {{by the time the}} first draft was finished. It went back into turnaround. Mechanic had also wanted to make some changes to the script, but Soderbergh disagreed and decided to shop the film to other major studios. They all turned him down because they were not confident in the prospects of a three-hour film about drugs, according to Gaghan. USA Films, however, had wanted to take on the movie <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> Soderbergh approached them. They provided the filmmakers with a $46 million budget, a considerable increase from the $25 million which Fox offered.|$|E

25|$|The art {{and craft}} of carpet weaving has gone through periods of decline during times of {{political}} unrest, or {{under the influence of}} commercial demands. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a major part in the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with natural dyes, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian carpets and rugs were regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers, until today.|$|E

25|$|The {{designs for}} all three dresses were {{entrusted}} by Siti to the duo. For the first dress, they used a red net cloth that comes with motifs sewn into it. For the second dress, inspired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> Siti worked with them, they used red lace and net to make the dress. For the final dress, which was a striped sequin gold dress with a red base and side panels, they used fabrics that are full of sequins to make it. Few adjustments were done to the designs after they saw her during the full rehearsals of the concert, including changing the colours of her tudungs. All three dresses were made from imported fabrics and materials. It took them three weeks to finish designing and creating all the dresses.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1902, Hobbs {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the job of assistant professional at Bedford School, which he held throughout the summer term. The work mainly consisted of working as a groundsman and bowling in the nets, which left him exhausted and unhappy. Living away from home <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> and working in a public school environment left him feeling socially out of his depth and he did not enjoy his cricketing duties, although he later admitted that the cricketing strength of the school improved his own batting. In late August, Hobbs returned to Cambridge to play as a professional for the first time. For a fee of ten shillings, he appeared for a team from the nearby town of Royston against Hertfordshire Club and Ground. Appearing in his highest level of cricket to date, Hobbs scored 119. His success delighted his family and made him a local celebrity. Hobbs' father had helped to arrange his appearance in the match but was already seriously ill with pneumonia, and he died a week after his son scored his century, on 3 September 1902. His death left his wife and children facing great financial hardship.|$|E
25|$|Immunopathology is {{a branch}} of {{clinical}} pathology that deals with an organism’s immune response to a certain disease. When a foreign antigen enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system {{that can lead to}} more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation {{is a prime example of}} autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are Primary Immunodeficiency, where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and Secondary Immunodeficiency, where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia. In all vertebrates, there are two different kinds of immune responses: Innate and Adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is used to fight off non-changing antigens and is therefore considered nonspecific. It is usually a more immediate response than the adaptive immune system, usually responding within minutes to hours. It is composed of physical blockades such as the skin, but also contains nonspecific immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T Cells, and basophils. The second for of immunity is Adaptive immunity. This form of immunity requires recognition of the foreign antigen before a response is produced. Once the antigen is recognized, a specific response is produced in order to destroy the specific antigen. Because of this idea, adaptive immunity is considered to be specific immunity. A key part of adaptive immunity that separates it from innate is the use of memory to combat the antigen in the future. When the antigen is originally introduced, the organism does not have any receptors for the antigen so it must generate them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> the antigen is present. The immune system then builds a memory of that antigen, which enables it to recognize the antigen quicker in the future and be able to combat it quicker and more efficiently. The more the system is exposed to the antigen, the quicker it will build up its responsiveness.|$|E

500|$|Born on 10August 1886 at Clinkers Hill near Castlemaine, Victoria, Harrison {{was the son}} of printer and {{stationer}} Joseph Harrison, and his English-born wife Ann.

Keen to fly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> he saw an aeroplane, he travelled to Britain in March 1911 and trained as a pilot at the Bristol School on Salisbury Plain.

Gaining employment as an instructor for Bristol, he taught flying on behalf of the company in Spain and Italy, as well as in Halberstadt, Germany, where he became aware first-hand of that country's militarism; some of the students he trained and examined later served as pilots in the Luftstreitkräfte during World WarI.|$|E

500|$|An {{accomplished}} writer, series creator Nic Pizzolatto {{delved into}} fiction writing and published a novel, titled Galveston (2010), before being appointed as a screenwriter for AMC's The Killing the following year. It was {{around this time}} that Pizzolatto was preparing to branch out into television, an endeavor that, {{due to a lack}} of capital, was never fully realized. He had already begun writing True Detective as his next novel, but later, once the project took definite form, felt it was more suitable on screen. [...] "I'd always had plans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> I'd talked to an agent from Hollywood, I was going to ask how you break into this business, and particularly cable-TV writing, because in television the writer stays in control, which is what the concept of show runner is", he remembers. Pizzolatto pitched Galveston to several executives, and from May to July 2010, he drafted six screenplays, including a spec script for [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] which consumed 90 pages. Shortly thereafter, he secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series.|$|E
