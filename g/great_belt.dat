When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as an hour and a quarter.|$|E

5|$|The ferry {{terminal}} {{presents the}} only alternative to the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> Link for passenger transport between Jutland and Zealand. It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830. Currently Mols-Linien operates the route and annually transports some 2 million passengers and a million vehicles. Additional roll-on/roll-off cargo ferries serve Finland and Kalundborg {{on a weekly basis}} and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals. Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the Baltic Sea.|$|E

50|$|The grasslands of {{the western}} plains were {{the core of the}} <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt.</b> The grasslands {{consisted}} primarily of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and buffalo grass (Bouteloua dactyloides). These grasses have deep and dense root structure and retain large amounts of water, making them well suited for dramatic environmental fluctuations. Volatility, not equilibrium, defined the natural environment of the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>great</b> bison <b>belt</b> is a {{tract of}} rich {{grassland}} that ran from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico around 9000 BC.

These grasses retain their moisture at the roots which allowed for grazing ungulates such as bison to find high-quality nutritious food in autumn.|$|R
5|$|Peresvet {{was named}} after Alexander Peresvet, a Russian Orthodox monk who fought and died at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, against a Mongolian army. Her keel was laid down on 21 November 1895 by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg and she {{launched}} on 19 May 1898. She was not completed, however, until July 1901, {{at the cost of}} 10,540,000 rubles. Peresvet entered service in August, and was sent to Port Arthur in October 1901. En route, she ran aground on the tip of Langeland Island while passing through the Danish <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> on 1 November, but was apparently not seriously damaged. Upon arrival she was assigned to the Pacific Squadron and became the flagship of the squadron's second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky.|$|E
5|$|The {{harsh winter}} of 1657/58 had forced the Dano-Norwegian fleet in port, and the Great and Little Belts {{separating}} the Danish isles {{from the mainland}} were frozen. After entering Jutland from the south, a Swedish army of 7,000 veterans undertook the March across the Belts; on 9 February 1658, the Little Belt was crossed and the island Funen (Fyn) captured within a few days, and soon thereafter Langeland, Lolland and Falster. On 25 February, the Swedish army continued across the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> to Zealand with the Danish capital Copenhagen. Although only 5,000 men made it across the belts, the Swedish attack was completely unexpected; Frederick III was compelled to surrender and signed the disadvantageous Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the fleet}} {{conducted}} squadron maneuvers in the North Sea, which included coast defense exercises with {{soldiers from the}} X Corps. On 16 August, the fleet assembled in Danzig once again for the annual autumn maneuvers. The exercises started in the Baltic and on 30 August the fleet passed through the Kattegat and Skagerrak and steamed into the North Sea for further maneuvers in the German Bight, which lasted until 7 September. After a third phase of the maneuvers in the Kattegat and the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> from 8 to 26 September, the fleet went into port for annual maintenance. The year 1900 began with the usual routine of individual and divisional exercises. In {{the second half of}} March, the squadrons met in Kiel, followed by torpedo and gunnery practice in April and a voyage to the eastern Baltic. From 7 to 26 May, the fleet went on a major training cruise to the northern North Sea, which included stops in the Shetlands from 12 to 15 May and in Bergen from 18 to 22 May. On 8 July, the ships of the I Division were reassigned to the II Division.|$|E
50|$|At their peak, between {{thirty and}} forty million bison roamed the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt.</b> Bison are {{excellent}} thermo-regulators, and successfully endured the harshest environmental conditions. The protein to carbohydrate ratio {{in the short}} grass provided an ideal diet for large numbers of bison. Humans had largely destroyed the megafauna of North America, eliminating the resource competition of bison. The droppings and grazing of the bison supported healthy grass maintenance, and prevented the intrusion of taller grasses. The <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt</b> supported numerous species and complex ecosystems. For instance, the bison were so plentiful that by the early 19th century, {{it is estimated that}} about 1.5 million wolves lived on the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt,</b> feeding largely on the bison.|$|R

50|$|Humans had {{altered the}} {{landscape}} and ecosystems of the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt</b> for thousands of years. They removed trees, introduced new plants, hunted animals, and planted crops. However, the most significant human changes {{took place in the}} last four hundred years. The introduction of livestock from Europe completely altered the natural environment. Brought by the Spanish in the 1500s, horses were spread across the plains through complex trade networks. The horses were perfectly suited for the environment of the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt,</b> and quickly proliferated. Plains Indians eagerly adopted them, using them to pursue the bison herds across the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt</b> year-round. Some societies were radically altered, as they fully adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle. By the early 19th century, about 60,000 Plains Indians owned between 300 and 900 thousand horses. This was in addition to over two million wild horses. The horses put pressure on the bison in two ways. First, they competed with the bison for grazing, reducing the carrying capacity of the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt.</b> Second, they enabled the Plains Indians to kill bison at a much greater rate than prior to the adoption of horses.|$|R

5|$|Wettin {{took part}} in a pair of {{training}} cruises with the I Squadron during 9–19 January and 27 February– 16 March 1905. In March, Wettin was sent to assist her sister ship , which had run aground in the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt.</b> Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, Swinemünde, and Flensburg, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; Wettin and the main German fleet was anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit was strained by the Anglo-German naval arms race. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. In October, the I Squadron went on a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.|$|E

25|$|With the 14 June 1998 {{opening of}} the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> Fixed Link, car, coach and rail {{transport}} became faster between Jutland and Funen on the one hand, and Zealand on the other. Without {{the need to take}} the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> ferries, travel time was cut by an hour. For instance the travel time by train from Aarhus to Copenhagen fell from four to three hours, making domestic flights considerably less competitive. This had it effect on patronage, with significant drop in domestic traffic.|$|E

50|$|The {{destruction}} of the bison had serious consequences for the ecosystems of the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt.</b> The resilient short grasses were dominated by the less stable but aggressive tall grasses. Cattle soon replaced the bison as the primary consumers of the grasslands. By 1900, about 30 million livestock subsisted on the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt.</b> The cattle quickly overgrazed large sections of the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt.</b> The situation was so severe {{that the amount of}} land required to maintain cattle increased tenfold. The cattle began a process of denuding the plains and altering the ecosystems of the west.The final major change to the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt</b> was agriculture. The grasslands soon proved to be a hospitable area for growing wheat. Farmers and homesteaders removed the grass and sod to make room for farmland. This practice disrupted ecosystems, leading to an explosion in the populations of grasshoppers and other pests. The {{destruction of}} the grasslands was extensive. In the southern plains of the United States, three million acres of grassland was reduced to 450,000 acres of grassland by 1926. World War I caused a boom in wheat prices, but the postwar period saw a major decline in prices, driving farmers to produce even greater amounts of it. The {{destruction of the}} grasslands led to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, one of the worst ecological disasters in history. By 1935, 850 million tons of topsoil had blown off. The dust was carried as far as the Atlantic Ocean. Since then, the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt</b> has been supported by government soil conservation efforts, but the grasslands have never fully recovered.|$|R
50|$|About 50-75 {{million years}} ago, surging molten rock formed the {{mountain}} ranges of the west, including the Black Hills. About 10 million years ago, geological forces shaped {{the rest of}} the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt,</b> the largest terrestrial biome in North America. When the Pleistocene epoch ended about 10,000 years ago, warmer and drier weather came to dominate the region, making the biome ideal for grasslands and vegetation. Before human intervention, the <b>Great</b> Bison <b>Belt</b> included most of the present-day United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. It stretched from Southern Mexico to Northern Canada, and from California to Virginia.|$|R

[...] Some of the farmers returned to Toronto and Montreal. Some moved west to the prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta once the National Transcontinental Railway was completed. Many of the farmers shifted to mining once minerals were found in the area. Others entered the logging industry. Some towns still remaining today include Cochrane, New Liskeard, Timmins, Kapuskasing, and Hearst.|$|R

25|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{have been}} {{an integral part of}} the project, and have been of decisive significance for the choice of alignment and determination of the design. Environmental considerations were the reason why <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> A/S established an environmental monitoring programme in 1988, and initiated co-operation with authorities and external consultants on the definition of environmental concerns during the construction work and the professional requirements to the monitoring programme. This co-operation issued in a report published at the beginning of 1997 on the state of the environment in the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt.</b> The conclusion of the report was that the marine environment was at least as good as before construction work began.|$|E

25|$|Railway ferries {{had started}} service across another Danish strait, the much smaller Little Belt, in March 1872. A railway ferry service across the <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> was debated {{as early as}} 1872–75, but {{political}} unwillingness and objections from the board of Det sjællandske Jernbaneselskab, the major railway company on Zealand, delayed the decision. However, the company was nationalised in 1880, and in 1881, {{it was decided to}} establish the service. The first <b>Great</b> <b>Belt</b> ferries, H/F Korsør and H/F Nyborg, went into service on December 1, 1883. The railway nationalisation led to the creation in 1885 of the national railway company DSB, which would operate the ferries almost until the opening of the fixed link.|$|E

The city was also to house an enormous art museum for the northern part of Germany′s empire, containing [...] "only works of German masters".
