NIOSH recommends that the exposure limit of EDB be substantially lowered from the current federal standards of 20 ppm for an 8 hour limit, 30 ppm ceiling to a ceiling of 0. 13 ppm for any 15 minute sampling period. At this level an employee would have a maximum of about 686 mg/kg for a 40 year working lifetime, which is substantially below the dose known to cause adverse effects in experimental animals. Medical surveillance should be provided for all employees working with EDB and records involving EDB exposure should be kept for 30 years after termination of employment.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to test the hypothesis that a summary measure of the VOC mixture, other risk factors, and covariates for each worker will lead to better prediction of symptom outcome.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Acne is a multifactorial {{skin disease}} {{affecting}} about 80 % of people aged 11 to 30. Several systemic and topical treatments {{are used to}} treat existing lesions, prevent scarring and suppress {{the development of new}} lesions. Topical therapy is often used as first line treatment for acne, due to the location of the target organ, the pilosebaceous unit, in the skin. Retinoids are widely used as oral or topical treatment for this disease, with tretinoin and adapalene being two of the most used topical retinoids. The transdermal route offers several challenges to drug delivery, e. g. the excellent resistance of the stratum corneum to diffusion, as well as variable skin properties such as site, age, race and disease. Some additional difficulties are associated with the dermatological delivery of tretinoin and adapalene, which include suboptimal water solubility of the retinoids, isomerisation of tretinoin in the skin, mild to severe skin irritation, as well as oxidation and photo–isomerisation of tretinoin, even before crossing the stratum corneum. Researchers constantly strive to improve dermatological retinoid formulations in order to combat low <b>dermal</b> flux, skin <b>irritation</b> and instability. The release kinetics of tretinoin varies greatly according {{to the way in which}} it is incorporated into the formulation and according to the type of formulation used. Little research has been conducted regarding improved formulations for adapalene. Pheroid technology is a patented delivery system employed in this study in order to improve the dermal delivery of retinoids. Tretinoin and adapalene were separately incorporated into castor oil, vitamin F and Pheroid creams. The creams were evaluated in terms of their in vitro retinoid release, in vitro transdermal diffusion and stability. Castor oil and Pheroid creams were superior in terms of release and dermal delivery of adapalene. Tretinoin was best released and delivered to the dermis by castor oil cream. The castor oil creams were the most stable formulations, whereas the Pheroid creams were the most unstable. In terms of release, dermal diffusion and stability, castor oil cream proved to be the most suitable cream for both tretinoin and adapalene. Master...|$|R
40|$|The Earth s moon {{presents}} {{a hostile environment}} in which to live and work. There is no atmosphere to protect its surface from the ravages of solar wind and micrometeorite impacts. As a result, the moon s surface {{is covered with a}} thin layer of fine, charged, reactive dust capable of entering habitats and vehicle compartments, where it can result in crewmember health problems. During the Apollo missions, lunar dusts were introduced into the crew vehicle, resulting in direct exposure and occasional reports of respiratory, <b>dermal</b> and ocular <b>irritation.</b> In order to study the toxicological effects of lunar dust, NASA formed the Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Advisory Group (LADTAG). This interdisciplinary group is comprised of leading experts in space toxicology, lunar geology, space medicine and biomedical research. LADTAG has demonstrated that lunar soil contains several types of reactive dusts, including an extremely fine respirable component. These dusts have highly reactive surfaces in the lunar environment; the grains contain surface coatings which are generated by vapor phases formed by hypervelocity impact of micrometeorites. This unique class of dusts has surface properties that are unlike any Earth based analog. These distinctive properties are why lunar dusts are of great toxicological interest. Understanding how these reactive components behave "biochemically" in a moisture-rich pulmonary environment will aid in determining how toxic these particles are to humans. The data obtained from toxicological examination of lunar dusts will determine the human risk criteria for lunar dust exposure and produce a lunar health standard. LADTAG s analysis of lunar dusts and lunar dust simulants will include detailed lunar particle characterizations, determining the properties of particle activation, reactivation of lunar dust, the process of dust passivation and discerning the pathology of lunar dust exposure via inhalation, intratracheal instillation, cell culture exposure, dermal exposure and ocular exposure. The resulting health standard will be time-based and will vary by the duration and type of exposure. It may also be necessary to set multiple standards for different types of lunar dust, as well as for dust in its activated form vs. aged & passivated dust. This standard, set to protect the health of our robust astronaut crews, will not only impact NASA medical operations, but engineering designs as well. The data from our multidisciplinary research are vital in developing remediation devices and environmental monitors. Ultimately, the engineering and safety groups will design and develop countermeasures for space vehicles, suits, rovers and habitats that will be sustained within the limits of the health standard...|$|R

The animals were also observed for clinical signs and mortality after the application of test film. The <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> potential of silk protein film was examined using Draize test. In the initial test, three test patches were applied sequentially for 3 min, 1 and 4 hours, respectively, and skin reaction was graded. The irritant or negative response was confirmed using two additional animals, each with one patch, for an exposure period of 4 hours. The responses were scored at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the patch removal. Skin sensitization study was conducted according to Buehler test in guinea pigs, in which on day 0, 7 and 14, the animals were exposed to test material for 6 hours (Induction phase) and on day 28, the animals were exposed for a period of 24 hours (Challenge phase). The skin was observed and recorded at 24 and 48 hours after the patch removal. In acute {{dermal toxicity}} study, the rats dermally treated with silk film did not show any abnormal clinical signs and the body weight, biochemical parameters and gross pathological observations were not significantly different from the control group. In acute <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> study, the treated rabbits showed no signs of erythema, edema and eschar, and the scoring was given as “ 0 ” for all time points of observations according to Draize scoring system. In skin sensitization study, there were no skin reactions 24 and 48 hours after the removal of challenge patch, which was scored “ 0 ” based on Magnusson/Kligman grading scale...|$|E
40|$|Recommended {{criteria}} for a standard intended to protect the employees against exposure to acrylamide (79061) in the workplace {{for up to a}} 10 -hour work shift, 40 -hour work week, over a working lifetime. Occupational exposure to acrylamine, because of systemic effects and <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> produced by contact with acrylamide, is defined as work in an area where acrylamide is stored, produced, processed, or used. The main topics covered include: recommendations for levels of acrylamide in the air including sampling and analysis; medical surveillance; personal protective equipment; informing employees of hazards from acrylamide; work practices; sanitation; monitoring and recordkeeping, biologic effects of exposure, including epidemiology, toxicology, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and teratogenesis; environmental data and engineering controls.

30|$|Periodically, the EPA {{issues a}} report {{covering}} glyphosate exposure and health-impact incident reports. For example, between 2002 and 2008, {{a total of}} 271 incident reports were compiled by EPA, 36 % of which involved neurological symptoms, 29.5 % <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation,</b> rash, or hives, and 14 % respiratory duress [15]. Common causes of such incidents include a slow leak in a hose or fitting on a backpack sprayer, leading to the drenching over several hours of the applicator’s neck, back, and/or legs; repair of an equipment breakdown that inadvertently leads to significant exposure to spray solution; and, routine maintenance and service of spraying equipment and tank cleanup procedures. In the case of large-scale spray equipment used to apply a GBH in farm fields or large areas, a person repairing a leaky fitting or valve, or dealing with clogged nozzles or a blown hose, can be heavily exposed {{in a matter of}} seconds.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} it was {{examined}} {{how people are}} exposed to compounds contained in hygienic cleaning products used in the kitchen. The products for which exposure was assessed are dishwashing liquids, hygienic cleaning napkins, spray cleaners and bleach containing products (abrasive, all purpose cleaner and bleach). For each product type, exposure was assessed for one sample compound while performing one or two cleaning tasks in the kitchen. The exposure assessments were performed using the computer application, CONSEXPO. The calculated exposures were compared to the toxicity of the assessed compounds {{in order to assess}} risk. Exposure to didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride is concluded to be a possible cause of slight <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> when using a hygienically cleaning trigger spray. On the basis of a first toxicological screening, exposure to the assessed compounds when using the products for cleaning tasks in the kitchen is not expected to cause adverse health effects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Post-herpetic {{neuralgia}} (PHN) is {{a common}} type of neuropathic pain that can severely affect quality of life. NGX- 4010, a capsaicin 8 % dermal patch, is a localized treatment that can provide patients with significant pain relief for up to 3 months following a single 60 -minute application. The NGX- 4010 application {{can be associated with}} application-site pain and in previous clinical trials pretreatment with a topical 4 % lidocaine anesthetic was used to enhance tolerability. The aim of the current investigation was to evaluate tolerability of NGX- 4010 after pretreatment with lidocaine 2. 5 %/prilocaine 2. 5 % anesthetic cream. Methods Twenty-four patients with PHN were pretreated with lidocaine 2. 5 %/prilocaine 2. 5 % cream for 60 minutes before receiving a single 60 -minute application of NGX- 4010. Tolerability was assessed by measuring patch application duration, the proportion of patients completing over 90 % of the intended treatment duration, application site-related pain using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and analgesic medication use to relieve such pain. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> using dermal assessment scores. Results The mean treatment duration of NGX- 4010 was 60. 2 minutes and all patients completed over 90 % of the intended patch application duration. Pain during application was transient. A maximum mean change in NPRS score of + 3. 0 was observed at 55 minutes post-patch application; pain scores gradually declined to near pre-anesthetic levels (+ 0. 71) within 85 minutes of patch removal. Half of the patients received analgesic medication on the day of treatment; by Day 7, no patients required medication. The most common AEs were application site-related pain, erythema, edema, and pruritus. All patients experienced mild <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> 5 minutes after patch removal, which subsequently decreased; at Day 7, no irritation was evident. The maximum recorded dermal assessment score was 2. Conclusion NGX- 4010 was well tolerated following pretreatment with lidocaine 2. 5 %/prilocaine 2. 5 % cream in patients with PHN. The tolerability of the patch application appeared comparable with that seen in other studies that used 4 % lidocaine cream as the pretreatment anesthetic.

40|$|NIOSH {{recommends}} in {{this document}} that employee exposure to hydroquinone (123319) be limited to 2. 0 mg/m 3, about 0. 44 parts per million, as a ceiling concentration during a 15 minute collection period. Recommendations were provided for medical surveillance steps, environmental monitoring, labeling and posting of hazards, use of personal protective clothing and equipment, instructing employees of potential hazards, safe work practices, waste disposal, confined space entry requirements, monitoring, recordkeeping, and emergency procedures. Evidence was presented of eye injuries, systemic effects and <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> following exposure to hydroquinone. However, no eye injuries have been documented {{in the absence of}} quinone vapor. No studies were available of the morbidity and mortality among persons working with hydroquinone, of the effects of exposure to hydroquinone by inhalation, or of teratogenic actions caused by exposure of pregnant animals or women to hydroquinone. Hydroquinone appears to effect the mitotic process in unicellular organisms and to decrease reproductive success in mammals; no evidence of mutagenicity in organisms other than bacteria and yeasts had been presented.
