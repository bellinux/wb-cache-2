We propose a technique to manufacture reusable and complex LOCs made up of SU- 8 resist for the fluidic structure and of glass for the <b>hard</b> <b>packaging,</b> and are compatible with the integration of thick electrodes. The method is based on the combination of two bonding technologies, both based on a wafer bonder. The first one consists of the bonding of a thin photosensitive SU- 8 dry film, which is similar to lamination. The second one is the standard bonding technique which uses a hard substrate covered by an SU- 8 layer. The LOCs that can be obtained by combining these two methods are transparent, and include 3 D microfluidic structures and thick electrodes. Moreover, these LOCs are reusable, packaged and ready to use. In order to validate the concept, we designed an LOC devoted to cell arraying, using dielectrophoresis, as well as to cell electroporation...|$|R

40|$|Different {{methods for}} quality {{assessment}} of separated andcommingled plastics from household and electronic waste havebeen developed. Especial {{attention has been}} given tospectroscopic methods since they are non-destructive andrequire little or no sample preparation at all. A wide variety of low molecular weight compounds have beenidentified in recycled polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylenefrom <b>hard</b> <b>packaging</b> waste by gas chromatography- massspectroscopy (GC-MS) after microwave assisted extraction (MAE). Low molecular weight substances such as alcohols, esters,ketones and fragrance and flavour compounds were detected inthe recycled resins. The major category of compounds identifiedin the virgin resins is conformed by aliphatic hydrocarbonssuch as alkanes and alkenes. It was found that theconcentration of aromatic hydrocarbons without functionalgroups, e. g. ethylbenzene and xylenes in recycled HDPE wasapprox. 5 times higher and equal to 120 and 35 ppb,respectively. The potential of near infrared (NIR) and Fourier transformRaman (FT-Raman) spectroscopy in combination with multivariateanalysis as a rapid, non-destructive and accurate analyticalmethod has been studied and the feasibility of these methodsfor at/in line characterisation of several properties ofrecyclates has also been explored. NIR in diffuse reflectance mode has been successfully usedfor quantification of antioxidants in polyethylene, thestandard error of prediction is almost comparable to the errorof wet methods, i. e., extraction plus liquid chromatography. The error of prediction of this method is 35 ppm for Irganox 1010 and 68 ppm for Irgafos 168. The inaccuracy in thequantification of Irgafos 168 {{is due to the fact}} that thisantioxidant degrades during polymer processing. NIR and Mid-infrared (Mid-IR) worked well for fastdetermination of molecular weight and crystallinity of therecycled HDPE and acceptable errors of prediction, comparableto that of the reference methods, i. e. size exclusionchromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) have been obtained. The present thesis also shows that NIR and Raman are goodcandidates for in/on line compositional analysis of mixedpolymer fractions from recycled plastic waste. Diffusereflectance NIR allows a rapid and reliable measurement ofpellets and requires no previous sample preparation. Thecomposition of binary blends can be determined with highaccuracy. The PP content in the PP/HDPE blends was predictedwith a RMSEP equal to 0. 46 %w in the 0 - 15 %wt region and theRMSEP for PP in the PP/ABS blends was 0. 3 %wt. The thermal and thermoxidative stability of recycled PP,HDPE and a 20 / 80 PP/HDPE blend subjected to multiple extrusionhave been studied by DSC, thermal analysis (TGA) andchemiluminiscence (CL). A decrease in Toxand OIT was observed after each extrusion step. The drop in OIT was sharper after the first two extrusions. TheOIT values produced by DSC and CL were in good agreement. However, CL provided more information about the oxidationprocess taking place in the blends. The moisture content in recycled polyamide 6, 6 was readilydetermined by NIR in transmission mode and it could bepredicted with a RMSEP = 0. 05 %wt. The accuracy of the methodappeared to be as good as that of the more time consumingthermal methods such as TGA, DSC and loss on dry (LOD), whichwere used as reference methods. The influence of differentamounts of water on the viscoelastic properties of nylon hasbeen investigated.

40|$|A tax on waste-to-energy {{incineration}} {{of fossil}} carbon in {{municipal solid waste}} from households was introduced in Sweden on July 1, 2006. The tax has led to higher incineration gate fees. One of the main purposes with the tax {{is to increase the}} incentive for recycling of materials, including biological treatment. We investigate whether and to what extent this effect can be expected. A spreadsheet model is developed in order to estimate the net marginal cost of alternative waste treatment methods, i. e., the marginal cost of alternative treatment minus avoided cost of incineration. The value of the households' time needed for source separation is discussed and included. The model includes the nine largest fractions, totalling 85 % (weight), of the household waste currently being sent to waste incineration: food waste, newsprint, paper <b>packaging,</b> soft and <b>hard</b> plastic <b>packaging,</b> diapers, yard waste, other paper waste, and non-combustible waste. Our results indicate that the incineration tax will have the largest effect on biological treatment of kitchen and garden waste, which may increase by 9 %. The consequences of an incineration tax depend on: (a) the level of the tax, (b) whether the tax is based on an assumed average Swedish fossil carbon content or on the measured carbon content in each incineration plant, (c) institutional factors such as the cooperation between waste incinerators, and (d) technological factors such as the availability of central sorting of waste or techniques for measurement of fossil carbon in exhaust gases, etc. Information {{turns out to be a}} key factor in transferring the governing force of the tax to the households as well improving the households' attitudes towards material recycling.

Project, {{based at}} Edinburgh University Library and funded under the JISC Fair Programme, is aiming to produce, among other things, a {{software}} solution for {{institutions in the}} UK to implement their own E-theses or Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) online submission system and repository. In order to achieve this it has been necessary to examine existing packages that may provide {{all or part of}} the solution we desire before considering what extra development we may need to do. We evaluated two open source packages to deliver E-theses functionality via a Web-based interface: ETD-db by Virginia Tech, and DSpace written in partnership between Hewlett-Packard (HP) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). A direct comparison is <b>hard</b> as each <b>package</b> is driven by different motivations: ETD-db is specifically designed for E-theses, containing a ‘workspace‘ for supervised authoring of documents, and a thesis-specific metadata set; DSpace has been developed to aid the creation of institutional repositories, with the emphasis more on post-submission workflows and potential digital preservation for a variety of document types. The DAEDALUS Project at the University of Glasgow has provided us with a round-up of initial experiences with DSpace and another open-source institutional repository package called EPrints. org and notes that: ‘They have much in common and the choice of which, or both, or neither, will hinge on a range of local factors‘.

A system of finite element modeling combined with graphics. elastogram generation was used to study the detection of hard spots in beef rations. Finite element was used to model the structural deformation of beef steaks under compression while elastogram was generated using cross-correlation techniques on congruent compression RF echo sequences. The system was first used to determine the optimal elastography conditions for segments of pro-and post-detection of <b>hard</b> spots in <b>packaged</b> beef rations. Three different models, halogenous model, non-homogenous model and orthotropic model were established for beef steaks and the elastograms with different sizes and ratios of moduli of elasticity (modulus ratios) of hard spots to surrounding tissue were generated under the selected conditions. The elastograms were segmented using an automatic thresholding algorithm and the results were used to analyze the detection of hard spots. The optimal conditions determined for elastography were an applied strain of 1. 0 %, a sampling frequency of 35 MHz, a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, and a transducer frequency of 5 MHz. There were significant differences among three models for hard spots detection. The orthotropic model described the structure of beef steaks most precisely and had the smallest detected error for hard spot detection among the three models. Sizes of hard spot, modulus ratios of hard spot versus background, and relative positions of hard spots are factors affecting the detection of hard spots for elastography. The larger the size of hard spot, or the higher the modulus ratio, the smaller the relative error of the hard spot detection. In order for spots to be detected, they must have at least 4 mm of diameter with 5. 0 modulus ratio or 2. 5 modulus ratio with 6 mm of diameter. The relative positions of hard spots also was a factor affecting the individual detection of hard spots when more than one hard spot existed in the sample. Interference between hard spots may cause noise in elastogram. Three automatic thresholding segmentation algorithms were also developed in this study. They selected the threshold value for segmentation based on the contour lines, the local minima of the histogram of the elastogram, and the magnitude of gradient of the Image...|$|R
30|$|Surveillance {{programs}} were initiated {{to control the}} presence of substances prohibited in articles [25] and to enforce the SVHC provisions relating to articles. Some data on these activities are published in the annual reports of the responsible national authorities. It must be emphasized that the surveillance programs by national {{as well as by}} non-governmental programs focus on about a dozen SVHCs, whereas the number of SVHCs amounts to currently 173. The small number of substances monitored is due to various reasons, such as the practicability of the analytical methods, the costs of expensive articles, the handling of very bulky or heavy articles, or the fact that some SVHCs undergo chemical reactions in the production process and might then stay below the trigger value in the final article. Furthermore, the surveillance of the same substances over several years allows to detect trends. The surveillance programs conducted by the enforcement authority of the German Federal State Baden-Württemberg focused on a few article groups where SVHCs or restricted substances [1 Annex XVII] might be expected. In 2013, the analytical measurements conducted in their surveillance programs revealed that SVHCs and restricted chemicals were present in many consumer articles, in some cases at rather high concentrations. Two-thirds of the articles under scrutiny contained SVHCs above the threshold of 0.1 % and many answers by suppliers were wrong. 22 out of 84 articles contained more than 0.1 % of the respective phthalates DEHP (up to 19 %) and DIBP, whereas the producers had not indicated these SVHCs in their Art. 33 (2) answers. The authorities analyzed up to 15 different phthalates, some of which are SVHCs (di-iso-heptyl phthalate (DIHP), bis-(2 -methoxyethyl)phthalate (BMEP), N-pentyl-isopentylphthalate (PIPP), dipentyl phthalate (DPP), diisopentylphthalate (DIPP), dihexylphthalate (DHP)), some are SVHCs and listed in Annex XVII [1] (dibutyl phthalate (DBP), bis-(2 -ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), benzylbutylphthalate (BBP), di-iso-butylphthalate (DIBP)), {{and some of them are}} listed in Annex XVII and are no SVHCs up to now (dioctyl phthalate (DnOP), di-iso-nonylphthalate (DINP), di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP)). Some phthalates that had previously been used as substitutes have meanwhile been regulated. This example of phthalates shows the problem, which surveillance organizations as well as producers have to face when provisions for a certain substance might change in the course of the years as the candidate list, Annex XVII, or other regulations are updated. Persistent organic pollutants such as short-chain chlorinated paraffins and HBCDD were also detected in various articles by the surveillance authorities of Baden-Württemberg. Cadmium was measured in articles with PVC material, jewelry, <b>hard</b> solder, and <b>packaging.</b> The biocide DMF was found in shoes and other leather articles.

40|$|The {{rural areas}} of many {{countries}} in Africa are affected by critical shortages of staff. One of the contributing factors to this problem is the poor distribution of the available health workers between rural and urban areas. Fortunately health policy managers {{in the region are}} trying to find means and ways of improving the availability of health workers in the rural areas. However in order for the health service managers to develop and implement effective policy options, {{it is important to understand}} the underlying assumptions of health workers decision to relocate to, stay in or leave the rural areas. It is the aim of this review to explore what health workers think can drive them to accept rural post and how governments have responded to their concerns focusing the ECSA region. Methods A literature review was conducted on factors which influence health workers decision to work in rural areas and government policies. Only English language materials which were published between 1990 and 2012 were searched. Documents were searched from PubMed, Google scholar, Global HRH resource centre and rural health Journal. Different terms in relation to attraction and retention of health workers in rural areas were used. Government and WHO web sites were also searched to find relevant policy documents therefore Grey and unpublished literature was included in the review. Snow bowling was mainly used to find relevant documents. The initial study produced 106 documents on preferences and choices of health workers which were examined and eventually 20 documents were included in the review. Results Despite the availability of evidence on the preferences and choices of health workers to relocate to, stay in or leave the rural areas, countries in the ECSA region do not respond favourably to the concerns raised by the health workers. Only Zambia has a comprehensive strategy which incorporated both financial and non-financial incentives however the scheme targeted doctors only. Few other countries which have the specific policies on rural retention are South Africa unfortunately; they only concentrated on hardship allowances. Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya do have the rural policies which are solely donor driven and are implemented in selected areas. In Malawi, the country failed to implement its <b>hard</b> to reach <b>package</b> due to poor economic environment and government failed to meet the cost of the strategies. Conclusion There is enough evidence in the ECSA region that health workers do not like working in the rural areas and governments have not responded favourably to the providers concerns. Factors influencing the decision to relocate or stay in the rural areas are very complex and interrelated.
