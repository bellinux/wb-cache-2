5000|$|The Pandrol [...] "Fastclip" [...] was {{introduced}} in 2000 to overcome some {{of the limitations of}} the original <b>E-clip.</b> In particular, the Fastclip is captive to the concrete sleeper to which it is attached and is more suitable for automatic insertion and extraction.|$|E

5000|$|Common {{examples}} include <b>e-clips</b> (e-ring) and the (both internal and external) snap ring or circlip [...] These general types of fasteners are sized {{to provide an}} interference fit onto (or into, {{in the case of}} an internal fastener) a groove or land when in use, such that they must be elastically deformed in order to install or remove them.|$|R
40|$|LKAB {{intends to}} {{increase}} the production of iron ore in the upcoming years. To prevent problems with the capacity along Malmbanan (The Iron Ore Line) {{an increase in the}} maximum permissible axle load is required. The first step is an increase from 30 ton to 32. 5 ton. The vision is {{to increase the}} axle load in 4 steps of 32. 5 - 35 - 37. 5 – 40 ton, where an axle load of 40 ton is the final goal. The report deals with the influence of an increased axle load for each track component. This is in order to present the deterioration of the track quality when the axle load is increased. Different methods of track maintenance and reinforcements will also be discussed. The work is focused on the southern circuit of Malmbanan. Track conditions on individual track sections will not be considered. The work only includes the track structure i. e. signaling systems and power supply systems will not be considered. Economical calculations of reinforcement and maintenance activities is left for future investigations. The working process has included a literature study, field study, computational study and an interview study. This has led to an assessment of to what extent each track component is affected by an increase in maximum permissible axle load. The rail will be exposed to a higher amount of wear, an increased risk for rail defects and plastic deformation of the rail head. Rail damage is most easily prevented by rail grinding and rail lubrication in sharp curves. More extensive measures are to replace the rail with a stronger rail steel or replace with a larger rail profile. The rail fastenings will be affected by higher track forces and are particularly exposed in sharp curves. The rail fastening systems has to be replaced gradually when increasing the permissible axle load. The only fastening device, in use today, that will be approved for 40 ton axle load is the Fastclip and the strongest <b>e-clips</b> with plastic rail pads. The lifetime of the sleepers will be shortened with an increased axle load. A critical factor is the bending moment at the position of the rail {{and in the middle of}} the sleeper. According to the performed calculations all sleeper models eventually have to be replaced, except sleeper model A 22. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the sleeper strength for some models. Strength tests for each specific sleeper model should therefore be carried out. It is recommended that a research study is performed to gain knowledge about the track position and model for all the fastening systems and sleepers along the track. This in order to ease future track upgrades. A higher axle load leads to an accelerated deterioration of the ballast. Ballast cleaning is recommended in the near future to reduce the rate of ballast contamination. The ballast thickness should not be less than 50 cm, according to performed calculations. An increased axle load will cause an increased need for maintenance of the track substructure. Reinforcements have to be carried out on several bridges and culverts. This also applies to the geotechnics, which is mainly reinforced by pressure banks at track sections with poor subgrade. A complete investigation of the bearing capacity of the track subgrade should be performed. This in order to find track sections with insufficient bearing capacity. An investigation of the load carrying capacity for all bridges along the southern circuit of Malmbanan should also be performed...|$|R

Following {{concerns}} from the council at Carisbrook, {{the event was}} swiftly moved {{at the last minute}} to the new site, with the support of Buloke Shire Council. The line up once again featured a range of artists, including Ace Ventura, Alex Smoke, Basic, Chromatone, <b>E-Clip,</b> Grouch, Headroom, Human Element / DJ Martin, Hypnocoustics, Jiser, Klopfgeister, LOUD, Young Kim, Mad Maxx. By this stage, the event was still relatively small, with 2500 people attending.|$|E
40|$|Based on National Railways Master Plan (RIPNAS) of Directorate General of Railways Ministry of Transportation (2011), in 2030, {{number of}} railway pessangers in Java {{increased}} {{in the amount of}} 858. 5 million people / year and freight in Java amounted to 534 million tons / year. Therefore, the government planed to develop the railway network in Java with Double Track program or multiple pathways in order to achieve optimal service, the development of a single track to double track between Semarang Tawang Station in Semarang until Gubug station in Grobogan were included. From the design performed, the double track alignment will be placed {{on the right side of}} the existed alignment in direction from Semarang to Gubug where there are more open land availability, with the new lines elevation as high as the existed lines elevation.

40|$|Impact loads {{applied to}} {{concrete}} sleepers, either {{due to the}} wheel flats of a train or rail abnormalities, may cause the sleepers to crack. The rail pads {{have been used to}} attenuate the effect of these impact loads on concrete sleepers and on the substructures in ballasted railway tracks. The rail pads experience high intensity loads due to wheel impacts and, as a result, the pad properties deteriorate during the service life. The consequences can be significant for the dynamic behaviour of railway tracks, interaction of vehicle and track, and impact forces on track components. However, there is currently no standard method available {{that can be used to}} evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the pads. In this paper, the degradation of rail pad properties as a function of their in-service life is studied with a view of developing a technique for predicting the optimum period of track maintenance with regard to pad replacement. Identification of structural properties using methods of experimental modal analysis provides a means for investigation of the deterioration of dynamic pad characteristics. A technique using an instrumented impact hammer is employed in this study. The pad samples were collected from the railway lines in Sydney Electrified Network, Australia, which are operated by Rail Corporation New South Wales (RailCorp). Through testing of pads in a recently developed rail pad testing machine, the vibration responses were measured in the frequency range from 0 to 1000 Hz using the Bruel 2 ̆ 6 Kjaer PULSE Vibration Analyser system. The analytical solution was derived to estimate the dynamic stiffness and damping constants of the worn pads from the obtained experimental data. The rates of deterioration based on limited data are proposed to predict the useful lifetime of pads and the period of pad replacement. In this study, the type of rail pad used was the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pad with 5. 5 mm thickness. All worn pads were sourced from RailCorp tracks with approximately 22 MGT (million gross tons) annual tonnage. Based on linear regression analysis, it has been determined that at 20 kN preload (equivalent to PANDROL <b>e-Clip</b> fastening system clamping force) degradation of dynamic stiffness and damping is about 2. 2 MN/m and 19. 6 Ns/m per MGT, respectively, for the particular track conditions...|$|E
