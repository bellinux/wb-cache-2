5|$|During his presidency, Endara {{abolished}} the Panamanian military {{and replaced it}} with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates. His administration was marked by internal fighting and corruption scandals, and his popularity plummeted. He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares on September 1, 1994.|$|E

5|$|The Ely and Littleport riots of 1816, {{also known}} as the Ely riots or Littleport riots, {{occurred}} between 22 and 24 May 1816 in Littleport, Cambridgeshire.

5|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} January 1934, New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia tapped Robert Moses {{to head a}} newly unified Parks Department. Moses soon prepared extensive plans to reconstruct the city's parks, renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools, zoos, playgrounds and parks. Moses acquired substantial Civil Works Administration, and later, Works Progress Administration funding and soon embarked upon an eight-year citywide construction program, relieving some of the <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> in New York City in this Depression year.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' {{residents}} {{worked in}} Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% {{of the economy}} in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, {{one of the reasons for}} the <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I show how <b>higher</b> <b>unemployment</b> {{in a region}} may reduce thepopulation's {{residential}} mobility within that region. A period of <b>higher</b> <b>unemployment</b> creates more uncertainty among individuals about future income and place of employment so those with significant moving costs {{are more likely to}} consider delaying a move. Periods of relatively <b>higher</b> <b>unemployment</b> may also be characterized by fewer new hirings and fewer job quits, both of which tend to dampen mobility. A multinomial logit analysis using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data is used to examine the effect of state unemployment rates on the decision to move.

5|$|By 1959, {{more than}} 1,000 homes a year were being constructed. By the late 1970s, the {{economic}} growth was over for both downtown and local businesses and industries. The farm crisis of the 1980s hit Davenport {{and the rest of}} the Quad Cities hard, with <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> and financial hardships. 35,000 workers lost their jobs throughout the entire Quad Cities area. The Caterpillar Plant on the cities north side closed, causing many jobs to be lost.|$|E
5|$|Deptford {{experienced}} {{economic decline}} in the 20th century with {{the closing of the}} docks, and the damage caused by the bombing during the Second World War - a V-2 rocket destroyed a Woolworths store (now New Cross Gate), killing 160 people. <b>High</b> <b>unemployment</b> caused some of the population to move away as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The local council have developed plans with private companies to regenerate the riverside area, and the town centre.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of <b>high</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E

Vichy troops in the country were defeated by the Allied forces in July and Quwatli left Syria during the campaign. He returned in 1942. France officially recognized Syria's independence on 27 September. However, French troops were not withdrawn and national elections were postponed by the French Mandatory authorities.|$|E
5|$|On {{moving into}} , Thatcher {{introduced}} {{a series of}} political and economic initiatives intended to reverse <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> and Britain's struggles {{in the wake of the}} Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{ran against}} Democratic {{incumbent}} Jimmy Carter and independent candidate John B. Anderson. He was praised by supporters {{for running a}} campaign of upbeat optimism. Aided by the Iran hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home marked by <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> and inflation, Reagan won the election in a massive landslide. The 1980 presidential election {{marked the beginning of}} the Reagan Era, and signified a conservative realignment in national politics. At 69 years old, Reagan became the oldest person ever elected U.S. president until 2017, when President Donald Trump was sworn in at the age of 70.|$|E

5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s {{by the collapse}} of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} of the {{political}} spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E

5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and <b>high</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The two establishments were {{constructed}} in South East Northumberland {{as part of}} an incentive to lower the <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> numbers. The site was also chosen because of the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries. Ellington Colliery sunk in 1909, with Lynemouth Colliery sinking 18 years later. However, in 1968, the two collieries were connected underground by the Bewick Drift, from which coal was brought to the surface. The Drift had no rail connection, and so coal was sent to the washery at Lynemouth by conveyor belt. The power station was constructed nearby the end of the conveyor belt.|$|E
5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's <b>high</b> <b>unemployment</b> meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E
