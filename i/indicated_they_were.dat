5|$|Game 1 {{was held}} in Washington, where Capitals owner Ted Leonsis took steps to prevent Penguins' fans from {{purchasing}} tickets, such as not selling tickets to customers whose 724 or 412 area code <b>indicated</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> from Western Pennsylvania. Crosby scored to give the Penguins a first period lead, but Washington scored two goals before {{the conclusion of the}} period. Mark Eaton tied the game in the second period, but Washington's Semyon Varlamov held the Penguins scoreless {{for the remainder of the}} game as the Capitals took a 1–0 lead in the series. The game had 40%more viewers than playoff games the previous season. In Game 2, Ovechkin and Crosby scored three goals each, though Dave Steckel's second period goal was the difference as Washington won 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Jamaican {{officials}} issued {{radio and}} television advisories for residents in low-lying areas, urging them to be ready and evacuate if necessary. The Jamaican government opened all shelters {{on the island and}} placed its armed forces on standby. Long lines for storm supplies were reported at local businesses ahead of the storm as residents rushed to obtain supplies in preparation for Ernesto's onslaught. When a tropical storm warning was put in effect for Jamaica and the central Bahamas, cruise ship companies <b>indicated</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> diverting several liners to avoid the storm.|$|E

5|$|A CRA poll {{conducted}} throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale, her government, and the PC Party. Only 21 per cent {{of those surveyed}} felt Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, behind both Michael and Ball. Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent who <b>indicated</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011. Towards the end of 2013, satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase, though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May. According to a November CRA poll, satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent, while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent. A quarter of decided voters thought Dundedale was the best choice for premier, this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball. Due to a large drop in NDP support, down to 19 percent, the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that they would vote for the party in an election. The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters saying they would vote for the party in an election.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA <b>indicated</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E

Among Christians, adherents to the Church of England constituted 15%, Roman Catholic Church – 9%, other Christians (including Presbyterians, Methodists, other Protestants, as well as Eastern Orthodox) – 17%. 71% of young people aged 18–24 {{said they had no}} religion.|$|E

Nothing came of the proposal however. In 1946 the possibility of extending the railway to Red Lion Square, Hythe was investigated again, but the East Kent Road Car Co Ltd agreed to extend their bus service from Folkestone to terminate at the original Hythe station and the extension idea was dropped.|$|E
25|$|Even as {{peace talks}} progressed and stalled, Indonesia {{maintained}} its campaign of infiltrations. On 15 August, a headman reported an incursion in the 3rd Division and follow up <b>indicated</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> about 50 strong. A series of contacts ensued as 2/6 Gurkhas deployed patrols and ambushes, {{and after a}} month, 15 had been killed and 3 captured. The Gurkhas {{reported that they were}} well trained and professionally led, but their ammunition expenditure was high and their fire discipline broke down. The prisoners reported 300 more invaders within a week and 600 in a fortnight. The Battle of Long Jawai was the first major incursion for the centre of the 3rd Division, directed by an RPKAD Major Mulyono Soerjowardojo, who had been sent to Nangabadan earlier in the year. The proclamation of Malaysia in September 1963 meant that Malaysian Army units deployed to Borneo (now East Malaysia).|$|E
25|$|The poor <b>indicated</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{not so much}} {{concerned}} about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was {{much lower than the}} prices they had to pay to private vendors. They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. Boiling of water is frequent. Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality.|$|E

25|$|In 1988 {{two former}} PAVN officers, Nguyen Thanh Hong and Nguyen Van Kiem (a later {{commander}} of D445 Battalion)—while being {{interviewed by the}} Australian official historian, Ian McNeill—claimed {{no more than two}} battalions had been involved, less than half the lowest Australian estimate. Kiem claimed the primary force consisted of D445 Battalion reinforced by one company of North Vietnamese from Headquarters Military Region 7 with a total of 720 men, while Hong said one battalion from the 275th Regiment had also been involved and that with D445 Battalion its total strength was 700 to 800 men. They believed an entire Australian battalion had been engaged along with two squadrons of APCs, and that it had been reinforced by a second battalion the following day, while there had been hundreds of Australian casualties, citing a BBC broadcast which reported 500 killed and 21 tanks destroyed. Against this, Kiem estimated total Viet Cong losses as approximately only 30, mainly from artillery fire. Hong agreed, stating the figure of 245 killed was exaggerated by a factor of 10. Yet this was at odds with Viet Cong records later captured by US forces, with the diary of the 275th Regiment's commander listing that unit's losses as 500 dead. Captured soldiers later also stated D445 Battalion's casualties had been 70 killed and 100 wounded. Such claims were also contradicted by the Dong Nai history which stated both the 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion had been involved. Indeed, the majority of the dead buried after the battle were wearing green uniforms, and this coupled with their weapons and equipment, <b>indicated</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> either main force Viet Cong or North Vietnamese. One of the three prisoners was from D445 Battalion and the other two were North Vietnamese who claimed to be from the 45th Regiment, perhaps unaware their unit had changed its name to the 275th Regiment when operating in the south. According to them it was the artillery battalion of this regiment which had bombarded Nui Dat. Years later many of Kiem's claims about the role of D445 Battalion were found to be misleading.|$|E
