40|$|Visual {{inspection}} and classification of cigarettes packaged in a tin container {{is very important}} in manufacturing cigarette products that require high quality package presentation. For accurate automated {{inspection and}} classification, computer vision has been deployed widely in manufacturing. We present the detection of the <b>defective</b> <b>packaging</b> of tins of cigarettes by identifying individual objects in the cigarette tins. Object identification information is used for the classification of the acceptable cases (correctly packaged tins) or defective cases (incorrectly packaged tins). This paper investigates the problem of identifying the individual cigarettes and a paper spoon in the packaged tin using image processing and morphology operations. The segmentation performance was evaluated on 500 images including examples of both good cases and defective cases...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that 'all-risk' {{policies}} do not actually cover all perils. The liability of the insurer in such cases is consequently not absolute. Certain 'self-evident' exclusions, in fact, exist {{in the case of the}} liability of the insurer in an 'all risk' policy. Despite the fact that the insured procured an 'all-risk' policy, an insurer would not be liable to compensate the insured for damages resulting from all occurrences. It is crucial that the precise content and meaning of terms and especially 'wear and tear', 'leakage', 'breakage', 'inherent vice', 'latent defect' and 'defective packaging' be clear. It appears that the South African law of insurance blindly follows the English law. As a result, the potentially problematic interpretation incidental to English law is incorporated into South African insurance law. An example of this problem situation is the current interpretation of 'inherent vice' and 'defective packaging'. In English law, these terms are interpreted as being the same. It is submitted, however, that the <b>defective</b> <b>packaging</b> of a product should not be construed as an inherent vice of that product. The implication of this submission is not that an insurer should be held liable, but that the combination of these concepts as having the same meaning is not technically correct in law. In similar vein, the South African courts also follow the English courts in their superfluous distinction between 'normal' and 'abnormal' wear and tear, as well as 'normal' and 'abnormal' leakag...|$|E
40|$|Packaging is {{a complex}} subject and its role to the food {{industry}} and to the consumers includes protection, containment, transportation, preservation, and advertisement to the food industry. <b>Defective</b> <b>packaging</b> {{has the potential of}} negating all the food processor has attempted to accomplish by the most meticulous method of manufacturing processes. Nigerians have diverse ready-to-eat foods, diet and drinks varying from one tribe and geographical locations to another, with different packing materials and methods adopted. The aim of this work is to appraise the various properties of the local food packaging material used in Nigeria with particular reference to its suitability to the packaged food. A survey was carried out to ascertain the various type of local packaging materials used in Nigeria; samples of locally prepared and packaged foods were purchased from various sales outlets in Ogbomoso town, southwest Nigeria; the samples were stored at room temperature. Results shows that the common type of materials used to package food in Nigeria includes discarded bottles and jars, old stock of paper prints, leaves, maize-sheath, glass-sided boxes, jute sacks, poly sacks, polyethylene bags among others. The advantages of these materials includes availability and low cost price; while the disadvantage includes easy contamination of packaged food,easy deterioration of packaging materials, easy spillage of packaged products, poor shelf-life of packaged food among others. It is observed that the role of packaging is not accomplished in the use of these materials; also no standard of regulatory body has been effective in ensuring the safety of readyto-eat food...|$|E

Based on the shear strain values obtained from Moiré tests, the fatigue life of defective and non-defective BGA packages subjected to thermal cycling tests is predicted and compared.

40|$|Because of long {{distribution}} {{lines from}} the manufacturer to the consumer, commodities like sweets, baker's ware, cereal products and dried fruit will already be attacked by stored product insects in packages. The economical loss caused by food pests must be ranked as important. First of all food packages applied in masses by manufacturers, primarily folding cartons but also bags are little useful for protection of stored products against pests. For that reason, insect proof packages will be asked by manufacturers and packers. Research work has revealed that infestation of packed foods will be caused exclusively by untight and <b>defective</b> <b>package</b> closures. Research and development in the packaging industry will lay stress upon an improved closure technique. Moreover high technical efficiency will be claimed for mechanical packaging. Besides a perfect machine compatibility of the packaging material a good adhesive technique is a necessary condition which allows manufacturing of package clo sures without pores and holes. As an example for a new packaging and adhesive technique, the so-called "Sift-Proof" procedure combined with the "Foam Melt"-method is described...|$|R

Since then we have made several improvements {{with respect to the}} safety, flexibility, and efficiency of the vector system. A three-plasmid expression system is used to generate pseudotyped HIV- 1 particles by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 T cells with a <b>defective</b> <b>packaging</b> construct, a plasmid coding for a heterologous envelope (Env) protein, and a vector construct harboring a reporter gene such as neo, ShlacZ (encoding a phleomycin resistance/β-galactosidase fusion protein), HSA (encoding mouse heat-stable antigen), or EGFP (encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein). The packaging constructs lack functional Vif, Vpr, and Vpu proteins and/or {{a large portion of the}} Env coding region as well as the 5 ′ and 3 ′ long terminal repeats, the Nef function, and the presumed packaging signal. Using G 418 selection, we routinely obtained vector particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) with titers of up to 8 × 107 CFU/μg of p 24, provided that a functional Tat coding region was present in the vector. Vector constructs lacking a functional Tat protein yielded titers of around 4 × 106 to 8 × 106 CFU/μg of p 24. Packaging constructs with a mutation within the integrase (IN) core domain profoundly affected colony formation and expression of the reporter genes, indicating that a functional IN protein is required for efficient transduction. We explored the abilities of other Env proteins to allow formation of pseudotyped HIV- 1 particles. The rabies virus and Mokola virus G proteins yielded high-titer infectious pseudotypes, while the human foamy virus Env protein did not. Using the improved vector system, we successfully transduced contact-inhibited primary human skin fibroblasts and postmitotic rat cerebellar neurons and cardiac myocytes, a process not affected by the lack of the accessory proteins...|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis B viruses encode a {{polymerase}} (P) protein {{with key}} roles in both reverse transcription and genomic RNA encapsidation. Genetic analysis of cis-acting signals required for viral replication implicates an RNA stem-loop structure in both RNA packaging and {{the initiation of}} reverse transcription, {{a process in which}} P protein also serves as the primer. We now show that duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) polymerase binds specifically and with high affinity to this RNA stem-loop structure. Mutational analysis indicates that all mutations in the RNA target that inhibit the P protein-RNA interaction inhibit both in vivo RNA packaging and in vitro DNA priming to comparable extents. However, certain mutations in the loop region of the RNA have minimal impact on P protein-RNA binding but are nonetheless severely <b>defective</b> for <b>packaging</b> and DNA synthesis. Thus, P protein-RNA complex formation is necessary but not sufficient to initiate these activities.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to identify and characterize the protein machinery that functions in the intracellular translocation and assembly of peroxisomal proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several genes encoding proteins that are essential for this process have been identified previously by Kunau and collaborators, but the mutant collection was incomplete. We have devised a positive selection procedure that identifies new mutants lacking peroxisomes or peroxisomal function. Immunofluorescence procedures for yeast were simplified so that these mutants could be rapidly and efficiently screened for those in which peroxisome biogenesis is impaired. With these tools, we have identified four complementation groups of peroxisome biogenesis mutants, and one group that appears to express reduced amounts of peroxisomal proteins. Two of our mutants lack recognizable peroxisomes, although they might contain peroxisomal membrane ghosts like those found in Zellweger syndrome. Two are selectively <b>defective</b> in <b>packaging</b> peroxisomal proteins and moreover show striking intracellular clustering of the peroxisomes. The distribution of mutants among complementation groups implies that the collection of peroxisome biogenesis mutants is still incomplete.

Members of the human APOBEC 3 family of cytidine deaminases can inhibit {{a wide range of}} endogenous, as well as exogenous, retroelements. These enzymes are structurally organized in one or two domains comprising a zinc-coordinating motif. APOBEC 3 G contains two such domains, only the C terminal of which is endowed with editing activity, while its N-terminal counterpart binds RNA, promotes homo-oligomerization, and is necessary for packaging into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) virions. Here, we performed a large-scale mutagenesis-based analysis of the APOBEC 3 G N terminus, testing mutants for (i) inhibition of vif-defective HIV- 1 infection and Alu retrotransposition, (ii) RNA binding, and (iii) oligomerization. Furthermore, in the absence of structural information on this domain, we used homology modeling to examine the positions of functionally important residues and of residues found to be under positive selection by phylogenetic analyses of primate APOBEC 3 G genes. Our results reveal the importance of a predicted RNA binding dimerization interface both for packaging into HIV- 1 virions and inhibition of both HIV- 1 infection and Alu transposition.

Their ability to infect human cells and their utility as gene therapy vectors were not well characterized. To address this issue, primary and immortalized human cells were tested for their ability to be infected by MCF <b>packaged</b> <b>defective</b> vectors as well as replication competent MCF virus. A new packaging cell line, called MPAC, was created to <b>package</b> <b>defective</b> retroviral vectors in virus particles with envelope proteins derived from a Moloney mink cell focus-inducing (Mo-MCF) virus. The cellular tropism of MPAC-packaged retroviral vectors was the same as replication competent MCF viruses. Testing various established cell lines showed some human cell lines could be infected with MPAC-packaged vectors while others cannot. In addition, I show that some human cells fully support MCF virus replication while others either partially or fully restrict MCF virus replication. This indicates that some human cells express a protein on their surface that acts as a receptor for MCF viruses and allows MCF viral entry. In addition, the human cells that express a receptor for MCF viral entry did not show any further block to viral replication. An important determinant in the pathogenic phenotype of MCF 247 has been mapped to the enhancer region of the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR). Recombination of endogenous genetic elements with the 32 ̆ 7 portion of env occurs and incorporates unique LTR sequences.

The sources of silica dust may arise from air supply to emplacement drifts as well as host rock around emplacement drifts. For this calculation, the source of dust is conservatively assumed to be the host rock (Assumption 3. 6), which is subject to long-term neutron exposure resulting in saturated radioactivity.

Aam 42 terminase was more strongly dependent than wild-type terminase on gpFI, the catalyst of prohead binding.

40|$|Previous {{genetic and}} {{biochemical}} studies performed with {{several members of}} the Alphaherpesvirus subfamily have shown that the UL 31 and UL 34 proteins are essential components of the molecular machinery that mediates the primary egress of newly assembled capsids across the nuclear membrane. Further, there is substantial evidence that BFLF 2 and BFRF 1, the respective positional homologs of UL 31 and UL 34 in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome, are also their functional homologs, i. e., that the UL 31 /UL 34 pathway is common to distant herpesviruses. However, the low degree of protein sequence identity between UL 31 and BFLF 2 would argue against such a hypothesis. To further clarify this issue, we have constructed a recombinant EBV strain devoid of BFLF 2 (Delta BFLF 2) and show that BFLF 2 is crucial for efficient virus production but not for lytic DNA replication or B-cell transformation. This defective phenotype could be efficiently restored by trans complementation with a BFLF 2 expression plasmid. Detailed analysis of replicating cells by electron microscopy revealed that, as expected, Delta BFLF 2 viruses not only failed to egress from the nucleus but also showed <b>defective</b> DNA <b>packaging.</b> Nonfunctional primary egress did not, however, impair the production and extracellular release of enveloped but empty viral particles that comprised L particles containing tegument-like structures and a few virus-like particles carrying empty capsids.

40|$|The N-proximal {{region of}} cowpea {{chlorotic}} mottle virus (CCMV) capsid protein (CP) contains an argininerich RNA binding motif (ARM) {{that is also}} found in the CPs of other members of Bromoviridae and in other RNA binding proteins such as the Tat and Rev proteins of human immunodeficiency virus. To assess the critical role played by this motif during encapsidation, a variant of CCMV RNA 3 (C 3) precisely lacking the ARM region (C 3 /� 919) of its CP gene was constructed. The biology and the competence of the matured CP derived in vivo from C 3 /� 919 to assemble and package progeny RNA was examined in whole plants. Image analysis and computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction of wild-type and mutant virions revealed that the CP subunits bearing the engineered deletion assembled into polymorphic virions with altered surface topology. Northern blot analysis of virion RNA from mutant progeny demonstrated that the engineered mutation down-regulated packaging of all four viral RNAs; however, the packaging effect was more pronounced on genomic RNA 1 and RNA 2 than genomic RNA 3 and its CP mRNA. In vitro assembly assays with mutant CP subunits and RNA transcripts demonstrated that the mutant CP is inherently not <b>defective</b> in <b>packaging</b> genomic RNA 1 (53 %) and RNA 2 (54 %), but their incorporation into virions was competitively inhibited by the presence of other viral RNAs.

Susceptibility of sperm nuclear DNA to dithiothreitol (DTT) -induced decondensation, as measured by ethidium bromide binding, was markedly high compared with values at day 0 in men and monkeys during periods when FSH antibody titer was high. Sperm chromatin structure assay yields α t values, which is another index of chromatin packaging. Higher α t values, signifying poor packaging, occurred in both species following immunization with heterologous pituitary FSH. The binding of fluorosceinated pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA-FITC) to acrosome of sperm of monkeys and men was significantly low, compared with values at day 0 (control) during periods when cross-reactive FSH antibody titer was high and endogenous FSH was not detectable. Blockade of FSH function in monkeys by active immunization with a recombinant oFSH receptor protein corresponding to a naturally occurring messenger RNA (mRNA) also resulted in production of sperm with similar defects in chromatin packaging and reduced acrosomal glycoprotein concentration. Thus, it appears that in monkeys and men, lack of FSH signaling results in production of sperm that exhibit <b>defective</b> chromatin <b>packaging</b> and reduction in acrosomal glycoprotein content.

Frenkel, Cell 30 : 295 - 304, 1982) have {{documented}} the potential use of defective virus vectors (amplicons) derived from {{herpes simplex virus}} for the efficient introduction of foreign DNA sequences into eucaryotic cells. Specifically, cotransfection of cells with helper virus DNA and cloned amplicons (8 to 10 kilobases [kb]) containing bacterial plasmid DNA sequences linked {{to a set of}} herpes simplex virus cis-acting propagation signals (a replication origin and a cleavage-packaging signal) resulted in the generation of virus stocks containing <b>packaged</b> <b>defective</b> genomes that consisted of uniform head-to-tail reiterations of the chimeric seed amplicon sequences. The chimeric defective genomes could be stably propagated in virus stocks and could thus be used to efficiently infect cells. We now report on additional studies designed to propagate relatively large sets of eucaryotic DNA sequences within chimeric <b>packaged</b> <b>defective</b> genomes. These studies have utilized a 12 -kb chicken DNA sequence encoding the chicken ovalbumin gene and cloned by Lai et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77 : 244 - 248, 1980) in the plasmid pOV 12. Virus stocks derived from cells cotransfected with helper virus DNA and chimeric amplicons (overall size of 19. 8 kb, of which 12 kb corresponded to the chicken DNA) contained defective genomes composed of reiterations of the 19. 8 -kb seed amplicon sequences. However, in addition to the authentically sized repeat units, defective genomes in the derivative virus stocks contained smaller repeat units representing deleted versions of the seed 19. 8 -kb amplicons. The recombinational events leading to the formation of deleted repeats did not appear to occur at unique sites, as shown by comparative analyses of multiple, independently generated virus series propagated from separate transfections. In contast, seed amplicons ranging in size from 11 to 15 kb and containing subsets of the 12 -kb chicken DNA sequences replicated efficiently and could be stably propagated in virus stocks.

METHODS: Sperm samples were obtained from 12 infertile, oligozoospermic patients and 12 healthy normozoospermic volunteers. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) {{was used to determine}} aneuploidy rates in sperm and inverse restriction site mutation (iRSM) assay to determine gene mutations; <b>defective</b> chromatin <b>packaging</b> was quantified by sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) and DNA strand breaks by the Comet assay. RESULTS: FISH analysis showed a significant increase in gonosomal X,Y, 18 (P < 0. 01) disomy and diploid sperm with X,Y, 18, 18 (P < 0. 05) in the infertility patients compared with the controls. A significant increase (P < 0. 01) in disturbed sperm chromatin was found in the infertility patients compared with the control group using the SCSA assay. In the Comet assay, a significant increase (P < 0. 01) in the tail moment was found in the infertility patients compared with the control group, indicating significantly high levels of DNA strand breaks. There was no significant increase in point mutations detected by iRSM assay. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that infertile oligozoospermic men have an elevated level of XY aneuploidy and XY diploidy in the germ-line, as well as elevated levels of sperm chromatin disturbances and sperm DNA strand breaks. These data demonstrate that oligozoospermic infertility patients show several different types of genetic damage in their sperm.

40|$|Defective genomes {{present in}} {{serially}} passaged {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) stocks {{have been shown to}} consist of tandemly arranged repeat units containing limited sets of the standard virus DNA sequences. Invariably, the HSV defective genomes terminate with the right (S component) terminus of HSV DNA. Because the oligomeric forms can arise from a single repeat unit, it has been concluded that the defective genomes arise by a rolling circle mechanism of replication. We now report on our studies of <b>defective</b> genomes <b>packaged</b> in viral capsids accumulating in the nuclei and in mature virions (enveloped capsids) translocated into the cytoplasm of cells infected with serially passaged virus. These studies have revealed that, upon electrophoresis in agarose gels, the defective genomes prepared from cytoplasmic virions comigrated with nondefective standard virus DNA (Mr 100 × 106). In contrast, DNA prepared from capsids accumulating in nuclei consisted of both full-length defective virus DNA molecules and smaller DNA molecules of discrete sizes, ranging in Mr from 5. 5 to 100 × 106. These smaller DNA species were shown to consist of different integral numbers (from 1 to approximately 18) of defective genome repeat units and to terminate with sequences corresponding to the right terminal sequences of HSV DNA. We conclude {{on the basis of these}} studies that (i) sequences from the right end of standard virus DNA contain a recognition signal for the cleavage and packaging of concatemeric viral DNA, (ii) the sequence-specific cleavage is either a prerequisite for or occurs during the entry of viral DNA into capsid structures, and (iii) DNA molecules significantly shorter than full-length standard viral DNA can become encapsidated within nuclear capsids provided they contain the cleavage/packaging signal.

Method: The templates for the sense or antisense RNA were polymerase chain reaction-cloned from HIV pNL 43 into a murine leukaemia virus-based vector and corresponding <b>defective</b> virions were <b>packaged</b> in PA 317 cells. Human Jurkat T cells transduced with these vectors were challenged with HIV and monitored for viral RNA, viral DNA and p 24 production for 23 weeks. Results: Intracellular expression of HIV sense RU 5 sequences (RNA complementary to minus-strand strong-stop DNA) enhanced HIV replication in T cells. Expression of HIV sense or antisense U 3 RU 5 sequences (identical or complementary to plus-strand strong-stop DNA) conferred long-term inhibition of HIV replication, despite continuous presence of viral challenge in the transduced cell cultures. Conclusion: Plus-strand strong-stop DNA as an intermediate in the early process of viral reverse transcription can be explored as an additional target for anti-HIV gene therapy.

The formation of transport vesicles in vitro requires the incubation of an ER-membrane fraction with three protein fractions collectively known as coat protein II (COPII; Sar 1 p, Sec 23 p/Sec 24 p, and Sec 13 p/Sec 31 p). We used this assay to investigate how targeting [v-SNARE, vesicle-soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein receptor], putative adapter (e. g., Emp 24 p), and cargo molecules are captured into ER-derived COPII vesicles. Analysis of fusion proteins {{strongly suggests that}} the cytoplasmic domain of the v-SNARE protein Sec 22 p is required for its packaging into ER-derived COPII vesicles. We examined the packaging requirements for various molecules by individually titrating each of the COPII components. More Sar 1 p (the GTP-binding protein that initiates vesicles budding) is needed to package the membrane-associated v-SNAREs and Emp 24 p than is needed to package the soluble secretory protein glycosylated pro-α-factor (gpαF). Microsomes prepared from a strain overproducing Sec 12 p (the nucleotide exchange protein that recruits Sar 1 p to the ER) produce vesicles containing gpαF without the addition of exogenous Sar 1 p, whereas the v-SNAREs and Emp 24 p are not efficiently packaged under these conditions. Addition of Sar 1 p to these microsomes leads to increased packaging of v-SNAREs and Emp 24 p with no increase in the packaging of gpαF. Finally, we show that membranes prepared from strains with mutations in the SEC 16 gene are more <b>defective</b> for the <b>packaging</b> of v-SNARE molecules and Emp 24 p than they are for the packaging of gpαF.

Seshaiah, G. Natsoulis, J. D. Boeke, B. H. Hahn, and J. C. Kappes, J. Virol. 69 : 3389 - 3398, 1995). To explore the possibility of utilizing Vpx and Vpr to target dominant negative mutants of the HIV Pol proteins into virions, we fused HIV- 2 Vpx with an enzymatically defective protease (PR) mutant. Using a vector system to facilitate transient coexpression with HIV provirus, Vpx-PR-mutant (VpxPR(M)) fusion protein was expressed and packaged efficiently into HIV- 2 and simian immunodeficiency virus virions. Immunoblot analysis of purified virions demonstrated that the packaging of VpxPR(M) interfered with the processing of the Gag and Gag/Pol precursor proteins, {{similar to that of}} a well-characterized active-site PR inhibitor. The incomplete processing of Gag and Gag/Pol was consistent with a 25 -fold reduction in virion infectivity. The coexpression of a <b>packaging</b> <b>defective</b> VpxPR(M) fusion protein with HIV- 2 provirus produced virions with fully processed Gag protein, similar to wild-type virions. Importantly, virions trans complemented with a Vpx-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion protein were normal with respect to the processing of Gag protein and the ability to infect and replicate in vitro. These results indicate that VpxPR(M) specifically inhibited the function of the viral protease and provide for the first time proof of principle that the incorporation of foreign proteins into virions via fusion with Vpx can inhibit HIV replication. The use of accessory proteins as vehicles to deliver deleterious proteins to virions, including dominant negative mutants of Pol proteins, may provide new opportunities for application of gene therapy-based antiretroviral strategies. The ability to package PR by expression in trans, independent of the Gag/Pol precursor, also represents a novel approach that may be exploited to study the function of the Pol proteins...|$|R
40|$|Huntington's disease (HD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease caused by a CAG-triplet expansion in the gene encoding the protein huntingtin. The disease typically starts in mid-life and progresses for 15 - 20 years. To date no effective treatment is available for curing the disease. HD primarily affects the striatum, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. At later stages cell death {{is evident in the}} striatum and cerebral cortex. Interestingly, some non-neuronal tissues such as muscle and the endocrine pancreas are also affected. A larger than normal proportion of HD patients develop diabetes mellitus. Traditionally the majority of symptoms were believed to be caused by extensive neuronal death. However, recent studies indicate that neuronal dysfunction plays a central role for symptom development at the early to middle stages of the disease. In this thesis we have aimed at (1) studying the proteins involved in neurotransmitter docking and release at the active zones of the presynapse in patient samples and mouse models of HD; (2) assessing the function of the cholinergic neurons in HD and (3) investigating the intracellular transport and release of insulin in insulin-secreting clonal beta-cells expressing wild-type or mutant huntingtin. We describe a loss of several proteins important for vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release in patient brain samples and in brains from mouse models of HD. Moreover, we have observed a <b>defective</b> synthesis and <b>packaging</b> of acetylcholine in a mouse model of HD and in patient brain tissues. Taken together, these studies indicate that there is a defective neurotransmitter handling and release. Possibly this could underlie some of the cognitive defects and the progressive dementia that are integral parts of HD symptomatology. In beta-cells we detected an early reduction of insulin release in mutant huntingtin expressing cells. The decreased insulin secretion is not explained by decreased insulin synthesis or cell death due to mutant huntingtin. Instead we observed a slowed intracellular transport of insulin-containing vesicles. We suggest that this, in combination with a decreased insulin production, could cause diabetes mellitus in mouse models of HD and in patients. In summary, we have observed alterations in the intracellular transport, neurotransmitter synthesis, handling and release in cell and mouse models of HD and in HD patient brains. The data indicate that cellular dysfunction, rather than cell death, may underlie some of the early symptoms of HD. This suggests that enhancing synaptic functions may be a novel approach to therapeutic intervention in HD...|$|R
40|$|Many viruses {{protect their}} genome in a protein capsid. Viral capsid {{formation}} involves {{the association of}} multiple copies of viral capsid protein subunits, representing single or multiple protein species, and different assembly strategies are utilized. Pseudomonas phage phi 6 uses an assembly pathway in which an empty capsid (procapsid, PC) is first assembled, serving as a compartment for the subsequent encapsidation of the RNA genome. During encapsidation, the compact, empty PC undergoes conformational rearrangement to reach its final expanded form. The phi 6 PC is composed of the main structural protein, P 1, and three minor protein species: the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase P 2, the packaging nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) P 4, and the assembly cofactor P 7. In vitro systems of phi 6 assembly, genome encapsidation, and transcription have been established, allowing infectious particles to be constructed from purified protein and RNA components. In this thesis, stoichiometric measurements were established to estimate the relative copy numbers of PC proteins in phi 6 virions and PCs. Different concentrations of the phi 6 minor proteins were employed in in vitro assembly reactions to probe potential PC binding sites. The results indicate that potential binding sites for proteins P 2 and P 7 are only partially occupied in phi 6 virions and recombinant PCs. High P 7 occupancy in self-assembled PCs resulted in reduced P 2 incorporation, suggesting some correlation between P 2 and P 7 during PC assembly. Although high P 4 hexamer occupancy was critical for initial particle formation, a large excess of P 4 in the self-assembly reaction slowed the rate of PC self-assembly, which may be ascribed to excessive production of P 1 -P 4 nucleation complexes. In addition, electrostatic interactions were demonstrated {{to be the main}} driving force in phi 6 PC assembly. Furthermore, it was shown that P 4 hexamers spontaneously dissociate from the empty capsid shell. P 4 -deficient particles have slower sedimentation velocity and an expanded appearance compared to the PC that has full-occupancy of P 4. These particles are also <b>defective</b> in RNA <b>packaging</b> and transcription. However, purified P 4 hexamers can efficiently assemble on P 4 -deficient particles, guiding the particles to their naive compact conformation and rescuing packaging and transcription activities. The results obtained from this study provide new insight into the principles of viral capsid assembly and demonstrate the reversibility of the PC maturation pathway.

40|$|The UL 33 gene of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) encodes a 130 amino acid (aa) protein that is {{essential}} for the cleavage of concatemeric viral DNA into monomeric genomes and their packaging into preformed capsids. Several lines of evidence have suggested that UL 33, along with the UL 15 and UL 28 gene products, forms part of a terminase enzyme responsible for catalysing this process. This thesis describes the creation and characterisation of a number of UL 33 insertion mutants in an effort to examine structure-function relationships within this protein and gain further insights into its function. Sixteen distinct mutants, encoding polypeptides with 5 aa insertions located at 14 separate positions throughout the protein, were generated. The abilities of these mutants to complement the DNA packaging and growth defects of viruses lacking functional copies of UL 33 (the null mutant dlUL 33 and the temperature sensitive mutant ts 1233) were examined. Nine of the mutants were defective in both assays, and the capacity of all 16 mutants to support DNA packaging correlated precisely with their ability to complement virus growth. Regions of UL 33 sensitive to insertion displayed a high degree of sequence conservation with UL 33 homologues of other herpesviruses. In agreement with previous reports, a direct interaction between UL 33 and UL 28 was demonstrated in immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays. Although all sixteen mutants appeared to interact with UL 28 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, four of the insertion mutants were defective in co-localisation with UL 28 in immunofluorescence assays. Interestingly, of these four mutants, three supported DNA packaging to wt levels. Similar experiments confirmed that UL 33 interacts directly with UL 15, and immunofluorescence assays indicated that none of the mutants was impaired in this interaction. Novel interactions were also demonstrated between UL 33 and the HSV- 1 DNA packaging proteins UL 6 and UL 25. UL 6 forms a portal vertex through which DNA is inserted into capsids, whilst UL 25 is thought to play a structural role in stabilising capsids upon addition of DNA and is required only during the latter stages of encapsidation. All sixteen UL 33 mutants were again able to interact with both partners in immunofluorescence assays. Of the remaining HSV- 1 proteins necessary for genome encapsidation, neither UL 17 nor UL 32 interacted with UL 33. Immunofluorescence studies of virally infected cells revealed that UL 15 was necessary for the localisation of the remaining terminase components (UL 28 and UL 33) to nuclear sites of viral DNA replication, where packaging occurs. This is consistent with a model originally proposed by Yang et al. (J. Virol. 81 : 6419 - 6433, 2007), who suggested that a nuclear localisation signal within UL 15 was necessary for the nuclear import of the terminase complex. Similar experiments revealed that, in the absence of UL 6, none of the terminase components localised to replication compartments (RCs), suggesting that UL 6 might be required for retaining the terminase at sites of DNA packaging. Together, the data presented in this thesis are consistent with UL 33 forming part of the HSV- 1 terminase via its interactions with UL 15 and UL 28. It is also possible that UL 33 contributes to the transient interaction of terminase with the portal protein, UL 6, during packaging. Although the interaction between UL 33 and UL 25 warrants further examination, it could be relevant to the mechanism by which UL 25 is recruited to capsids and functions at the late stages of the head-filling process. Surprisingly, no clear evidence was obtained that any of the 16 mutants was defective in interactions with UL 6, UL 15, UL 25 or UL 28. It is therefore not yet possible to conclude whether the observed interactions of UL 33 with these four proteins are essential for viral DNA packaging. By the same token, the reason(s) why nine of the 16 mutants are <b>defective</b> in DNA <b>packaging</b> remains unclear, but {{does not appear to be}} associated with their ability to form known protein-protein interactions or to localise to sites of DNA packaging. The development of cell free systems and biochemical assays will be an important step in further characterising these proteins. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
