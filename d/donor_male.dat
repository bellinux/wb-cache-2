40|$|A {{potential}} possible therapy, Myoblast Transfer Therapy (MTT), for {{the lethal}} childhood myopathy Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), is the transplantation of myogenic cells (myoblasts) into the diseased skeletal muscle {{in order to}} replace the missing gene product, dystrophin. To date, experimental studies in animal models and clinical trials of this therapy in patients have shown little or no success. Immunological rejection of the transplanted (donor) myoblasts appears {{to be one of}} the major problems. To overcome this problem, the effect of immunomanipulating the host environment was investigated using female dystrophic mdx mice and a Y-chromosome specific probe to track the <b>donor</b> <b>male</b> myoblasts. Peripheral T-cells of adult female mdx host mice were depleted using anti-CD 4 and CDS antibodies, and naive T-cells were tolerised to the <b>donor</b> <b>male</b> myoblasts (C 57 Bl/ 10 Sn) by injection of these myoblasts "directly into the host thymus. Grafts of sliced <b>donor</b> <b>male</b> muscle were then implanted into leg muscles of these treated mdx hosts and the muscles sampled after 1, 3 and 12 weeks. The migration of donor myoblasts away from the sliced muscle grafts and their fusion with host myofibres was significantly enhanced in muscles of the immunomanipulated hosts, compared with untreated hosts. This was marked at 3 weeks and sustained at 12 weeks. Thus, depletion of peripheral T-cells either alone or combined with induction of host tolerance, significantly enhances the success of MTT and represents a promising long-term strategy without the adverse side effects associated with long-term use of immunosupressive drugs.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} {{studies have shown}} that mate choice copying is a viable mating strategy under certain conditions. Copying experiments in fish have been conducted primarily in the laboratory, except for one study conducted in the field under artificial conditions. We investigated whether in a wild population of the coral reef whitebelly damselfish (Amblyglyphidodon leucogaster) females copy the choice of other females. Females preferentially spawn with males that have recently mated. To determine if the presence of new eggs in the nest was the reason females chose mates or whether females were mate choice copying, we conducted egg-switching experiments. Eggs from males that recently mated were donated to males that had no eggs. If females are mate choice copying, then <b>donor</b> <b>males</b> with no eggs in the nest should continue to receive additional eggs. If females are using the presence of new eggs as the criterion for mate choice, then foster males with new eggs should receive additional eggs. We found that <b>donor</b> <b>males</b> received new eggs significantly more often than expected. More females mated with <b>donor</b> <b>males</b> than foster males. Furthermore, females preferentially chose to mate with males whom they had seen mating with another female. Females appear to remember the mate choice of other females and choose to mate with those same males even after 1 day. These results suggest that females may be copying the mating decision of other females rather than choosing males based on the presence of new eggs in the nest.

40|$|Microsurgical {{models of}} vein-to-artery graft surgery have been {{developed}} in rats {{as a means of}} assessing vein graft adaptation and neo-intimal hyperplasia. Neo-intimal hyperplasia in these grafts is often attributed, at least in part, to an adaptive response by venous smooth muscle cells to the increased intraluminal pressure of the arterial pressure. However, considerable evidence suggests complete or near-complete cellular replacement in these grafts. A series of experiments were undertaken in which male vein or artery grafts were placed into either allogeneic female nude rat hosts or into syngeneic WKy female hosts as a means of determining donor cell survival. Grafts were removed at postsurgery week 2 or week 6 and the fate of the <b>donor</b> <b>male</b> cells assessed by PCR amplification of the testis-determining gene Sry. The Sry gene was undetectable in 2 -week male to female vein grafts. When left for 6 weeks, donor cells were detectable in vein grafts only after multiple 50 -cycle PCR analyses. Minimal donor cell survival was not due to an allograft response, as <b>donor</b> <b>male</b> cells were readily detectable in WKy male to female nude rat artery-to-artery grafts.

There was a small but statistically significant increase in both collagen content and mineral content of bone 1 mo after the infusion. Similar results were obtained with infusion of relatively large amounts of wild-type whole marrow cells into the transgenic mice.

For female to male transplants, a WR of greater than 0. 9 is recommended. MethodsThe United Network for Organ Sharing database was examined for adult HT from 1999 to 2011. Controls with a WR of 0. 9 or greater (normal donor to recipient weight ratio) {{were compared with}} patients with a WR of 0. 6 to 0. 89 (WRL) and a WR of less than 0. 59 (WRVL).

ResultsOf the 21, 928 patients undergoing HT, 14, 592 (66. 6 %) were performed with a normal donor to recipient weight ratio, 7212 (32. 9 %) were performed with WRL, and 124 (0. 6 %) were performed with WRVL. In <b>male</b> <b>donor</b> to <b>male</b> recipient, <b>male</b> <b>donor</b> to female recipient, and female donor to female recipient HT, the use of WRL did not influence median survival (P = . 3621) and {{was not associated with}} increased mortality (P = . 7273).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Separate {{transmission}} {{networks for}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) coexist. Molecular typing of viral genomes can provide insight in HIV transmission routes in donors for whom risk behavior-based donor selection failed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study includes all HIV-infected Dutch and Flemish donors in the period 2005 to 2014 (n= 55). Part of the HIV polymerase (pol) gene was amplified, sequenced, and compared with more than 10, 000 HIV strains obtained from HIV-infected Dutch and Flemish patients. The most likely transmission route was determined based on HIV phylogeny and the donor's self-reported risk behavior during the exit interview. RESULTS: HIV-infected <b>donors</b> were predominantly <b>male</b> (69 %), were repeat donors (73 %), {{were born in the}} Netherlands or Belgium (95 %), and harbored HIV Subtype B (68 %). Seventy-five percent of HIV-infected <b>male</b> <b>donors</b> were part of robust phylogenetic clusters linked to male-to-male sex, while only 24 % of HIV-infected <b>male</b> <b>donors</b> reported male-to-male sex during posttest counseling. Sex between men and women accounted for 13 % of HIV infections in <b>male</b> <b>donors</b> and 93 % of HIV infections in female donors based on phylogenetic analysis. Only 40 % of HIV-infected female donors had HIV Subtype B; 65 % of female donors reported a foreign partner and indeed HIV sequences interspersed with sequences from HIV-endemic areas abroad, in particular sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSION: HIV typing helps to understand HIV transmission routes in donor populations.

40|$|Our {{previous}} study {{suggested that the}} alarm pheromones in rats could be divided into at least two functionally different categories: one evoking autonomic responses and the other evoking behavioral responses, and {{the present study was}} conducted to test this hypothesis. Four regions of the body surface, i. e. the whisker pad, neck, rump and perianal region, of an anesthetized male Wistar rat were electrically stimulated (donor) and, after removal of the donor, the recipient rat was introduced into the same box and its behavioral and autonomic changes were recorded. Electrical stimulation of the perianal region of anesthetized donor rats provoked the release of odor that subsequently augmented core body temperature in other awake male rats. By contrast, electrical stimulation of the whisker pad of anesthetized <b>donor</b> <b>males</b> provoked the release of odor that augmented sniffing, rearing and locomotor activity in other awake male subjects. These results suggest that the alarm pheromone released from the face modifies behavior and that from the anal area induces autonomic stress responses in recipients...|$|R
