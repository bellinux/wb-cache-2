40|$|Monolithic {{integration}} of step-up DC-DC converters {{used to be}} one of the largest challenges in <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> CMOS SoCs. Charge pumps are considered as the most promising solution regarding in- tegration levels compared to boost converter with bulky inductors. However, conventional charge pump architectures usually show significant drawbacks and reliability problems, when used as on- chip <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> generators. Hence, innovative charge pump architectures are required to realize the monolithic {{integration of}} charge pumps in <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> applications. In this dissertation, three 4 -phase charge pump architectures with the dynamic body biasing tech- nique and clock schemes with dead time techniques were proposed to overcome drawbacks such as body effect and reverse current problem of traditional Pelliconi charge pump. The influences of <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> CMOS sandwich capacitors on the voltage gain and power efficiency of charge pumps were extensively investigated. The most reasonable 4 -phase charge pump architecture with a suitable configuration of <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> sandwich capacitors regarding the voltage gain and power efficiency was chosen to implement two <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> ASICs in an advanced 120 V 0. 35 μm <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> CMOS technology. The first test chip operates successfully and is able to generate up to 120 V from a 3. 7 V low voltage DC supply, which shows the <b>highest</b> output <b>voltage</b> among all the reported fully integrated CMOS charge pumps. The measurement results confirmed the benefits of the proposed charge pump architectures and clock schemes. The second chip providing a similar output voltage has a reduced chip size mainly due to decreased capacitor areas by increased clock frequencies. Fur- thermore, the second chip with an on-chip clock generator works independently of external clock signals which shows the feasibility of integrated charge pumps as part of <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> SoCs. Based on the successful implementation of those <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> CMOS ASICs, further discussions on the stability of the output voltage, levels of integration and limitations in the negative <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> generation of <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> CMOS charge pumps are held with the aid of simulation or measurement results. Feed- back regulation by adjusting the clock frequency or DC power supply is able to stabilize the voltage performance effectively while being easily integrated on-chip. Increasing the clock frequency can significantly reduce the required capacitor values which results in reduced chip sizes. An application example demonstrates the importance of fully integrated <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> charge pumps. Besides, a new design methodology for the on-chip <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> generation using CMOS technolo- gies was proposed.

Models of the stations are modeled and analyzed in PSCAD/EMTDC to study the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> transients that are created after current chopping with vacuum circuit breaker. Vacuum circuit breaker may chop the current before it reaches zero value, which means that <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> transients can be created.

The purpose of this thesis {{is to examine the}} use of vacuum circuit breaker in small-scale hydropower stations and the risk for <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> transients from current chopping.
