40|$|Nivalenol is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} various Fusarium species. The European Commission (EC) asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for a scientific {{opinion on the}} risk to human and animal health related {{to the presence of}} nivalenol in food and feed. A total of 13 164 results for nivalenol in food, feed and unprocessed grains, collected in 2001 - 2011 from 18 European countries, were available for the evaluation. The highest mean concentrations for nivalenol were observed in oats, maize, barley and wheat and products thereof. Grains and grain-based foods, in particular bread and rolls, <b>grain</b> <b>milling</b> <b>products,</b> pasta, fine bakery wares and breakfast cereals, made the largest contribution to nivalenol exposure for humans. Animal exposure to nivalenol is primarily from consuming cereal grains and cereal by-products. The available information on the toxicokinetics of nivalenol is incomplete. Evidence exists for metabolic de-epoxidation in some species. Based on the data available, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) concluded that the overall weight of evidence is that nivalenol is unlikely to be genotoxic. Toxic effects of nivalenol include immunotoxicity and haematotoxicity. A reduction in white blood cell (WBC) counts in a 90 -day rat study was identified as the critical effect for human risk assessment. Using these data and a benchmark dose analysis the CONTAM Panel established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 1. 2 µg/kg b. w. per day. All chronic human dietary exposures to nivalenol estimated, based on the available occurrence data in food, are below the TDI, and are therefore not a health concern. No toxicity data were identified for ruminants, rabbits, fish and companion animals but lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels were identified in pigs and poultry. Based on estimates of exposure the risk of adverse health effects of feed containing nivalenol is low for both these species...|$|R

Sufficient and adequate information related to company products is a component of fundamental importance regarding the powerful presence of a company in the web. The important question that remains to be answered though regards the profile of companies in food sectors considered as of lower internationalization compared to higher internationalization sectors. We contrasted five sectors of the lowest and five sectors of the highest internationalization. The five low internationalization industries selected were all in the food industry: preserved fruits and vegetables, dairy products, <b>grain</b> <b>mill</b> <b>products,</b> beverages and other food products. The five high-internationalization industries included: photographic equipment, computers, electronic components, communications equipment and motor vehicles. The 283 web-sites of companies in these sectors were evaluated (131 sites of food companies and 152 sites of companies operating in high internationalization industries) following a comprehensive procedure through the use of the Yahoo web-search engine (www. yahoo. com). The results show a statistically significant difference between high and low internationalization sectors for 14 different variables relevant to product presence in the Internet. Companies in low internationalization sectors (that is firms in food sectors) have an inferior product presence in the web compared to companies in sectors of higher internationalization.

500|$|The {{maintenance}} dose of warfarin can fluctuate significantly {{depending on the}} amount of vitamin K1 in the diet. Keeping vitamin K1 intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations. Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K1. Green parts of members of the family Apiaceae, such as parsley, cilantro, and dill, are extremely rich sources of vitamin K; cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli, as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens, are also relatively high in vitamin K1. Green vegetables such a peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin K1 as leafy greens. Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K1. [...] Foods low in vitamin K1 include roots, bulbs, tubers, and most fruits and fruit juices. Cereals, <b>grains</b> and other <b>milled</b> <b>products</b> are also low in vitamin K1.|$|R
