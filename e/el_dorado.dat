5|$|Voltaire {{depicts the}} worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all of Candide is a {{discussion}} of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode of <b>El</b> <b>Dorado,</b> a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only {{out of a sense of}} obligation.|$|E
5000|$|The label dropped The <b>El</b> <b>Dorados</b> in 1958, and Moses Jr. {{subsequently}} toured with {{a succession}} of backing vocalists.

5|$|After {{passing through}} <b>El</b> <b>Dorado,</b> the Kansas Turnpike crosses the northernmost arms of <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> Lake. This marks the turnpike's {{entry into the}} Flint Hills, a band of hills in eastern Kansas. The turnpike does not leave this region {{completely}} until it reaches Topeka. As the highway continues northeast past <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> Lake, it runs roughly parallel to the Walnut River to the west, which feeds the reservoir, and K-177 to the east. Northwest {{of the town of}} Cassoday, K-177 finally crosses the turnpike, with Exit 92 (Cassoday), a diamond interchange, providing a connector to the state highway. The interchange was not present when the turnpike opened in 1956, but was built soon after as an east-facing folded diamond with two separate toll plazas. The present configuration was built c. 1995. Near this interchange, the turnpike crosses the Walnut River.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of <b>El</b> <b>Dorado,</b> but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a chaingun. Nate knocks a telephone pole on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of <b>El</b> <b>Dorado,</b> and try to keep Nate away from it.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} National Hurricane Center's first {{advisory}} on Isis, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Dolores to Puerto Cortés along the Baja California Peninsula. This helped some of the residents get an early start.Early on September 2, the warning was extended from Santa Rosalía to Punta Abreojos, while an additional tropical storm warning was issued from <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> to Guaymas. After Isis became a hurricane, officials issued a hurricane warning from Dolores to Punta San Gabriel on the Baja California Peninsula and from <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> to Bahía Kino on the mainland.|$|E

5|$|After a {{few more}} adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into <b>El</b> <b>Dorado,</b> a {{geographically}} isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, {{and all of the}} king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in <b>El</b> <b>Dorado,</b> but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described from California as Armillaria olida by mycologists Harry D. Thiers and Walter Sundberg in 1976. The type specimen was collected on May 6, 1972, in the Crystal Basin Recreation Area in <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> County. Thiers and Sundberg classified {{it in the}} section Ponderosa of genus Armillaria due to its inamyloid spores, but noted that its relationship to other species was unclear. They also noted the similarity of the form and color of its cap to species in section Constricta of genus Lyophyllum.|$|E
5|$|With the {{indigenous}} groups {{closer to the}} Caribbean Coast, the people traded highly valuable sea snails. Ironically, the sea snails were worth more than {{the price of gold}} to the Muisca, due to the distance from their location far inland high in the Andes. The skilled goldworking of the Muisca formed the basis for the legend of <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> that became widespread among the Spanish conquistadors; this eventually drew them into the heart of Colombia—an ill-fated expedition that took almost a year and cost the lives of about 80% of their men.|$|E

5|$|For many years, {{the four}} lanes from Sacramento stopped at Riverton, where the {{original}} two-lane road {{continued through the}} canyon and over Echo Summit. The state rejected a proposed $133 million total realignment between Riverton and Kyburz in 1985, instead opting for a less expensive program of spot improvements including new bridges and passing lanes. Portions of the work were completed by 1987, including a four-lane bridge at Riverton (though two lanes are used by traffic turning at Ice House Road at {{the east end of}} the bridge). Between White Hall and Kyburz, a pair of four-lane bridges over the South Fork American River, carrying a realignment across a bend in the river, were dedicated on May 31, 1995, as the <b>El</b> <b>Dorado</b> County Veterans Bridges.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lane {{continued}} to organize with its 9mile (14km) wide eye surrounded by very deep convection, and the storm strengthened further to reach peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) by midday on September 16. It turned unexpectedly {{to the northeast}} , and at 1915UTC on the 16th, Hurricane Lane made landfall in a sparsely populated region of Sinaloa, 20miles (32km) southeast of <b>El</b> <b>Dorado.</b> This made Lane the most intense hurricane to strike Mexico since Hurricane Kenna in the 2002 season. The combination of the mountainous terrain of Mexico and increasing west-southwesterly wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and the storm dissipated on September 17. The remnants of Lane later moved into Texas, United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Hawks made Hatari!, {{again with}} John Wayne, {{who plays a}} big-game hunter in Africa.
