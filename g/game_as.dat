5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video <b>game,</b> <b>as</b> it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic <b>game</b> <b>as</b> well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E
