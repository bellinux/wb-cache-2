2500|$|While Human became Norwood's first {{effort not to}} be {{nominated}} for a Grammy Award in any category, it received generally favorable reviews from music critics, averaging a 67 out of a 100 among averaged reviews on Metacritic. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe complimented the album as appropriately rich and varied: [...] "It's better than good enough. It's a light, breezy listen that shows off Brandy's resilience, humility, joy, and vibrancy." [...] She especially highlighted Jerkins' input on the album: [...] "Jerkins manages {{to bring out the}} expressive best in her pleasantly raspy vocalizing." [...] The Guardian writer Alex Macpherson noted Human [...] "a thoughtful, intimate work on which Norwood sings movingly about fragility and fear," [...] giving it four and a half stars out of five, while Andy Kellman of AllMusic called the album Norwood's [...] "most platitudinal" [...] and [...] "least enjoyable release in her catalog," [...] adding: [...] "Brandy is clearly in a comfort zone that enables her to open up more than ever [...] Human is nothing if not a serious album. But <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>very</b> well be her most useful one." [...] He gave the album three and half stars out of five. Billboard magazine said that [...] "while Human is missing the sassy Brandy we know and love from such tracks like 'I Wanna Be Down' and 'Talk About Our Love,' we can still appreciate the much-needed solace of setting personal turmoil to memorable music." ...|$|E

2500|$|This idea of {{separating}} the Creator and youth's {{thought about the}} Creator is harmful. He says, [...] "with the years came understanding, and with understanding knowledge, and with knowledge grief,-and with increased knowledge increased grief. But as he was developed and educated in this way, the simple became more difficult for him, and since with out this guidance he wanted to rule himself, everything {{became more and more}} complicated. – Perhaps he chose the guidance of thought, and in order not to owe anyone anything he let this seed sow itself and let one thought evolve out of another, until eventually the infinite manifested itself to him and made him dizzy. The more he stared fixedly at it, the more his eye lost the visual power to find the way back to finitude.-Perhaps desire blinded him, life seemed like a joke to him, and he let God grieve in heaven while he chose pleasure and let enthusiasm speak in vain about conflict and struggle, about courage in dangers, patience in tribulation, love in life, victory in death, reward in heaven, while he let every day have its pleasure.-Perhaps a worldly-minded worry about food and clothing scattered his mind so that he did neither the one nor the other." [...] Kierkegaard's remedy for this individual is {{to find a place to}} be alone with God. He says, [...] "Just as the first book in the Old Testament has been called Genesis, the second Exodus, so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>very</b> well be said that in human life there is a third book called Retreat." [...] He continues, [...] "We are speaking only of the beautiful meaning of the retreat for human life and of how having thought about the Creator in one's youth is the retreat's rescuing angel. Let a person's work take from him what belongs to it, his time, his diligence, but in the advancing years, O God, preserve a recollection of youth that preserves youth's thought of the Creator. Woe to him who separates what God has joined together, who to him who separates adulthood from its youth.|$|E

60|$|At last Timur {{contrived}} {{an ingenious}} stratagem, {{by which he}} hoped to cause his enemy to fall into a snare. It seems {{that there was a}} small island in the river, not far from the walls of the city, on which, before the siege commenced, Timur had built a fortress, to be held as a sort of advanced post, and had garrisoned the fortress with about one thousand men. Timur now, in order to divert the attention of the Monguls from the city itself, sent a number of men out from the city, who pretended to be deserters, and went immediately to the Mongul camp. Of course, Elak questioned them about the defenses of the city, in order to learn where the weak points were for him to attack. The pretended deserters advised him to attack this fortress on the island, saying that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>very</b> easily be taken, and that its situation was such that, when it was taken, the city itself must surrender, for it completely commanded the place.|$|E

6000|$|The Microscope, {{which for}} the most part I made use of, was shap'd [...] much like that in the sixth Figure of the first Scheme, the Tube [...] being {{for the most part}} not above six or seven inches long, though, by [...] reason it had four Drawers, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>very</b> much be lengthened, as [...] {{occasion}} required; this was contriv'd with three Glasses; a small [...] Object Glass at A, a thinner Eye Glass about B, and a very deep one [...] about C: this I made use of only when I had occasion to see much of an [...] Object at once; the middle Glass conveying a very great company of [...] radiating Pencils, which would go another way, and throwing them upon [...] the deep Eye Glass. But when ever I had occasion to examine the small [...] parts of a Body more accurately, I took out the middle Glass, and only [...] made use of one Eye Glass with the Object Glass, for always the fewer [...] the Refractions are, the more bright and clear the Object appears. And [...] therefore 'tis not to be doubted, but could we make a Microscope to [...] have one only refraction, it would, cæteris paribus, far excel any [...] other that had a greater number. And hence it is, that if you take a [...] very clear piece of a broken Venice Glass, and in a Lamp draw it out [...] into very small hairs or threads, then holding the ends of these [...] threads in the flame, till they melt and run into a small round Globul, [...] or drop, which will hang {{at the end of the}} thread; and if further you [...] stick several of these upon the end of a stick with a little sealing [...] Wax, so as that the threads stand upwards, and then on a Whetstone [...] first grind off a good part of them, and afterward on a smooth Metal [...] plate, with a little Tripoly, rub them till they come to be very [...] smooth; if one of these be fixt with a little soft Wax against a small [...] needle hole, prick'd through a thin Plate of Brass, Lead, Pewter, or [...] any other Metal, and an Object, plac'd very near, be look'd at through [...] it, it will both magnifie and make some Objects more distinct then any [...] of the great Microscopes. But because these, though exceeding easily [...] made, are yet very troublesome to be us'd, because of their smallness, [...] and the nearness of the Object; therefore to prevent both these, and [...] yet have only two Refractions, I provided me a Tube of Brass, shap'd [...] much like that in the fourth Figure of the first Scheme; into the [...] smaller end of this I fixt with Wax a good plano convex Object Glass, [...] with the convex side towards the Object, and into the bigger end I fixt [...] also with wax a pretty large plano Convex Glass, with the convex [...] side towards my eye, then by means of the small hole by the side, I [...] fill'd the intermediate space between these two Glasses with very clear [...] Water, and with a Screw stopp'd it in; then putting on a Cell for the [...] Eye, I could perceive an Object more bright then I could when the [...] intermediate space was only fill'd with Air, but this, for other [...] inconveniences, I made but little use of.|$|E
6000|$|Comment on the abundance, the gaiety and drollery, {{the generous}} play {{of vision and}} fancy in all this, would seem so needless as to be almost officious, were not the {{commentator}} constantly, were he not infinitely, arrested and reminded and solicited; which is at once his advantage and his embarrassment. Such a letter, at all events, read over with the general key, touches its contemporary scene and hour into an intensity of life for him; making indeed the great sign of that life my brother's signal vivacity and cordiality, his endless spontaneity of mind. Every thing in it is characteristic of the genius and expressive of the mood, and not least, of course, the pleasantry of paradox, the evocation of each familiar image by its vivid opposite. Our mother, e.g., was not at that time, nor for a good while yet, so venerably [...] "silvered"; our handsome-headed father had lost, occipitally, long before, all pretence to raven locks, certainly {{to the effect of}} their [...] "rippling"; the beauty of our admirable aunt was as happily alien either to wildness or to the [...] "hanging" [...] air as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>very</b> well be; the [...] "mystery" [...] of our young sister consisted all in the candour of her natural bloom, even if at the same time of her lively intelligence; and H.'s mirth and garrulity appear to have represented for the writer the veriest ironic translation of something in that youth, I judge, not a little mildly--though oh so mildly!--morose or anxiously mute. To the same tune the aquiline in his own nose heroically derides the slightly relaxed line of that feature; and our brother Wilky's want of physical [...] "depth" [...] is a glance at a different proportion. Of a like tinge of pleasantry, I may add, is the imputation of the provincial gape to our friend T. S. Perry, of Newport birth and unintermitted breeding, with whom we were to live so much in the years to come, and who was then on the eve of entering Harvard--his face already uninterruptedly turned to that love of letters, that practice of them by dauntless and inordinate, though never at all vulgarly resonant, absorption which was to constitute in itself the most disinterested of careers. I had myself felt him from the first an exemplary, at once, and a discouraging friend; he had let himself loose in the world of books, pressed and roamed through the most various literatures and the most voluminous authors, with a stride that, as it carried him beyond all view, left me dismayed and helpless {{at the edge of the}} forest, where I listened wistfully but unemulously to the far-off crash from within of his felled timber, the clearing of whole spaces or periods shelf by shelf or great tree by tree. The brother-in-law of John La Farge, he had for us further, with that reviving consciousness of American annals which the War was at once so rudely and so insidiously to quicken in us, the glamour of his straight descent from the Commodores Perry of the Lake Erie in the war of 1812, respectively, and of the portentous penetration of Japan just after the mid-century, and his longer-drawn but equally direct and so clean and comfortable affiliation to the great Benjamin Franklin: as these things at least seemed to me under my habit (too musing and brooding certainly to have made for light loquacity) of pressing every wind-borne particle of personal history--once the persons were only other enough from myself--into the service of what I would fain have called picture or, less explicitly, less formulatedly, romance.|$|E
