25|$|Data {{shows that}} the {{application}} of the death penalty is strongly influenced by racial bias. Furthermore, some opponents argue that it is applied in an arbitrary manner by a criminal justice system that {{has been shown to be}} biased through the systemic influence of socio-economic, geographic, and gender factors.

25|$|Monitoring costs: A {{barrier to}} {{shareholders}} using good information <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of processing it, especially {{to a small}} shareholder. The traditional answer to this problem is the efficient-market hypothesis (in finance, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) asserts that financial markets are efficient), {{which suggests that the}} small shareholder will free ride on the judgments of larger professional investors.|$|E
25|$|In haploids {{produced}} from anther culture, {{it is observed}} that some plants are aneuploids and some are mixed haploid-diploid types. Another disadvantage associated with the double haploidy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> involved in establishing tissue culture and growth facilities. The over-usage of doubled haploidy may reduce genetic variation in breeding germplasm. Hence one has to take several factors into consideration before deploying doubled haploidy in breeding programmes.|$|E

25|$|The {{opportunity}} cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser {{in the late}} 19th century. Opportunity cost <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of any activity {{measured in terms of}} the value of the next best alternative foregone (that is not chosen). It is the sacrifice related to the second best choice available to someone, or group, who has picked among several mutually exclusive choices.|$|E

Depending on the issuer, marketing programs are also {{a significant portion of}} expenses.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{disadvantage}} of electrification <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> for infrastructure: overhead lines or third rail, substations, and control systems. Public {{policy in the}} U.S. interferes with electrification: higher property taxes are imposed on privately owned rail facilities if they are electrified. The EPA regulates exhaust emissions on locomotive and marine engines, similar to regulations on car & freight truck emissions, in order to {{limit the amount of}} carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitric oxides, and soot output from these mobile power sources.|$|E

25|$|Iceland already {{converts}} its {{surplus electricity}} into exportable goods and hydrocarbon replacements. In 2002, it produced 2,000tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysis, {{primarily for the}} production of ammonia (NH3) for fertilizer. Ammonia is produced, transported, and used throughout the world, and 90% of the cost of ammonia <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the energy to produce it. Iceland is also developing an aluminium-smelting industry. Aluminium costs are driven primarily by the cost of the electricity to run the smelters. Either of these industries could effectively export all of Iceland's potential geothermal electricity.|$|E
25|$|Applying the {{internal}} {{rate of return}} method to maximize the value of the firm, any investment would be accepted, if its profitability, as measured by {{the internal}} rate of return, is greater than a minimum acceptable rate of return. The appropriate minimum rate to maximize the value added to the firm <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of capital, i.e. the {{internal rate of return}} of a new capital project needs to be higher than the company's cost of capital. This is because an investment with an internal rate of return which exceeds the cost of capital has a positive net present value.|$|E
25|$|The obvious {{disadvantage}} to {{this design}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> {{and complexity of}} two drive trains, and the increased maintenance load that implies. Another is that if one engine fails, the other cannot be used to drive both tracks. Both of these problems were greatly reduced {{in the case of}} steam power, where the majority of the engine in terms of size and weight is the boiler, and the cylinders that extract that power are much smaller in comparison. It can also provide variable output by controlling the amount of steam sent to each cylinder. It is much more complex when used with internal combustion engines.|$|E

25|$|Civil {{liberties and}} {{political}} groups were {{also concerned about}} changes to NSW law enacted for the APEC meeting, giving the NSW Police Force new powers, including a suspension of the normal function of habeas corpus, freedom of movement, an excluded persons blacklist and other civil liberties. Police and security forces had also erected a security perimeter around much of inner city Sydney. Another point of criticism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of security for the event with official budget figures at A$169 million. New South Wales Police Minister David Campbell justified the strong security presence and curtailment of civil liberties on the fear of 'violent protest' from the Mutiny collective, and other protest groups.|$|E
25|$|Called {{in by the}} Imperial Continental Gas Association in 1863 {{to replace}} a failed roof over a {{telescoping}} gas holder, Schwedler devised a workable solution but thinking further about the problem, in 1866 published an article describing {{a new type of}} iron cupola that was simpler, lighter, and as sturdy: it takes the form of an unsupported spheroidal steel vault, rather than beams, and was normally used to span distances of 2545m. He used Schwedler cupolas in designing four new gas holders for Berlin's street lighting, of which the one now known as the Fichte-Bunker (1874) survives, and the only deterrent to their use today <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of labour. He designed the cupolas on Berlin's New Synagogue (1863) and the Sedan Panorama at Alexanderplatz Station.|$|E
25|$|This {{difference}} {{is one of}} the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as Match.com, Yahoo Personals, and eHarmony.com are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like MySpace and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users. The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006. Whether it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.|$|E

25|$|Slovakia {{has several}} privately funded {{universities}}, however public universities consistently score {{better in the}} ranking than their private counterparts. Universities have different criteria for accepting students. Anyone can apply to any number of universities. The limiting factor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of application fees, which can range from a few € to over 100 € per one application. The student may apply for a social discount for the application fee. Several universities, including some the best ranking in Slovakia, accept all applicants and perform a screening process during the study, which results in a higher dropout rate among the students compared to universities that require passing an entry exam. Other methods of acceptance may include weighting past study results from high school, passing an entry test {{or a combination of}} both.|$|E
25|$|In economics, {{marginal}} cost {{is the change}} in the opportunity cost that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of producing one more unit of a good. Intuitively, {{marginal cost}} at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered fixed. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the fixed costs of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of snake bites {{can involve}} wearing {{protective}} footwear, avoiding areas where snakes live, and not handling snakes. Treatment partly {{depends on the}} type of snake. Washing the wound with soap and water and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom, cutting the wound with a knife, or using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however, antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends {{on the type of}} snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown, antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world getting the right type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they sometimes do not work. An additional issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person's breathing is sometimes also required.|$|E
