5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when {{bodies of water}} begin to dry up in the summer or <b>early</b> <b>fall</b> and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and <b>early</b> <b>fall,</b> but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E

5|$|Michael Horodniceanu, {{chief of}} MTA Construction Company, told The New York Times in January 2014 that {{complications}} in {{the installation of}} the inclined elevator would likely cause a further delay of about three months, bringing the opening date to very late summer or <b>early</b> <b>fall</b> of 2014, or to November 2014. By March 2014, the station's tentative opening date was still to be in November 2014.|$|E

Most of the problems were attributed to the incline elevators being installed in the station, and to the ventilation fans along the tunnel.|$|E

This was to be followed by an Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase before full production could start.|$|E
5|$|Lodges {{are grouped}} into {{sections}} that are then grouped into regions. The section chief is the elected youth leader, a volunteer adult is appointed as the section adviser, {{and the area}} director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser. In addition to the section chief, the section has two additional elected officers. The vice chief and secretary are elected immediately following {{the election of the}} section chief at the section's annual business meeting. All sections gather annually at a section conclave held in the late spring or <b>early</b> <b>fall.</b> The section officers lead the planning of this weekend {{with the help of the}} lodge chiefs in the section.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and <b>early</b> <b>fall,</b> and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E

5|$|On 14 August, Colonel David E. Lownds {{took over}} as {{commander}} of the 26th Marine Regiment. There were sporadic actions in the vicinity during the late summer and <b>early</b> <b>fall,</b> the most serious {{of which was the}} ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March. During December and early January there were numerous sightings of NVA troops and activities in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained relatively quiet.|$|E
5|$|Summers are hot and humid; {{during this}} season, highs {{average in the}} upper80s °F (lower30s °C) and lows average in the upper60s °F (lower20s °C). The {{combination}} of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and <b>early</b> <b>fall,</b> they have often weakened {{by the time they}} reach Stephens City, partly due to the city's far inland location.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand {{and water}} to make mud mortar. They {{obtained}} most of the material from canyon deposits, {{but some of the}} clays may have been collected {{from the base of the}} cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and <b>early</b> <b>fall</b> rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} S.thiersii grow during the mid or late summer until <b>early</b> <b>fall.</b> Since {{it was first}} {{reported}} in 1952 in Texas, this species has been expanding its range. It appeared in southern Illinois in the 1990s and has since spread to central Illinois, where it is the most common mushroom found in lawns during July and August. Today it occurs in nine states including Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas and Illinois. It also occurs in Mexico.|$|E

30|$|Conclusions After {{fatalities}} {{attributed to}} hyperkalaemia post barbiturate coma, we aimed {{to assess the}} occurrence and any contributing factor. A case series 2 highlighted the potassium replacement as a significant variable. This was not shown here, possibly due to restrictive replacement in patients during infusion. We did find an <b>earlier</b> <b>fall</b> in potassium following the start of infusion and an earlier peak after cessation. That no variable showed significance suggests {{a lack of understanding}} of the cause of dysregulation.|$|R

5000|$|The Marshall Suite is a 1999 album by The Fall (their 20th).

The end result has songs like the catchy [...] "Touch Sensitive", and the strange, complex, thumping jungle beats of [...] "Crying Marshall".
