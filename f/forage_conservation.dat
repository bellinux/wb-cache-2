40|$|Wrapped forages, in {{the form}} of silage and haylage, have become more common in horse diets during recent years. Silage and haylage is {{commonly}} produced in big bales. However, for use in stables with few animals, these bales often contain too much forage to be consumed before onset of aerobic deterioration. Smaller bales are therefore of interest, but knowledge of the chemical composition (including vitamin content), fermentation pattern and changes in those variables during storage of small bales is limited, and was therefore investigated. Small bale forage contained higher pH, higher ethanol and lower lactic acid content, compared to general levels in chopped silo silage, but low levels of ammonia-N and butyric acid. There were no general effects of dry matter or extent of fermentation on Î±-tocopherol and Î²-carotene contents in the preserved forages, but linear positive correlations between the vitamins and lactic acid existed. In general, long-term storage (14 months) of small bales influenced fermentation variables, yeasts and pH, but silage was affected by storage to a larger extent than haylage. Although changes occurred during storage, values in two month old bales correlated well with values obtained after 14 months. The influence of <b>forage</b> <b>conservation</b> methods on horse preference was also investigated. Hay, haylage and silage were produced from the same grass crops and the forages were offered simultaneously to horses. Silage was the first chosen forage, had the highest rate of consumption and the longest eating time, while hay had the lowest consumption rate and the shortest eating time. Haylage was intermediate between hay and silage in both eating time and rate of consumption. The influence of <b>forage</b> <b>conservation</b> methods on equine hindgut fermentation was studied using fistulated horses. Hay, haylage and silage were produced from the same grass crop and fed in a changeover study. Horses were sampled after being fed the forage for 21 days, and a kinetic study of colon fermentation was performed in each period. <b>Forage</b> <b>conservation</b> method had no effect on microbial or chemical composition in the right ventral colon or faeces on Day 21.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine if}} different methods of <b>forage</b> <b>conservation</b> influenced horse preference for conserved forages. Silage, haylage with two different dry matter (DM) levels and hay was produced from the same grass crop at the same botanical maturity stage. Four horses were simultaneously offered the four forages (1 kg DM of each forage) once daily for four consecutive experimental periods, each period consisting of 5 days. On each experimental day, the horses were observed for 2 h and their first choice, eating time and forage consumption was registered for every forage. The number of times each horse depleted individual forages and the number of times each horse tasted or smelled a forage, but left it in favour of another forage, was also recorded. Silage had the highest rate of consumption (0. 90 kg DM/day, S. D. 0. 14) and longest eating time (28. 4 min/day, S. D. 5. 16). Hay had the lowest rate of consumption (0. 23 kg DM/day, S. D. 0. 14) and shortest eating time (6. 8 min/day, S. D. 4. 08), while the haylages were intermediate. Silage was the first choice 72 of 84 times (85 %). Hay was never completely consumed and silage was never left in favour of another forage after smelling or tasting it. We conclude that the <b>forage</b> <b>conservation</b> methods had an impact on horse preference in favour of silage, even if the reason for silage preference remains to be explained...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify in three European mountain regions the ecosystem services of grassland that different stakeholders identify (which ecosystem services for whom), the relative rankings of these ecosystem services, and how stakeholders perceive the provision of these ecosystem services to be related to agricultural activities. We found differences: (1) between farmersâ€™ perceptions of ecosystem services across regions and (2) within regions, between knowledge of ecosystem services gained by regional experts through education and farmersâ€™ local field-based knowledge. Nevertheless, we identified a common set of ecosystem services that were considered important by stakeholders across the three regions, including soil stability, water quantity and quality, <b>forage</b> quality, <b>conservation</b> of botanical diversity, aesthetics and recreation (for regional experts), and forage quantity and aesthetic (for local farmers). We observed two contrasting stakeholder representations of the effects of agricultural management on ecosystem services delivery, one negative and the other positive (considering low to medium management intensity).

Analysis of the rumen microbiome is thus important {{to understanding the}} underlying microbial activity under different feeding strategies. This study investigated the effect of <b>forage</b> <b>conservation</b> method and vitamin E supplementation on rumen function using a rumen simulation technique. Ryegrass (GRA) or ryegrass hay (HAY) was supplemented with 20 % concentrate containing zero or 50 IU/d vitamin E, as ?-tocopheryl acetate, according to a 2 ? 2 factorial design. The <b>forage</b> <b>conservation</b> method did not substantially change the nutrient composition but {{had a profound impact}} on the structure and diversity of the rumen microbiome. HAY diets promoted a more complex bacterial community (+ 38 OTUs) dominated by Firmicutes. This bacterial adaptation, together with increased rumen protozoa levels and methanogen diversity, was associated with greater fiber disappearance (+ 12 %) in HAY diets, but also with greater rumen true N degradability (+ 7 %) than GRA diets. HAY diets also had a higher metabolic H recovery and methane production (+ 35 %) suggesting more efficient inter-species H transfer between bacteria, protozoa and methanogens. Contrarily, GRA diets promoted more simplified methanogen and bacterial communities, which were dominated by Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus, thus lactate formation may have acted as an alternative H sink in GRA diets. Moreover the structure of the bacterial community with GRA diets was highly correlated with N utilization, and GRA diets promoted greater bacterial growth and microbial protein synthesis (+ 16 %), as well as a more efficient microbial protein synthesis (+ 22 %). A dose-response experiment using batch cultures revealed that vitamin E supplementation increased rumen fermentation in terms of total VFA and gas production, with protozoal activity higher when supplying ?-tocopheryl acetate vs. ?-tocopherol. Moreover, ?-tocopheryl acetate promoted a small increase in feed degradability (+ 8 %), possibly as a result of its antioxidant properties which led to higher bacterial and protozoal levels. Vitamin E supplementation also modified the levels of some methanogen species indicating that they may be particularly sensitive to oxidative stresses. Our findings suggested that when possible, grass should be fed instead of grass hay, in order to improve rumen function and to decrease the environmental impact of livestock agriculture. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

Primary growths of timothy and meadow fescue sward were conserved by ensiling with none (NA), an inoculant enzyme preparation (IE) or a formic acid based (FORM) additive or as hay 1 week later. Conservation of grass by drying rather than ensiling resulted in lower forage 18 : 2 n- 6, 18 : 3 n- 3, total fatty acid and fat-soluble vitamin concentrations. In spite of lower intakes, milk fat 18 : 2 n- 6 and 18 : 3 n- 3 content was higher (P < 0. 05) for hay than for silage diets (12. 1, 9. 6, 9. 6 and 9. 3 and 5. 00, 3. 51, 4. 27 and 2. 93 g/kg total fatty acids, for hay, NA, IE and FORM silages, respectively). <b>Forage</b> <b>conservation</b> method had no clear effects on milk trans 18 : 1 or CLA content. Compared with silage, hay diets resulted in milk containing lower (P < 0. 001) riboflavin, alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene concentrations, but had no effect on ascorbic acid, thiamine, pyridoxine or retinol content. Feeding more concentrates had no effect on milk fatty acid composition or milk vitamin content, other than lowering (P < 0. 001) 16 : 0 concentrations from 348 to 338 g/kg fatty acids. Supplements of PG led to small (P < 0. 05) increases in milk 13 : 0 anteiso and 15 : 0 content from 1. 06 and 11. 3 to 1. 22 and 12. 6 g/kg fatty acids and reduced (P < 0. 05) the concentrations of ascorbic acid (16. 1 v. 15. 1 g/kg milk).

40|$|Marine turtles {{regularly}} migrate hundreds {{to thousands}} of kilometres between nesting beaches and home <b>foraging</b> grounds. Effective <b>conservation</b> of marine turtles requires understanding of migration patterns {{in order to facilitate}} regional cooperation across the turtles 2 Ì† 7 migratory range. Indigenous Australians maintain traditional rights and responsibilities for marine turtle management across much of the northern Australian coast. To better understand turtle migrations and identify with whom the Aboriginal people of north-east Arnhem Land (Yolngu) share turtles, we used satellite telemetry to track the migration routes of 20 green turtles (Chelonia mydas) departing from a nesting beach similar to 45 km south of Nhulunbuy, north-east Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. All tracked turtles remained within the Gulf of Carpentaria. These results suggest that the foraging habitat for adults of this nesting population may be largely confined to the Gulf, offering an optimistic scenario for green turtle conservation. Given these results and the critical role Indigenous people play in conserving and managing marine turtles, we recommend that a formal network of indigenous communities be established as the foundation of a community-based turtle-management strategy for the Gulf of Carpentaria region...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: Smirnova iranica Sabeti {{is one of}} the {{valuable}} and adapted shrub native species to the sandy fields of Central Iran and of Fabaceae family that in terms of the production of <b>forage</b> and soil <b>conservation</b> and creating a beautiful landscape and medicinal value is critically important. No study has been conducted on this plant essence in Iran, so far. Methods: In the habitat of the plant, located in Kashan sandy areas, during flowering in the third week of April in each site, flowers were collected and after extraction of essential oils using simultaneous method of distillation and extraction using organic solvents, a chromatography device connected to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) was used in order to identify the combinations of essential oils. Results: The essence yields were 0. 02 and the color of essential oils was yellowish. The important and main combinations of essential oils were Hexadecanoic acid, Tetradecanoic acid and 6, 10, 14 -Trimethyl- 2 -pentadecanone which consisted more than 10 percent of the composition. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Smirnova iranica sabeti is a versatile plant found in sandy fields of Iran with medicinal, anti-virus, anti-cancer and anti-bacterial properties...|$|R
40|$|Warm season grasses are {{increasingly}} being cultivated in North America for summer <b>forage,</b> soil <b>conservation,</b> and biomass production. In more northern environments, temperature and length of growing season have an overriding effect on the productivity of warm season grasses. There is limited information on the adaptability and production potential of warm season grasses in these short season areas. A {{study was conducted in}} south-western Quebec from 1993 to 1996 to evaluate the productivity of five species of warm season grasses. Phenological development, canopy leaf area development and architecture, radiation-use efficiency (RUE), yield and chemical composition were determined. In terms of phenology, there was a diversity of developmental patterns and the genotypes of greatest potential were characterised by early spring growth and late onset of dormancy in fall. Most of the genotypes that were early in spring growth were also early maturing and low yielding. Late maturing genotypes were generally late in spring growth, high yielding and generally of southern origin. Differences in developmental patterns were partly explained by differences in base temperatures for germination and growth, and growth rates. Seed osmoconditioning and/or matriconditioning alleviated effects of low temperatures on switchgrass seed germination and potential establishment. Maximum leaf area index ranged from 6. 1 to 8 and the vertical leaf area distributions and light interception levels varied among genotypes. Average end of season biomass yields ranged from 8. 5 to 14. 4 Mg ha- 1. Switchgrass rates of DM accumulation ranged from 175 to 191 kg ha- 1 day- 1 and RUE 0. 89 to 1. 1 g MJ- 1 of incoming solar radiation. Moderate amounts of N fertilisation increased yield and quality of switchgrass, which could be harvested in a 2 -cut system. NDF and ADF ranged from 77 [...] 88 and 46 [...] 57 % respectively, and showed a rapid increase to a mid season plateau. Nitrogen concentrations declined curvilinearly wi...|$|R
