5|$|After reuniting Kevin {{with her}} chicks, Carl and Russell fly the <b>dirigible</b> {{back to the}} city. Carl {{presents}} Russell with his final badge: a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met. Meanwhile, Carl's house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie.|$|E
5|$|The repentant Carl goes outside, {{only to see}} Russell sailing {{off with}} some {{balloons}} and the propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the <b>dirigible,</b> tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that the next big war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France <b>dirigible</b> airship twenty-eight miles an hour and such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty-five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 1929, off {{the coast}} of New Jersey, a biplane hooked itself to the bottom of a <b>dirigible</b> and was carried along by the larger craft. This is the 2nd such incident. The “snapon, snapoff” {{experiment}} is accomplished by the Navy airship , under Lt. Com. Herbert Wiley, and a Navy biplane. The biplane, regulating its speed to that of the <b>dirigible,</b> flew close under the Los Angeles. A large hook had been attached {{to the middle of the}} top wing of the biplane, and from the bottom of the Los Angeles hung a U-shaped yoke. Maneuvering the ship under the <b>dirigible,</b> the plane pilot slipped the hook into the Los Angeles’ yoke and for 3 or 4 minutes the <b>dirigible</b> carried the biplane. The plane pilot, by a cord arrangement in his cabin, withdrew the hook from the yoke and flew clear of the <b>dirigible.</b>|$|E

Luthor battles Superman with a green ray but Luthor is ultimately defeated by him, and Lois is rescued. Superman destroys Luthor's <b>dirigible</b> with him still on it, implying Luthor may have died, although stories ending with Luthor's apparent death are common in his earliest appearances.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, {{with the}} help of Alfredo Kindelán, Torres {{directed}} the construction of the first Spanish <b>dirigible</b> in the Army Military Aerostatics Service, created in 1896 and located in Guadalajara. It was completed successfully, and the new airship, the España, made numerous test and exhibition flights. As a result, a collaboration began between Torres and the French company Astra, which managed to buy the patent with a cession of rights extended to all countries except Spain, in order to make possible the construction of the <b>dirigible</b> in its country. So, in 1911, the construction of dirigibles known as the Astra-Torres airships was begun. Some were acquired by the French and British armies at the beginning of 1913, and were used during the First World War for diverse tasks, principally naval protection and inspection.|$|E
