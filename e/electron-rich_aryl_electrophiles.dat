40|$|Organotrifluoroborates {{have emerged}} {{in the past decade}} as {{suitable}} nucleophilic partners for the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, acting as masked boronic acids. These compounds are deprotected under conditions required for cross-coupling. Their tetracoordinate nature renders them inert to a myriad of chemical transformations and allows them to undergo the transmetalation step of the catalytic cycle with limited interference from competitive protodeboronation. The main focus of the research done has been to utilize organotrifluoroborates to: 1) Generate a new class of organometallic reagents for the development of novel disconnections in molecular structures, 2) Use their enhanced stability during transmetalation to effect new strategies for the incorporation of primary and secondary alkyl groups onto <b>aryl</b> <b>electrophiles,</b> and 3) Develop a new bidirectional functionalization strategy through the use of boryl-substituted organotrifluoroborates. ^ Owing to the prevalence and importance of aminomethyl alkenyl- or aryl linkages in bioactive molecules, the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of N,N-dialkyl- and monoalkylaminomethyltrifluoroborates with <b>aryl</b> <b>electrophiles</b> was explored. A variety of these aminomethyltrifluoroborate substrates were prepared and shown to cross-couple with a variety of <b>aryl</b> <b>electrophiles,</b> generating the corresponding benzylamines in moderate to excellent yields. This serves as a powerful alternative to the more traditional reductive amination route to the same compounds. * ^ The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of primary and secondary (including secondary β-trifluoroboratoamides) organotrifluoroborates has been achieved with <b>aryl</b> <b>electrophiles.</b> This represents the first body of work devoted to developing a strategy devoted to accomplishing alkylation with limited interference from β-hydride elimination. * ^ The concept of bidirectional functionalization was investigated through the use of orthogonally reactive dibora species. Given the vast reactivity differences between tetracoordinate organotrifluoroborates and virtually all tricoordinate organoborons, boryl-substituted organotrifluoroborate permitted selective reactivity at one boron center, leaving the second intact for subsequent transformation. * ^ *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the iron catalyzed cross coupling of <b>aryl</b> <b>electrophiles</b> with alkyl Grignard reagents was studied. The reaction proceeds via a rate-limiting oxidative addition of the aryl halide to an Fe(I) complex generated in situ. A transmetalation from an aryl Grignard reagent occurs either {{before or after the}} oxidative addition. An exergonic reductive elimination closes the cycle, yielding the cross coupled product and regenerates the Fe(I) from Fe(III). Added ligands and dilution increases the stability of the active catalyst. The reaction can take place at dry ice temperature. Initial rate studies indicated that high concentrations of any reagent can lead to complete or partial catalyst deactivation. Under strongly reducing conditions, iron seems to form less active complexes that only slowly re- enter the catalytic cycle. The iron catalyzed cross coupling of alkyl <b>electrophiles</b> with <b>aryl</b> Grignard reagents follows the same mechanism as the <b>aryl</b> <b>electrophile</b> – alkyl Grignard coupling. With the more weakly reducing aryl Grignards, the iron catalyst is stable in diethyl ether without additives. The nature of the active catalyst has been under debate. In the couplings with aryl Grignard reagents, the active catalyst is an Fe(I) species. Fe(I) complexes are stable in ether, and they are active catalysts. The active iron catalyst has a spin state of S= 3 / 2, even though the precatalytic Fe(III) salts have a high spin state (S= 5 / 2). The spin change occurs after the first transmetalation, when the strong ligand field of the aryl group raises the energy of one d-orbital, inducing an electron pairing event...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} metal-free reactions to obtain carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bonds. This is achieved by transferring carbon ligands from hypervalent iodine reagents to suitable nucleophiles. The bulk of the work presented herein concerns arylation of oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles, using the well-known diaryliodonium salts as aryl sources. In the first project, O-arylation of the oxime ethyl acetohydroxamate was studied. It was found that electron-poor as well as <b>electron-rich</b> <b>aryl</b> moieties could be transferred successfully to this nucleophile. Furthermore, the protocol could be extended to a sequential one-pot synthesis of benzo[b]furans. This method allowed for a fast synthesis of the natural product stemofuran A and formal syntheses of other natural products. In a successive project, O-arylation of hydroxide and aliphatic alkoxides was investigated. It is known that electron-poor aryl moieties can be transferred to these nucleophiles in moderate to high yields. However, combined with more electron-rich diaryliodonium salts, {{a large amount of}} side products were formed. These were suppressed upon addition of aryne traps, suggesting that aryne pathways are competing with the desired ligand coupling. It was also observed that secondary alcohols were oxidized to the corresponding ketones. The mechanism for this oxidation was investigated and aryne pathways could be excluded. Instead we suggest that the carbinol hydrogen gets deprotonated via an internal mechanism, after the alkoxide has coordinated to the iodonium salt. Highly sterically congested alkyl aryl ethers could be obtained in high yields by combining tertiary alcohols with ortho-blocked diaryliodonium salts.   Next, N-arylation of secondary acyclic amides was studied using acetanilide as the model substrate. This procedure was suitable for transfer of electron-poor as well as ortho-substituted aryl moieties, but attempts to transfer very <b>electron-rich</b> <b>aryl</b> groups were unsuccessful. On the other hand, the amides displayed a complementary reactivity, allowing phenylation of electron-rich amides.   In the final project, a one-pot synthesis of the cyclic iodonium reagent vinylbenziodoxolone is presented. These compounds have not been explored as reagents earlier. Initial screenings showed that the vinyl moiety could be transferred to nitrocyclohexane with opposite regioselectivity compared to the acyclic analogue of the reagent.
