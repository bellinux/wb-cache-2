5|$|Although Riley was wealthy {{from his}} books, {{he was able}} to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, {{and was a}} part of the Gilded Age New York {{literary}} {{scene for}} the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> to avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public figure with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{historian}} Tacitus describes Domitian's first {{speech in}} the Senate as brief and measured, {{at the same time}} noting his ability to elude awkward questions. Domitian's authority was merely , however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function. Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's , promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and Antonius Primus and replacing them by more reliable men such as Arrecinus Clemens.|$|E

Only in January 1826, when he turned the country over to Sucre, did he promise that the Peruvian legislature would approve Bolivia's independence.|$|E

It was published in his Catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters (1771) as object number 33; hence the name M33. When William Herschel compiled his extensive catalogue of nebulae, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> not to include most of the objects identified by Messier. However, M33 was an exception and he catalogued this object on September 11, 1784 as H V-17.|$|E

Taizong reduced conscript labour requirements and lowered taxes; in addition, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> to avoid undertaking projects that might deplete the treasury and exhaust the strength of the population.

25|$|The first Labour Government, under Ramsay MacDonald, {{took office}} in January 1924. Eden's maiden speech (19 February 1924) was a {{controversial}} attack on Labour's defence policy and was heckled, and thereafter <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> to speak only after deep preparation. He later reprinted the speech in a collection called Foreign Affairs (1939) to give an impression {{that he had been}} a consistent advocate of air strength. Eden admired H.H. Asquith, then in his final year in the Commons, for his lucidity and brevity. On 1 April 1924 he spoke urging Anglo-Turkish friendship and ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne, which had been signed in July 1923.|$|E
25|$|Though {{his mother}} favored his {{retirement}} from public life, Roosevelt, his wife, and Roosevelt's {{close friend and}} adviser, Louis Howe, were all determined that Roosevelt continue his political career. Roosevelt convinced many people that he was improving, which he believed to be essential prior to running for public office again. He laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs by swiveling his torso, supporting himself with a cane. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> never to be seen using his wheelchair in public, and great care was taken to prevent any portrayal in the press that would highlight his disability. However, his disability was well known before and during his presidency and became {{a major part of}} his image. He usually appeared in public standing upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{at the military}} academy, Chávez generally avoided all discussion of politics with his family, especially whenever he stayed with them during holidays. He particularly disliked political discussion with his father, who was then {{a member of the}} COPEI political party—indeed, his father would eventually rise to the position of Education Director of Barinas during the COPEI administration of Luis Herrera Campins. However, Chávez did enjoy such talk during his regular visits to the Ruiz family household. For several months during 1974, Chávez maintained a personal diary; in it, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> in his usage of proper Spanish language. Chávez also expressed a leftist political orientation; writing of his dislike of U.S. foreign policy and Venezuela's perceived lack of a distinct national or cultural identity. As an example, he noted that both Venezuela's national sport (baseball) and Venezuela's popular music ultimately were American in origin.|$|E

25|$|Neither {{the use of}} {{graphite}} nor {{sodium nitrate}} was new. Glossing gunpowder corns with graphite was already an accepted technique in 1839, and sodium nitrate-based blasting powder {{had been made in}} Peru for many years using the sodium nitrate mined at Tarapacá (now in Chile). Also, in 1846, two plants were built in south-west England to make blasting powder using this sodium nitrate. The idea may well have been brought from Peru by Cornish miners returning home after completing their contracts. Another suggestion is that it was William Lobb, the planthunter, who recognised the possibilities of sodium nitrate during his travels in South America. Lammot du Pont would have known about the use of graphite and probably also knew about the plants in south-west England. In his patent <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> to state that his claim was for the combination of graphite with sodium nitrate-based powder, rather than for either of the two individual technologies.|$|E

Unsuccessful in this, they attempted to prevent the tea from being unloaded after three tea ships had arrived in Boston Harbor. Hancock was at the fateful meeting on December 16, where he reportedly told the crowd, [...] "Let every man do what is right in his own eyes." [...] Hancock did not take part in the Boston Tea Party that night, but he approved of the action, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> not to publicly praise the destruction of private property.|$|E

500|$|During the investigations, Ivy Lee, {{who handled}} public {{relations}} for the Rockefeller family, and a team at the Institute began a campaign to defend Rhoads' reputation. He {{was seen as a}} promising researcher. The Rockefeller Foundation also wanted to protect its working relationship with medical organizations in Puerto Rico and avoid problems with critics of human experimentation in the US. During the early 1930s, there was a revival of the anti-vivisectionist movement in the US, which also was concerned about the use of vulnerable populations as human subjects of experimentation: children (especially orphans), prisoners, and soldiers. As Lederer observed, [...] "some members of the medical community...monitored the popular and medical press." [...] Francis Peyton Rous of the Rockefeller Institute was editor of the Journal of Experimental Medicine through the 1930s and 1940s. Although it accepted few articles on clinical research, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> about their wording in an effort to avoid criticism by the anti-vivisectionists.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{financial}} {{interests in the}} music publishing business grew after he collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s and learned that McCartney was making approximately $40 million a year from other people's songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun investing in publishing rights to songs that others had written, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> with his acquisitions, only bidding on {{a few of the}} dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included [...] "Everyday People" [...] (1968), Len Barry's [...] "1-2-3" [...] (1965), and Dion DiMucci's [...] "The Wanderer" [...] (1961) and [...] "Runaround Sue" [...] (1961); however, his most significant purchase came in 1985, when he acquired the publishing rights to ATV Music Publishing after months of negotiation. ATV had acquired the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including the Northern Songs catalog that contained the majority of the Lennon–McCartney compositions recorded by the Beatles.|$|E
500|$|On August 3, 2013, Frank {{expressed}} {{sympathy with}} the host's atheism on the television program Real Time with Bill Maher. [...] In his biography, however, Frank states unequivocally {{that he is not}} an atheist and is uncomfortable expressing firm views on questions for which he is unable to provide an answer. Frank's agnosticism led him to resolve (if he had been appointed as interim Senator) to take the oath of office on the United States Constitution, rather than the Bible. For most of his life and entire Congressional career, Frank was known as a Jew. Frank continues to identify strongly with the Jewish community and has been careful throughout his career that his agnosticism not reflect negatively on other Jews.

60|$|But, then, {{let me add}} a caution {{here for}} the best of tradesmen not to neglect--namely, as the {{tradesman}} should take care to pay his bills and notes currently, so, that he may do it, <b>he</b> must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> what notes <b>he</b> issues out, and how he suffers others to draw on him. <b>He</b> that <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> of his reputation in business, will also be cautious not to let any man he deals with over draw him, or draw upon him before the money drawn for his due. And as to notes promissory, or under his hand, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> not to give out such notes but on good occasions, and where he has the effects in his hand to answer them; this keeps his cash whole, and preserves his ability of performing and punctually paying when the notes become due; and the want of this caution has ruined the reputation of a tradesman many times, when he might otherwise have preserved himself in as good credit and condition as other men.|$|R
