According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The Wrath of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its <b>intended</b> <b>meaning</b> in The Wrath of Khan) is death, Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} area in {{semantic}} analysis is {{the identification of}} the <b>intended</b> <b>meaning</b> at the word level (taken to include idiomatic expressions). This is word-sense disambiguation (a concept that is evolving away from the notion that words have discrete senses, but rather are characterized by {{the ways in which they}} are used, i.e., their contexts). The tasks in this area include lexical sample and all-word disambiguation, multi- and cross-lingual disambiguation, and lexical substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of lexical resources.|$|E

It is well-known that Crazy Horse did not want to be photographed during his lifetime and is reportedly buried in an undisclosed location. While Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear believed in the sincerity of the motives, many Native Americans still oppose the <b>intended</b> <b>meaning</b> of the memorial.

25|$|As {{it comes}} to word {{formation}} processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes {{to show up in}} children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently.

When {{it comes to}} compounds, children first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though some of them do not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the <b>intended</b> <b>meaning</b> such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept.|$|E

500|$|Linguistically, ain't {{is formed}} by the same rule that English {{speakers}} use to form aren't and other contractions of auxiliary verbs. Most linguists consider usage of ain't to be grammatical, as long as its users convey their <b>intended</b> <b>meaning</b> to their audience. In other words, a sentence such as [...] "She ain't got no sense" [...] is grammatical because it generally follows a native speaker's word order, and because a native speaker would recognize the meaning of that sentence. Linguists draw a distinction, however, between grammaticality and acceptability: what may be considered grammatical across all dialects may nevertheless be considered not acceptable in certain dialects or contexts. The usage of ain't is socially unacceptable in some situations.|$|E

500|$|Pragmatic {{directions}} provide {{children with}} {{additional information about}} the speaker's <b>intended</b> <b>meaning.</b> Children's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer, such as explicit links to word meanings. Adults present young children with information about how words are {{related to each other}} through connections, such as [...] "is a part of", [...] "is a kind of", [...] "belongs to", or [...] "is used for". These pragmatic directions provide children with essential information about language, allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words. This is also called inclusion. When children are provided with two words related by inclusion, they hold on to that information. When children hear an adult say an incorrect word, and then repair their mistake by stating the correct word, children take into account the repair when assigning meanings to the two words.|$|E

Language {{becomes an}} {{important}} thing for people as {{the part of the}} society becausethey need language in their communication. In making communication more effectiveand to make sentences more acceptable to the hearer, it can be measured by applying cooperative principle consisting of four maxims proposed by Grice (2004), but in the real communication, that principle is not always being obeyed by the speaker and this phenomenon is called flouting and violating maxim. The writer conducts a study on “Wild Child” movie which shows the violating and flouting maxims phenomena occurring between the main characters. There are three problems of this study: (1) what maxims are violated and flouted in the main characters 2 ̆ 7 utterances of Wild Child movie in the exposition and conflict plot (2) How are the implied meaningsresolved by the interlocutors from the utterances being violated and flouted in WildChild movie (3) What are the <b>intended</b> <b>meanings</b> of the utterances being violated andflouted in Wild Child movie. This study uses the qualitative approach because the analysis {{is in the form of}} description rather than numbers. Then, the writer analyzes the main characters 2 ̆ 7 utterances. This study reveals that violating and flouting maxims are applied in themovie. There are 19 dialogues containing violating and flouting maxims, and the most violated and flouted is maxim of quantity. From violating and flouting maxims uttered by the main characters, their interlocutors use three resolving strategies: negotiation, contextual knowledge exploitation, and combination strategies in resolving the <b>intended</b> <b>meanings.</b> There are some <b>intended</b> <b>meanings</b> found, such as giving more information to hearer, maintaining good relationship, making jokes, supporting hearer, agreeing statement, persuading and showing surprise. Then, most of <b>intended</b> <b>meanings</b> from the utterances being violated and flouted are Showing Surprise and persuading hearer strategies. The most maxims that violated and flouted in the movie was quantity, it is shown by the main character in the movie by giving more information to the hearer in every conversation she made. The main character showed her ignorance and her being spoilt as a new student of Abbey Mount, a girlboarding school in rural of England. The writer suggests that the next researchers will analyze about the violating andflouting maxims in different plot, such as climax, falling action because the analysisabout resolving strategies will be more interesting. The writer also suggests that thenext researcher will use different theories about context that help to define theimplicit meaning, such as the relevance theory...|$|R

Mass-classifiers are present in all languages since {{they are the only}} way to [...] "count" [...] mass nouns that are not naturally divided into units (as, for example, [...] "three [...] of mud" [...] in English; *"three muds" [...] is ungrammatical). On the other hand, count-classifiers are not inherently mandatory, and are absent from most languages. Furthermore, count-classifiers are used with an [...] "unexpectedly low frequency"; in many settings, speakers avoid specific classifiers by just using a bare noun (without a number or demonstrative) or using the general classifier gè. Linguists and typologists such as Joseph Greenberg have suggested that specific count-classifiers are semantically [...] "redundant", repeating information present within the noun. Count-classifiers can be used stylistically, though, and {{can also be used to}} clarify or limit a speaker's <b>intended</b> <b>meaning</b> when using a vague or ambiguous noun; for example, the noun kè [...] "class" [...] can refer to courses in a semester or specific class periods during a day, depending on whether the classifier (...) mén or (...) jié is used.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the <b>intended</b> <b>meaning</b> {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that {{every once in a while}} I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E
