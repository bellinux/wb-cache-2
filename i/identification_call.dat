5000|$|During {{a routine}} mission, Claus' men find the dead {{bodies of the}} man's family that they {{rejected}} earlier. Without warning, an ambush ensues. Claus, without proper <b>identification,</b> <b>calls</b> in an airstrike on a nearby compound to cover the men's escape. He is charged the next day for killing 11 innocent civilians, and is sent back home. The grave consequences of these accusations shake him and his family, and his defense lawyer asserts {{that he needs to}} claim that he had proper identification in order to avoid a prison sentence. Though Claus plans to admit his guilt, Maria angrily admonishes him for not thinking of his children's lives without a father. He ultimately decides to claim that he had proper <b>identification</b> to <b>call</b> for the airstrike.|$|R

50|$|QSIG has two layers, called BC (basic call) and GF (generic function). QSIG BC {{describes}} {{how to set}} up calls between PBXs. QSIG GF provides supplementary services for large-scale corporate, educational, and government networks, such as line <b>identification,</b> <b>call</b> intrusion and call forwarding. Thus for a large or very distributed company that requires multiple PBXs, users can receive the same services across the network and be unaware of the switch that their telephone is connected to. This greatly eases the problems of management of large networks.|$|E
50|$|Elections Canada {{followed}} up {{on at least two}} instances in which voters received robocalls supposedly from Elections Canada telling voters that their polling stations had been changed. In one instance, Eduardo Harari, a volunteer working on Ken Dryden’s Liberal campaign in York Centre, stated that the reason he had been told in one of the calls for the polling station location change was due to the high number of people voting at his polling station. Harari also said that he had received eight bilingual fake calls from Elections Canada telling him his polling station had changed, including one on April 21 and the last on May 2. While Harari did report the calls to Elections Canada during and after the election, he was only contacted by Elections Canada after the second call. Charbonneau also interviewed Peggy Walsh Craig of Nipissing—Timiskaming, who said she had received a robocall purportedly from Elections Canada. Craig also stated that she received voter-identification calls earlier in the campaign ostensibly from someone representing the Conservative party. Harari also reported having received a similar voter <b>identification</b> <b>call</b> from someone claiming to be from the Conservative party. Both Harari and Craig had indicated they would not be voting Conservative.|$|E

Patients with any of these infectious mono-nucleosis syndromes (IMS) present sufficient clinical and laboratory findings to suggest the possibility of infectious mononucleosis, but the key points in making the differentiation, as we see it, are the pertinent history, some deviations from the typical I 1 ~I pattern of expression, and above all no increase in heterophile antibodies after absorption of their serum with guinea-pig kidney antigen. The review first describes typical clinical and laboratory features of infectious mono-nucleosis to facilitate comparison with these simulating syndromes. Infectious Mononucleosi...|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{fundamental}} concept that most similar properties of samples from a single-object class should be congregated on their class mean, an efficient and simple approach for pattern <b>identification,</b> <b>called</b> the mean representation based classifier (MRC), is presented. MRC is a linear model representing a testing sample as a linear {{combination of all}} class means and the class associating the biggest item of the linear combination coefficient is favoured. MRC is easy to employ with a least squares estimator. In addition, MRC need not tune any parameter and avoids mistaking the local optimum value as the global optimal one. MRC is evaluated on three standard databases. The experimental results show MRC is superior to other state-of-the-art nonparametric classifiers...|$|R

40|$|Automatic <b>identification</b> of bird <b>calls</b> without manual {{intervention}} {{has been a}} challenging task for meaningful research on the taxonomy and monitoring of bird migrations in ornithology. In this paper we apply several techniques used in speech recognition to the automatic <b>identification</b> of bird <b>calls.</b> A new technique which computes the ensemble average on the FFT spectrum is proposed for <b>identification</b> of bird <b>calls.</b> This ensemble average is computed on the FFT spectrum of each bird and is called the Spectral Ensemble Average Voice Print (SEAV) of that particular bird. The SEAV of various birds are computed and {{are found to be}} different when compared to each other. A database of bird calls is created from the available recordings of fifteen bird species. The SEAV is then used for the <b>identification</b> of bird <b>calls</b> from this database. The results of identification using SEAV are then compared against the results derived from common classifiers used in speech recognition like dynamic time warping (DTW), Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). A one level and two level classifier combination is also tried by combining SEAV classifier with the DTW classifier. The SEAV is computationally less expensive when compared to DTW or the GMM based classifiers while performing better than the DTW technique. Several new possibilities in automatic bird <b>call</b> <b>identification</b> using SEAV are also listed. 1...|$|R

40|$|A novel fusion {{approach}} for Language <b>Identification</b> <b>called</b> Language-dependent Fusion (LDF) {{is presented in}} this paper. A fusion system is a hybrid system which fuses the results from several individual sub-systems which utilize varied features, models, and/or classifiers. In LDF, instead of applying single fixed weighting coefficients to each sub-system, which happens in conventional approach such as Linear Score Weighting (LSW), varied weighting coefficients are applied to not only each sub-system but also to each language. Furthermore, instead of the experimental and statistical approach, weighting coefficients are calculated from the performance of each language-pair, which reflects the difference among languages. Experiments conducted on the OGI- 92 multi-language database demonstrate a remarkable improvement when compared to individual sub-systems (45. 46 % error rate reduction) and commonly used fusion techniques such as LSW (33. 33 % error rate reduction) in a 10 -language setting. Other advantages of LDF are also discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|We give a {{new method}} to turn {{identification}} schemes into signature schemes with two advan-tages over the Fiat-Shamir transform: (1) Security is proven with tight reductions to standard assumptions, and (2) We obtain not just ordinary signatures, but ones with extra properties, specifically double-authentication prevention. The method consists of defining a new goal for <b>identification</b> <b>called</b> security against constrained impersonation that, unlike standard goals, {{can be shown}} via tight reductions from standard assumptions, and then using a double-hashing transform to turn identification schemes that meet this notion, and have an additional syntac-tic property we call being trapdoor, into double-authentication-preventing signature (DAPS) schemes, again with a tight reduction. Our implementations, using OpenSSL’s crypto library on an Intel Core i 7, show that our DAPS schemes are not only significantly more efficient than prior ones, but competitive with in-use signature schemes that lack the double authenticatio...|$|R
