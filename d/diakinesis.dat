5000|$|Chromosomes {{condense}} further {{during the}} <b>diakinesis</b> stage, from Greek words meaning [...] "moving through". This {{is the first}} point in meiosis where the four parts of the tetrads are actually visible. Sites of crossing over entangle together, effectively overlapping, making chiasmata clearly visible.

40|$|Inheritance {{patterns}} at four allozyme loci and {{chromosome pairing}} behaviour at <b>diakinesis</b> {{were examined in}} the naturally occurring autotetraploid Heuchera grossulariifolia. Segregation patterns for Tpi, Pgi, Pgm- 2, and Lap deviated significantly from all possible disomic models. All patterns were consistent with tetrasomic inheritance of these marker loci. No chromatid segregation was detected electrophoretically. Meiotic chromosome configurations at <b>diakinesis</b> in 45 cells were compared with a previously published model to test for autopolyploid-like chromosome pairing. Using the observed chiasma frequencies, the frequency of quadrivalents {{was consistent with the}} expectations for an autotetraploid. We suggest that the low frequency of quadrivalents at <b>diakinesis</b> in Heuchera grossulariifolia is due to small chromosome size, which results in a low chiasma frequency.

40|$|Chromosomal {{studies were}} carried out on Eichhornia crassipes and the taxon was found to have 32 {{individual}} chromosomes with a haploid chromosome number of 16 (n = 16), indicating a clear tetraploid genome of 2 n = 4 x = 32. Chiasmata frequencies per nucleus/bivalent were analyzed at diplotene and <b>diakinesis</b> revealing a marked reduction of chiasmata at <b>diakinesis</b> as compared to diplotene. The very low terminalization value of 0. 43 showed that most of the chiasmata were terminalized at <b>diakinesis</b> and metaphase I. Multivalent associations were frequent suggesting the presence of a translocation heterozygote. Univalents were also of a frequent occurrence. Chromatid bridges, fragments, laggards and eliminated chromosomes were also frequent at both MI and MII. Secondary association of chromosomes occurred with a preponderance of four and eight over other groups. The occurrence of secondary associations and other aberrations were suggestive that Eichhornia crassipes is of hybrid origin. Cytological studies of Eichhornia crassipes revealed that chromosome behaviour which includes high frequency of chromatid bridges formed (42. 52 %), high percentage of univalents (15. 24 %) and the presence of phragmoplast during microsporogenesis does not influence the prolific behaviour of the plant...|$|E

40|$|During {{studies on}} the genomic {{relationships}} of the wild species of the genus Pennisetum, one spontaneous triploid (3 x =  27) plant was identified among the diploid cytotypes (2 n =  18) of Pennisetum hohenackeri Hochst. ex Steud. The triploid plant resembled the diploid in most morphological characters, except for the reduced number of spikelets. Chromosome associations of 9 II +  9 I were observed at <b>diakinesis</b> and metaphase I. The bivalents divided normally, while the univalents lagged and formed a separate nucleus, which was included {{in one of the}} daughter cells.

40|$|We {{have studied}} four Caenorhabditis elegans homologs of the Rad 21 /Scc 1 /Rec 8 sister-chromatid {{cohesion}} protein family. Based on the RNAi phenotype and protein localization, {{it is concluded}} that one of them, W 02 A 2. 6 p, is the likely worm ortholog of yeast Rec 8 p. The depletion of C. elegans W 02 A 2. 6 p (called REC- 8) by RNAi, induced univalent formation and splitting of chromosomes into sister chromatids at <b>diakinesis.</b> Chromosome synapsis at pachytene was defective, but primary homology recognition seemed unaffected, as a closer-than-random association of homologous {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) signals at leptotene/zygotene was observed. Depletion of REC- 8 also induced chromosome fragmentation at <b>diakinesis.</b> We interpret these fragments as products of unrepaired meiotic double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), because fragmentation was suppressed in a spo- 11 background. Thus, REC- 8 seems to be required for successful repair of DSBs. The occurrence of DSBs in REC- 8 -depleted meiocytes suggests that DSB formation does not depend on homologous synapsis. Anti-REC- 8 immunostaining decorated synaptonemal complexes (SCs) at pachytene and chromosomal axes in bivalents and univalents at <b>diakinesis.</b> Between metaphase I and metaphase II, REC- 8 is partially lost from the chromosomes. The partial loss of REC- 8 from chromosomes between metaphase I and metaphase II suggests that worm REC- 8 might function similarly to yeast Rec 8 p. The loss of yeast Rec 8 p from chromosome arms at meiosis I and centromeres at meiosis II coordinates the disjunction of homologs and sister chromatids at the two meiotic divisions...|$|E

A definite relationship between the number of cells showing these star formations at pachytene and the number of cells showing bivalent associations at <b>diakinesis</b> and metaphase I on the one hand, and between the number of arms involved the stars and the number of chromosomes involved in each association on the other, signify that these stars are forerunners of secondary associations...|$|E

The chromosomes were analyzed during mitosis and <b>diakinesis,</b> and the tetrad normality and pollen viability were also assessed. In addition, stomata and pollen were measured and some plant features were studied morphometrically. All of the strains had 2 n = 22, except for two, which had 2 n = 33 and 2 n = 44.

Triploid and tetraploid plants had a lower tetrad normality rate than the diploids. All of the strains had inviable pollen. Thus, the higher the ploidy number, the greater the size of the pollen and the stomata, and the lower their number per unit area. The triploid strain produced the shortest plants and the lowest number of inflorescences, whereas the tetraploid strain had the largest leaves.

In this article we describe a new protocol for immunolabelling meiotic proteins that allows the detection of a large range of proteins on strongly spread chromosomes throughout the entire meiotic process. We used this method to immunodetect MLH 1, a crucial component of the meiotic recombination machinery, and found that it can be visualised as foci from pachytene to <b>diakinesis,</b> where it co-localises with chiasmata. The mean MLH 1 foci number per meiotic cell at <b>diakinesis</b> was 8. 4 for WS- 4 and 9. 95 for Col- 0, with the number of foci per bivalent ranging from 1 to 5. We also analysed MLH 1 distribution within bivalents and found that they were not restricted to specific chromosomal regions. The analysis of MLH 1 foci formation in the Atzip 4 mutant, where class I crossover (CO) formation is prevented, revealed that residual chiasmata were not labelled by MLH 1, strongly suggesting that MLH 1 antibodies only label class I COs in Arabidopsis.

40|$|Changes in {{the pattern}} of {{organization}} of microtubules in the meiotic stages of development of pollen (i. e. from pre-meiotic interphase to more or less metaphase I) of a normal (IR 36) and a temperature/photoperiod sensitive male sterile line (Peiai 64 S) of rice were studied using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In IR 36, from pre-meiotic interphase to metaphase I, the pattern of microtubule distribution in the meiocytes underwent a series of changes. Some new organizational patterns of microtubules (that have not been described before) were observed during microsporogenesis, including the existence of a broad band of perinuclear microtubules at the <b>diakinesis</b> stage of development. The pattern of microtubule distribution in the meiocytes of the male sterile line, Peiai 64 S, was quite different from that seen in IR 36. In Peiai 64 S, the microtubules showed abnormal patterns of distribution from pre-meiotic interphase to metaphase I. For example the broad band of perinuclear microtubules seen at <b>diakinesis</b> in IR 36 was much disorganized and loosened in Peiai 64 S. The spindles formed were also very abnormal and different from the normal spindle. The appearance of abnormal microtubule distribution {{in the early stages of}} microsporogenesis may contribute to the malformation and ultimate abortion of pollen in Peiai 64 S. 對水稻(Oryzasativa L.)

Two temperatures, 21 ° and 32 °, were used for both the 4 A and 6 B experiments. —Only one chiasma was observed in each heteromorphic bivalent.

The fewer crossovers than expected are explained in part by stickiness of chromosomes at the high temperature, sometimes resulting in adjacent chromosomes being wrongly scored as having a chiasma, and in part by premetaphase disjunction of some recombined bivalents and subsequent independent behavior of the two resulting univalents. —Male transmission of the 4 A telocentric from the heteromorphic bivalent was unusually high: 51 % at 21 ° and 31 % at 32 °...|$|E

Moderate increases in mean yield were obtained in some progenies; however, some progenies were not significantly affected or had lower average number of berries per plant than their own parents. Moreover, concentration of fruit ripening reached a peak during {{the second and third}} harvests.

Spontaneous chromosome breakage occurring in early prophase was believed to {{have resulted in the}} observed fragments at <b>diakinesis.</b> The <b>diakinesis</b> fragments and univalents were the probable origin of the anaphase laggards and subsequent micronuclei in the quartets. Pollen fertility in the parental genotypes was measured using pollen germination in vitro followed by staining with propioniccarmine. There {{was no significant difference between}} the average of percent of pollen classified as sound by this method, and the average percentage of quartet groups with no micronuclei, which is an indicator of pollen normality. The hybrid genotypes exhibited normal anthesis, with well formed anthers, however they failed to dehisce and produce normal pollen. Free normal microsporocytes were produced following the quartet stage in the hybrid, but they remained uninucleated and thus degenerated to shriveled pollen. The pistil in the hybrid appeared normal and limited evidence suggests they are fertile. Abnormalities in chromosome behavior which lead to the loss of genetic material as micronuclei in the microsporocyte, can explain the percentage of abnormal pollen observed in the parental genotypes, but not in the hybrid.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of meiotic {{chromosomes}} in air-dried preparations from 30 genitally sound rams (Ovis aries). Three of the rams had a normal mitotic karyotype (2 n = 54) and the remainder were carriers of the t 1, t 2 and t 3 Robertsonian translocations in various heterozygous and homozygous combinations. The studies on the primary spermatocytes showed that the normal rams had a modal number of 27 chromosomal elements and the translocation-carrying rams were recorded with a modal number of either 24 or 25. The translocation in the heterozygous state was characterized {{by the presence of}} a trivalent in cells at the diplotene, <b>diakinesis</b> and metaphase I stages, while in the homozygous state it was characterized by the presence of a bivalent. The modal number of chromosomal elements was recorded in 90. 5 to 97. 3 percent of the cells at <b>diakinesis</b> and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams. The modal number of chromosomal elements was recorded in 88. 3 percent of the cells in the normal rams. An association between the sex bivalent and a small autosomal bivalent was recorded in 3. 5 to 5. 3 percent of the cells at <b>diakinesis</b> and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams. Eight percent of the cells in the normal rams were seen with a sex bivalent association. The sex chromosomes were separated in 0. 0 to 1. 1 percent of the cells at <b>diakinesis</b> and metaphase I in the translocation-carrying rams, while 0. 7 percent of the cells in the normal rams had separated sex chromosomes. However, aneuploidy involving the sex chromosomes was not observed in the secondary spermatocytes from the normal and translocation-carrying rams. A total of 1, 757 secondary spermatocytes were counted from 27 translocation-carrying rams and 103 secondary spermatocytes from 3 normal rams. The studies on the secondary spermatocytes showed that the modal number of 30 chromosome arms was recorded in 87. 3 to 96. 0 percent of the non-polyploid cells in the translocation-carrying rams and 95. 2 percent of the cells in the normal rams. No hypermodal cells were found in the normal rams. Hypermodal cells were recorded in 0. 0 to 3. 6 per cent of the non-polyploid cells in the translocation-carrying rams. There were individual variations in the percentage of hypermodal cells recorded in rams with identical karyotypes. There were also significantly greater numbers of cells with 29 chromosome arms than with 31 chromosome arms in the translocation-carrying rams. This suggested that chromosome loss due to lagging at anaphase I or technical manipulation, must have occurred in addition to non-disjunction. A significant surplus of secondary spermatocytes of normal karyotype and a deficit of 25, t 1 t 3 were found in the metaphase II figures from the triple heterozygous rams. Significantly uneven distributions of segregation products were also found in the multiple translocation-carrying rams with karyotypes of 50,xy,t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 and 49,xy,t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 tx. The translocation-carrying sheep have been shown to have good conception rates and an average breeding performance. This would suggest that only balanced (euploid) spermatozoa are involved in fertilization and the unbalanced (aneuploid) spermatocytes fail to mature into spermatozoa and are selected against or degenerate during spermatogenesis. The evidence indicates that the fertility of the ram is unaffected by the presence of the translocation chromosomes and consequently these sheep should not be eliminated arbitrarily from our animal populations...|$|E
30|$|We tested two hypotheses, {{taking into}} {{consideration}} that the number and the position of chiasmata occurs randomly (i.e. p[*]=[*] 0.5), as is expected in the meiotic process. For the first hypothesis, z 1 {{was defined as the}} proportion of open bivalents and in the second one, z 2, as the proportion of interstitial chiasmata. In order to minimize the differences in chiasmata occurrence during meiosis, open bivalents and chiasmata position were determined mainly in <b>diakinesis</b> and also in prometaphase I, in cells where those items could be undoubtedly determined. Previous published chromosome number reports were included in this report in order to enlarging the discussion of this cytogenetic study and the meiotic recombination analysis.|$|E
40|$|Four {{populations of}} Pfaffia tuberosa, the Brazilian ginseng, {{collected}} in the central region {{of the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) were cytologically analyzed for meiotic behavior. All were tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 68) and this condition could be observed through multiple chromosome pairing in pachytene and quadrivalent formation at <b>diakinesis.</b> Irregular chromosome segregation in both divisions {{led to the formation of}} a wide diversity of meiotic products. Chromosome stickiness was also frequently found among microsporocytes. Pollen grains of different sizes were observed, while pollen sterility ranged from 49. 56 to 64. 20 % among analyzed populations.

40|$|Sister {{chromatid}} cohesion {{is fundamental}} for the faithful transmission of chromosomes during both meiosis and mitosis. Proteins {{involved in this}} process are highly conserved from yeasts to humans. In screenings for sterile animals with abnormal vulval morphology, mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans evl- 14 and scc- 3 genes were isolated. Defects in cell divisions were observed in germ line {{as well as in}} vulval and somatic gonad lineages. Through positional cloning of these genes, we have shown that EVL- 14 and SCC- 3 are likely the only C. elegans homologs of the yeast sister chromatid cohesion proteins Pds 5 and Scc 3, respectively. Both evl- 14 and scc- 3 mutants displayed defects in the meiotic germ line. In evl- 14 mutants, synaptonemal complexes (SCs) were detectable but more than the usual six DAPI (4 ', 6 '-diamidino- 2 -phenylindole) -positive structures were seen at <b>diakinesis,</b> suggesting that EVL- 14 /PDS- 5 is important for the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion in late prophase. In scc- 3 mutant animals, normal SCs were not visible and ~ 24 DAPI-positive structures were seen at <b>diakinesis,</b> indicating that SCC- 3 is necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. Immunostaining revealed that localization of REC- 8, a homolog of the yeast meiotic cohesin subunit Rec 8, to the chromosomes depends on the presence of SCC- 3 but not that of EVL- 14 /PDS- 5. scc- 3 RNA interference (RNAi) -treated embryos were 100 % lethal and displayed defects in cell divisions. evl- 14 RNAi caused a range of phenotypes. These results indicate that EVL- 14 /PDS- 5 and SCC- 3 have functions in both mitosis and meiosis...|$|E
