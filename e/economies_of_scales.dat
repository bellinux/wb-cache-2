40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tries to}} contribute to empirically assess hypotheses of the "New Economic Geography". Specifically, we tested {{the relevance of the}} combination of lower transportation cost with the role of economies of scale in explaining the regional distribution of total activity and of industrial activity. Economies of scale are assumed to be due to "backward and forward" linkages among firms. We also took into account congestion effects and asymmetry among regions. The model was tested for the regions of Brazil, in the period 1950 - 1995 and 1970 - 1995, and for the regions of India, in the period 1961 - 1991. Using panel results, we observed that transportation costs were generating concentration of total activity in the periods 1950 - 1995 arid 1950 - 1970. For these samples, there is evidence that <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> were a cause of concentration of total activity. Other forces, not explained by the model, were generating dispersion and so were congestion effects. For the period 1970 - 1995, we found that congestion effects and lower transportation cost were helping to disperse economic activity, in the panel results. Economies of scale were not, contrary to the model's predictions, helping economic growth. In the case of Brazil, for the 18 -state samples, industrial activity tended to concentrated due to the effects of lower transportation cost, although higher industrial growth rates were a characteristic of the states with less <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales.</b> In the case of India, strong concentration effects were taking place, both due to lower transportation cost and due to other reasons.

40|$|Beginning with an {{empirical}} analysis of banking crises using a logit econometric model covering {{a sample of}} developed and developing countries between 1980 - 1997, the paper suggests that crises are more likely in years of low growth and high real interest rates.

The paper argues that less developed countries (LDCs) face inherent obstacles in setting up efficient regulation, and building up a sound-banking sector. These are related to the presence of multiple tasks and multiple principals, poor institutions, lack of <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> in banking sector as well as regulatory supervision, and the lack of reputation.

In this deliverable, {{it has been shown}} that there are important economies of scale in airport operations, and, thus, it can justify the current trend of capacity expansion programs observed in major hubs. For the year 2006, the range of estimated economies of scale varies between 4. 36 and 1. 23, with an average value of 1. 75. A basic methodology was proposed in order to analyze the likely level of output at which the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> would be exhausted.

More specifically I focus on investigating whether {{there are signs of}} diversification, formal schooling being a risky investment. The data used is unusual in that it includes the head of household’s risk preferences in addition to school-related and other information. This allows me to test whether older sibling’s education is differently related to school start and school progress in households with differently risk-averse heads, something that should be expected if there is any household level diversification. I find this to be the case with regard to the probability of school entry, but not of school progress. And, the diversification mechanism is not strong enough to dominate forces creating positive sibling dependency in education. Trying to evaluate what causes the positive siblings’ dependency I focus on economies of scale in education/sibling interaction and liquidity constraints and results points towards <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> being the important mechanism creating the positive siblings ’ dependency. ...|$|E

In the second phase, the model makes an optimal assignment of microcontrollers to each feasible or buildable product by utilizing <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> offered by large microcontroller volumes.
