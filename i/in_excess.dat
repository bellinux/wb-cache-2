On the other hand, the portion of NY31 in the Oneida County town of Vernon between the Vernon Downs racetrack and Youngs Road handles just 910 cars per day on average, making it the least-traveled segment of the route.|$|E

Using data from the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) of 2001 - 2003, we consider whether the female <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> internalizing disorders contributes to the female <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> chronic debilitating conditions and whether the male <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> externalizing disorders contributes to the male <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> life threatening conditions. We find that women have significantly higher odds of meeting the DSM-IV criteria for one or more lifetime internalizing disorders and significantly lower odds of meeting the DSM-IV criteria for one or more lifetime externalizing disorders. We also find that women have higher odds of reporting four of the ten chronic debilitating conditions examined, including arthritis, frequent or severe headaches, seasonal allergies, and gallbladder removal, and lower odds of reporting three of the six life threatening conditions examined, including stroke, heart disease, and high blood pressure. We conclude that the female <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> internalizing disorders partially mediates, or explains, the female <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> arthritis, headaches, and gallbladder removal, while the male <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> externalizing disorders partially accounts for the male <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> heart disease and high blood pressure.

Qualitatively different behaviour arises <b>in</b> the <b>excess</b> receptor regime, where the volume concentration of receptors is much greater than the ligand concentration, and the excess ligand regime, where the ligand concentration is much greater than the receptor concentration. <b>In</b> the <b>excess</b> receptor regime a ligand binds at as many sites as possible as determined by the crosslinking affinity constant and the valence of the ligand. Thus ligands tend to be bound at many sites. <b>In</b> the <b>excess</b> ligand regime, ligands compete for receptor binding and hence tend to bind at a low number of sites per molecule.

40|$|In most countries, {{numbers of}} deaths rise {{considerably}} {{during the winter}} season. This winter <b>excess</b> <b>in</b> mortality has, however, been declining during recent decades. The causes of this decline are hardly known. This paper attempts to derive a number of hypotheses {{on the basis of}} a detailed description of trends <b>in</b> winter <b>excess</b> mortality <b>in</b> the Netherlands. Numbers of death by age, cause of death, and month of death for the period 1953 - 1988 were analysed by log-linear regression. There was a 50 % reduction <b>in</b> winter <b>excess</b> mortality between the 1950 s and 1970 followed by a much smaller reduction in later years. The decline <b>in</b> winter <b>excess</b> for total mortality can largely be attributed to parallel declines for a number of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Excess mortality decreased for winter months without influenza epidemics as well as for those with epidemics. The results suggest that the decline <b>in</b> winter <b>excess</b> mortality <b>in</b> the Netherlands can only partly be explained by decreases in influenza-associated mortality. It is argued that the role of the introduction of central heating is minimal and that a fundamental role is played by factors closely related to socioeconomic progres...|$|R
