We find that the location of rent protection institutions and the sectoral trade structure determine whether or not globalization raises steady-state economic growth.

By analyzing a two-period dynamic noncooperative game between these two firms, we identify conditions under which the copycat can gain successful market entry. More importantly, we find that the potential entry of a copycat creates (implicit) pressure for the incumbent to lower its selling price; hence, it improves consumer welfare. Finally, we identify conditions under which the potential entry of a copycat can increase social welfare (i. e., consumer welfare and the profit of both firms) ...|$|E

40|$|Vegetable {{oils and}} fats {{may be used as}} cheap {{substitutes}} for milk fat to manufacture imitation cheese or imitation ice cream. In this study, 400 [*]MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the fat fraction of the products was used in the context of food surveillance to validate the labeling of milk-based products. For sample preparation, the fat was extracted using an automated Weibull-Stoldt methodology. Using principal component analysis (PCA), <b>imitation</b> <b>products</b> can be easily detected. In both cheese and ice cream, a differentiation according to the type of raw material (milk fat and vegetable fat) was possible. The loadings plot shows that <b>imitation</b> <b>products</b> were distinguishable by differences in their fatty acid ratios. Furthermore, a differentiation of several types of cheese (Edamer, Gouda, Emmentaler, and Feta) was possible. Quantitative data regarding the composition of the investigated products can also be predicted from the same spectra using partial least squares (PLS) regression. The models obtained for 13 compounds in cheese (R 2 0. 75 – 0. 95) and 17 compounds in ice cream (R 2 0. 83 – 0. 99) (e. g., fatty acids and esters) were suitable for a screening analysis.

40|$|Product imitating, {{which is}} usually preceded by reverse engineering, {{is defined as the}} process of replicating the {{performance}} of an existing product in one or more of its per-formance areas and is a common industry practice. Imitating is often chosen as a design path to reduce investment costs and quickly enter a growing market. This paper presents metrics {{that can be used to}} quantify the barrier and time to market entry for a competitor pursuing an imitation design path. The market entry of a competitor releasing an <b>imitation</b> <b>product</b> to the masses can occur only after the process of reverse engineering and imitat-ing. Therefore, a Barrier to Market Entry is the summation of the reverse engineering and imitation barriers. Products that have been reverse engineered, imitated, and released to the masses can greatly reduce the market share of the original developer. The approach presented in this paper is designed to facilitate the creation of products that protect them-selves against reverse engineering and imitating. The presented approach balances the cost to develop such products against prolonged market share by introducing barriers to market entry. Through the use of unique materials, by the original developer, the time it takes for an imitator to release an imitation to the masses can be greatly delayed. The metrics presented are coupled with a numerical optimization technique in order to maximize the return on investment of the innovator. A simple structural example is used to illustrate the approach...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} meaning of huckster {{is a person}} who sells small articles, either door-to-door or from a stall or small store, like a peddler or hawker.

The word was still in use in England in the 1840s, when it appeared as a black market occupation. The word is related to the Middle Dutch hokester, hoekster and the Middle Low German höker, but appears earlier than any of these.

40|$|Purpose – Trade in {{counterfeit}} goods {{is perceived as}} a substantial threat to various industries. No longer is the emergence of <b>imitation</b> <b>products</b> confined to branded luxury goods and final markets. Counterfeit articles are increasingly finding their way into other sectors, including the fast-moving consumer goods, pharmaceutical, and automotive industries – with, in part, severe negative consequences for consumers, licit manufacturers, and brand owners alike. This paper seeks to shed light on the economic principles of counterfeit trade and the underlying illicit supply chains. Design/methodology/approach – An extensive literature review was conducted that comprised contributions from different strands of management research. Findings – Though governments as well as management have clearly identified the problem, very little is known – both in practice and theory – about the mechanisms and structure of the illicit market, the tactics of counterfeit producers, consumer behavior with respect to <b>imitation</b> <b>products</b> and the financial impact on individual companies. The diversity of the counterfeit phenomenon underlines the need for further research in this area and the development of company-specific measures for fighting product piracy. Research limitations/implications – The clandestine nature of the counterfeit market limits direct accessibility to the phenomenon. Consequently, the existing body of literature does not necessarily cover all aspects of counterfeit activities. The review helps to highlight existing research gaps but {{may not be able to}} identify additional aspects of the phenomenon that, thus far, have not been deemed relevant. Originality/value – The paper critically reviews the current state of research across different management-related disciplines. From an academic perspective it may serve as a starting point for a future research agenda that addresses the current knowledge gaps. From a practitioner's perspective it is helpful for understanding the relevant influence factors and for developing appropriate, state-of-the-art counterstrategies...|$|R
