5|$|It {{was hoped}} by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian {{governor}} Johan Van Angelbeek might {{be persuaded to}} allow a peaceful occupation of Ceylon by British forces, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the Kew Letters from William of Orange, which advocated cooperation with British forces. A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to negotiate and his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort Oostenberg, which overlooked Trincomalee, were successful. On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of Ceylon on 1 August however {{the commander of the}} defences refused to acknowledge the instruction, citing problems with the wording of the instructions. For two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander, the British position partially undermined by the destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock. Although all of the crew and passengers were saved, large quantities of military stores sank with the frigate.|$|E

25|$|Following his arrest, Philippon {{said that}} he would fight the charge, as he {{considers}} his phone to be “personal”. His case got national and international attention, and several organizations argued that the Charter right to privacy could extend to electronic devices at the border, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of recent Supreme Court case law.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{computer}} <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> technology is a vital component for lighting designers. Lighting computer programs are preferred in preparing architectural projects <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> techniques, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> calculations. Lighting computer programs, which arise with the aim of helping lighting designers, gain more interest day by day. The most important property of lighting computer programs is the ability to enable the simulation of lighting projects without requiring any real life applications. In addition, with the use of lighting computer programs, incomplete parts of projects are determined to make necessary calculations. In this study, the details about lighting computer programs, <b>especially</b> as used <b>in</b> interior <b>lighting,</b> are mentioned. A comparison of programs will be made by pointing out necessary characteristics <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> computer programs...|$|R

25|$|The main plot of The Winter's Tale {{is taken}} from Robert Greene's {{pastoral}} romance Pandosto, published in 1588. Shakespeare's changes to the plot are uncharacteristically slight, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the romance's undramatic nature, and Shakespeare's fidelity to it gives The Winter's Tale its most distinctive feature: the sixteen-year gap between {{the third and fourth}} acts.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the Commission adopted interventionism as its policy. The {{context of}} the decade was of {{decolonization}} of Africa and Asia, and many countries of the continent pressed for a more active UN policy on human rights issues, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of massive violations in apartheid South Africa. The new policy meant that the Commission would also investigate and produce reports on violations.|$|E
25|$|Ma {{was able}} to repair the {{political}} damage and, in December 2002, became the leading figure in the KMT by easily winning reelection as mayor of Taipei {{with the support of}} 64% of Taipei voters while DPP challenger Lee Ying-yuan received 36%. His solid victory, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of opposition from both President Chen and former President and KMT chairman Lee Teng-hui, led many to speculate about his chances as the KMT candidate for the 2004 presidential elections, although nothing came of it.|$|E

50|$|In Europe, {{academic}} {{belief in}} mercantilism {{began to fade}} in the late 18th century, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> Britain, <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the arguments of Adam Smith and the classical economists. The repeal of the Corn Laws by Robert Peel symbolised the emergence of free trade as an alternative system.|$|R

25|$|Planning {{continued}} {{for the northern}} Dutchess stretch, to be built after the war. With the enforced break in construction, and its new authority over the entire road, the commission began to look at ways to improve what had already been built, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the road's growing role as a regional artery. The Hawthorne Circle, where the Taconic, Saw Mill River Parkway and NY100 intersected, was the major problem. It had become a magnet for accidents and congestion. A 1944 study recommended it be replaced with a three-level grade-separated interchange.|$|E
25|$|At special {{sessions}} of the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, Smith and the Centre for Public Policy Analysis joined by Members of Congress, including U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, and others, {{called on the}} U.S. Department of Justice to immediately drop the case, and the charges, against General Vang and the other Hmong defendants, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the Lao government's and Lao Peoples Army's (LPA) ongoing military attacks and egregious human rights violations directed against many of the Laotian and Hmong people, which included attacks on unarmed civilians and political and religious dissidents, atrocities, rape, torture {{and the use of}} mass starvation.|$|E
25|$|The Sunday Times was wary {{of being}} duped, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> {{of the recent}} Hitler Diaries hoax. As a result, the {{newspaper}} insisted on verifying Vanunu's story with leading nuclear weapon experts, including former U.S. nuclear weapons designer Theodore Taylor and former British AWE engineer Frank Barnaby, who agreed that Vanunu's story was factual and correct. In addition, a reporter, Max Prangnell, was sent to Israel {{to find people who}} knew Vanunu and verify his story. Prangnell verified Vanunu's backstory, meeting a few people at Ben-Gurion University who identified Vanunu from a photograph, as well as meeting neighbors and others who confirmed he had worked at the Dimona nuclear plant.|$|E

50|$|Thermal {{insulation}} - Insulation in the building’s envelope {{will decrease}} {{the amount of}} heat transferred by radiation through the facades. This principle applies both to the opaque (walls and roof) and transparent surfaces (windows) of the envelope. Since roofs could be a larger contributor to the interior heat load, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>lighter</b> constructions (e.g. building and workshops with roof made out of metal structures), providing thermal insulation can effectively decrease heat transfer from the roof.|$|R

25|$|The {{unavailability}} {{of treatments}} in the most-affected regions has spurred controversy, with some calling for experimental drugs {{to be made}} more widely available in Africa on a humanitarian basis, and others warning that making unproven drugs widely available would be unethical, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of past experimentation conducted in developing countries by Western drug companies. As {{a result of the}} controversy, on 12 August an expert panel of the WHO endorsed the use of interventions with as-yet-unknown effects for both treatment and prevention of Ebola, and also said that deciding which treatments should be used and how to distribute them equitably were matters that needed further discussion.|$|E
25|$|Single-mother and lower-class {{families}} {{have a much}} more difficult time negotiating childcare or finding sustainable childcare options. The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model does not apply to single-parent families because the single-parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do. Few low-income mothers are happy with their childcare arrangements <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the fact that low-income childcare arrangements suffer from frequent disruptions. In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, an RAF {{board of}} inquiry ruled {{that it was}} {{impossible}} to establish the exact cause of the accident. This ruling was subsequently overturned by two senior reviewing officers, who stated the pilots were guilty of gross negligence for flying too fast and too low in thick fog. This finding proved to be controversial, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of irregularities and technical issues surrounding the then-new Chinook HC.2 variant which were uncovered. A Parliamentary inquiry conducted in 2001 found the previous verdict of gross negligence on the part of the crew to be 'unjustified'. In 2011, an independent review of the crash cleared the crew of negligence.|$|E

50|$|The idea of Competition Commission was {{conceived}} and {{introduced in the}} form of The Competition Act, 2002 by the Vajpayee government. A need was felt to promote competition and private enterprise <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> the <b>light</b> of 1991 Indian economic liberalisation.|$|R
25|$|Coal can {{be found}} in {{abundance}} in the USA and many other countries and its price has remained relatively constant in recent years. Of the traditional fossil fuels - oil, coal, and natural gas - coal is used as a feedstock for 40% of global electricity generation. Fossil fuel consumption and its contribution to large-scale, detrimental environmental changes is becoming a pressing issue, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the Paris Agreement. In particular, coal contains more CO2 per BTU than oil or natural gas and is responsible for 43% of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. Thus, the lower emissions that IGCC technology allows through gasification and pre-combustion carbon capture is discussed as a way to addressing aforementioned concerns.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{due to the}} {{political}} situation, research on the Kaifeng Jews and Judaism in China came to a standstill {{until the beginning of}} the 1980s, when political and economic reforms were implemented. In the 1980s, the Sino-Judaic Institute was founded by an international group of scholars to further research the history of the Jewish communities in China, promote educational projects related to the history of the Jews in China and assist the extant Jews of Kaifeng. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Israel in 1992 rekindled interest in Judaism and the Jewish experience, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the fact that 25,000 Jewish refugees fled to Shanghai during the Nazi period.|$|E
25|$|Much of Stieve's {{research}} was conducted during the 1930s, after the Nazi Party had come to power in Germany. He did not join the party himself, but as an ardent German nationalist supported Adolf Hitler {{in the hope of}} restoring national pride. The Nazis imprisoned and executed many of their political opponents, and their corpses became Stieve's primary research material, with his full awareness of their origin. While much of his work is still considered valuable—among other things, he provided scientific evidence that the rhythm method was not effective in preventing pregnancy—it is considered tainted by his effective collaboration with the Nazi regime's political repression, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of its later genocides.|$|E

25|$|Following the London Conference (1939) the British Government {{published}} a White Paper which proposed {{a limit to}} Jewish immigration from Europe, restrictions on Jewish land purchases, and a program for creating an independent state to replace the Mandate within ten years. This was seen by the Yishuv as betrayal of the mandatory terms, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the increasing persecution of Jews in Europe. In response, Zionists organised Aliyah Bet, a program of illegal immigration into Palestine. Lehi, {{a small group of}} extremist Zionists, staged armed attacks on British authorities in Palestine. However, the Jewish Agency, which represented the mainstream Zionist leadership, still hoped to persuade Britain to allow resumed Jewish immigration, and cooperated with Britain in World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Empire and the Qing Empire had {{maintained}} a long peace, {{starting with the}} Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, but Tsarist forces took advantage of Chinese defeats to impose the Aigun Treaty of 1858 and the Treaty of Peking of 1860 which ceded formerly Chinese territory in Manchuria to Russia, much of which is held by Russia {{to the present day}} (Primorye). The Russians aimed for control over the Amur River for navigation, and the all-weather ports of Dairen and Port Arthur in the Liaodong peninsula. The rise of Japan as an Asian power provoked Russia's anxiety, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of expanding Japanese influence in Korea. Following Japan's victory in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895, the Triple Intervention of Russia, Germany and France forced Japan to return the territory won in Liaodong, leading to a de facto Sino-Russian alliance.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that of itself Florida Maple is not {{employed}} as a commercial timber species, it is used with associated commercial species when the products are pulpwood, sawtimber, or wood veneer stock. It is considered a hard maple and as high quality individuals are suitable for producing furniture, flooring, paneling, and shoe lasts. However, its relative scarcity, small size, and fairly poor shape generally confine its use to only factory and box lumber, and even this is only an occasional occurrence. It has, however, been experiencing growing popularity as an ornamental or shade tree, especially in the southern United States due to its high heat resistance. It is also a source of maple syrup, though again its size and rarity limit its use in this regard, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the Sugar Maple's established popularity within the business.|$|E
