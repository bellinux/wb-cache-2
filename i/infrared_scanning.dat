They are presented both as single puzzles in third-person missions, and as timed stand-alone missions. The computer puzzles include maze puzzles, where a player must select a coloured path from a starting box to an ending box and sometimes a second and third box, are used to represent bypassing locks and other computer functions. Letter sequence puzzles, where a player swaps adjacent pairs {{of a series of}} random letters until they are in the correct sequence, are used to represent code-breaking such as for encrypted files or a locked door. Colour/symbol matching puzzles, where a cursor randomly moves across a field of coloured squares and the player must press the controller button that corresponds to that coloured square, are used to represent unscrambling files from hard drives and other similar functions. A number of other puzzles are used only once, including puzzles to simulate transferring files over a damaged network, <b>infrared</b> <b>scanning</b> of buildings, radar-like scanning of areas, and creating a network link across the entire planet.|$|E

5000|$|Related equipment, {{although}} not strictly thermometers, include <b>infrared</b> <b>scanning</b> systems and infrared thermal imaging cameras. <b>Infrared</b> <b>scanning</b> systems scan a larger area, typically by using {{what is essentially}} a spot thermometer pointed at a rotating mirror. These devices are widely used in manufacturing involving conveyors or [...] "web" [...] processes, such as large sheets of glass or metal exiting an oven, fabric and paper, or continuous piles of material along a conveyor belt. Infrared thermal imaging cameras or infrared cameras are essentially infrared radiation thermometers that measure the temperature at many points over a relatively large area to generate a two-dimensional image, called a thermogram, with each pixel representing a temperature. This technology is more processor- and software-intensive than spot or scanning thermometers, and is used for monitoring large areas. Typical applications include perimeter monitoring used by military or security personnel, inspection / process quality monitoring of manufacturing processes, and equipment or enclosed space hot or cold spot monitoring for safety and efficiency maintenance purposes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} active {{substance}} on the interfacial tension of an alkali/inorganic salt/synthetic surfactants / crude oil system was studied, through {{the ways of}} contact time, <b>infrared</b> <b>scan</b> and mass analysis. This system consisted of heavy alkyl benzene sulfonate, sodium chloride, sodium hydrate and Daqing crude oil. The result of the experiment indicate that active substance diffusion from oil/aqueous interface to aqueous phase and finally the process of diffusion has a equilibrium in the system with the prolonging of the contact time. At the same time,the value of the minimum IFT {{and the value of}} equilibrium IFT rises with the prolonging of the contact time and has a linear relationship between IFT and t- 1 / 2 when IFT value approaching the minimum and after the minimum, the process is diffusion controlled. The oil and aqueous phase had been analysed by <b>infrared</b> <b>scan</b> and mass analysis, and then the phenomenon have been found that the content of active substance in the oil decreased and the content of active substance in the aqueous increased after alkali had a reaction with compound system. It is proved that the active substances in the oil play a very important role for reducing the IFT. Key words: contact time; diffusion action; alkali; interfacial tensio...|$|R

50|$|Fast and {{effective}} detection {{is a key}} factor in wildfire fighting. Early detection efforts were focused on early response, accurate results in both daytime and nighttime, and the ability to prioritize fire danger. Fire lookout towers were used in the United States in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones, carrier pigeons, and heliographs. Aerial and land photography using instant cameras were used in the 1950s until <b>infrared</b> <b>scanning</b> was developed for fire detection in the 1960s. However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the fire manager. During the Yellowstone fires of 1988, a data station was established in West Yellowstone, permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours.|$|E
5000|$|Hyperspectral {{surveillance}} is {{the implementation}} of hyperspectral scanning technology for surveillance purposes. Hyperspectral imaging is particularly useful in military surveillance because of countermeasures that military entities now take to avoid airborne surveillance. Aerial surveillance was used by French soldiers using tethered balloons to spy on troop movements during the French Revolutionary Wars, and since that time, soldiers have learned not only {{to hide from the}} naked eye, but also to mask their heat signatures to blend into the surroundings and avoid <b>infrared</b> <b>scanning.</b> The idea that drives hyperspectral surveillance is that hyperspectral scanning draws information from such {{a large portion of the}} light spectrum that any given object should have a unique spectral signature in at least a few of the many bands that are scanned. The SEALs from NSWDG who killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011 used this technology while conducting the raid (Operation Neptune's Spear) on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.|$|E
