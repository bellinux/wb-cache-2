500|$|The Joker {{serves as}} an {{unreliable}} narrator. He admits to his own uncertainty, as he has disparate memories of the single event ("Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> one way, sometimes another... If I'm {{going to have a}} past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"), accentuating the comic's depiction of [...] "a world unraveling toward relentless urban violence and moral nihilism..." ...|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

500|$|Balzac {{sought to}} present his {{characters}} as real people, neither fully good nor fully evil, but completely human. [...] "To arrive at the truth", {{he wrote in the}} preface to Le Lys dans la vallée, [...] "writers use whatever literary device seems capable of giving the greatest intensity of life to their characters". [...] "Balzac's characters", Robb notes, [...] "were as real to {{him as if he were}} observing them in the outside world". This reality was noted by playwright Oscar Wilde, who said: [...] "One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of [...] Lucien de Rubempré.... It haunts me in my moments of pleasure. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> when I laugh".|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1958, Bánáthy {{recruited}} two patrols of boys to take part. [...] Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader. At the beginning {{there was not much}} discussion of leadership competencies. Chiorini said, [...] "White Stag was all about creating an environment in which youth led youth. At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> was very clear in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. There was no question about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were." [...] Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program. Some of them remained active with it into the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a number}} of backstories have been given, a {{definitive}} one {{has not yet been}} established for the Joker. An unreliable narrator, the character is uncertain of who he was before and how he became the Joker: [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!" [...] A story about the Joker's origin appeared in Detective Comics #168 (February 1951), nearly a decade after the character's debut. Here, the character is a laboratory worker who becomes the Red Hood (a masked criminal) to steal a million dollars from his employer and retire. He falls into a vat of chemical waste when his heist is thwarted by Batman, emerging with bleached white skin, red lips, green hair and a permanent grin.|$|E

60|$|For some seconds I sat there, {{leaning back}} in my chair and gazing close at that incredible, that accusing document. I knew it couldn't lie: I knew {{it must be the}} very handiwork of unerring Nature. Then slowly a {{recollection}} began to grow up in my mind. I knew of my own memory it was really true. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>it</b> so, now, as in a glass, darkly. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> having stood, with the pistol in my hand, pointing it straight at the breast of the man with the long white beard whom they called my father.

500|$|By {{the time}} of their second Star-Club visit from 1–14 November 1962, Starr had become the group's drummer. The Beatles stayed at the Hotel Germania (Detlev-Bremer-Strasse 8), having the luxury of single rooms for the first time, and then stayed at the Hotel Pacific (Neuer Pferdemarkt 30) for another booking from 18–31 December 1962. Harrison said: [...] "We came back to play the Star-Club, a big place and fantastic because it had a great sound system. This time we had a hotel. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> was quite a long walk from the club, {{at the top of the}} Reeperbahn going back towards the city." [...] Portions of their final {{performances}} were taped with a portable recorder by an associate of Ted [...] "King Size" [...] Taylor of the Dominoes, another group playing at the club. The tapes were released on West Germany's Bellaphon label in 1977 as The Beatles: Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962, and subsequently re-released in various formats and titles.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} she remembered her first day of filming, Woodburne {{recalled}} [...] "Yes - <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> perfectly. We were unpacking stuff from the car and moving into No 28. I already knew Alan, but I didn't know the kids. It all just meshed, though, and we knew immediately what type of family {{we were going to}} be." [...] Susan was given a teaching job at the local high school and Karl became the local GP, giving the family immediate links with other characters. In 1995, Rainey Mayo portrayed a teenage Susan in a daydream. In October 2009, Woodburne became the longest-serving actress in the show's history, having appeared on-screen as Susan for fifteen years. Of her television milestone, Woodburne said, [...] "It seems both bizarre and wonderful to me that I'm coming up to 15 years on the show, even though the world of Neighbours feels instinctive and familiar, I'm still challenged and rewarded by the work." ...|$|E
500|$|In the studio, the New York Dolls {{dressed in}} their usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did not approve of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the {{sessions}} to [...] "get the glitter out of your asses and play". Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive mixing console, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: [...] "It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff. Well, that's how <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it,</b> anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album. According to Scopa, the group's carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with Rundgren's professional work ethic and schedule: [...] "He doesn't put up with bullshit. I mean, [...] rarely started their live sets before midnight, so who knows? Todd {{was very much in}} charge in the studio, however, and I got the impression that everybody was looking to him." ...|$|E

500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> is a little below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; {{the rest of the}} evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E

We kinda had that from the beginning. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> not even being a question. You know the HD formats, I didn't really like them very much at all. I'm just not warming up to them. But they change a lot. The film would have six different looks if we tried to keep up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rich Mullins (October 21, 1955 – September 19, 1997) was an American {{contemporary}} Christian music {{singer and}} songwriter {{best known for}} his worship songs [...] "Awesome God" [...] and [...] "Step by Step". Some of his albums were also considered among Christian music's best, including Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth (1988), The World As Best As <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> <b>It,</b> Volume One (1991) and A Liturgy, a Legacy, & a Ragamuffin Band (1993). His songs have been performed by numerous artists, including Caedmon's Call, Five Iron Frenzy, Amy Grant, Carolyn Arends, Jars of Clay, Michael W.

2500|$|... "The issue {{revolved}} around Queen refusing {{to go on}} at their allotted time because the light wasn't right - <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> was sundown, so whoever went on stage wouldn't get the full benefit of their light show. It came down to a battle between management, which then spilled into a fracas between the roadies of our respective bands, as each crew jostled to set gear up. The MC (or some other promoter) goaded the crowd into an us and them vibe, with the local band in favour over the unknown [...] "pommie bastards". It ended with us going on stage first, and Queen redeeming themselves to the crowd and showing a hint {{of what they were}} to become.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Mullins {{released}} {{a pair of}} albums entitled The World As Best As <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> <b>It,</b> Volume One and Volume Two. These featured a more [...] stripped-back, acoustic feel than his earlier work, with nods to Irish music. [...] "Step By Step", a song written by his friend Beaker and included on volume one, and incorporated into [...] "Sometimes By Step" [...] with additional lyrics by Mullins on volume two, became an instant hit on Christian radio, and, like [...] "Awesome God", it became a popular praise chorus. Both during and after Mullin's college years, Beaker was a substantial influence on Mullins and his music. Beaker co-wrote, performed, and toured with Mullins for several years. The first song they wrote together was [...] "Boy Like Me, Man Like You", a 1991 hit for Mullins. Mullins wrote his hit song [...] "Let Mercy Lead" [...] for Beaker's son Aiden.|$|E
2500|$|While {{some historians}} insist Winfield—a {{prolific}} diarist—had the scalp buried with his brother's body, {{no record of}} this claim exists. [...] After Winfield's death in 1865, at least five separate accounts maintain that Ebey's sister, Mary Ebey Bozarth, inherited the relic. Albert Kellogg, the son of Dr. John Kellogg, recalled visiting Bozarth [...] "ten or twelve years" [...] after the murder and [...] "she showed the scalp lock still retaining the long black hair. It {{was the only thing}} of that kind I had ever seen and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> caused cold chills to run over me." [...] After Bozarth died in 1876, Ebey's scalp was passed on to his niece, Almira Enos. The next mention of its location occurred in 1892 when Almira visited Whidbey, an event noted by the Island County Times. In the newspaper's July 29, 1892 issue it was reported: ...|$|E
