60|$|The eavesdropper faltered {{near their}} kind backs, wishing for {{something}} more from them which should give their souls away, but they remained silently standing there, {{and he did not}} somehow feel authorized to make them reflect that, if the car was lighted up, it must be open, and that the friendly porter somewhere within would not mind letting them look through it under his eye. Perhaps they did reflect, and the woman was trying to embolden the man to the hardy venture. In the end they did not attempt it, but they turned away with another sigh from the woman which found its echo in the eavesdropper's heart. Doubtless if they had penetrated that splendid interior without having paid for seats, it would, in some fine, mystical sort, have pauperized them; it would have corrupted them; they would have wished after that always to travel in such cars, when clearly they could not afford it; very possibly it might have led to their moral if not financial ruin. So he tried to still his bosom's ache, but he could never quite forget that gentle pair with their unrequited longing, and the other day they came almost the first thing into his mind when he read that a great German steamship company had some thoughts of putting on a train of Pullman cars from the port of arrival to the mercantile metropolis which was the real end of their ships' voyages. He thought, whimsically, perversely, how little difference it would make to that pair, how little to those measureless most whose journeys shall end in heaven, where Pullman passengers, or even passengers by the ordinary European first-class cars, may be only too glad to meet them. He gave a looser rein to his thoughts and considered how very little the ordinary necessities of life, such as Pullman cars and taxicabs and <b>electric</b> <b>radiators</b> and non-storage chickens and unsalted butter concern the great mass of the saints, who would find them the rarest luxuries, and could hardly be imagined coveting them; and then from this wild revery he fell to asking himself whether a Pullman train would be such a great advance or advantage over the old-fashioned European first-class carriages in which he had been so long content to travel with the native nobility. Self-brought to book on this point, he had to own that he had once had moments of thinking in a German second-class car that he would not change to an American Pullman if he could for even less than a third more money. He recalled a pleasant run from Crewe to Edinburgh in a third-class English car, when he never once thought of a Pullman car except to think it was no better. To be sure, this was after two-thirds of his third-class fellow-passengers had got out, and he was left to the sole enjoyment of two-thirds of the seats. It is the luxury of space which your more money buys you in England, where no one much lower than a duke or a prime minister now goes first class for a long haul. For short hauls it is different, and on the Continent it is altogether different. There you are often uncomfortably crowded in the first-class carriages, and doubtless would be in a Pullman if there were any, so that if you are wise, or only well informed, you will give the guard a shilling to telegraph before leaving London and get you a number on the Rapide from Calais to Paris.|$|E

Heating of buildings is an essential area within energy efficiency. Many buildings are old and were built {{at a time when}} the energy prices were low and the term “energy efficiency” was unheard of. By applying today’s broad range of energy saving actions on these old, and thereby often, heating ineffective buildings, this area has a large potential in reducing energy consumption and costs. Churches and chapels are generally old buildings with, in many cases, ineffective heating systems and therefore consume much more energy than needed. Significant part of the means of the parish goes to the heating of such a church/chapel, resources that could be used for other purposes instead. Another aspect is that if the heating is not performed properly, it could lead to major damages to the building and its fixtures. The churches of Laholm and Skummeslöv and the chapels of Skogaby and St. Gertrud are all buildings with heating systems that should be looked into. The buildings belong to Laholm Church Communion and they are a part of Gothenburg Diocese.

Two different instruments, a condensation particle counter (CPC) and an optical particle counter (OPC) were used to quantitatively determine ultrafine and fine particle emissions, respectively. The CPC measures particles from 0. 02 μm to larger than 1. 0 μm. The OPC was adjusted to measure particle concentrations in eight fractions between 0. 3 and 1. 0 μm. The sources were cigarette side-stream smoke, pure wax candles, scented candles, a vacuum cleaner, an air-freshener spray, a flat iron (with and without steam) on a cotton sheet, <b>electric</b> <b>radiators,</b> an electric stove, a gas stove, and frying meat.

40|$|If {{you want}} to {{minimize}} the need for purchased energy the best way {{is to ensure that}} as little heat and air as possible escapes from the building. A significant amount of heat in buildings with normal standard is lost through the surrounding envelope that is through the roof walls, windows, doors and floors. High air tightness of a building improves profitability by creating a better indoor environment and lower energy consumption. It normally requires addition of energy to balance the energy losses of various kinds. A building's energy is the energy that is purchased for normal use during a normal property and energy. For the building to be in balance have the energy to be equal to the losses. Transmission losses for the arena is approximately 140 000 kWh and for the stable approximately 130 000 kWh. Ventilation losses for the arena are approximately 140 000 kWh and for the stable 130 000 kWh. The energy consumption for the entire horse riding centre was approximately 340 100 kWh (2011). Heat consumption is approximately 270 200 kWh. When you subtract the unnecessary losses the consumption is approximately 170 000 kWh.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim was to}} study selected aspects of indoor environment in dwellings and their association with symptoms compatible with the sick building syndrome (SBS). A validated questionnaire was developed specifically for residential indoor investigations, using sociological principles and test procedures. The questionnaire was mailed to 14, 243 multi-family dwellings in Stockholm, selected by stratified random sampling. Females, subjects {{with a history of}} atopy, those above 65 y, and those in new buildings reported more symptoms. Subjects owning their own dwelling had less symptoms. A multiple regression model was developed, to identify residential buildings with a higher than expected occurrence of SBS. In total, 28. 5 % reported at least one sign of building dampness in their home (condensation on windows, humidity in the bathroom, mouldy odour, water leakage). All indicators of dampness were related to symptoms, even when adjusting for demographic data, and other building characteristics (OR= 2. 9 - 6. 0). Associations between symptoms and other building data was evaluated in older houses, built before 1961. Subjects in older buildings with a mechanical ventilation system had fewer symptoms. Heating by <b>electric</b> <b>radiators,</b> and wood heating was associated with an increase of most types of symptoms (OR= 1. 2 - 5. 0). Multiple sealing measures (OR= 1. 3), and major reconstruction (OR= 1. 1 - 1. 9), was associated with an increase of symptoms. The effect of seasonal adapted ventilation (SAV) was studied in a small experimental study. A 20 % reduction of ventilation flow from 0. 5 - 0. 8 ac/h to 0. 4 - 0. 5 ACH during the heating season increased the perception of poor indoor air quality in the dwelling in general, and in the bedroom. In conclusion, low building age, and building dampness in the dwelling are associated with SBS. In older houses, mechanical ventilation is beneficial. The thesis did not support the view that energy saving measures in general is an important risk factor for SBS, but major reconstruction and multiple sealing measures can be risk factor for symptoms. Reducing the outdoor ventilation flow below the current Swedish ventilation standard (0. 5 ACH) may increase the perception of impaired air quality...|$|E

40|$|A {{decrease}} in energy consumption {{is an important}} part of the effort to reduce fossil emissions. Buildings contribute to a considerable share of the energy consumption in Norway, mainly because of the cold climate and low energy prices. Building regulations today set low limits for maximum energy use for heating, but existing buildings have a higher potential for reductions, as the maximum energy limit has changed over the years. This report covers possible strategies for reducing energy demand in a specific part of the Norwegian building stock: Apartment blocks constructed between 1981 and 2010. Earlier projects have also evaluated the energy reduction potentials in the Norwegian dwelling stock. However, this has mostly been done on an aggregated level, and as buildings vary greatly in size, location, and age, the same recommendations cannot be expected to apply to all buildings. The effects of rehabilitations and demolitions on the building stock are often simplified to linear behaviour, but this is not accurate. Calculations were carried out on defined standardised buildings in a climatic zone represented by Oslo. First, an energy balance was established for evaluating the energy consumption of the various buildings, both in their original state, and subject to various combinations of rehabilitations to heating system, insulation, and ventilation. Then, heating-related costs were calculated in order to find the options with the lowest net present value, based on an investment horizon of 36 years. Based on these results, possible scenarios for energy use and CO_ 2 emissions were calculated for the years 2014 - 2050, based on the average building being rehabilitated after 40 years. In line with other studies, the energy consumption in the original buildings were found to be low, and close to the current TEK 10 regulation, which must be followed if major rehabilitations are conducted. Hardly any rehabilitations were found to be profitable with the costs of today, and a doubling of the electricity costs affected the outcome to a small degree only. In most cases, the best option is to change as little as possible, although replacements of windows and doors were profitable for the oldest buildings. Using <b>electric</b> <b>radiators</b> for all room heating is the most common heating system today, but this is not in line with the TEK 10 standard. If the heating system is to be changed, air-air heat pumps are the best alternative. However, the savings from these depend highly on climate conditions. Fuel oil heaters are the least profitable option, and these should be removed, as is mandatory soon anyway. Demolitions alone result in a 15 % energy reduction within 2050, close to the scenario based on lowest possible costs at 21 %. The low emissions case results in a 50 % reduction, while rehabilitations to zero energy buildings would reduce the energy by 72 %. No official reduction target is presently set for Norway, although a 50 % energy reduction between 2010 and 2040 has been expressed in a report for the former Government. This target is only possible to reach with zero energy upgrades. Emissions follow similar paths as the energy when Norwegian electricity mix is used as a basis. However, definitions on electricity mix and related emissions affect the results more than the chosen energy rehabilitations when estimating total emissions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Summary This report {{presents}} {{results from}} the project ”Converting direct resistive electric heating into district heating - customer related aspects” conducted at the division of Efficient Energy Systems, Department of Energy Sciences, Lund University. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how specific households within one housing area (Sandsbro in Växjö with 110 one-family houses) experienced the conversion process, in order to understand the reasons behind “yes” or “no” responses to the utility’s offer. A qualitative approach with semi-structured in-depth interviews with a specially selected sample of households from 10 converted and 13 not converted houses was chosen as the main method. The investigation led to the following conclusions and recommendations: • Household reactions to the terms of sale and conversion: Many households felt that the decisions were rushed - there is a need for better planning, especially for the older households. The information provided was evaluated as detailed and sufficient. The “demonstration villa” was a good idea but the installation should be done more professionally - aesthetics are very important here. Home visits were the only personal contact and should be conducted in all houses in order to answer questions and explain problems. Co-ordination of excavation should be better in order to limit the time the ground is open. A few of the households undertook some of the works themselves to reduce costs but the compensation was often considered as too low to motivate customers. • Household opinions on the product and/or service: Almost all households felt that the thermal comfort was better than before - more stable indoor temperature, no problems with overheated radiators or smell of burning dust. On the other hand, hot water comfort was worse - longer waiting time for hot water and too low water temperature during summer. Aesthetics were considered very important and could be crucial for the decision to convert the heating system. Many of the interviewed households were uncertain how to adjust and take care of the system - there is a notable need for information here. • Household understanding of the economic terms of the district heating conversion: It was clear that many of the interviewed households did not have a view about the change of energy costs after conversion. It was also difficult for them to make a profitability analysis before the decision. However, the offer was considered to be very favourable in this specific case. It is important that the offer and investment comes at the right time for the households - regardless of the price. One argument raised against district heating conversion was fear of monopoly and high energy costs. All households, even those not converted, were convinced that the investment would be paid back in the future because of an increased property value following conversion. Household reasons to say “no” to district heating conversion: • The household has recently invested in a new heating system or in a secondary system, • Negative views about aesthetics of the waterborne system, • It’s too labour intensive to convert, • Wrong facts or misunderstanding. Household reasons to say “yes” to district heating conversion: • Improved thermal comfort, • Convenience, • Low investment costs • Expectations about lower energy costs, • Few alternatives to direct resistive space heating, • Better than electricity from an environmental point of view. Statistical analysis proved that variables such as “age”, “type of household” and “energy use level” could, to some extent, be related to the decision to convert from <b>electric</b> <b>radiators</b> to district heating...|$|E

Therefore, there is a national interest in finding solutions to peak problems also on the demand side, i. e. enabling electricity users to decrease or shift load when needed. For local players in the electricity market, there are various technical and economic motives for developing methods to influence or control customers’ usage patterns. In the studies described here (Study 1 and Study 2) ten households in electrically heated houses, were examined. The households were all customers of the electric utility Skånska Energi AB. In 1999 the utility equipped their customers with a remote metering system (CustCom) that has an in-built load control component. A large number of studies, in Sweden as well as in other countries, investigate the impact of habits on energy use within a home. A hitherto not investigated area is the effect of habits on the load pattern. In Study 1 (of this licentiate thesis), the load pattern of ten households was examined by using energy diaries combined with frequent meter readings (every five minutes) of the load demand for heating, hot water service and domestic electricity use. Household members kept energy diaries over a four-day period in January 2004, noting time, activities and the use of household appliances that run on electricity. Comparison of the data from these two sources provided an estimate of the impact of various activities and the use of electrical appliances on load demand. The analysis showed that the use of heat-producing household appliances, e. g. sauna, washing machine and dryer, appliances used for cooking (oven, kitchen range-hob, electric kettle and microwave oven), dishwasher and extra electric heaters, contribute to the household’s highest peaks. Turning on the sauna and {{at the same time}} using the shower equates to a peak load of 7 - 9 kW. This, in addition to the use of electricity for heating and lighting along alongside electricity use for refrigerators and freezers, results in some households reaching their main fuse level (roughly 13, 8 kW for a main fuse of 20 A). This means that the domestic use of electricity makes up a considerable part of the highest peak loads in a household, but the highest peaks occur together with the use of electricity for heating and hot water. vi ix In the second study, Study 2, the households participated in a load control experiment, in which the utility was able to turn on and switch off the heating and hot water systems remotely, using the CustCom system. Heating and water heaters were switched off for periods of 1 - 4 hours (except for one occasion during which the water heater was switched off for 16 hours) without letting the households know when the control periods would take place or how long they would last. Household heating and hot water comfort as well as the households’ attitudes towards and experiences of being controlled were investigated using a combination of methods. During the experiment period, which lasted three weeks, the household indoor temperature was measured to establish the temperature drops caused by switching off the heating system. The households were asked to make notes of their experiences of thermal comfort and hot water comfort on a specified “comfort sheet”. In order to be able to ascertain whether the households had missed out on any of the control periods, the household members had to keep a record of when they were away from home. Following the test period, interviews were carried out in order to establish the household experiences of the load control experiment, to gain insight into the household members’ views of their energy use and energy habits, and to gain an understanding of the requirements that customers have regarding load control measures. Issues such as limitations of control time, compensation and feedback were discussed. Also, a more indirect form of load control - tariffs - were discussed, namely classical time tariffs and tariffs using a peak load component where the grid fee is based on an average of the customer's three highest hourly peaks during one month. Interview data, records of thermal and hot water comfort and indoor temperature readings showed that the households noticed some of the control periods but that equally some went unnoticed. At its lowest, the indoor temperature went down by 2, 5 ºC. Obviously, longer control periods of three or four hours contributed to larger temperature drops, but at the same time sun radiation through windows affected the indoor temperature. Hence, the households seemed to be more sensitive to load controls in the mornings than in the evenings when the sun had had the chance to heat up the house. The households under investigation kept different indoor temperature levels; the average temperature ranged from 18, 5 ºC to 24 ºC. Intuitively, a household that normally keeps a lower indoor temperature should be more sensitive to a temperature drop of a couple of degrees. In this study, however, the households with a higher average indoor temperature tended to sense the temperature drops to the same extent as those with lower average indoor temperatures. This may be a result of these households adapting their clothing to the high indoor temperature by for instance wearing Tshirts or walking around barefoot even in wintertime. Another factor impacting on the thermal experience is the speed of the temperature drop. Houses equipped with direct resistive <b>electric</b> <b>radiators</b> and light frameworks lack the capacity to store heat and as such the indoor climate will be affected more easily. Load control of the hot water systems went unnoticed. Only one household experienced a shortage of hot water when the water heater had been switched off for several hours (during the 16 -hour long control period). The other households did not notice the switch-off period at all. This may however be a result of the fact that the households participating in this study did have big water heaters in relation to their hot water needs...|$|E

40|$|A planar, {{directive}} antenna {{with large}} fractional bandwidth is introduced in this paper. A detailed {{discussion on the}} proposed antenna topology and its architecture is reported. The proposed element {{is a combination of}} a patch and a loop radiator. A proper combination of the <b>electric</b> field <b>radiator</b> (patch) with a magnetic field radiator (loop around the patch) is exploited for expanding the operational bandwidth. A parametric study is presented to investigate the effect of the antenna geometrical parameters on its performance. A general and computationally efficient procedure for extracting the antenna equivalent circuit is described and used to achieve a meaningful circuit theory-based insight into the characteristics of the radiating structure. The theoretical and experimental results are compared, and it is demonstrated that the element features over 100 % fractional bandwidth, good impedance matching, and unidirectional and stable radiation patterns.

40|$|We fill {{a gap in}} the {{arguments}} of Boykin et al [American Journal of Physics, Vol 70 No. 4, pp 415 - 420 (2002) ] by not invoking an electric current loop (i. e. magnetic dipole model) to account for the radiation energy loss, since an obvious corollary of their results is that the capacitors should radiate directly even if the connecting wires are shrunk to zero length. That this is so is shown here by a direct derivation of capacitor radiation using an oscillating <b>electric</b> dipole <b>radiator</b> model for the capacitors as well as the alternative less widely known magnetic 'charge' current loop representation for an electric dipole [see for example "Electromagnetic Waves" by S. A. Schlekunoff, van Nostrand (1948) ]. Implications for Electromagnetic Compliance (EMC) issues as well as novel antenna designs further motivate the purpose of this paper.
