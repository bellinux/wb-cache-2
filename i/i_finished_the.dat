[...] Grant (serving as President when Sherman's memoirs first appeared) later remarked that others {{had told him}} that Sherman treated Grant unfairly but [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> book, I found I approved every word; that ... it was a true book, an honorable book, creditable to Sherman, just to his companions—to myself particularly so—just such a book as I expected Sherman would write." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Trent Reznor expressed his intentions to write {{material for a}} new release while on tour promoting With Teeth. He reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006. Reznor devised much of the album's musical direction on his laptop. Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, [...] "When I was on the [...] tour, to keep myself busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in a creative mode and when <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it." ...|$|E
500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> movie that I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E

500|$|On September 24, West {{announced}} that he had finished the album and would be releasing it sometime in November. In his blog post, he wrote [...] "I changed my album to November something cause <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> album and I felt like it..I want y'all to hear it as soon as possible". West later stated that the album would be released on November 25, 2008. However, Island Def Jam, the distributing label, brought the date forward by one day to capitalize on Thanksgiving weekend. 808s & Heartbreak was also released on November 24, 2008 in the United Kingdom and the Philippines. A limited edition in a digipak case was first released in Germany on November 21, 2008. A special edition of the album was released on December 16 that contains the album in CD and dual LP format, and also features album artwork redone by the artist of the original cover, Kaws.|$|E
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E

He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Day of the Tentacle was a {{moderate}} commercial success; according to Schafer, it sold around 80,000 copies upon release. The game was critically acclaimed. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World wrote in September 1993, [...] "Calling Day of the Tentacle {{a sequel to}} Maniac Mansion [...] {{is a little like}} calling the space shuttle a sequel to the slingshot". He enjoyed the game's humor and interface, and praised the designers for removing [...] "dead end" [...] scenarios and player character death. Ardai lauded the voice acting, writing that it [...] "would have done the late Mel Blanc proud", and compared the game's humor, animation, and camera angles to [...] "Looney Toons [...] gems from the 40's and 50's". He concluded, [...] "I expect that this game will keep entertaining people for quite some time to come". In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD version that Sanders's Bernard was among [...] "many other inspired performances", concluding that [...] "Chuck Jones would be proud". Sandy Petersen of Dragon stated that its graphics [...] "are in a stupendous cartoony style", while praising its humor and describing its sound and music as [...] "excellent". Although the reviewer considered it [...] "one of the best" [...] graphic adventure games, he noted that, like LucasArts' earlier Loom, it was extremely short; he wrote that he [...] "felt cheated somehow when <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> game". He ended the review, [...] "Go, Lucasfilm! Do this again, but do make the next game longer!".|$|E

Iñárritu cast Keaton for his depth {{in a variety of}} acting styles: he could handle the demands of the stage, up-close work, and comedy and empathy [...] "with a {{profound}} depth to both." ...|$|E

2500|$|Francis Ford Coppola {{was drawn}} to S. E. Hinton's novel Rumble Fish because of the strong {{personal}} identification he had with the subject matter— a younger brother who hero-worships an older, intellectually superior brother, which mirrored the relationship between Coppola and his brother, August. A dedication to August appears as the film's final end credit. The director said that he [...] "started to use Rumble Fish as my carrot for what I promised myself when <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>The</b> Outsiders". Halfway through the production of The Outsiders, Coppola decided {{that he wanted to}} retain the same production team, stay in Tulsa, and shoot Rumble Fish right after The Outsiders. He wrote the screenplay for Rumble Fish with Hinton on Sundays, their day off from shooting The Outsiders. During rehearsals, Dillon got used to the adult-like acting behavior and situations after having been in The Outsiders. Dillon and Rourke developed a friendship when filming, getting used to their interesting, mischievous characters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{completion}} of the screenplay, concerned Sparks that Cyrus {{would not be able}} to successfully execute the role: [...] "The first thing I thought when <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> screenplay was, wow, I hope she can do this, this is a tough role because I'm bringing you through a whole gamut of emotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. Are you able to do this as an actress?", After visiting the set and watching Cyrus film, Sparks' worries abated. To play the New York teen, Cyrus worked with a dialect coach to lose her Southern accent and learned to play classical piano. After she completed filming, Cyrus said that in a case of life imitating art, she had matured and [...] "changed a lot" [...] over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way Ronnie does in the film. [...] "Showing this movie, I feel like I'm really showing a part of my growth as a person as well. So I'm really excited for people to see it." ...|$|E
