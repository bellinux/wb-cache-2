The overall PV generator is modeled with a very compact two-component physical model. A PV generator, constituted by a string of three standard 30 cell modules, connected to the grid {{by means of a}} PWM inverter, a <b>decoupling</b> <b>inductor</b> and a low frequency toroidal transformer is used as practical application example. This system is modeled and simulated using both DC and transient analysis with different modulation index values. Simulation outputs are compared with experimental results obtained from an ad hoc designed prototype system showing good agreement. The proposed circuit simulation procedure and models can be useful in assessing design variables as well as in checking novel hardware/software solutions for maximum power point tracking and grid connection...|$|E

To reduce the complexity, cost and number of power conversions, which results in higher efficiency, only one voltage-controlled voltage source inverter (VCVSI) is used. The VCVSI is connected in series on the DC battery side and in parallel on the AC grid side with a <b>decoupling</b> <b>inductor.</b> The system provides sinusoidal voltage at the fundamental value of 220 V/ 60 Hz for the load during abnormal utility power conditions or grid failure. Also, the system can be operated to mitigate the harmonic current and voltage demand from nonlinear loads and provide voltage stabilization for loads when sudden voltage fluctuation occur, such as sag and swell. The experimental results confirm the system protects against outages caused by abnormal utility power conditions and sudden voltage fluctuations and change. </p...|$|E

40|$|Power {{and ground}} planes on {{multilayer}} PCBs can effectively radiate electromagnetic fields {{excited by the}} IC simultaneous switching noise. The high frequency electromagnetic radiation is often calculated from the electric field {{along the edge of}} the PCB, which can be estimated with a cavity model using magnetic walls. The excitation of the cavity modes is related to the via current passing through the power bus planes at the interconnection between IC package and PCB. Usually the attention is focused on the differential-mode current of the package pins, but in the present paper it is shown that the common-mode current flowing out from package pins plays a very important role in the excitation of cavity modes, and its neglect implies a fatal underestimation of the electromagnetic radiation from the power bus planes in some circumstances. A second important contribute to the radiation is given by the common mode current on the pins, together with the current flowing on the PCB ground plane.

Introduction High quality on-chip inductors are essential to monolithic integration of RF circuits in silicon [1]. Degradation of the quality factor, Q, due to substrate effects has been studied [2]. In addition, the problem of signal coupling via the substrate in RF circuits has been reported [3]. As inductors occupy substantial area, it is critical to suppress the coupling between the inductors and the substrate. Physically, both problems stem from energy loss to the substrate as the electric field penetrates into the silicon, especially at above GHz frequencies. Therefo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Analysis and {{simulation}} of the voltages and currents {{in the secondary}} windings of a multiple output flyback converters reveals that they {{are affected by the}} choice of output capacitors. Poor selection of the capacitor values may cause a pseudo-discontinuous behavior in a converter which operates, as a whole, in the continuous conduction mode. The implications of these results on output ripple and small signal response are discussed, and design guidelines are suggested. IN 1 RODUCI 10 N One of the advantages of flyback DC-DC converters is the relative ease and economy with which multiple output systems can be realized. Whereas other topologies require <b>inductor</b> <b>decoupling</b> between secondary, simple capacitive loading is sufficient for the flyback converter. Consequently, flyback converters are smaller, lighter and more economical in multiple output configurations. These characteristics probably explain their relative abundance in many commercial products in the I W- 200 W range. The analytical approaches described hitheno for multiple output flyback converters were generally {{based on the assumption that}} the multiple output topology can be reduced to a single output configuration by connecting the normalized secondary windings in parallel [I]. The apriori assumption made was that the conduction cycle for all secondary windings in a multiple output convener is the same. A closer analysis reveals however, that this assumption is not valid for the general case. Consequently, one cannot theoretically reduce the multiple output configuration to an equivalent single output convener. These problems were examined in the present study which considers the general case of a multiple output flyback converter. One begins by investigating the &quot;OC &quot; conditions of a two output converter operated in the cOntinuous conduction mode. The results of this analysis are then used to draw general conclusions for the OC and small signal behavior of multiple output flyback converters...|$|R
