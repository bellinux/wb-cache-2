5|$|The Swedish band Europe {{released}} the anthemic album The Final Countdown which {{reached the top}} ten in several countries, including the U.S. and while the title single reached number one in 26 countries. Stryper made their mainstream breakthrough in 1986 {{with the release of}} their platinum album To <b>Hell</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Devil and brought Christian lyrics to their hard rock music style and glam metal looks. Two Pennsylvania bands, with Harrisburg's Poison and Philadelphia's Cinderella released multi-platinum début albums, respectively Look What the Cat Dragged In and Night Songs in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the U.S. for three weeks and sold over six million copies. Additionally, some established hard rock bands of the era such as the Scorpions, Whitesnake, Aerosmith, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Judas Priest began incorporating glam metal elements into their sounds and images, as the genre's popularity skyrocketed in 1985-86.|$|E

However, the Emperor reappears in the throne {{room in a}} new demonic form, {{revealing}} he has returned from <b>Hell</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> intention of destroying the entire world. The party and Leon escape Palamecia Castle with the wyvern, as the castle is replaced with the palace of Hell, Pandaemonium. Leon agrees to help the group seal the Emperor away. The party travels to the Jade Passage, an underground passage to the underworld, and finds the portal to Pandaemonium, where they finally defeat the Emperor. Afterwards, Leon chooses to leave {{in response to the}} trouble he caused, though Firion assures him that he'll be welcomed back if and when he returns.|$|E
25|$|Bring Me the Horizon {{then moved}} even {{further away from}} deathcore in their third album There Is a <b>Hell,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{incorporation}} of electronica, classical music and pop into their metalcore style. This required more ambitious production feats, such as using a full choir, a synthesised orchestra and glitched out vocals and breakdowns (that were also toned down, favouring quiet atmospheric passages in song breaks). For the writing of Sempiternal, the band pooled far broader influences such as post-rock acts like This Will Destroy You and Explosions In The Sky and from pop music.|$|E

500|$|Soon the Christian metal bands became {{controversial}} {{for their}} beliefs and often evangelistic {{goals in the}} metal music scene, which typically holds individualism in particularly high esteem. Stryper, for instance, although a commercial success at that time, received a hostile reception when they played at a Dutch metal festival in 1985. Regardless of this, Stryper helped to popularize the genre. They were the first Christian band to reach platinum status on an album. The 1986 album To <b>Hell</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Devil sold 2 million copies and achieved a Grammy nomination. The music videos for [...] "Free", [...] "Calling on You", and the power ballad [...] "Honestly" [...] all spent many weeks on Music Television's Top 10, and [...] "Free" [...] was in the No. 1 position for 12 weeks (60 days), May 4 – July 24, 1987.|$|E
500|$|The song's bleak lyrics were {{explained}} by Marker as {{a mockery of}} the angsty [...] " [...] thing" [...] themes prevalent in mid-1990s alternative rock songs, as well as a self-deprecating reference to Garbage's own dark lyrics, with Manson explaining that the song was [...] "a dig at ourselves because we like records that don't make us feel very happy, and at this so-called 'alternative' scene of 'we're so weird and more wonderful than everybody else'". Vig added that [...] "'Only Happy When It Rains' was about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene. With us there's self-deprecation, we have to poke fun at ourselves because we're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics, which makes us filled with self-loathing, hurhur." [...] Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song [...] "Happy When It Rains" [...] (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche. Lyrically, Manson described [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] as [...] "about wanting love but knowing life will always get in the way.... yet not being obliterated by that.

500|$|By late December Welles {{had run out}} {{of money}} and the film was put on hold while he searched for {{additional}} funding. However, some small scenes were shot during the break. Welles later said that he had rejected offers for funding that were conditional upon filming in color. Welles eventually secured funding from Harry Saltzman and production officially resumed in late February with most of Keith Baxter's longer speeches and the Coronation scene in Madrid. Between March and April, Welles finished the film with filler shots, close-ups, the final rejection scene and most of Falstaff's speeches. According to Keith Baxter, Welles had stage fright and delayed all of his scenes until the very end of filming, except for scenes that included other actors. Welles was timid about shooting his love scene with Moreau, and used a double whenever possible. Other filming locations included the Chateau Calatañazor, Puerta de San Vincente and the Soria Cathedral. Welles was harsh with his crew members and according to actor Andrew Faulds, [...] "he spoke in five different languages to them and was pretty offensivevery demanding. I suppose he'd worked out that if you bullied actors, you didn't get the best from them whereas, to <b>hell</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> technicians. They had to do as they were told, and pretty quick." [...] A scene depicting the assassination of King Richard II, originally intended to open the film, was cut.|$|E

2500|$|Christian {{rock was}} {{often viewed as}} a {{marginal}} part of the nascent Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) and contemporary gospel industry in the 1970s and '80s, though Christian folk rock artists like Bruce Cockburn and rock fusion artists like Phil Keaggy had some cross-over success.

They reached their height in popularity in the late eighties alongside other Christian-identifying hard rock acts such as Stryper.
