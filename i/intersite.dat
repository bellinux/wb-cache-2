Implantation sites were rendered visible by intra-venous injection of Evans Blue dye. Blood flow was measured at 15 min after alcohol injection by the ^Rb fractionation method. In controls, blood flow was significantly greater (P < 0 05) at implantation sites (0. 77 ± 0. 04 ml/min/g) than at <b>intersites</b> (0. 43 ± 0. 03 ml/min/g).
