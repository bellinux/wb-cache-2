40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>intercritical</b> <b>rolling</b> on the microstructural development during {{the processing of}} hot rolled multiphase steels is characterised. <b>Intercritical</b> <b>rolling</b> leads to dynamic recovery of ferrite and to strain-induced transformation of austenite into ferrite. The prior deformation of austenite considerably influences the bainite transformation. It is shown that a smaller amount of austenite transforms into bainite when bainite forms from deformed austenite. This is explained by the physics of the bainite transformation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Series {{of trials}} were {{conducted}} on a laboratory rolling mill to evaluate the influence of <b>intercritical</b> <b>rolling</b> on the microstructure and texture of steel with 0. 082 %C, 1. 54 % Mn, 0. 35 % Si, 0. 055 %Nb and 0. 078 %V. Two parallel rolling schedules A and B were designed {{on the base of}} the experimentally deduced CCT diagram of the steel. In rolling schedule A the material was subjected to accelerated cooling and coiling simulation after final rolling in the intercritical region, whereas in rolling schedule B the last rolling pass in the intercritical region was replaced by a water quench at the same temperature of the <b>intercritical</b> <b>rolling</b> pass in schedule A. Microstructure and texture were characterized by means of light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, EBSD and XRD. It was found that the average grain diameter and the texture depend significantly on the final rolling temperature in the intercritical region. The decrease of the <b>intercritical</b> <b>rolling</b> temperature leads to an increase of the { 111 }〈uvw 〉 /{ 001 }〈uvw 〉 ratio, {{but at the same time}} the increase of the average ferrite grain size was also observed. A phenomenological model based on the K–S orientation rela-tionships was used to predict the texture formation in the intercritical region...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} microgrid {{technique has}} been applied to a laboratory-made duplex stainless steel, to experimentally simulate the local state of deformation of the austenite-ferrite microstructure of low-alloy steels subject to intercritical deformation. A sample containing such a microgrid was deformed by plane strain compression at high temperature under conditions representative of hot rolling processes. The distortion of the microgrid after hot deformation revealed, in a quantifiable manner, the plastic flow of both phases and different deformation features. The micro-strain distributions measured can be used to validate the models predicting the hot deformation of low alloyed C-Mn steels during <b>intercritical</b> <b>rolling...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} hot rolling textures of steel sheet with {{different}} compositions and hot rolling parameters have been compared. The observed hot rolling textures all {{belonged to a}} limited number of different types. These types seemed to depend on the composition, the hot rolling parameters, and the local deformation mode. The influence of these hot rolling textures on the properties of commercial sheet steels after cold rolling and continuous annealing is critically evaluated. For steels with a low content of high temperature precipitates, the texture and microstructure after <b>intercritical</b> hot <b>rolling</b> often appeared {{to be the result of}} a transformation induced recrystallisation process with a specific nucleation mode. Understanding of the nature of this type of recrystallisation may facilitate an improvement in the material properties by optimisation of the hot rolling texture. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} simplify the {{production}} routine and to save cost of hot-rolled TRIP steels, the <b>intercritical</b> <b>rolling</b> process was investigated using thermo-mechanical simulation technology. Both 0. 2 C- 1. 5 Mn- 1. 5 Si and 0. 2 C- 1. 5 Mn- 1. 5 Si- 0. 5 Cu TRIP steels were chosen so as to study the effect of 0. 5 pct Cu addition on microstructure and retained austenite volume fraction of 0. 2 C- 1. 5 Mn- 1. 5 Si TRIP steel. It is found that grain size refinement happened during intercritical deformation, and multi-phase microstructure could be achieved after isothermal treatment, so intercritical annealing can be eliminated to avoid grain size coarse {{and to keep the}} refine grain size in intercritical-deformed TRIP steels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Thermomechanical {{processing}} (TMP) involves both thermal {{and mechanical}} treatments that define both product shape and microstructure/properties. Since the industrial revolution, machines of augmented power, size and precision have {{given rise to}} TMP that challenged explanation of the crystal mechanisms. In wrought iron, lamellar ferrite exhibited high transverse crack resistance due to fine slag stringers that as flux facilitated welding of puddled bars in forging of shafts or rolling of plates for bell-welding into pressure tight pipes; the substructure developed in the iron as working continued below 900 ˚C strengthened it. Patenting of high C steel wire led to an optimum cold-drawn structure for outstanding strength and toughness. Hot forming technology, combined with the refining potential for austenite decomposition gave rise to controlled rolling for enhanced ferrite nucleation, ausforming to refine martensite and <b>intercritical</b> <b>rolling</b> to deform the ferrite or to spheroidize the carbides. Cold rolling and annealing have been scheduled to impart suitable strength, grain size, substructure and texture...|$|E
40|$|Many {{engineering}} materials {{call for}} increasing strength and ductility. Unfortunately, the material properties of high ductility and high strength are usually mutually contradictory. These conflicting requirements have generated interest in transformation induced plasticity or TRIP steels, which mainly {{consist of a}} mixture bainite, ferrite and retained austenite. The superior strength and ductility {{of these types of}} steels is due to the strain induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite. Intercritical deformation (i. e. deformation in the austenite + ferrite two phase region) has been extensively studied on C-Mn and microalloyed steels, but not on TRIP steels. <b>Intercritical</b> <b>rolling</b> increases the volume fraction and decreases the grain size of ferrite. These characteristics may be beneficial to the ductility of TRIP steels, since the volume fraction of retained austenite may increase with ferrite volume fraction by increasing the level of C segregation to the untransformed austenite. As well, the size of the retained austenite may decrease with decreasing ferrite grain size, thus increasing the stability of retained austenite against strain induced transformation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the intercritical deformation on the characteristics of retained austenite and resulting mechanical properties of a TRIP steel...|$|E
40|$|The way {{in which}} texture {{development}} is affected by hot rolling, <b>intercritical</b> <b>rolling,</b> and warm rolling was studied in a plain carbon, a niobium microalloyed and an interstitial free steel. Three processing parameters were varied: the austenitizing temperature (1250 $ sp circ$C or 1150 $ sp circ$C), amount of reduction (90 % or 75 %) and finish rolling temperature (1020 $ sp circ$C, 870 $ sp circ$C, 770 $ sp circ$C, 730 $ sp circ$C and 630 $ sp circ$C {{for the first two}} materials, and 1020 $ sp circ$C, 920 $ sp circ$C, 870 $ sp circ$C, 820 $ sp circ$C, 720 $ sp circ$C and 620 $ sp circ$C for the IF steel). It was found that lower reheating temperatures and larger deformations lead to more intense textures. The effect of finish rolling temperature was different for each steel. In the plain carbon, only warm rolling produced a strong texture. In the interstitial free steel, the strongest textures were again produced by rolling in the ferrite range. In the niobium microalloyed steel, the retardation of austenite recrystallization intensifies the fcc deformation texture components; thus, a fairly strong texture is inherited by the ferrite, which is in turn enhanced by further deformation. The experimental textures were compared with the transformation textures predicted by using the Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship. It was found that when most of the reduction was applied in the austenite recrystallization range, the cube texture appeared to form, which transformed preferentially into the rotated cube $ { 001 } langle 110 rangle$. When the austenite remained in the pancaked state, the expected transformation products of the fcc rolling texture, i. e. the copper $ { 112 } langle 111 rangle$, brass $ { 110 } langle 112 rangle$, S $ { 123 } langle 634 rangle$ and Goss $ { 110 } langle 001 rangle,$ again appeared, with clear preferences for particular variants. The calculations indicate that the final ferrite texture formed from either recrystallized or deformed austenite is significantly modif...|$|E
