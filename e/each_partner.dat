5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, <b>each</b> <b>partner</b> will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Prey of cnidarians {{ranges from}} {{plankton}} to animals several {{times larger than}} themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense; starfish, notably the crown of thorns starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and parrot fish, which eat corals; and marine turtles, which eat jellyfish. Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with some fish; for example clown fish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and <b>each</b> <b>partner</b> protects the other against predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs or {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Though less studied than the superb- and splendid fairywrens, it is presumably socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, with <b>each</b> <b>partner</b> mating with other individuals. Females and males feed young equally, while helper birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engage in mutual preening. Occasionally larger groups of around 10 birds have been recorded, though {{it is unclear whether}} this was incidental or a defined flock.|$|E

5|$|Henry Blackwell began {{a two-year}} {{courtship}} of Stone {{in the summer}} of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because {{she did not want to}} surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow <b>each</b> <b>partner</b> to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.|$|E
5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which <b>each</b> <b>partner</b> is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and <b>each</b> <b>partner</b> may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are {{more likely to engage in}} this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E

40|$|Drawing {{from social}} {{cognitive}} theory (Ban-dura, 1986) and data from 1, 640 couples who remained together {{over the first}} 4 waves of the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relation-ships and Family Dynamics (Pairfam) project, the authors examined the temporal ordering between <b>each</b> <b>partner’s</b> relationship efficacy and conflict (constructive behaviors and fre-quency of negative exchanges) assessed at the dyadic and individual levels. The results revealed that <b>each</b> <b>partner’s</b> constructive con-flict behaviors and negatively valenced conflict frequency at the couple level temporally pre-ceded relationship efficacy {{for male and female}} partners. There was no support for the reverse order or bidirectional linkages over time. These results challenge the prevailing theoretical and empirical suppositions regarding associa-tions between relationship efficacy and couple interactions. The discussion theorizes a more complex efficacy process in couple relations, whereas specific efficacy beliefs shape behaviors in that domain, which subsequently inform <b>each</b> <b>partner’s</b> global relationship efficacy over time...|$|R

30|$|The {{weighting}} {{factor in the}} utility function represents <b>each</b> <b>partner’s</b> bargaining power, and captures, for instance, relative resource endowment, time availability, outside options and egalitarian views. Members with the most “power” will tend to do less housework and engage more in labor market work (Bonke et al. 2008). In this context, “power” is related to comparative advantages and better outside options (Hersch and Stratton 1994). The {{weighting factor}} in the household production function may alter from 1 in order to account for different productivity levels in household production between husbands and wives. It is assumed that the observed labor supply of each spouse is the optimal solution of this maximization problem given <b>each</b> <b>partner’s</b> bargaining strength.|$|R
