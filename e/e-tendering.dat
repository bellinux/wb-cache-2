40|$|Major {{risk factors}} {{relating}} to electronic transactions {{may lead to}} destructive impacts on trust and transparency {{in the process of}} tendering. Currently, electronic tendering (<b>e-tendering)</b> systems still remain uncertain in issues relating to legal and security compliance and most importantly it has an unclear security framework. Particularly, the available systems are lacking in addressing integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation in <b>e-tendering</b> requirements. Thus, one of the challenges in developing an <b>e-tendering</b> system is to ensure the system requirements include the function for secured and trusted environment. Therefore, this paper aims to model a secured <b>e-tendering</b> system using misuse case approach. The modeling process begins with identifying the <b>e-tendering</b> process, which is based on the Australian Standard Code of Tendering (AS 4120 - 1994).

This to ensure the <b>e-tendering</b> transaction is secured and the most important is to gain trust from the <b>e-Tendering</b> stakeholder. Therefore, there is a need to develop a secured <b>e-Tendering</b> model as a guideline to <b>e-tendering</b> developers in developing the system. The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is the most appropriate system development methodology that can guide researchers in generating secured artifact. The RUP has been used by many researchers to construct a secured application model in various researches and projects. This due to the ability of the RUP in guiding researchers to deliver secured artifacts through Inception and elaboration phases.

However, the area where SME-s are lacking the most is the public procurement market, where as a general rule, they are consider under represented. Mainly {{due to the fact that}} larger corporations are more successful in winning government contracts. European Commission passed the „Small Business Act“ in 2011 and its main idea is to promote the new law-making principle – „think small first“. The idea behind the principle is to have all the member states to passing laws, which take the SME-s interest into consideration as the first priority and thus helping reduce the bureocracy and increasing the competitivness of the SME-s compared with bigger businesses. The aim of this thesis is to find out the main hindering facts that prevent SME-s to be as successful in government organized tenders and to promote find possible to the issues addressed. The focus of the thesis is mainly on Estonia, but also about the general trends in the EU. Based on the research, there are amongst other factors, two main reasons for the SME-s to be not as efficient in public tenders: 1) Too complicated tender procedures and the lack of <b>e-tender</b> systems. 2) Corruption. In order to increase the SME-s access and participation in public procurement tenders, the first things that need to be done from the institutional perspective is to have the tenders organized in a trasparent way, where the documents and other necessary requirements are publicly and openly available to all the interested parties. Thus, there is also a need for e-procurement systems, where the info help tools are readily available for the SME-s. Currently, there is already a similar system built in Estonia, but as it is still in development, the real benefits of it have still not been proved. At the same time, there are many countries within the EU that do not have the e-procurement systems developed at all. Corruption is seen as one of the most difficult issue to tackle, as it is relatively difficult to assess. Many countries have the lack of resources to have proper authorities in order to conduct surveillance on their public servants. However, corruption is not s serious concern in many countries, especially in the more developed Western and Northern European countries.

Numerous electronic tendering systems have been established {{with the intent of}} improving the efficiency of the tendering process. Although providing adequate security services is a desired feature in an <b>e-tendering</b> system, current <b>e-tendering</b> systems are usually designed with little consideration of security and legal compliance. This research focuses on designing secure protocols for <b>e-tendering</b> systems. It involves developing methodologies for establishing security requirements, constructing security protocols and using formal methods in protocol security verification. The implication is that it may prove suitable for developing secure protocols in other electronic business domains. In depth investigations are conducted into a range of issues in relation to establishing generic security requirements for <b>e-tendering</b> systems. The outcomes are presented in a form of basic and advanced security requirements for <b>e-tendering</b> process. This analysis shows that advanced security services are required to secure e-tender negotiation integrity and the submission process. Two generic issues discovered {{in the course of this}} research, functional difference and functional limitations, are fundamental in constructing secure protocols for tender negotiation and submission processes. Functional difference identification derives advanced security requirements. Functional limitation assessment defines how the logic of generic security mechanisms should be constructed. These principles form a proactive analysis applied prior to the construction of security protocols. Security protocols have been successfully constructed using generic cryptographic security mechanisms. These protocols are secure e-tender negotiation integrity protocol suite, and secure e-tender submission protocols. Their security has been verified progressively during the design. Verification results show that protocols are secure against common threat scenarios. The primary contribution of this stage are the procedures developed for the complex e-business protocol analysis using formal methods. The research shows that proactive analysis has made this formal security verification possible and practical for complex protocols.

PKI is the process to provide secure web based environment guarantees the reliability of the overall system. PKI uses asymmetric encryption/decryption technique to offer high shielded environment. This paper discusses this fact with integration of <b>e-Tendering</b> with Public Key Infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Tendering {{process is}} {{utilized}} by principal to invited capable tenderer {{to participate in}} competitive bid for winning a large project. Due to advent of IT infrastructure, <b>E-tendering</b> is introduced and adopted in many countries. Yet, an electronic environment did not promise curbing collusion between principal and certain tenderers. Other than common threats to system like security breaches by malicious parties, security issue related to ethical issue like fraud and repudiation issue where no evidence existed to denied it. In this paper, common threats for <b>e-tendering</b> process altogether with security countermeasure are described. This three interrelated attribute (consist of tender phase, threat and security countermeasure) are illustrated in misuse case for {{better understanding of the}} risk that may occurs in particular tender phase. Furthermore, it sought to ease the system developer for designing and constructing a secure <b>e-tendering</b> system...|$|E
40|$|A {{major step}} is {{required}} to integrate critical legal requirements into <b>e-tendering</b> system design. The current systems using ad-hoc security mechanisms {{do not meet the}} legal requirements for forming a complex electronic contract. This paper analyses the etendering process and its legal obligations. The mapping of these obligations to security policies has identified a set of essential security services (mechanisms) for <b>e-tendering</b> systems, with particular emphasis on the contract forming process. These essential security services provide a promising solution for a reliable etendering system...|$|E

This protocol is focused on securing the integrity of tendering documents and ensuring that a secure record of document generation is kept. Our protocol provides a mechanism to manage <b>e-tendering</b> contract evidence as a legal record in a unique and effective manner. It is the starting point of reliable record keeping. To a certain extent, it also addresses existing security problems in the traditional tendering processes...|$|E
