Unlike passive treatments, ANC utilizes an acoustic actuator (loudspeaker) to cancel unwanted sound fields. There {{are two main}} control topologies whenconsidering the active suppression of sound, feedforward and feedback. The former requiresthat the disturbance be known before the control signal is generated, and is ideal for periodicor random signals. Feedback arrangements, on the other hand, modify the dynamics of anenclosured sound field to augment damping, and requires no a priori knowledge of the disturbance. A modified version of feedback that is used in structures called positive positionfeedback (PPF), {{can be applied to}} acoustic systems. In a previous study, a tuned resonantfilter modelled after a Helmholtz resonator was used in PPF configuration to suppress noiselevels by Bisnette and Vipperman (2004). However, the presence of speaker dynamics necessitatesfurther phase compensation, which is accomplished with an all-pass filter. The workpresented here further develops this control method by using a higher-order compensator. Inthis study, band-pass filters are used to improve the multi-modal control by limiting phaseinteraction of adjacent modes. Further refinements are made by realizing the control systemelectronically, which gives the ability to adapt controller parameters. Here, an algorithmis presented that adapts the resonant controller gain. Experimental results show moderatereductions with no <b>energy</b> <b>spill-over</b> to the next adjacent uncontrolled mode...|$|E

As such, it has to cope with strongly variable abiotic conditions. Here we studied {{the response of the}} photosynthetic apparatus of this red alga to illumination. We found that, as previously described {{in the case of the}} unicellular alga Rhodella violacea (E. Delphin et al., Plant Physiol. 118 (1998) 103 – 113), a single multi-turnover saturating pulse of light is sufficient to induce a strong quenching of fluorescence. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this fluorescence quenching, we combined room temperature and 77 K fluorescence measurements with absorption spectroscopy to monitor the redox state of the different electron carriers in the chain. In addition, we studied the dependence of these various observables upon the excitation wavelength. This led us to identify <b>energy</b> <b>spill-over</b> from Photosystem II to Photosystem I rather than a qE-type non-photochemical quenching as the major source of fluorescence quenching that develops upon a series of 200 ms pulses of saturating light results, in line with the conclusion of Ley and Butler (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 592 (1980) 349 – 363) from their studies of the unicellular red alga Porphyridium cruentum. In addition, we show that the onset of this spill-over is triggered by the reduction of the plastoquinone pool...|$|E

After mild detergent solubilization, crystalline PSII arrays were extracted in which dimeric PSII particles associate in multiple rows. Image processing of the arrays {{shows that the}} PSII dimers are tightly packed at distances of 12. 2 and 16. 7 nm. The domains {{are considered to be}} an important type of association for preventing either <b>spill-over</b> <b>energy</b> from PSII towards photosystem I (PSI) or direct energy flow from phycobilisomes to PSI, because the latter can only be at periphery of the arrays...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the view}} of {{pressing}} unemployment and environmental problems, different policies have been proposed to create jobs in {{the transition to a}} green economy, including the so-called “green jobs”. There has been an intense debate on the quantification of these employment effects, especially in the European Union. Most studies have focused on estimating gross future employment effects and have ignored the effects between different sectors and countries. This paper looks, for the first time, at the past net employment impacts from the transformation of the EU <b>energy</b> sector including <b>spill-over</b> effects, by using a multi-regional input–output model and the World Input–Output Database. The analysis is focused on the period (1995 – 2009) when the EU’s energy structure went through a significant shift, away from the more carbon intensive sources, towards gas and renewables. We estimate the net employment generated from this structural change at 530, 000 jobs in the EU (0. 24 % of total employment in 2009), of which one third is due to trans-boundary effects within the EU (i. e. employment generated in one country due to the changes in another). Within the EU, the main gainers were Poland, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Spain, and the main losers were Ireland, Lithuania, France and Czech Republic...|$|R
