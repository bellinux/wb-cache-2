40|$|Abstract — Radiowave {{propagation}} can be attenuated {{by different}} atmospheric parameters like raindrops, suspended particles, aerosols and variation of {{temperatures in the}} atmosphere. Absorption and scattering through the propagating medium is highly influenced by {{the condition of the}} atmosphere. Sea Surface Temperature plays a vital role in the absorption of moisture in the several layers of the upper atmosphere from the surface level. Oceans are the major sources from where the atmosphere gets the moisture content. Thus aerosol particles content increases in the atmosphere and formation of rain drops occurs. The equivalent path length of the radiowave signal at higher frequencies gets affected by the raindrop sizes and suspended particles existing in the atmosphere. The wireless communication at present depends mostly on the higher frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Ka and <b>Ku</b> <b>bands</b> belong to this higher frequency range. Our aim in the present paper is to study whether the attenuation of the radiowave at Ka and <b>Ku</b> <b>bands</b> has any relation with the monthly mean sea surface temperature of the Nino regions of Pacific Ocean...|$|R
