5000|$|The {{link with}} Australia's second largest {{telecommunications}} company, Optus, proved {{crucial to the}} company's early success. One.Tel initially operated largely as a reseller of Optus services, receiving $120 for each mobile telephone customer that it attracted. The Optus contract was a wonderful deal for One.Tel and a terrible deal for Optus. One.Tel did not even need to sign up a customer to a long-term contract, it merely needed to have a customer accept a SIM card {{in order to receive}} $120 from Optus. This reportedly led to some unusual business practices, such as paying customers $10 to accept a new SIM card. Many SIM cards were never used. It also had an adverse impact on the credit-worthiness of One.Tel's customers, as One.Tel signed up many people who would not have been accepted as customers by other telephone carriers. It has been reported that One.Tel's customers were mainly [...] "single mothers, pensioners and teenagers". This aspect of the business has led some commentators to speculate that the business was initially conceived as a pump and <b>dump</b> <b>operation</b> - a business that had no long-term future, but was being built up for a quick sale via an Initial Public Offering (IPO).|$|E
40|$|Dragline Swing to Dump Automation By Peter Corke, CSIRO Manufacturing Technology/CRC for Mining Technology and Equipment (CMTE) Peter Corke {{presented}} {{a case study}} of a project to automate the dragline swing to <b>dump</b> <b>operation.</b> The project is funded by ACARP, BHP Coal, Pacific Coal and the CMTE and is being carried out on a dragline at Pacific Coal's Meandu mine near Brisbane. Corke began by highlighting that the minerals industry makes extensive use of large, mechanised machines. However, unlike other industries, mining has not adopted automation and most machines are controlled by human operators on board the machine itself. Choosing an automation target The dragline automation was chosen because: ò draglines are one of the biggest capital assets in a mine; ò performance between operators vary significantly, so improved capital utilisation is possible; ò the dragline is often the bottleneck in production; ò {{a large part of the}} operation cycle is spent swinging from dig to dump; and ò it is technically feasible.

The superconducting magnet is composed of two parts: the inner part with Nb 3 Sn cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC) and the outer part with NbTi CICC. Both parts are connected in series and powered by a single DC power supply. The superconducting magnet can be cooled with supercritical helium at inlet temperature of 4. 5 K. The total inductance and stored energy of the superconducting magnet are about 0. 278 H and 436. 6 MJ at an operating current of 56 kA respectively.

The geological conditions, <b>dumping</b> <b>operation,</b> and waste particle size distribution were investigated in the Heidaigou open pit mine.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} advanced algorithms for realtime {{detection of}} dragline duty, the quantification of its causes and the combined optimisation of dragline motion to minimise cycle time and duty. Draglines are large, powerful, rotating, multibody systems that {{operate in a}} similar manner to cranes and certain pick and place robots. Duty is an estimate of fatigue damage on the dragline boom caused by cyclic stresses that are associated with the repetitive dig and <b>dump</b> <b>operation.</b> Neither realtime detection of duty nor the quantification of its causes were previously available. In addition, no previous researchers have optimised the dynamic motion of mining equipment to achieve the combined maximisation of productivity and minimisation of maintenance measures. The advanced duty detection system was developed to improve feedback to dragline operators. The algorithms that were developed are based on the mechanics of dragline motion and fatigue. In particular, fatigue cycles in measured stress are identified at the earliest possible time, based on a novel proof and modification to the rainflow cycle counting algorithm. The contributions of specific causes to each individual stress range are quantified based on the mechanics of operator dependent control and dragline dynamics. In this manner, specific causes of duty are measured. The algorithms confirmed the significant contribution from operator dependent factors and identified the major causes, attributing 28 % of the total duty to out-of-plane bucket motion and 15 % to dynamic vibration. Further improvements to dragline performance required the development of a dragline dynamic model for offline testing and optimisation. A complete, condensed set of equations for a four-degree-of-freedom nonlinear coupled model of a dragline was derived using Lagrange’s method, allowing direct insight into dragline behaviour not available from previous research. The model was used to investigate the relationship between motor power, operator behaviour, bucket trajectory, productivity and duty during the swing and return phases of operation. Significant potential for increasing productivity and reducing duty was demonstrated. The advanced duty detection system and the dragline model were validated with field measured data, video footage, alternative modelling and expert review. Realtime and end-of-cycle feedback was simulated over many cycles of measured data. Experts from industry and research were consulted to verify the causes of duty based on detailed measured data analysis. The forces, stresses and out-of-plane angle predicted by the dragline model were closely compared with measured data over various indicative cycles. The dragline model was also validated against an alternative model constructed in ADAMS. The development of the dragline model enabled model-based numerical optimisation. Significant nonlinearities in the model and the constraints necessitated the use of the Lagrange multiplier method. The bucket trajectory during the swing and return phase was directly optimised. In order to minimise cycle time and duty, a penalty for duty incurred was added to the cycle time, effectively maximising long-term productivity. For a slew torque optimisation scenario using measured rope lengths, the numerical optimisation performance was shown to be 10 - 30 % better than manual optimisation and 50 - 60 % better than the operator performance. This thesis outlines several significant contributions to improving dragline performance. Underpinning the advanced duty detection system are three significant contributions to fatigue cycle counting algorithms: a proof of the equivalence of two pre-existing algorithms; a new algorithm that enables realtime detection of duty; and an algorithm that can attribute duty to specific causes. These novel feedback tools can provide realtime operator feedback and identify the causes of excess duty and when it was incurred. A complete and condensed set of equations for the four-degree-of-freedom model enabled, for the first time, the optimisation of dragline operation to concurrently reduce duty and increase productivity. The models and feedback algorithms were validated with field measured data. Future work could include installation and extension of the advanced duty detection system. In addition, further modelling and optimisation research could focus on improving the heuristics used for bucket trajectory control, realtime determination of optimum bucket trajectory and testing proposed dragline modifications...|$|E

It has been the theorized that accidents associated with <b>dumping</b> <b>operations</b> might be reduced by short-dumping rather than edge-dumping, but many operators {{have been reluctant to}} use short-dumping because they believe it is not as cost effective as edge-dumping. To evaluate this perception, researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reviewed the costs of various dumping methods at waste and spoil piles. The study found that overall cost differences between the two methods were not significant in most cases. However, while overall cost differences between the two methods appear small, capital costs could be more significant when short -dumping if numerous dump sites are used concurrently. The choice of which method to use should be based on considerations of the safety of dozer and truck operators. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Also available via the World Wide Web as an Acrobat. pdf file.

Furthermore, it studies whether these sediment nourishments could indirectly feed the nearby-located Baarland tidal flat. In this study, two morphodynamic models for the Scheldt Estuary were set up, using both the newly developed D-Flow Flexible Mesh software, for the numerical modelling, and the more established Delft 3 D software. The new software allows a local refinement of the grid in the area of interest for better hydraulic and morphological analysis and shorter computational times. Both models were calibrated and validated for the local hydrodynamics, and subsequently used to study several sediment dumping scenarios. As the sediment module within D-Flow FM was not available yet, the morphological impact of each dumping scenario is investigated using offline-predicted sediment transport patterns based on predicted velocities. These large <b>dumping</b> <b>operations</b> can cause intense changes in the local hydrodynamics and also significant morphodynamic changes not only locally but also in the wider macro-cell area. Indications of erosion and accretion in the Baarland flat were found without though having a clear view of the flat nourishment.
