5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} cigars {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro.

5|$|During the First World War, Paris {{sometimes}} {{found itself}} on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne.

In the years after the war, known as Les Années Folles, Paris {{continued to be a}} mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including <b>Ernest</b> <b>Hemingway,</b> Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Sidney Bechet and the surrealist Salvador Dalí.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, <b>Ernest</b> <b>Hemingway,</b> and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection {{between himself and the}} other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques. In The Perpetual Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, the Paris {{literary}} {{community was}} dominated by Colette, André Gide, François Mauriac, André Malraux, Albert Camus, and, after World War II, by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre; Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including <b>Ernest</b> <b>Hemingway,</b> Samuel Beckett, and, in the 1970s, Milan Kundera.

5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin.

They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S.

Scott Fitzgerald and <b>Ernest</b> <b>Hemingway.</b> They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of <b>Ernest</b> <b>Hemingway</b> and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E

A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E
