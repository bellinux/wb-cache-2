It is emphasized that the Fed, in order to preserve its independence, formulates monetary policy in a way that prevents the formation of coalitions within the government that could threaten its independence. As a consequence, the Fed, in general, attempts to balance multiple, changing objectives. This attempt leads to the demand for "flexibility," an absence of precommitment. Much of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the way in which the Fed's desire to avoid precommitment influences its use of analytical procedures for formulating policy and its use of money supply targets.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the PlA 1 /A 2 polymorphism and platelet activation and aggregation in patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD). DesignA prospective single-centre cohort study. Methods 45 patients with PAD on aspirin 75 mg were recruited and phenotyped/genotyped for the Gp IIb/IIIa PlA 1 /A 2 polymorphism. Platelet-Monocyte Aggregation (PMAs) was evaluated using flow-cytometry. ResultsThe formation of PMAs in the PlA 2 group was higher but not statistically significant (p= 0. 17). However, when males were analysed separately, the formation of PMAs was significantly higher in the PlA 2 group (p= 0. 0192). No difference was seen in the females. ConclusionsIn this study we show that the PlA 1 /A 2 polymorphism primarily affects the aggregation of platelets to monocytes in males.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{examines}} the ‘politics of difference’, a phrase now almost synonymous with postmodernism and the critique of the Enlightenment. The article provides a post-structuralist take on this critique arguing that a critique of Enlightenment values {{can lead to a}} deepening of democracy and using Foucault’s notion of governmentality to <b>elucidate</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> political reason links the form of liberal government with the self-governing individual. It also examines emergent forms of post-coloniality with its emphasis on philosophies of difference and encounters with the Other and borrows the concept of the ‘multitude ’ from Hardt and Negri, to talk about Derrida’s ‘coming of world demoracy’. Every nationalism is metaphysically an anthropologism, and as such subjectivism. Nationalism is not overcome through mere internationalism; it is rather expanded and elevated thereby into a system. Nationalism is as little brought and raised to humanitas by internationalism as individualism is by an ahistorical collectivism. (Martin Heidegger, Letter on Humanism, 1999, p. 244...|$|E
