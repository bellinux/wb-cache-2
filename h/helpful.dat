5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may be <b>helpful</b> {{for treating}} vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, {{with a single}} dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be <b>helpful.</b> However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Laparoscopic {{identification}} is <b>helpful</b> in diagnosing tubal disease; a 65 percent to 90 percent {{positive predictive value}} exists in patients with presumed PID.|$|E
5|$|Primary lung cancers {{themselves}} {{most commonly}} metastasize to the brain, bones, liver and adrenal glands. Immunostaining of a biopsy is often <b>helpful</b> {{to determine the}} original source. The presence of Napsin-A, TTF-1, CK7 and CK20 are <b>helpful</b> in confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin or chromogranin.|$|E
5|$|The sapheno-femoral {{junction}} {{is tested}} by the Valsalva maneuver {{with the use of}} color Doppler being <b>helpful</b> at this stage.|$|E
5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} mutations are harmful. However, {{the vast majority of}} mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be <b>helpful</b> in another.|$|E
5|$|As {{one area}} in which OPEC members {{have been able to}} {{cooperate}} productively over the decades, the organization has significantly improved {{the quality and quantity of}} information available about the international oil market. This is especially <b>helpful</b> for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of careful planning.|$|E
5|$|Danny Pudi as Abed Nadir – Abed is a Palestinian/Polish boy who – {{according}} to Jeff – has Asperger syndrome. He proves <b>helpful</b> to Jeff with {{his ability to}} obtain quick and detailed knowledge of everyone he meets.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the artist}} and amateur naturalist Abbott Handerson Thayer, Cott {{explains}} countershading with diagrams, photographs of models and examples of real animals. He shows how <b>helpful</b> {{it would be for}} military camouflage with drawings of gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing may be <b>helpful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jason Weaver as Teddy, a {{close friend}} of Rashad's. Weaver {{impressed}} producer Austin in his previous film Drumline enough to get a role in ATL. The director felt that Weaver, the veteran of the young cast, and his experience would be <b>helpful</b> to the other cast members.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the pioneers}} of {{research}} into animal coloration, Edward Bagnall Poulton classified the forms of protective coloration, {{in a way which}} is still <b>helpful.</b> He described: protective resemblance; aggressive resemblance; adventitious protection; and variable protective resemblance. These are covered in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{necessary}} obligations, Anderson was {{also known for}} helping students with problems both academic and personal, lending <b>helpful</b> guidance. In some cases, Anderson was known to have given loans to students, as well share a drink in troubling times.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} the FDA interviewed physicians, Reich's {{students}} and his patients, asking about the orgone accumulators. A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an accumulator told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phoney, but found it <b>helpful</b> because his wife sat quietly in it for four hours every day.|$|E
5|$|Prolotherapy – the {{practice}} of injecting solutions into joints (or other areas) to cause inflammation and thereby stimulate the body's healing response – has not {{been found to be}} effective by itself, although it may be <b>helpful</b> when added to another therapy.|$|E
5|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} {{affect the}} amount of pain experienced {{and the degree to}} which it interferes with daily life; and the American Institute of Medicine and the American Pain Society support the inclusion of expert, quality-controlled psychosocial care as part of cancer pain management. Psychosocial interventions include education (addressing among other things the correct use of analgesic medications and effective communication with clinicians) and coping-skills training (changing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors through training in skills such as problem solving, relaxation, distraction and cognitive restructuring). Education may be more <b>helpful</b> to people with stage I cancer and their carers, and coping-skills training may be more <b>helpful</b> at stages II and III.|$|E
5|$|The arrests {{brought a}} surge of media {{coverage}} to the sit-in campaign, including national television news coverage, front page stories in both of Nashville's daily newspapers, and an Associated Press story. The students generally viewed any media coverage as <b>helpful</b> to their cause, especially when it illustrated their commitment to nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} block the ball with either their hands or arms. Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage. Sports {{involving}} quick reactions may be <b>helpful,</b> as these help the goalkeeper's reflexes which is a crucial skill.|$|E
5|$|The human {{innovation}} {{of cooking}} {{may have been}} particularly <b>helpful</b> in overcoming many of the defensive chemicals of plants. Many enzyme inhibitors in cereal grains and pulses, such as trypsin inhibitors prevalent in pulse crops, are denatured by cooking, making them digestible.|$|E
5|$|Weather ship {{observations}} {{proved to}} be <b>helpful</b> in wind and wave studies, as commercial shipping tended to avoid weather systems for safety reasons, whereas the weather ships did not. They were also <b>helpful</b> in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. Beginning in the 1970s, their role was largely superseded by weather buoys because of the ships' significant cost. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts {{leading up to the}} Great Storm of 1987. The last weather ship was Polarfront, known as weather station M ("Mike"), which was removed from operation on January 1, 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.|$|E
5|$|While {{the moment}} from {{gyroscopic}} forces is only 12% of this, it {{can play a}} significant part because it begins to act {{as soon as the}} rider applies the torque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can be especially <b>helpful</b> in motorcycle racing.|$|E
5|$|With {{other causes}} ruled out, people with {{non-specific}} {{low back pain}} are typically treated symptomatically, without exact determination of the cause. Efforts to uncover factors that might complicate the diagnosis, such as depression, substance abuse, or an agenda concerning insurance payments may be <b>helpful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis, several therapies have proven <b>helpful.</b> The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used {{in the management of}} MS have several adverse effects. Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be <b>helpful</b> in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|Bonfiglioli often bought {{material}} from writers without an established reputation; {{he did not}} make any special effort to acquire stories from well-known names. He was known for writing long and <b>helpful</b> rejection letters to newcomers, {{but he also had}} a reputation for laziness, and much of the day-to-day editorial work was done by assistants—first James Parkhill-Rathbone, and then Keith Roberts.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players often {{encounter}} <b>helpful</b> {{residents who}} will {{point the way}} to outlaws. The residents need to be protected during gameplay, as the player has to pay a fine if any are shot by either bandits or Sheriff Quickdraw himself. Some outlaws are mounted on horseback, meaning that the player may have to saddle an imaginary horse to pursue them.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a <b>helpful</b> aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more <b>helpful</b> in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be <b>helpful,</b> and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support this assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is <b>helpful</b> when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{evidence}} of the earliest known life on land on Earth may {{have been found in}} 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. These findings may be <b>helpful</b> in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. Lithium salts may also be <b>helpful</b> for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+. They may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry's coordinator, {{was removed}} from his post and {{transferred}} from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper Diário de Notícias that the British police had only pursued leads <b>helpful</b> to the McCanns, ignoring that the couple were suspects. As an example, he criticized their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic and vaginal {{ultrasounds}} are <b>helpful</b> in {{the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} amphibians {{evolved in}} the Devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were <b>helpful</b> in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.|$|E
5|$|The {{encyclopedia}} {{was praised}} by the School Library Journal for its reference value and comprehensiveness. Booklist recommended the encyclopedia {{be placed in}} academic, public, and high school libraries as a <b>helpful</b> resource. Publishers Weekly was critical of the author's objectivity, suggesting that the encyclopedia was biased {{in favor of the}} agency's intelligence operations, but concluded that the book was still a useful reference tool.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the fiction is thought by Donald Tuck to have {{generally}} fallen during Santesson's period at the helm, though this was not entirely his faultthere were a great many other magazines competing for stories by the top writers. Santesson himself, despite a modicum of controversy over his heavy use of UFO and related material, was kind and <b>helpful</b> to writers, and was well liked as a result.|$|E
