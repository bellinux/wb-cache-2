For instance, in 1959, 13% of firms focused on internal rates of return while 86% of firms did so in 1988. In addition, the percentage of firms utilizing accounting measures decreased from 50% in 1959 to 12% in 1988. One potential reason that dominating performance measures change over time is that as organizations replace old measures when they discover their limitations.|$|E
