40|$|We use an {{extended}} version of electrodynamics, which admits {{the existence of}} magnetic charges and currents, to discuss how different models for <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> do or do not carry hidden momentum {{under the influence of}} external electromagnetic fields. Based on that, we discuss how the models adopted for the <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> from the particles that compose a material medium influence the expression for the electromagnetic part of the light momentum in the medium. We show that Abraham expression is compatible with <b>electric</b> <b>dipoles</b> formed by <b>electric</b> charges and magnetic dipoles formed by magnetic charges, while Minkowski expression is compatible with <b>electric</b> <b>dipoles</b> formed by magnetic currents and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> formed by <b>electric</b> currents. The expression ε_ 0 E×B, on the other hand, is shown to be compatible with <b>electric</b> <b>dipoles</b> formed by <b>electric</b> charges and magnetic <b>dipoles</b> formed by <b>electric</b> currents, which are much more natural models. So this expression has an interesting interpretation in the Abraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in a medium: It is the expression compatible with the nonexistence of magnetic charges. We also provide a simple justification of why Abraham and Minkowski momenta can be associated with the kinetic and canonical momentum of light, respectively.

This is unrealistic, as real dipoles have separated charge. However, because the charge separation is very small compared to everyday lengths, the error introduced by treating real dipoles like they are theoretically perfect is usually negligible. The direction of dipole is usually defined from the negative charge towards the positive charge.|$|E

25|$|This has an {{interesting}} consequence on the <b>electric</b> <b>dipole</b> moment (EDM) of any particle. The EDM is defined through {{the shift in}} the energy of a state when it is put in an external electric field: Δe = d·E + E·δ·E, where d is called the EDM and δ, the induced dipole moment. One important property of an EDM is that the energy shift due to it changes sign under a parity transformation. However, since d is a vector, its expectation value in a state |ψ> must be proportional to | J |ψ>. Thus, under time reversal, an invariant state must have vanishing EDM. In other words, a non-vanishing EDM signals both P and T symmetry-breaking.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with spin which refers to the magnetic dipole moments of particles, much experimental work is continuing on measuring the <b>electric</b> <b>dipole</b> moments (EDM) of fundamental and composite particles, namely those of the electron and neutron, respectively. As EDMs violate both the parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries, their values yield a mostly model-independent measure of CP-violation in nature (assuming CPT symmetry is valid). Therefore, values for these EDMs place strong constraints upon the scale of CP-violation that extensions to the standard model of particle physics may allow. Current generations of experiments are designed {{to be sensitive to the}} supersymmetry range of EDMs, providing complementary experiments to those done at the LHC.|$|E
