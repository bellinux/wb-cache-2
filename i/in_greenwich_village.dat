5|$|Bryant became {{familiar}} with the socialist journal The Masses through Portland resident and lawyer C. E. S. Wood, who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine.

She and other political activists, such as Alexander Berkman, were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband. In 1914, Reed, a Harvard graduate and established writer who by then lived <b>in</b> <b>Greenwich</b> <b>Village,</b> came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the University Club of Portland against the class system.
