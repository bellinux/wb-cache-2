40|$|Greetings {{from the}} Editor <b>Hello,</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> another year of Paradox. A {{year in which}} we are {{planning}} to bring you several exciting and innovative editions of this magazine, to complement the entertaining schedule of mathematics and statistics related talks, seminars, Olympics, BBQs and more organised by the Melbourne University Mathematics and Statistics Society (MUMS). This year, we hope to include articles by interested maths and stats students of all levels, and in general encourage participation by everyone who wants to see 1998 be a fun and stimulating year (or just wants to pad their C. V. and see their name in print). So anyone who wants to submit any maths or stats jokes, puzzles, articles, pictures, recipes or anything at all — jus...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hello,</b> everyone, <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> summer. “Wake up! ” is {{not what}} one wants to hear on the flight deck. A former airline pilot {{recently}} told me this story about one of his missions. He and his crew were completing a roundrobin trip with several intermediate stops that had taken up most of their crew duty day. This was the third {{day in a row}} that he and his copilot had flown. They had left their home domicile in the late afternoon, so they had been up several hours before their departure.

The Manitoba Chapter Executive has had a busy and productive year. In June 2011, the Executive met to formulate a plan for the upcoming year. We developed a list of goals and objectives focusing on the continued retention and recruitment of the Chapter as well as providing the critical care nursing profession with support for further knowledge acquisition and advancement of the science of critical care nursing.

40|$|<b>Hello</b> {{everyone}} <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> the 19 th Security Protocols Workshop. The theme this year, {{which it}} is traditional to mention in the first session (and then never refer to again), is "Alice doesn't live here anymore". One of the perennial problems in analysing security protocols is how we distinguish Alice from not-Alice. The prevailing wisdom is that Alice possesses something which not-Alice does not. It might be knowledge of something that {{is used as a}} key. It might be that Alice possesses some physical characteristic, such as a biometric, or that there is something about the hardware that Alice is running on that is difficult to replicate. Or it might be that Alice possesses exclusive access to the interface to some distinguishing piece of hardware, like a dongle, although such hardware (when we think about it) usually belongs to some other security domain anyway. ?? 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

Our topic today is “The Art of Architecture Transformation. ” • As we all know, large scale transformations can be very challenging. These challenges are not only compounded by a wide array of new technology components and high business expectation to get it right the first time, but also for planning and executing something that your organization – or you- have never done! • Today, we want to explore the art and science of large scale architecture planning. Our speakers are practicing enterprise architects, and will share their experiences and lessons learned in rebuilding entire IT organizations and infrastructure. • They will discuss this in terms of a standardized approach that includes business-led architecture planning, change management, and business communication. All of which are critical to ensure that your projects stay supported and funded! Let me introduce our speakers. Copyright © 2012, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

40|$|Wow, {{has this}} project grown! <b>Hello,</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> our new watchers and {{stargazers}} — {{and a special}} thanks to everybody who has provided feedback and helped over the past weeks. It's been a huge pleasure, and a complete blast, to have you around. Things have become much nicer and more stable {{as a result of}} your support, and I (that's me, @felixhenninger) have learnt a great deal and have become a better developer. This release is to commemorate a stable state in view of a few major upcoming changes, but there's also been a lot of activity that is worth summarizing. Contributor friendliness, project infrastructure, and community outreach A focus of the recent work has been to make the project as a whole more stable and accessible to contributors. This was prompted in a large part by Mozilla's excellent Open Leadership Training and the fantastic Global Sprint. In particular, the project now has A Code of Conduct Improved Contributor Documentation Build testing via travis-ci, thanks to @pvskarthikeya, who also (rightly) recommended the excellent course How to Write an Open Source Javascript Library by Kent C. Dodds Library Now includes utilities for building full-screen studies Supports automated and standardized backends for data collection Formats collected data much more nicely in the debug preview Builder CSV import and export for loops (big thanks to @crsh for suggesting this!) Now exports a complete study ready for the field, including data collection backends Browser compatibility issues are now detected automatically, and users are prompted to update their browser The builder taking big steps towards becoming progressive, i. e. offline-capable (it's not entirely there yet, but close) Editor code is now preloaded, removing a major source of errors (all credit goes to @jeffslofish for prompting this) Static files can be included in a study (upload UI upcoming!...|$|E

It has been a busy year for VOS with all the changes and {{upgrades}} as well as working around our budget constraints. With all this at hand, you, our marine weather observers remain true to the cause and we appreciate all that you do. Our data is getting better than ever and our goal remains quality over quantity.

5000|$|Though {{her writing}} is not {{explicitly}} political, it nevertheless includes implicit critiques of government policy. In Todos se van, explains one scholar, describes [...] "a landscape of oppression and, what is worse, its internalization and perpetual reenactment in private relations". The principal character, Nieve, could emigrate except {{that her father}} will not give permission for fear of offending Communist Party officials, and once he leaves in the Mariel boatlift {{he can no longer}} grant permission. And Ninca fui primera dama casts the influence of the Soviet Union on Cuban society in a negative as in this a vision of radio station in Cuba that embodies old technologies and a cultural style inherited from the Soviets: [...] "A place frozen in time, with all the cold of the Siberian Steppe, the air conditioner on high, and Russian postcards arranged in size on top of the frozen, noisy, and also Soviet apparatus, battered, but there working. I doubt that the Russian functionaries still have such a place in their country." [...] In her blog hosted by El Mundo, she wrote of the thaw in Cuban-American relations announced in December 2014: [...] Many thought that the wall of water would fall in one night. Some speculated that we would wake up with the news of a death or an overthrow and then everything would change. Living in this country teaches you that that is not possible, no matter what your political ideal. Things on this island are much more complex, foreign formulas do not work for us. Political life has taken root in a heartbreaking eternity, a deep, infinite eternity that has beaten my grandparents, my parents and that can powerfully beat me and mine. [...] While welcoming the hope offered by Barack Obama's words, she asked: [...] "Has anyone thought about how lonely, how profoundly alone we Cubans have been {{in the midst of the}} crowd?" [...] Yet she contrasted that isolation with another Cuban identity: [...] "In contrast with our anti-imperialist spirit, cultivated for five decades and more, we must be clear that half of our affections live in America and that everything that happens to us goes through the same waters and the same winds. Our weather forecast is almost nearly Miami's." [...] She concluded by evoking Hemingway: Here is the enemy at last ... going to talk, to walk with them, to make peace, to rebuild our lives and change everything for the better should be changed without ceasing to be what we are ... here is the enemy at last ... <b>Hello,</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> farewell <b>to</b> arms ...|$|R
