50|$|Stewart is now chiefly {{remembered for}} his first novel, Nordenholt's Million (1923), an early <b>ecocatastrophe</b> {{disaster}} novel in which denitrifying bacteria inimical to plant growth run amok and destroy world agriculture. The eponymous plutocrat Nordenholt constructs a refuge for the chosen few in Scotland, fortifying the Clyde valley. The novel is similar in spirit to such disaster stories as Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer's When Worlds Collide (1933) and anticipates the theme of John Christopher's The Death of Grass (1956).|$|E
40|$|Theodor Storm's novella 'Der Schimmelreiter' is set {{in northwestern}} Germany, a region {{with a long history}} of dyke {{building}} and coastal flooding. Drawing on insights into material agency, complexity, and the entwinement of materiality and discourse that have emerged from science studies, I read this text as an exploration of distributed agency that challenges humanist assumptions about both “man” and “nature” by disclosing the limits of rational human mastery in the face of unruly natural phenomena, both “inner” and “outer. ” At the same time, the multiple narrative frames of this tragic tale foreground the ineluctable force of viewpoint in any narrative performance of <b>ecocatastrophe.</b> As such, it exemplifies how narrative fiction can provide an imaginative space of reflection to investigate both the complex causality of hybrid natural-cultural disasters and different modalities of human responses to them...|$|E
40|$|Human {{intervention}} has impaired the Mississippi River’s {{ability to}} deliver sediment to its delta wetlands, {{and as a consequence}} acute land loss in coastal Louisiana has resulted in an unprecedented <b>ecocatastrophe.</b> To mitigate this degradation, an unparalleled restoration effort is underway. For this effort to be successful and sustainable, various sediment input mechanisms must be integrated, including: building appropriate sediment-diversions; beneficially using the millions of cubic metres of sediment dredged annually from navigational channels; harvesting deposits of sand and suitable sediment from the river and offshore; and related sediment management activities that are compatible with other uses of the river. A comprehensive sediment management plan has been developed to identify and delineate potential sediment sources for restoration, and to provide a framework for managing sediment resources wisely, cost effectively, and in a systematic manner. The Louisiana Sediment Management Plan provides regional strategies for improved comprehensive management of Louisiana's limited sediment resources...|$|E

The review of basic scientific directions of activity and most ponderable fundamental achievements of Institute, and solved on their basis {{of a number of}} important applied tasks is made. The contribution of Institute to determination of reasons of origin of technogenic accidents and <b>ecocatastrophes,</b> and also in development of methods of their prevention and liquidation is shown.

40|$|This article interrogates {{representations}} {{of time in}} the novels of Sam Taylor. Drawing on Ernst Bloch’s utopian philosophical framework, I argue that Taylor’s non-contemporaneous or “metachronous” temporalities reconfigure narrative time within the broader context of increasingly post-secular questions of final judgment. Rather than recapitulating the “Arcadian revenge” of SF <b>ecocatastrophes,</b> Taylor’s nonanthropocentric glimpses of futurity enable us to move beyond the dichotomy of pastoral Arcadia/savage wilderness in twenty-first-century fiction. A comparative reading of Bloch’s writings on natural futurity and Taylor’s novels thus helps us reorient the theorization of temporality, suggesting new directions for post-apocalyptic, ecocritical, and utopian literary analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{destruction}} and pollution {{of the natural}} environment poses two problems for philosophers. The first is political and pragmatic: which theory of the environment is best equipped to impact policymakers heading as we are toward a series of potential <b>ecocatastrophes?</b> The second is more central: On the environment philosophers tend to fall either side of an irreconcilable divide. Either our moral concerns are grounded directly in nature, or the appeal is made via an anthropocentric set of interests. The lack of a common ground is disturbing. In this paper I attempt to diagnose {{the reason for this}} lack. I shall agree that wild nature lacks features of intrinsic moral worth, and that leaves a puzzle: Why is it once we subtract {{the fact that there is}} such a lack, we are left with strong intuitions against the {{destruction and}}/or pollution of wild nature? Such intuitions can be grounded only in a strong sense of aesthetic concern combined with a common-sense regard for the interests of sentient life as it is indirectly affected by the quality of the environment. I suggest also that of the positions on offer, a hybrid theory of the environment is best suited to address our first problem, that of having an effective influence in the polity. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Fiction offers {{creative}} and imaginative scenarios and solutions that may stimulate {{young people to}} consider their own relationship with the environment. Literature for young people also offers insights into <b>ecocatastrophe,</b> anthropocentrism, sustainability, and other important issues. A further significance of this project is that it aligns with the cross-curriculum priority of the Australian Curriculum, namely ‘sustainability’. The 'Children's Literature and the Environment' project in AustLit includes a variety of bibliographic records (fiction, information books, film, poetry, and multimedia) relevant to {{children and young adults}} that deal with the environment in imaginative, scientific, educational, and creative ways, which culminates in an online exhibition. There are a number of components clustered around key concepts and issues, such as sustainability, urban environments, and Indigenous perspectives. This exhibition allows researchers and students to access and engage with bibliographical data on a range of literary and critical texts that provide various environmental perspectives over a significant period of time...|$|E
40|$|The mankind has {{got into}} {{extremely}} complicated and very dangerous {{situation at the}} beginning of third millennium. The most people don’t realize fully the level of threat of man’s activity and destructive consequences of this activity for environment. In fact, it has brought our planet to global <b>ecocatastrophe.</b> This situation has made world community look for new ways of humanity evolution. The well-known document entitled “The agenda for XXI century” accepted by International environmental conference of OUN in 1992 is one of such kind of ways. A new model of social development named sustainable development has been offered by this document. Sustainable development approach combined next ideas: harmonious interaction and unity of ecological, economic and social development. For transition to a new model of ecologically safe and energy saving development, it is necessary to seek the accordance of three above-mentioned constituents of development both at world level and at the regional level.

40|$|Modern {{progress}} in artificial intelligence permits to realize algorithms of adaptation for critical events (in addition to ERP). A production emergence, {{an appearance of}} new competitive goods, {{a major change in}} financial state of partners, a radical change in exchange rate, a change in custom and tax legislation, a political and energy crisis, an <b>ecocatastrophe</b> can lead up to a decrease of profit or bankruptcy of enterprise. Therefore it is necessary to assess a probability of threat and to take preventive actions. If a critical event took place, one must estimate restoration expenses and possible consequences as well as to prepare appropriate propositions. This is provided using modern methods of diagnostics, prediction, and decision making as well as an inference engine and semantic analysis. Mathematical methods in use are called in algorithms of adaptation automatically. Because the enterprise is a complex system, to overcome complexity of control it is necessary to apply semantic representations. Such representations are formed from descriptions of events, facts, persons, organizations, goods, operations, scripts on a natural language. Semantic representations permit as well to formulate actual problems and to find ways to resolve these problems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Some arachnids (spiders, mites and pseudoscorpions) {{are able}} to use both active and passive {{dispersal}}. The best-known passive dispersal method in arachnids is called ballooning and starts with tiptoe behaviour. Using threads of silk, spiders can move {{from place to place}} with air currents. Usually the spider aeronauts are small, but sometimes larger ones can also be transported in this way. Some mites spread passively also by using threads of silk, or use their own body as a carrying surface. A great number of mite species intentionally use other animals (e. g. insects) as carriers, and this phenomenon is known as phoresy. Similarly, pseudoscorpions sometimes infest insects. The most probable reasons that may cause passive dispersal are: overpopulation, changeable physical conditions, and <b>ecocatastrophe.</b> Passive dispersal {{is one of the major}} ways of colonization of new areas and habitats, which extends geographical ranges of species. The oldest traces of passive dispersal come from the Tertiary period, but it is thought to have existed also in the late Mesozoic. From an evolutionary point of view, the most interesting is the phoront-host relationship, as a result of co-evolution (e. g. Rhinoseius mites with hummingbirds) ...|$|E
40|$|Using an {{approach}} rooted in deconstructive close-reading and branching into pataphysics, this thesis studies, with {{and through the}} poetry of American modernist E. E. Cummings, ethical cultivations of aesthetics. First, a lover-beloved paradigm is unearthed in Cummings’s poetry, where love, a response to flaws, is the creative actualization of the world, others, and selves. Second, this love is extended (back) into poetry, using Cummings’s figures of birds—his “ornithopoeia,” the double movement of figuring the flesh and enfleshing the figure. Third, the ethico-aesthetic growth of the poet-reader, lover-beloved, and bird-figure is traced to a Taoist responsivity and eecological responsibility, using Cummings’s metaphor of the blossoming flower, or petalody. Cummings’s aversion to the nascent New Criticism allows this thesis to forage for an alternative to New Criticism’s sedentary offspring: namely, deconstruction and ubiquitous contemporary post-structuralist theory. It hybridizes Cummings’s poetry with ecocriticism, ancient and contemporary philosophy of love, ethics and theology, and biology. It holds binaries in suspension through Taoism and bends metaphysics back to physics through pataphysics, a science of exceptions and a poetics of vital matter. It explicates his entire oeuvre from poetry to personal correspondences, its inspirations and aspirations, its inventions and conventions, and its relevance on a still-modernist earth in the oily shadow of <b>ecocatastrophe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ways {{in which}} humans {{engage with the}} {{environment}} have always provided {{a rich source of}} material for writers and illustrators of Australian children's literature. Currently, readers are confronted with a multiplicity of complex, competing and/or complementing networks of ideas, theories and emotions that provide narratives about human engagement with the environment at a particular historical moment. This study, entitled Reading the Environment: Narrative Constructions of Ecological Subjectivities in Australian Children's Literature, examines how a representative sample of Australian texts (19 picture books and 4 novels for children and young adults published between 1995 and 2006) constructs fictional ecological subjects in the texts, and offers readers ecological subject positions inscribed with contemporary environmental ideologies. The conceptual framework developed in this study identifies three ideologically grounded positions that humans may assume when engaging with the environment. None of these positions clearly exists independently of any other, nor are they internally homogeneous. Nevertheless they can be categorised as: (i) human dominion over the environment with little regard for environmental degradation (unrestrained anthropocentrism); (ii) human consideration for the environment driven by understandings that humans need the environment to survive (restrained anthropocentrism); and (iii) human deference towards the environment guided by understandings that humans are no more important than the environment (ecocentrism). iv The transdisciplinary methodological approach to textual analysis used in this thesis draws on ecocriticism, narrative theories, visual semiotics, ecofeminism and postcolonialism to discuss the difficulties and contradictions {{in the construction of the}} positions offered. Each chapter of textual analysis focuses on the construction of subjectivities in relation to one of the positions identified in the conceptual framework. Chapter 5 is concerned with how texts highlight the negative consequences of human dominion over the environment, or, in the words of this study, living with <b>ecocatastrophe.</b> Chapter 6 examines representations of restrained anthropocentrism in its contemporary form, that is, sustainability. Chapter 7 examines representations of ecocentrism, a radical position with inherent difficulties of representation. According to the analysis undertaken, the focus texts convey the subtleties and complexities of human engagement with the environment and advocate ways of viewing and responding to contemporary unease about the environment. The study concludes that these ways of viewing and responding conform to and/or challenge dominant socio-cultural and political-economic opinions regarding the environment. This study, the first extended work of its kind, makes an original contribution to ecocritical study of Australian children's literature. By undertaking a comprehensive analysis of how texts for children represent human engagement with the environment at a time when important environmental concerns pose significant threats to human existence, I hope to contribute new knowledge to an area of children's literature research that to date has been significantly under-represented...|$|E
