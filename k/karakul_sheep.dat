Describes notable efforts to upgrade local Macina sheep for increased wool production by selection or cross-breeding with Merinos, increasing goat wool production by crossing imported Angora goats with locals and increasing pelt production by crossing the local long-haired Black Moor <b>sheep</b> with <b>Karakul</b> (Bokhara) <b>sheep.</b> Causes of the failure discussed...|$|R
25|$|Thar {{region of}} Rajasthan {{is the biggest}} wool-producing area in India. Chokla, Marwari, Jaisalmeri, Magra, Malpuri, Sonadi, Nali and Pungal breeds of sheep {{are found in the}} region. Of the total wool {{production}} in India, 40-50% comes from Rajasthan. The sheep-wool from Rajasthan is considered best for carpet making industry in the world. The wool of Chokla breed of sheep is considered of superior quality. The breeding centres have been developed for <b>Karakul</b> and Merino <b>sheep</b> at Suratgarh, Jaitsar and Bikaner. Some important mills for making Woolen thread established in desert area are: Jodhpur Woolen Mill, Jodhpur; Rajasthan Woolen Mill, Bikaner and India Woolen Mill, Bikaner. Bikaner is the biggest mandi (market place) of wool in Asia.|$|R

50|$|Baghlan's primary crops (as of 1974) were {{cotton and}} sugar beets, {{industrial}} sugar production having begun under Czech supervision in the 1940s. The area also produced grapes, pistachios, and pommegranates. The primary livestock are <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep.</b>|$|E
50|$|Karakul or Qaraqul (named after Qorako‘l, {{a city in}} Bukhara Province in Uzbekistan) is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep which originated in Central Asia. Some archaeological evidence points to <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> being raised there continuously since 1400 BC.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to detect polymorphism of butyrophilin (BTN) gene in sheep, cattle and buffalo, and to explore the nucleotide variability amongst them. Alu I, Hae III and Rsa I PCR-RFLP was carried out to reveal polymorphism at BTN gene spanning over part of exon 8 (502 bp). Alu I and Rsa I RFLP showed monomorohism at this locus while Hae III RFLP revealed polymorphism. In Hae III study, three genotypes, namely AA, BB and AB and two alleles A and B were found in sheep as well as in other species. The frequencies of the three genotypes AA, BB and AB in <b>Karakul</b> and Muzaffarnagari <b>sheep</b> were found as 0. 63, 0. 21 and 0. 16, and 0. 69, 0. 17 and 0. 14. In cattle and buffalo the frequencies were observed as 0. 81, 0. 15 and 0. 04, and 0. 75, 0. 14 and 0. 11 for AA, BB and AB genotypes, respectively. The frequencies of A and B allele in <b>Karakul</b> and Muzaffarnagari <b>sheep</b> were determined as 0. 71 and 0. 29, and 0. 76 and 0. 24, respectively. The allelic frequencies in cattle and buffalo were 0. 83 and 0. 17, and 0. 81 and 0. 19 for A and B allele, respectively. The nucleotides, which have been substituted from allele A to B, were found to be C to G (71 st nucleotide), C to T (86 th nucleotide), A to G (217 th nucleotide), G to A (258 th nucleotide), A to C (371 st nucleotide) and C to T (377 th nucleotide). The sequence variability between sheep and cattle was found at 143 rd, 179 th, 237 th, 371 st, 389 th, 418 th, 435 th and 469 th locations. The differences of nucleotides between sheep and buffalo were observed at 35 th, 143 rd, 170 th, 240 th, 282 nd, 389 th, 435 th and 469 th...|$|R
40|$|The molecular-genetic {{profiles}} {{from the}} determinant locus of scrapie {{have been described}} in the Botosani <b>Karakul</b> breed. <b>Sheep</b> belonged to two farm types: elite farm from Research and Development Station for Sheep and Goat Breeding, Popauti-Botosani and several production farms of some private farmers. The two farm types differ between them by selective specificities; in the farm elite the selection pressure is stronger and the selection criteria applied to sheep have been more accuracy than in the production farms. Sheep genotyping at the PrP locus was achieved by the Real-Time PCR method. By framing the individuals in risk classes concerning the prion disease, there were identified {{significant differences between the}} two farm types in terms of resistance / susceptibility to scrapie of sheep. The elite farm population is significantly advantaged as regards the molecular-genetic endowment at the PrP locus and low probability converting of the PrPc normal protein in the PrPSc pathogenic isomorph compared to the population of production farms. The reasons for the different associations of prion genotypes with morbid phenomenon intensity in the two farm types must be sought exclusively in the characteristics of selection systems applied to the animals in each farm type. From the standpoint of informational statistics, there is a high degree of genetic similarity at the PrP locus between the two populations. Contrary to expectations, the genetic diversity of prion structures is more developed in the elite farm than in the production farms. The knowing importance of prion profiles was revealed  in pursuit of genetic and veterinary prophylaxis of the sheep populations...|$|R
50|$|The town {{also used}} to be a centre for <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> farming, but this branch of {{agriculture}} has likewise been shrinking. Unemployment is high with only about 500 residents in possession of some sort of job. Alcohol abuse is common, particularly in the suburbs.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{husbandry}} {{constitutes a}} large part of Central Asian agriculture. Cattle, sheep, and poultry are the main animal species in agriculture, and breeding race horses is the pride of Turkmenistan. Some famous local breeds include the <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> and the Akhal-Teke horse. Some regions also cultivate mulberry trees and breed silkworms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> are a {{multi-purpose}} breed, {{kept for}} milking, meat, pelts, and wool. As a fat-tailed breed, {{they have a}} distinctive meat. Many adult Karakul are double-coated; in this case, people separate the coarse guard hair from the undercoat. Karakul is relatively coarse fiber used for outer garment, carpets and for felting.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 Willem Christoffel van Coller bought 33,000 {{hectares}} of {{land from the}} South West Administration (the government of Namibia at the time) {{for the purpose of}} farming <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep.</b> The land was previously an undeveloped area called Areb situated between the Ababis region to the South and the Koireb region to the North.|$|E
50|$|The town serves an {{agricultural}} area irrigated from the Qeysar River and also handles {{the trade in}} <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> with nomads. Maymana is an important livestock centre in Afghanistan. In the 1970s, the wool and cotton processing industry was booming in the city. Maymana is a market for leather goods, silk, carpets, wheat, barley, melons and grapes.|$|E
50|$|Traditional male {{clothing}} {{included a}} shirt, cloth pants, a wide red sash or belt, and a hat. The winter cap {{was made of}} <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> wool.

50|$|Although some tribal names, {{including}} Qureshi and Shaiboni {{are still}} remembered, {{most of the}} Arabs view genealogies as unimportant. Many of these Afghan Arabs work in the agricultural industry, often growing cotton and wheat while others raise <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep.</b> According to an academic, the Central Asian Arabs have not had any contact with Middle Eastern Arabs {{since the time of}} Tamerlane (circa 1400).|$|E
50|$|The {{disease was}} {{introduced}} to Iceland following an import of <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> from Germany in 1933. The susceptibility to maedi-visna infection varies across sheep breeds, with coarse-wool breeds apparently more susceptible than fine-wool sheep. Attempts at vaccination against maedi-visna virus have failed to induce immunity, occasionally causing increased viremia and more severe disease. Eradication programs have been established in countries worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{began in}} 1971 {{in the little}} place called Såne, at Esrum Lake, {{in the northern part}} of Zealand. To start with, Shropshire sheep were crossed with <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep.</b> The shropshire contributed with its size, plus the fact, that the shropshire is known for not eating twigs and bark of trees and shrubs, unlike most other sheep breeds, a feature that is somewhat preserved in the Såne-sheep. The <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> contributed with its good health qualities, its moderation and coat color. Since then, the norvegian Rygja sheep was added to increase stomach capacity, in order for it to better absorb large amounts of lean diet, and to a lesser extent to improve wool quality. The breed was officially approved in 1991. Since then the Suffolk-sheep, to a lesser extent, has been used in an attempt to reduce and prevent inbreeding. However, not all breeders recognize animals with Suffolk blood as being pure-blooded.|$|E
50|$|Buxoro Region has {{significant}} natural resources, especially natural gas, petroleum, graphite, bentonite, marble, sulfur, limestone, {{and raw materials}} for construction. The most developed industrial activities are oil refining, cotton ginning, textiles (including Uzbek ikat), and other light industry. Traditional Uzbek crafts such as gold embroidery, ceramics, and engraving have been revived. Bukhara Region {{is the center of}} <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> breeding and production of karakul pelts in Uzbekistan.|$|E
50|$|Hailing {{from the}} desert regions of Central Asia, <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> are renowned {{for their ability to}} forage and thrive under {{extremely}} harsh living conditions. They can survive severe drought conditions because of a special quality they have, storing fat in their tails. Karakul are also raised in large numbers in Namibia, having first been brought there by German colonists in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|In 1877 a {{community}} centre and a church {{was built on}} a section of Brits's farm. A private irrigation scheme was started by the Smartt Syndicate in 1885 and liquidated in 1954. The concern built two dams, planted lucerne and wheat. They grazed <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> and Clydesdale horses. In 1961, floods destroyed the Smartt Irrigation Board Dam and it was rebuilt {{by the government in}} 1964.|$|E
50|$|Namibia imports {{almost all}} of its goods from South Africa. Many exports {{likewise}} go to the South African market, or transit that country. Namibia's exports consist mainly of diamonds and other minerals, fish products, beef and meat products, <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> pelts, and light manufactures. In recent years, Namibia has accounted for about 5% of total SACU exports, and a slightly higher percentage of imports.|$|E
50|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{provided}} {{financial support}} to build and equip the Institute at Keldur but its original role was to respond to an epidemic in sheep that resulted from contact with <b>Karakul</b> (<b>sheep)</b> that had been imported into the country in 1933. The official date {{for the opening of}} The Institute at Keldur is November 15, 1948. The primary function of the institute is first and foremost to research veterinary diseases.|$|E
50|$|The Germans {{operated}} {{animal husbandry}} {{only to a}} small extent, because the resulting dung was not required due to the high soil fertility. Therefore, it was usually dried and used in the winter as fuel. Shepherding was more widespread, especially the fine-wooled <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep.</b> The men's traditional black skin caps were made from the wool. Poultry farming for self-sufficiency {{was a matter of}} course on each individual farm. Unlike other farming people, the Germans used horses instead of oxen for ploughing.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{different}} Russian papakhas. One, called a papaha, is a high fur hat, usually made of <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> skin. The hat has the general appearance of a cylinder with one open end, and is set upon the head {{in such a way}} as to have the brim touch the temples. Some of them come with ear flaps which can be folded up when not in use. The other called a kubanka, which is similar to the papaha, except shorter and with no ear flaps.|$|E

5000|$|Raimar von Hase began {{farming in}} 1975. He {{previously}} owned {{land in the}} Hardap Region near Uhlenhorst, where he bread <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep,</b> and other animal husbandry. This land was sold to the Namibian government in 2013. von Hase has been {{the leader of the}} Namibia Agricultural Union, which represents Namibia's farmers nationally since 2004. He replaced Jan de Wet, who had previously served since 1994. As leader of the NAU, von Hase adopted a conciliatory approach to national land reform, welcoming constitutional reforms. von Hase has also served as an honorary financial advisor to Namibian President Hage Geingob.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the largely}} white-dominated {{commercial}} sector, agriculture consists primarily of livestock ranching. There are about 4,000 commercial farms in Namibia, 3,000 {{of which are}} owned by whites. Cattle raising is predominant in the central and northern regions, while <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> and goat farming are concentrated in the more arid southern regions. Subsistence farming is mainly confined to the [...] "communal lands" [...] of the country's populous north, where roaming cattle herds are prevalent and the main crops are millet, sorghum, corn, and peanuts. Table grapes, grown mostly along the Orange River in the country's arid south, are becoming an increasingly important commercial crop and a significant employer of seasonal labor.|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} of land suitable for grazing has traditionally made animal husbandry {{an important part}} of the economy. There are two main types of animal husbandry: sedentary, practiced by farmers who raise both animals and crops; and nomadic, practiced by animal herders known as Kuchis. Natural pastures cover some 7500000 acre but are being overgrazed. The northern regions around Mazar-i-Sharif and Maymanah were the home range for about six million <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> in the late 1990s. Most flocks move to the highlands in the summer to pastures in the north. Oxen are the primary draft power and farmers often share animals for plowing. Poultry are traditionally kept in many houses, mostly in rural households.|$|E
50|$|Pelts of the <b>karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> bred in Bukhara {{and its environs}} are a {{traditional}} export commodity, but their contribution to total exports today is negligible. The production of karakul pelts dropped from 1.4 million pieces in 1990 to less than 700,000 pieces in 2004. Cattle, sheep, and chickens are raised for meat. There are 3 million cows in Uzbekistan, and they produce 5 million liters of milk per year. The achieved yields of around 1,600 kg of milk per cow per year are among {{the lowest in the}} CIS (compared to 2,500 kg per cow per year for Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova) and dismally low compared to those in the EU countries or North America. The low milk yields are attributable to insufficient feed and reluctance of peasants to use artificial insemination for breed improvement.|$|E
50|$|The steppes in the {{southern}} half of the desert are mostly made up of ranches run by Europeans, who raise <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> with local help and send the wool of the lambs to Europe for use in fur coats. Most {{of the rest of}} the desert is set aside for conservation. A vast portion of the desert, called the Sperrgebiet, was access-restricted due to the presence of diamonds, which are mined in the area at the mouth of the Orange River.Although the desert is largely unpopulated and inaccessible, there are year-round settlements at Sesriem, close to the famous Sossusvlei area, and other small outposts in other locations. Namibe in Angola, and Lüderitz, Walvis Bay and Swakopmund in Namibia, bordering on the desert, are the main settlements in the area.|$|E
50|$|Visna Maedi {{virus is}} a {{retrovirus}} meaning its genome {{consists of a}} (+)RNA that undergoes reverse transcription and then is integrated into the host's genome after infection. This integration is what leads to VMV's lifelong persistent infection. VMV has a long incubation period. During the initial outbreak among sheep in Iceland, {{there was no sign}} of clinical disease until six years after the importation of the <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep,</b> which brought the virus from Germany to Iceland. Susceptibility to infection also increases with a higher level. VMV infects cells of the monocyte lineage, but only replicates at high levels when the monocytes are more mature/differentiated. of maturity/differentiation of the monocytes. Infected differentiated monocytes, also known as macrophages, will continuously present VMV antigens inducing T-lymphocytes to produce cytokines that in turn induce the differentiation of monocytes.|$|E
50|$|The A4 Sheep Bank Project (A4SB) is {{a six-year}} project {{carried out by}} the MFLF in {{cooperation}} with the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development of Afghanistan (MRRD) and the Provincial Government of Balkh, together with the local community. The A4 Sheep Bank (A4SB) project reaches out to almost 500 households in 15 villages in Dehdadi and Nahr-e-shahe districts, Balkh Province. The goal of the project is to revive the Afghan <b>Karakul</b> <b>sheep</b> industry in order to strengthen rural livelihood, improve income and pave the way towards the creation of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) adding value to sheep by-products. The A4SB received initial funding from the Belgian Government, followed by the Royal Thai Government and MRRD’s National Area Based Development Program (NABDP), and most recently, from the Danish Embassy in Afghanistan through MRRD’s Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Program (AREDP).|$|E
