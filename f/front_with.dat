40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the monotonicity of transition fronts for bistable reaction-diffusion equations. Transition fronts generalize the standard notions of traveling fronts. Known examples of standard traveling fronts are the planar fronts and the <b>fronts</b> <b>with</b> conical-shaped or pyramidal level sets which are invariant in a moving frame. Other more general non-standard transition <b>fronts</b> <b>with</b> more complex level sets were constructed recently. In this paper, we prove the time monotonicity of all bistable transition <b>fronts</b> <b>with</b> non-zero global mean speed, whatever shape their level sets may have...|$|R

5|$|The Spanish Civil War, fought between 1936–39, {{provided}} an opportunity for many European countries to evaluate new technologies and tactics, including armored warfare. At {{the beginning of the}} war, the Nationalist and Popular Fronts each possessed only five World War I-era-design Renault FT light tanks, although these were soon reinforced with imported materiel. Italy began supplying Nationalist Spain with L3/35 tankettes in August 1936. The Soviet Union soon followed suit by supplying the Popular <b>Front</b> <b>with</b> T-26 light tanks in October 1936. Germany sent its first shipments of Panzer I light tanks to the Nationalist Front in September 1936. During the war, France and Poland provided the Popular <b>Front</b> <b>with</b> a number of additional FT light tanks. A considerable number of tanks delivered to the Popular Front were subsequently captured; many of these were put into service against their former owners.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Brezhnev was, like most middle-ranking Party officials, {{immediately}} drafted. He worked to evacuate Dnipropetrovsk's industries {{to the east}} of the Soviet Union before the city fell to the Germans on 26 August, and then was assigned as a political commissar. In October, Brezhnev was made deputy of political administration for the Southern <b>Front,</b> <b>with</b> the rank of Brigade-Commissar (Colonel).|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} <b>front,</b> <b>with</b> thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E

5|$|After {{service on}} the Western <b>Front</b> <b>with</b> the Royal Field Artillery during the Great War, Cockcroft studied {{electrical}} engineering at Manchester Municipal College of Technology. He then won a scholarship to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he sat the tripos exam in June 1924, becoming a wrangler. Ernest Rutherford accepted Cockcroft as a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory, and Cockcroft completed his doctorate under Rutherford's supervision in 1928. With Ernest Walton and Mark Oliphant he built {{what became known as}} a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Cockcroft and Walton used this to perform the first artificial disintegration of an atomic nucleus, a feat popularly known as splitting the atom.|$|E
5|$|As urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic {{churches were}} built to {{accommodate}} them. After {{the passing of}} the Catholic Relief Act, James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814–17). There was also growth in the Episcopal Church, which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816–18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816–18) and St David's (Ramshorn) (1824–26). In Glasgow, the Ramshorn Kirk's has a T-plan and symmetrical <b>front</b> <b>with</b> tall tower.|$|E

5|$|Both clubs {{lined up}} in a {{traditional}} 4–4–2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and left and right full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards. Wenger opted to pair Gilles Grimandi with Vieira in midfield and Wiltord up <b>front</b> <b>with</b> Henry, leaving Bergkamp on the substitutes' bench. Ashley Cole played in defence, ahead of Sylvinho, who did not feature in the matchday squad. For Liverpool, Houllier named Owen in the starting line-up, and chose Šmicer and Murphy to play in midfield. Gary McAllister, Patrik Berger and Fowler began the final as substitutes.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west <b>front,</b> <b>with</b> its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright wrote of the west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and has retained its painting from 1220.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the <b>front</b> <b>with</b> Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} morning hours, a cold <b>front</b> <b>with</b> several {{embedded}} low pressure areas extended from east Texas northeastward into the Ohio River Valley. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that morphed into a squall line. This line of severe thunderstorms {{would be responsible for}} tornado actitvity from late on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early in the morning, the squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through Louisiana and Mississippi, then proceeded to affect North and Central Alabama and parts of Middle and East Tennessee. The line strengthened as it moved through Alabama, due in part to a high amount of low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and increasing wind shear.|$|E
