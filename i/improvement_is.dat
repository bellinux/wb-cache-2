5|$|Adders execute integer {{addition}} {{in electronic}} digital computers, usually using binary arithmetic. The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> the carry skip design, again following human intuition; {{one does not}} perform all the carries in computing , but one bypasses the group of 9s and skips to the answer.|$|E
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> an active {{area of research}} in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs {{have been added to}} the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.|$|E

5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> longer (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and Bosch {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing flex vehicles to do a normal cold start at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by Bosch.|$|E

The <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate. Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by peeling of the skin. During this stage, a fluid overload state may occur; if it affects the brain, it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures. A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This {{is partly because}} the field {{is located in a}} remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E
