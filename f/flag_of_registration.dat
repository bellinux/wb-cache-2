40|$|In recent years, bulk {{carriers}} {{have been identified}} with high risks of catastrophic structural failure and foundering, and with heavy loss of human life. This study, based upon Lloyd's of London casualty records, identified four risk factors that had significant, independent effect upon {{the likelihood of a}} bulk carrier foundering. The risk of foundering increased with the age of the ship, and was related to the ship's <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b> Most importantly, however, increased risks were found for heavy cargoes of iron ore and scrap steel or iron, and for trading routes to the Far East and from Europe to North America. Additional safety measures, in particular regarding ship design and high-risk trades, may well be necessary to reduce the high casualty rates.

25|$|The Norwegian International Ship Register (NIS) {{was created}} on 1 July 1987. It {{allowed for a}} <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> {{convenience}} <b>registration</b> for ships in international traffic while remaining under Norwegian flag and jurisdiction. Instead of using the local registers, NIS was established as an office at Bergen Ship Register, part of the City Clerk in Bergen.|$|R
5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{choosing}} an open register are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use <b>of</b> <b>flags</b> <b>of</b> convenience lowers <b>registration</b> and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.|$|R
5000|$|Singapore is not {{regarded}} as a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> convenience country. Although the United Nations Convention for <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> Ships attempted to require a vessel's owners have a [...] "genuine link" [...] with the country <b>of</b> <b>registration,</b> the convention has never been ratified.|$|R
50|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country, called its flag state. A ship is bound to the law <b>of</b> its <b>flag</b> state. It is usual {{to say that the}} ship sails under the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> the country <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Bahamian flag {{is often}} used as a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> {{convenience}} by foreign merchant vessels. Under the Law on Merchant Shipping Act 1976 (amended in 1982), any domestic or foreign vessel - regardless of country of origin or place <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> - can be registered in the Bahamas [...] "without difficulty". [...] Furthermore, the ship's crew is not restricted by nationality and [...] "ordinary crew members" [...] have [...] "virtually no requirements for qualification". [...] This lack of regulation has led to ships flying <b>flags</b> <b>of</b> convenience - like the Bahamas' flag - having a reputation of possessing a [...] "poor safety record". [...] This came to light in November 2002, when a Greek oil tanker flying the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> the Bahamas split into two and sank in the Atlantic Ocean off the north-western Spanish coast. This produced an oil slick of 60,000 tons of petroleum.|$|R
40|$|According to the {{maritime}} norm, the {{nationality of ship}} is authorized with the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> ship by the state concerned, and the ship registered is allowed to fly the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> the state. The Japanese legislation for the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> ship requires that the nationality of the ship shall be genuinely linked with the nationality of owner(s) of the ship, and does not allow a bareboat chartered-out vessel to the foreign state to temporarily terminate the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the ship in Japan. Under the regime of EEZ, many Japanese far seas fishing vessels(FSFVs) were decommissioned or forced to transfer of ownership to the coastal state if they wanted continuation of fishing operation in the EEZ of coastal states concerned, which led drastic reduction of Japanese FSFVs. The UN Convention of the Law of the Sea(1982) which stipulates the status of ships in Article 92 does not regulate the linkage between nationality and ownership of ship, and the United Nations Convention on Conditions for <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> Ships(1986), while not in force, clearly recognizes the case <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the bareboat chartered-in ship. Some States(Canada, New Zealand, England, etc.) allow the bareboat chartered-in vessel to register it with their <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> ship. As the shortterm bareboat chartered-out {{would be one of}} breakthroughs for the plight of Japanese FSFVs loosing opportunity in the high seas, it is keenly requested that Japanese policy <b>of</b> ship <b>registration</b> allows temporary termination <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> Japanese ship for bareboat chartered-out...|$|R
