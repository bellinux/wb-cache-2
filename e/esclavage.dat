40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} oeuvre of Edouard Glissant (1928 - 2011), a prominent Martinican essayist, poet, novelist, playwright, philosopher, and theorist, {{who has played}} a considerable role in the emergence and recognition of French Caribbean literature as a whole. Through a central focus on his theoretical concept and literary expression of Antillanité, I analyze his poetic and political representation of contemporary Martinique and by extension the world in general, years after the “end” of the historic and historical events of slavery and colonialism. To give a more complete and updated assessment of the aftermath of these particular events, I examine his lesser known works published just {{before his death in}} 2011 namely Une nouvelle région du monde, Quand les murs tombent, Mémoires des <b>esclavages,</b> L’intraitable beauté du monde: Adresse à Barack Obama, Philosophie de la Relation, Les entretiens de Baton Rouge, Manifeste pour les produits de haute nécessité and Traité pour le Grand Dérangement. I argue that, in these “political interventions,” Glissant bridges the traditional divides between the poetic and the political, the theoretical and the practical, the aesthetical and the ethical, as well as the fictional and the realistic to re-actualize and give meaning to his main concepts and political ideologies presented in his previous foundational and far more widely read essays, treatises, novels, and manifestoes such as Le discours antillais, Poétique de la Relation, Traité du Tout-monde, Tout-monde, and Introduction à une poétique du Divers. In this dissertation, I redefine Glissant as a diasporic “poetician” who capitalizes on the événementiel to expose in an engaging and relatable fashion the controversial issues of identity, race, immigration, and globalization in our current world, which he imaginatively defines as a “Tout-monde. ” I examine his key theoretical notions of relation, imagination, intuition, and mondialité as centrally characteristic tropes, which he poetically and politically uses to challenge and propose alternatives to the “chaos” prevalent in the world in its totality from the West to the “Rest,” specifically in Africa, the French Caribbean archipelago, and France as respectively developed in the first, second, third and fourth chapters of this dissertation...|$|R

2500|$|The key {{component}} of Vichy's ideology was Anglophobia. In part, Vichy's virulent Anglophobia was due to its leaders' personal dislike of the British, as Marshal Pétain, Pierre Laval and Admiral François Darlan were all Anglophobes. As early as February 1936, Pétain had told the Italian Ambassador to France that [...] "England has always been France's most implacable enemy"; {{he went on to}} say that France had [...] "two hereditary enemies", namely Germany and Britain, with the latter being easily the more dangerous of the two; and he wanted a Franco-German-Italian alliance that would partition the British Empire, an event that Pétain claimed would solve all of the economic problems caused by the Great Depression. Beyond that, in order to justify both the armistice with Germany and the Révolution nationale, Vichy needed to portray the French declaration of war on Germany as a hideous mistake, and the French society under the Third Republic as degenerate and rotten. The Révolution nationale together with Pétain's policy of la France seule ("France alone") were meant to [...] "regenerate" [...] France from la décadence that was said to have destroyed French society and brought about the defeat of 1940. Such a harsh critique of French society could only generate so much support, and as such Vichy blamed French problems on various [...] "enemies" [...] of France, the chief of which was Britain, the [...] "eternal enemy" [...] that had supposedly conspired via Masonic lodges first to weaken France and then to pressure France into declaring war on Germany in 1939. No other nation was attacked as frequently and violently as Britain was in Vichy propaganda. In Pétain's radio speeches, Britain was always portrayed as the [...] "Other", a nation that was the complete antithesis of everything good in France, the blood-soaked [...] "perfidious Albion" [...] and the relentless [...] "eternal enemy" [...] of France whose ruthlessness knew no bounds. The chief themes of Vichy Anglophobia were British [...] "selfishness" [...] in using and abandoning France after instigating wars, British [...] "treachery" [...] and British plans to take over French colonies. The three examples that were used to illustrate these themes were the Dunkirk evacuation in May 1940, the Royal Navy attack at Mers-el-Kébir on the French Mediterranean fleet that killed over 1,300 French sailors in July 1940, and the failed Anglo-Free French attempt to seize Dakar in September 1940. Typical of Vichy anti-British propaganda was the widely distributed pamphlet published in August 1940 and written by self-proclaimed [...] "professional Anglophobe" [...] Henri Béraud titled Faut-il réduire l'Angleterre en <b>esclavage?</b> ("Should England Be Reduced to Slavery?"); the question in the title was merely rhetorical. Additionally, Vichy mixed Anglophobia with racism and antisemitism to portray the British as a racially degenerate [...] "mixed race" [...] working for Jewish capitalists, in contrast to the [...] "racially pure" [...] peoples on the continent of Europe who were building a [...] "New Order". In an interview conducted by Béraud with Admiral Darlan published in Gringoire newspaper in 1941, Darlan was quoted as saying that if the [...] "New Order" [...] failed in Europe it would mean [...] "...here in France, the return to power of the Jews and Freemasons subservient to Anglo-Saxon policy".|$|E

5000|$|The {{issue has}} been {{prominent}} on the French political agenda since the late 1990s, responding to international pressures on child prostitution and pornography and trafficking, international distinctions between forced and voluntary entry into prostitution (rejected by the dominant [...] "abolitionist" [...] discourse) and increasing migration. This {{has been accompanied by}} increasing discourse on la sécurité internally, which has gradually become dominant, affecting the framework in which prostitution is debated. This was heightened in 2002 when Jean-Pierre Raffarin's right-wing government (2002-2005) succeeded the Gauche Plurielle (plural left) coalition of Lionel Jospin (1997-2002). The Jospin construction was that prostitutes were victims and needed to be saved and re-integrated. This was a view shared by state feminists, ministers, delegates and the powerful abolitionist lobby and is reflected in the Derycke report as well as the National Commission on Violence Against Women, as well as the debates on modern slavery (<b>esclavage</b> moderne).These consultations in turn enabled agents of the civil society access to the policy process. Very few of these constructed prostitution as a legitimate form of work.|$|E

Although early abolitions were decided in Vermont, Pennsylvania, and then Saint-Domingue, in the 1780 s and 1790 s, the post-revolutionary period seems to have dampened abolitionist fervour in North America, {{with the notion of}} property prevailing over liberty.

40|$|In {{this short}} essay I {{am trying to}} present two {{different}} aspects of the women’s slavery in Europe during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Firstly in the case of Andalucia and south of Portugal, especially thanks to the recent thesis of Aurelia Martin Casares and Julio Izquierdo Labrado, and also thanks to the work of Vicenta Cortes Alonso and the excellent work, unfortunately not published, of Albert N’Damba, an catholic priest of Congo. The main outcome of this works is the obvious preference of the owners of slaves for the women and the prices of women are higher than the prices of the men. The motive is the productive ability of women. Secondly, I improve my investigations in the record offices of the Inquisitions of Malta and Sicily to point out the part of the corsairs in the trade of the human, especially the women proceeding from Russia, Greece, Central Europe.

40|$|Stephen Epstein {{is one of}} {{a growing}} group of {{scholars}} who are proposing a new interpretation of slavery in medieval and early modern Europe. The subject itself is not new. In the case of Italy, over the past century a few scholars have studied Italian slavery in local or regional studies, and it {{was the subject of a}} major work by Charles Verlinden (L <b>Esclavage</b> dans l Europe m di vale, vol. 2 : Italie olonies italiennes du Levant Levant latin Empire byzantine. Ghent: Rijsuniversiteit te Gent, 1977) and featured prominently in general surveys by Jacques Heers (Esclaves et domestiques au moyen ge dans le monde mediterranean. Paris: Fayard, 1981) and the present reviewer (Slavery from Roman Times to the Early Transatlantic Trade. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1985). Nevertheless, the historical profession has tended to ignore post-Roman slavery in the Mediterranean world, or to consider it either an attenuated relic from classical times or as a shadowy prelude to the great expansion of slavery in the colonial Americas. The numbers and percentages of slaves in Italy never approached those of true slave societies, in which more than 30 percent of the population was unfree. Common conclusions heretofore have been that slavery was not too important in the Italian economy, because most slaves were domestics; that slaves were not treated too harshly, because most lived in the households of their owners; and that slavery died out without leaving much of a trace in modern Italian society. ...|$|E
