The {{aim of this study}} was to utilize blood chemistry monitoring to establish the reference levels in a small prosimian primate, the <b>Grey</b> <b>Mouse</b> <b>Lemur</b> (Microcebus murinus). Method In the captive colony, mouse lemurs may live 10 – 12 years, and three age groups for both males and females were studied: young (1 – 3 years), middle-aged (4 – 5 years) and old (6 – 10 years). Blood biochemical markers were measured using the VetScan Comprehensive Diagnostic Profile. Because many life history traits of this primate are highly dependent on the photoperiod (body mass and reproduction), the effect of season was also assessed. Results The main effect of age was observed in blood markers of renal functions such as creatinine, which was higher among females. Additionally, blood urea nitrogen significantly increased with age and is potentially linked to chronic renal insufficiency, which has been described in captive mouse lemurs. The results demonstrated significant effects related to season, especially in blood protein levels and glucose rates; these effects were observed regardless of gender or age and were likely due to seasonal variations in food intake, which is very marked in this species.

The analysis of seven polymorphic microsatellite markers for 213 (130 males, 83 females) individuals allowed us to estimate relatedness coefficients and kinship relationships. Closely related males ranged further from each other than closely related females and natal males were found further from their potential mothers than were females. Natal males were more likely to disperse from their birth sites than females, although male dispersal was not universal. Male breeding dispersal was detected in half of the long-term observations. Males therefore seem to be the predominant vectors for gene flow between populations and social units. Females usually stayed within one to two home range diameters of their potential mother, facilitating the evolution of cooperative behaviour by kin selection among females. Most dispersal took place before the mating season, indicating an age of less than 7 months for natal dispersal. The analysis of spatiotemporal coexistence revealed the potential for inbreeding in only 3. 8 % of the potential mother–son dyads, but in 21. 9 % of the potential father–daughter dyads and in 41. 7 % of other closely related male–female dyads...|$|R

Torpor use was characterised by daily skin temperature profiles, and its energetic outcome was assessed from changes in body mass. Food shortage triggered torpor during {{the end of the}} gestation period (n[*]=[*] 1), ranging from shallow in response to 40 % food restriction to deep daily torpor in response to 80 % restriction. During the early period of lactation, females fed ad libitum (n[*]=[*] 2) or exposed to a 40 % restriction (n[*]=[*] 4) remained normothermic; but 80 % food restricted females (n[*]=[*] 5) gave priority to energy saving, increasing the frequency and depth of torpor bouts. The use of torpor was insufficient to compensate for 80 % energetic shortage during lactation resulting in loss of mass from the mother and delayed growth in the pups.

The effects of CR on these lemurs were compared with a potential mimetic, resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol naturally found in grapes. We hypothesized that both CR and RSV impact oxidative DNA and RNA damage compared to standard-fed control (CTL) animals. Adult (3 - 4 years old) male mouse lemurs were assigned to three dietary groups: a CTL group, a CR group receiving 30 % fewer calories than the CTL and a RSV group receiving the CTL diet supplemented with RSV (200 mg*day(- 1) *kg(- 1)). Oxidative stress was estimated after 3, 9, 15 and 21 months of treatment using the measurement of oxidized nucleosides in urine samples by mass spectrometry.

Contrary to our predictions, adult females had low-survival rates. Space sharing appeared to improve survival of both, mothers and daughters.

40|$|As {{ecosystems}} undergo changes worldwide, physiological {{flexibility is}} likely to be an important adaptive response to increased climate instability. Extreme weather fluctuations impose energetical constraints such as unpredictable food shortage. We tested how <b>grey</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus murinus) could adjust their daily heterothermy and locomotor activity to these 'energetic accidents' with a food restriction experiment. The experimental design consisted of acute calorie restriction (2 weeks, 80 % restriction) in the middle of winter, after a fattening season with low (11 weeks, 40 % restriction) versus high (ad libitum) food availability. This design aimed at simulating the combined effects {{of the quality of the}} fattening season (acclimation effect) and a sudden, severe food shortage during the lean season. Hour of start and duration of torpor were the most flexible components of energy savings, increasing in response to the acute food shortage with facilitation by chronic restriction (acclimation effect). Modulations of locomotor activity did not support the hypothesis of energy savings, as total locomotor activity was not reduced. Nonetheless, acutely restricted individuals modified their temporal pattern of locomotor activity according to former food availability. We provide the first experimental evidence of different temporal levels of flexibility of energy-saving mechanisms in a heterotherm exposed to food shortage. The acclimation effect of past food scarcity suggests that heterothermic organisms are better able to respond to unpredicted food scarcity during the lean season. The flexible control of energy expenditure conferred by heterothermy may facilitate the plastic response of heterothermic species to more frequent climatic hazards...|$|R

He would be even more impressed by the similarities if he had known what we have learned about primates over the last 50 years. Genetic kinship has emerged as the primary organizing force in the evolution of primate social organization and the patterning of social behaviour in non-human primate groups. There are pronounced nepotistic biases across the primate order, from tiny <b>grey</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus murinus) that forage alone at night but cluster with relatives to sleep during the day, to cooperatively breeding marmosets that rely on closely related helpers to rear their young, rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) females who acquire their mother's rank and form strict matrilineal dominance hierarchies, male howler monkeys that help their sons maintain access to groups of females and male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that form lasting relationships with their brothers. As more evidence of nepotism has accumulated, important questions about the evolutionary processes underlying these kin biases have been raised. Although kin selection predicts that altruism will be biased in favour of relatives, it is difficult to assess whether primates actually conform to predictions derived from Hamilton's rule: br > c. In addition, other mechanisms, including contingent reciprocity and mutualism, could contribute to the nepotistic biases observed in non-human primate groups. There are good reasons to suspect that these processes may complement the effects of kin selection and amplify the extent of nepotistic biases in behaviour...|$|R

Four- to five-year-old male <b>grey</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus murinus) were assigned to three dietary groups: a CTL group, a CR group receiving 30 % fewer calories than the CTL and a RSV group receiving the CTL diet supplemented with RSV (200 mg?day 21 ?kg 21).

No differences were found after a 21 -month period of treatment, except for lower glucose levels 30 min after glucose loading in CR animals.

40|$|Signals {{of recent}} spatial {{expansions}} in the <b>grey</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus murinus) SCHNEIDER, Nicole, et al. Background: Pleistocene events have shaped the phylogeography of many taxa worldwide. Their genetic signatures in tropical {{species have been}} much less explored than in those living in temperate regions. We analysed the genetic structure of a Malagasy primate species, a mouse lemur with a wide distribution (M. murinus), in order to investigate such phylogeographic processes on a large tropical island. We also evaluated the effects of anthropogenic pressures (fragmentation/deforestation) and natural features (geographic distance, rivers) on genetic structure in order to complement our understanding {{of past and present}} processes of genetic differentiation. Results: The analysis of the mitochondrial D-loop sequences of 195 samples from 15 study sites (10 from a continuous forest and five from isolated forest fragments) from two adjacent Inter-River-Systems (IRSs) revealed that forest fragmentation and the river restrict gene flow, thereby leading to an increased genetic differentiation between populations beyond the effect of isolation-by-distance. Demographic simulations detected signals of two successive spatial [ [...] . ] SCHNEIDER, Nicole, et al. Signals of recent spatial expansions in the grey mouse lemu...|$|E
40|$|A bulk {{of studies}} in rodents and humans suggest that sleep {{facilitates}} different phases {{of learning and}} memory process, while sleep deprivation (SD) impairs these processes. Here we tested the hypothesis that SD could alter spatial learning and memory processing in a non-human primate, the <b>grey</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus murinus), which is an interesting model of aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Two sets of experiments were performed. In a first set of experiments, we investigated the effects of SD on spatial learning and memory retrieval after one day of training in a circular platform task. Eleven male mouse lemurs aged between 2 to 3 years were tested in three different conditions: without SD as a baseline reference, 8 h of SD before the training and 8 h of SD before the testing. The SD was confirmed by electroencephalographic recordings. Results showed no effect of SD on learning when SD was applied before the training. When the SD was applied before the testing, it induced an increase {{of the amount of}} errors and of the latency prior to reach the target. In a second set of experiments, we tested the effect of 8 h of SD on spatial memory retrieval after 3 days of training. Twenty male mous...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{prevalence}} of diabetes and hyperinsulinemia increases with age, inducing metabolic failure and limiting lifespan. Calorie restriction (CR) without malnutrition delays the aging process, but its long-term application to humans seems difficult. Resveratrol (RSV), a dietary polyphenol, {{appears to be}} a promising CR mimetic that can be easily administered in humans. In this work, we hypothesized that both CR and RSV impact insulin sensitivity in a non-human primate compared to standard-fed control (CTL) animals. Four- to five-year-old male <b>grey</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus murinus) were assigned to three dietary groups: a CTL group, a CR group receiving 30 % fewer calories than the CTL and a RSV group receiving the CTL diet supplemented with RSV (200 mg*day(- 1) *kg(- 1)). Insulin sensitivity and glycemia were assessed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index) evaluation after 21 or 33 months of chronic treatment. Resting metabolic rate was also measured to assess the potential relationships between this energy expenditure parameter and insulin sensitivity markers. No differences were found after a 21 -month period of treatment, except for lower glucose levels 30 min after glucose loading in CR animals. After 33 months, CR and RSV decreased glycemia after the oral glucose loading without decreasing fasting blood insulin. A general effect of treatment was observed on the HOMA-IR index, with an 81 % reduction in CR animals and 53 % in RSV animals after 33 months of treatment compared to CTL. Chronic CR and dietary supplementation with RSV affected insulin sensitivity by improving the glucose tolerance of animals without disturbing their baseline insulin secretion. These results suggest that both CR and RSV have beneficial effects on metabolic alterations, although these effects are different in amplitude between the two anti-aging treatments and potentially rely on different metabolic changes...|$|R
