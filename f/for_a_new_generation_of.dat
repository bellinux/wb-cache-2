5|$|The {{writing of}} Roa Bastos spans four countries, six decades, and countless genres. In his {{lifetime}} he made important contributions to Latin American Boom writing, to the related Dictator Novel, {{and to the}} Nuevo Cine film movement through screenplays like Alias Gardelito (1961). Roa Bastos' influence {{can be found in}} the works of many foreign post-boom writers, including Mempo Giardinelli, Isabel Allende, Eraclio Zepeda, Antonio Skármeta, Saul Ibargoyen, and Luisa Valenzuela. The most important author to come out of Paraguay, he also remains highly influential <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Paraguayan authors. Roa Bastos' relationship with his country, unbroken by over 40 years of exile, was considered so important that in 1989 he was invited back by Paraguay's new president, Andrés Rodríguez, following the collapse of the Stroessner regime.|$|E

That new leadership came from a group of members affiliated with the Revolutionary Union, a Marxist–Leninist-Maoist organization, which later became Venceremos. In 1970, it took control of the MFU, repudiated its preamble and re-organized its newsletter. Enrollment fell to 700 in 1970 and to 70 by 1971; in July the MFU was disbanded.|$|E

Chicago construction worker Marc Smith turned urban poetry performance into audience-judged competitions in 1984. Poetry slams emphasize a style of writing that is topical, provocative and easily understood. Poetry slam opened the door <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> writers and spoken word performers, including Alix Olson, Apollo Poetry, Taylor Mali, and Saul Williams, and inspired hundreds of open mics across the country.|$|E

Ralph Nader, in a brief appearance, points out that auto makers usually only respond to government regulation {{when it comes to}} important advances whether seat belts, airbags, catalytic converters, mileage requirements or, by implication, hybrid/electric cars. The film suggests Toyota supported the production of Toyota Prius hybrid in part as a response to Bill Clinton's Partnership <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>Generation</b> <b>of</b> Vehicles and other U.S. Government pressure that was later dropped.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, European air forces began to {{consider}} their requirements for the coming decades. One such area of consideration was the requirement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> jet-powered trainer aircraft to replace such aircraft as the US-built Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star and French-built Fouga Magister. Britain and France established a collaborative program to pursue development of what was initially intended to become a supersonic jet aircraft. This aircraft was to be produced in two distinct variants for different roles: trainer and light attack aircraft. The result of this collaboration, the SEPECAT Jaguar, {{proved to be an}} excellent aircraft, but its definition had changed in the interim, and the type emerged as a full-sized, nuclear-capable strike fighter, whose two-seat variants were used for operational conversion to the type. As such, the Jaguar was not well suited for the general training mission.|$|E
