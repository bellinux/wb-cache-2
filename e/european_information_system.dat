40|$|Executive summary European {{markets for}} organic {{products}} are growing rapidly, {{but the market}} information available in most European countries is woefully inadequate. Often only very basic data such as certified organic holdings and land area are reported, and sometimes not even individual crop areas or livestock numbers. Important market data, such {{as the amount of}} production, consumption, international trade or producer and consumer prices, do not exist in most European countries. In some European countries there are only rough estimates of the levels of production and consumption. There is no standardisation and data are seldom comparable. Furthermore, detailed information on specific commodities is missing. Hence, investment decisions are taken under conditions of great uncertainty. Policy evaluation, including periodic monitoring of the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming and RDP 2007 - 2013, will require many other data in addition to those regarding production structures and financial data that are already available, but obtaining this information would require a new EU-wide data collection and processing system (DCPS) to be put in place. The <b>European</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> for Organic Markets (EISfOM) project is an EUfunded Concerted Action which has analysed and documented the current situation and proposed ways in which organic data collection and processing systems (DCPS) can be improved by means of: • improvement in the current situation of data collecting and processing systems for the organic sector • innovation in data collection and processing systems for the organic sector • integration of conventional and organic data collection and processing systems This report summarises the most relevant findings of the EISfOM project, which are analysed in the main project reports: Wolfert, S., Kramer, K.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{foster the}} {{development}} of a privacy-protective, sustainable cross-border information system in the framework of a European public health project. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A targeted privacy impact assessment was implemented to identify the best architecture for a <b>European</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> for diabetes directly tapping into clinical registries. Four steps were used to provide input to software designers and developers: a structured literature search, analysis of data flow scenarios or options, creation of an ad hoc questionnaire and conduction of a Delphi procedure. RESULTS: The literature search identified a core set of relevant papers on privacy (n = 11). Technicians envisaged three candidate system architectures, with associated data flows, to source an information flow questionnaire that was submitted to the Delphi panel for the selection of the best architecture. A detailed scheme envisaging an "aggregation by group of patients" was finally chosen, based upon the exchange of finely tuned summary tables. CONCLUSIONS: Public health information systems should be carefully engineered only after a clear strategy for privacy protection has been planned, to avoid breaching current regulations and future concerns and to optimise {{the development of}} statistical routines. The BIRO (Best Information Through Regional Outcomes) project delivers a specific method of privacy impact assessment that can be conveniently used in similar situations across Europe...|$|E

Data standards and mechanisms for their adoption can be laid down in the MIRRI infrastructure partner charter ensuring conformity and delivery of the envisaged MIRRI Information System. There remain a number of steps to deliver the MIRRI Information System beginning with the evaluation of existing software and tools for its construction. Further work on the scope of the MIRRI Information System will examine interoperability between collections’ data and other relevant data sets outside collections. There is a clear requirement to follow common data management standards, including adopting common ontologies, or vocabularies, if the Information System construction is to be successful. CC staff have developed standards for data management in the EU-FP 7 project EMbaRC (European Consortium of Microbial Resource Centres) and in the GBRCN (Global Biological Resource Centre Network). These standards will be assessed in the context of the envisaged MIRRI Information System.|$|E
40|$|European {{markets for}} organic {{products}} are growing rapidly, {{but the market}} information available in most European countries is seriously limited {{as a basis for}} investment and policy decisions. The EU was therefore funding a three-year concerted action EISfOM (<b>European</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> of Organic Markets) to analyse the current situation in 32 countries and to develop proposals to improve the quality and the volume of a European wide organic production and market data collection to support the development of a sector which offers significant potential for further growth as well as environmental and economic benefits. One area of data collection is related to the consumption of organic food. Presently no official organic consumption and consumer price statistics exist at European level. However, there are manifold national approaches to get access to organic consumption data in terms of volumes and values mostly operated by private household panel approaches. The main barrier is related to a missing European approach to harmonise the different specifications and classifications which would be enable a cross country comparison of data. As user requirements and costs for different approaches differ as a minimum standard a European wide definition of key indicators for organic consumption and methods for national data output harmonisation should be developed. ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{situation}} of market information systems on organic farming in Europe shows a substantial lack of information. Although previous EU-research {{projects such as}} OFCAP (FAIR 3 -CT 96 - 1794) and OMIaRD (QLK 5 - 2000 - 01124) have shown that regional or national data gathering takes place in many countries, the availability of detailed and current data on various levels, such as production, consumption, prices as well as trade, on the national {{as well as at}} the European level, is not satisfactory. The main problem areas identified in regard to market information systems for organic farming can be summarised as i) the lack of market information at the national level and ii) where data are available, the lack of data harmonisation at the European level. Within the EU-funded concerted action EISfOM (<b>European</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> for Organic Markets, QLK 5 - 2002 - 02400), the aim is to build a framework for reporting valid and reliable production and market data for the European organic sector in order to meet the needs of policymakers, farmers, processors, wholesalers and other actors involved in organic markets. Based on the previous research done in Workpackages 2, 3 and 4, this report focuses on the evaluation of pilot case studies in eight European countries, showing proposals for new and/or enlarged data collection and processing systems for organic markets in Europe. This report is based mainly on the pilot application studies conducted in WP 5. Following the description of objectives and the general approach of WP 5 in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 focuses on the national pilot case studies, including a description of the relevant institutions and DCPS as well as an assessment of data quality. Chapter 3 provides an analysis of the DCPS investigated with regard to the problems and barriers involved with their practical implementation. Chapter 4 then analyses the critical points identified with regard to potential solutions for harmonisation of various DCPS at the national and international level. Chapter 5 deals with the analysis of the recommendations made in WP 4, while Chapter 6 summarizing and concluding the results. As well as the national working papers on the results of the pilot application studies, this deliverable is also strongly linked to previous project deliverables, namely D 2 “WP 2 : Data collection and processing systems for conventional markets and WP 3 : Data collection and processing systems for organic markets” (Wolfert, S. et al., 2004), deliverable D 3 “Report on proposals for the development, harmonisation and quality assurance of organic data collection and processing systems. systems (Recke, G. et al., 2004) and the proceedings of the first European Seminar “Development of a <b>European</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> for organic markets – improving the scope and quality of statistical data” (Recke, G. et al., 2004) ...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesAminoindanes (“bath salts,” a {{class of}} novel psychoactive substances, NPSs) {{increased}} rapidly in popularity on the recreational drug market, particularly after mephedrone and other synthetic cathinones were banned in the UK in 2010. Novel aminoindanes continue to emerge, but relatively {{little is known about}} their effects and risks. Their history, chemistry, pharmacology, behavioral effects, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity are reviewed in this paper. MethodsScientific literature was searched on ISI Web of Knowledge: Web of Science (WoS) during June and July 2017, using English language terms: aminoindanes such as 5, 6 -methylenedioxy- 2 -aminoindane (MDAI), 5 -iodo- 2 -aminoindane (5 -IAI), 2 -aminoindane (2 -AI), 5, 6 -methylenedioxy-N-methyl- 2 -aminoindane (MDMAI), and 5 -methoxy- 6 -methyl- 2 -aminoindane (MMAI). WoS was selected as it searches several databases simultaneously and has quality criteria for inclusion. For typical use and effects, Erowid, PsychonautWiki, Bluelight, and Drugs-Forum were searched; for legal status and epidemiology, the <b>European</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> and Database on New Drugs (EDND) was used. ResultsAminoindanes were first synthesized for medical use, e. g., as anti-Parkinsonian drugs and later as a potential compound facilitating psychotherapy; however, they are now widely substituted for ecstasy. Their mechanisms of action (primarily via serotonin) mean that they may pose a significant risk of serotonin syndrome at high doses or when combined with other drugs. Fatally toxic effects have been observed both in the laboratory in animal studies and in clinic, where deaths related with aminoindanes have been reported. ConclusionGreater knowledge about aminoindanes is urgently required to decrease risks of fatal intoxication, and appropriate legislation is needed to protect public health without impeding research...|$|E

We assessed the network of forests areas managed for the dynamic {{conservation of}} FGR (conservation units) across Europe (33 countries). On the basis of information available in the <b>European</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> on FGR (EUFGIS Portal), species distribution maps, and environmental stratification of the continent, we developed ecogeographic indicators, a marginality index, and demographic indicators to assess and monitor forest conservation efforts. The pan-European network has 1967 conservation units, 2737 populations of target trees, and 86 species of target trees. We detected a poor coincidence between FGR conservation and other biodiversity conservation objectives within this network. We identified 2 complementary strategies: a species-oriented strategy in which national conservation networks are specifically designed for key target species and a site-oriented strategy in which multiple-target units include so-called secondary species conserved within a few sites. The network is highly unbalanced in terms of species representation, and 7 key target species are conserved in 60 % of the conservation units. We performed specific gap analyses for 11 tree species, including assessment of ecogeographic, demographic, and genetic criteria. For each species, we identified gaps, particularly in the marginal parts of their distribution range, and found multiple redundant conservation units in other areas. The Mediterranean forests {{and to a lesser}} extent the boreal forests are underrepresented. Monitoring the conservation efficiency of each unit remains challenging; however, < 2 % of the conserved populations seem to be at risk of extinction.

This paper contributes to this discussion by further developing the profile of <b>European</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> (IS) research that was reported on following the first ten years of the <b>European</b> Conference on <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> (ECIS). It is timely, in that ECIS celebrates its 20 th anniversary this year. As with the earlier articles, this paper reflects on European IS research, as presented at ECIS, but this time it concentrates on the second decade, in comparison with the first. Based on an analysis of all papers published in ECIS proceedings during the period 2003 - 2012, the paper highlights key research topics, research approaches adopted and key references used by ECIS authors. By comparing these data with the first ten years of ECIS (i. e., the period 1993 - 2002), it provides some evidence of emerging (and declining) trends over the 20 -year history of ECIS...|$|R
