5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.|$|E

25|$|The horses of Oldenburg <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> State Stud, {{and they}} first gained {{recognition}} under Anton Günther (1583–1667), Count of Oldenburg, who {{is said to}} have taken great personal interest in the breeding of horses. Count Anton Günther returned from a trip lasting several years with a number of horses he admired in Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Poland. Later, a gift of Oldenburg horses kept the Count of Tilly from sacking Anton Günther's dominion.|$|E

25|$|In a {{distributive}} negotiation, {{each side}} often adopts an extreme position, knowing {{it will not}} be accepted—and then uses a combination of guile, bluffing, and brinkmanship to cede as little as possible before reaching a deal. Distributive bargainers conceive of negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value. A distributive negotiation often involves people who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> previous interactive relationship, nor are they likely to do so again in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Genetics: alleles {{associated}} with aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and flushing phenotypes (alcohol flush reaction) in Asians are known genetic {{factors that influence}} alcohol tolerance {{and the development of}} hangover effects. Existing data shows that drinkers with genotypes known to lead to acetaldehyde accumulation are more susceptible to hangover effects. The fact that about 25% of heavy drinkers claim that they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hangover is also an indication that genetic variation plays a role in individual differences of hangover severity.|$|E
25|$|Berkshire's class A shares {{sold for}} $281,000.00 , making them the highest-priced shares on the New York Stock Exchange, {{in part because}} they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stock split and have only paid a {{dividend}} once since Warren Buffett took over, retaining corporate earnings on its balance sheet {{in a manner that is}} impermissible for mutual funds. Shares closed over $100,000 for the first time on October 23, 2006. Despite its size, Berkshire had for many years not been included in broad stock market indices such as the S 500 due to the lack of liquidity in its shares; however, following a 50-to-1 split of Berkshire's class B shares in January 2010, and Berkshire's announcement that it would acquire the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, parent of BNSF Railway, Berkshire replaced BNSF in the S 500 on February 16, 2010.|$|E

25|$|Brady was {{a lightly}} {{regarded}} prospect {{coming out of}} college, and was selected by the New England Patriots with the 199th overall pick in the sixth round of 2000 NFL Draft. He has subsequently played his entire professional career with the Patriots and has enjoyed a distinguished and decorated career that includes five Super Bowl wins, four Super Bowl MVPs, and two League MVPs. As {{a result of his}} highly successful career, Brady is rated among the greatest quarterbacks of all time. In addition to his other accolades, he has been named to the Pro Bowl twelve times and led the league in passing three times. He holds numerous NFL post-season passing records, and has more post-season wins than any other quarterback. Since Brady became their starting quarterback, the Patriots <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> losing season and have won 14 division titles. The Patriots played in eleven AFC Championship Games from 2001 to 2016—including six in a row from 2011 to 2016—and won seven of them.|$|E
25|$|Charlie and Itchy live in San Francisco as {{guardian}} angels. In each episode, {{they are}} given an assignment by Anabelle but, while they {{try to do the}} right thing, they become caught {{up in the middle of}} awkward situations. Charlie’s callous enemy Carface and his sidekick, Killer (from the first film), also appeared in the series, as did Charlie’s friends: the dog Sasha, the dog-angel Anabelle, and the human kid David. Finally, the series also featured two new characters named Bess, a pure bred award winning show dog and Itchy's love interest, and Belladonna, Anabelle's demonic cousin. The series makes several changes to the second film. For example, Charlie and Sasha were shown as being a couple at the end of the second film, however, in the series, they seem to <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> first date together; also, Itchy decides to stay in Heaven, but he is alive in the series, although it is explained later in the series why he is on Earth instead of being in Heaven.|$|E

500|$|In baseball, hitting for {{the cycle}} is the {{accomplishment}} of one batter hitting a single, a double, a triple, and a {{home run in the}} same game. Collecting the hits in that order is known as a [...] "natural cycle". Cycles are rare in Major League Baseball (MLB), and have occurred only 311 times since the first by Curry Foley in 1882. The most recent example was accomplished by José Abreu of the Chicago White Sox on September 9, 2017, against the San Francisco Giants. To this day, the Miami Marlins are the only MLB franchise who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> player perform the feat.|$|E
500|$|Neval later {{explained}} [...] "My {{initial reaction}} to the part was surprise as Neighbours <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> gay character. But {{the nature of the}} character never really bothered me. My only real concern was that the story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. She's not a stereotypical character and being gay is certainly not the only interesting thing about her." [...] Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004. In April 2005, Eliza Taylor-Cotter said that she had originally auditioned for the role of Lana, before joining the cast as Janae Timmins.|$|E
500|$|The English celebrity cook Fanny Cradock asserted: [...] "The English <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cuisine. Even Yorkshire pudding {{comes from}} Burgundy." [...] Nicola Humble {{observed}} that in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, {{there are about}} the same number of recipes from India as from Wales, Scotland and Ireland together. Panayi created controversy by asserting, with evidence, that fish and chips had foreign origins: the fried fish from Jewish cooking, the potato chips from France; the dish only came to signify national identity from about 1930. French cuisine powerfully influenced English cooking throughout the nineteenth century, and French celebrity chefs such as the Roux brothers and Raymond Blanc continue to do so in twentyfirst century England.|$|E

500|$|Until 2002, the Bonannos {{had been}} the only family in the modern history of the New York Mafia (i. e., since the Castellammarese War) to <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> made man turn {{informant}} or government witness. [...] Massino used this as a point of pride to rally his crime family. That year Frank Coppa, convicted on fraud and facing further charges from the FBI's forensic accounting investigation, became the first to flip. He was followed shortly by acting underboss Richard Cantarella, a participant in the Mirra murder, who was facing racketeering and murder charges. A third, Joseph D'Amico, subsequently turned state's evidence with the knowledge that Cantarella could implicate him for murder as well. All of these defections left Massino, at last, vulnerable to serious charges.|$|E
500|$|With {{decreasing}} album {{sales and}} a lack of commercially successful singles, Cher decided to further develop her acting career. While she had previously aspired to venture into film, she had only the critically and commercially unsuccessful movies Good Times and Chastity to her credit, and the Hollywood establishment did not take her seriously as an actress. She moved to New York in 1982 to take acting lessons with Lee Strasberg, founder of the Actors Studio, but never enrolled after her plans changed. She auditioned for and was signed by director Robert Altman for the Broadway stage production Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, playing a member of a James Dean fan club holding a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the film adaptation of the same title. Cher credits Altman for launching her acting career: [...] "Without Bob [...] I would <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> film career. Everyone told him not to cast me... I am convinced that Bob {{was the only one who}} was brave enough to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{regarded}} as favourites and their team included many players who had experienced success in the competition. The most notable was captain Paolo Maldini, who had won the competition four times previously, all with Milan, and Clarence Seedorf who had won the competition three times with three different clubs. Liverpool had been considered underdogs throughout the competition, but had beaten more favoured opposition, including Juventus and Chelsea, to reach the final. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez acknowledged this: [...] "Maybe Milan are favourites, but we have confidence, and we can win". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger felt Liverpool would win the match: [...] "I fancy Liverpool as Milan look jaded physically and certainly mentally, by losing the [...] title, I think they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> better chance than now to beat Milan." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not so optimistic, stating that the Liverpool side were {{not as good as}} the one that had won the 2001 UEFA Cup Final: [...] "No disrespect to the squad we have got now but it is obvious we are not as strong as we were when we won the UEFA Cup in 2001. Back then we had a settled team and that season when we went into games against Barcelona and Roma, we always felt we were as good as them." ...|$|E
