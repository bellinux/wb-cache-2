5|$|Between 1297 and 1298, Edward {{was left}} as regent {{in charge of}} England while the King campaigned in Flanders against Philip IV, who had {{occupied}} part of the English King's lands in Gascony. On his return, Edward <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> a peace treaty, under which he took Philip's sister, Margaret, as his wife and agreed that Prince Edward would in due course marry Philip's daughter, Isabella, who was then only two years old. In theory, this marriage {{would mean that the}} disputed Duchy of Gascony would be inherited by a descendant of both Edward and Philip, providing a possible end to the long-running tensions. The young Edward seems to have got on well with his new stepmother, who gave birth to Edward's two half-brothers, Thomas of Brotherton and Edmund of Woodstock, in 1300 and 1301. As king, Edward later provided his brothers with financial support and titles.|$|E

But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

5|$|Though not {{resident}} {{in the two}} boys' household, Edward I had taken great interest in the princes' upbringing and well-being. Before he died, the king had promised to provide Edmund with substantial grants of land. In August 1306, Edward <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> a charter promising Edmund land worth 7000 marks a year, and in May 1307, 1000 marks was added to this. He probably intended to give the earldom of Norfolk to Thomas, while Edmund would receive the earldom of Cornwall, which had been left vacant after Edward I's cousin Edmund died without children in 1300. When Edward II came to the throne, however, he went against his father's wishes by granting the earldom of Cornwall to his favourite Piers Gaveston. According to the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi, this act was a grave insult to the king's younger brothers. Edward II nevertheless took steps to provide his half-brother with an income; grants made in 1315 and 1319 secured Edmund 2000 marks a year. In May 1321, Edmund received the strategically important Gloucester Castle, and further grants followed his creation as Earl of Kent on 28 July 1321.|$|E
25|$|Their {{convictions}} in the U.S. District Court, {{on appeal}} {{at the time}} <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> the pardons, grew out of their good-faith belief that their actions were necessary to preserve the security interests of our country. The record demonstrates that they acted not with criminal intent, but {{in the belief that}} they had grants of authority reaching to the highest levels of government.|$|E
25|$|With the Revolution the {{fortress}} became national property and {{was no longer}} maintained. In 1804 {{the fortress}} was ceded to the hospice d'Uzès as compensation for other property that had been confiscated and sold. Although the hospice {{had no interest in}} the monument, in 1808 the Gard préfecture refused to allow it to be put up for sale and as a result the monument became a ruin and was vandalised. A hole in the wall of the tower was used to anchor the chain ferry that carried passengers across the Rhone. From 1821 the commune of Villeneuve rented the monument from the hospice until finally in 1842 the French king, Louis Philippe <b>I,</b> <b>signed</b> a bill authorising the commune to acquire the tower and its dependencies.|$|E

25|$|On 27 October 1807, Charles IV and Napoleon <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> the Treaty of Fontainebleau, {{which allowed}} {{the passage of}} French troops through Spanish {{territory}} to join the Spanish troops and invade Portugal, which had refused to obey the order of international blockade against England. As this was happening, there was the Mutiny of Aranjuez (17 March 1808), by which the crown prince, Ferdinand VII, replaced his father as king. However, when Ferdinand VII returned to Madrid, the city was already occupied by Joachim-Napoléon Murat, so that both the king and his father were virtually prisoners of the French army. Napoleon, {{taking advantage of the}} weakness of the Spanish Bourbons, forced both, first the father then the son, to join him in Bayonne, where Ferdinand arrived on 20 April.|$|E
25|$|By {{moving into}} the Rhineland, Louis dispelled fears in the Dutch Republic of a {{possible}} attack upon them, thus facilitating Prince William of Orange’s invasion of England in November. William’s success in the subsequent ‘Glorious Revolution’ – leading to his accession to the English throne in February 1689 (reigning jointly with his wife Mary) – enabled him to bring the full commercial and military power of England into the war against France, and rapidly {{led to the formation}} of the coalition he had long desired. On 12 May 1689, the Dutch and Emperor Leopold <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> the Grand Alliance, the aims of which were no less than to force France back to her borders as they were at the end of the Thirty Years War, and the Franco-Spanish War, thus depriving Louis of all his gains since his assumption of power.|$|E
25|$|Eugene's victory {{had given}} him {{effective}} control of the whole Po valley. Although the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice remained in Bourbon hands, Victor Amadeus eventually took possession {{of most of the}} territories promised him in the 1703 treaty with the Emperor. However, the Allied victories in 1706 had failed to dampen the growing animosity within the Grand Alliance as English and Dutch ministers blamed Joseph I for refusing to end the war in Hungary. Rákóczi's uprising was diverting vital Austrian resources from the fight with Louis XIV, and there were also fears the Ottoman Turks would take advantage to renew hostilities against the Emperor. Conversely, the Maritime Powers' sympathetic stance towards the rebellion's leader and co-religionist remained a source of bitterness in Vienna. To compound their disagreements, Joseph <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> the Convention of Milan on 13 March 1707, by which terms Louis XIV surrendered northern Italy in exchange for the safe passage of Medavy's army back to France. For the Austrians, the agreement assured their full uncontested possession of the Duchy of Milan and the Duchy of Mantua, but it also enabled Joseph I to pursue his dynastic interests in southern Italy, and in May Count Daun, with about 10,000 men, moved south to the Kingdom of Naples. The city of Naples surrendered without resistance and Gaeta fell after a siege on 30 September. Austria was now the predominant power in Italy, and Charles III was proclaimed King of Naples.|$|E

500|$|Wałęsa {{has offered}} {{conflicting}} statements regarding {{the authenticity of}} the documents. Initially he has appeared to come close to an admission, saying in 1992, [...] "in December 1970, <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> three or four documents" [...] to escape from the secret police. In his 1987 autobiography A Way of Hope, Wałęsa said, [...] "It is also the truth that I had not left that clash completely pure. They gave me a condition: signature! And then I signed." [...] He denies he acted upon the collaboration agreement. However, in his later years Wałęsa said all the documents are forgeries and told BBC in 2008, [...] "you will not find any signature of mine agreeing to collaborate anywhere".|$|E
500|$|Brown {{was also}} a tough {{negotiator}} over salaries, often refusing to give players raises despite strong performance. He was called [...] "cold and brutal" [...] by sportswriters, and told players to be [...] "ready to fight for your financial lives". [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> with Paul, he felt that $1,000 was $10 million", said Gene Hickerson, a guard who played for the Browns in the late 1950s and 1960s. Brown's stingy approach to salaries frustrated his players and was a motivating force behind {{the formation of the}} National Football League Players Association, which represents players' interests in dealings with the league. Browns players including Dante Lavelli and Abe Gibron helped found the union in 1956 along with lawyer and former Browns assistant coach Creighton Miller. Brown was so annoyed by the union that he had a 1946 team photo in his office touched up to remove Miller.|$|E

[...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game.

That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said.

500|$|Kaif's {{career as}} a model led to {{anticipation}} surrounding her Bollywood debut. Boom (2003) had its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival, and was heavily promoted at the event. Boom was a commercial and critical failure. Kaif's enactment of a supermodel ensnared in the Mumbai underworld was poorly received, with Ziya U. Salam of The Hindu attributing the weak performances of the film's leading ladies to [...] "the vacuity of their expressions". Hindustan Times reported that after Booms release, Kaif was written off due to her poor Hindi and thick British accent. She later dismissed the film: [...] "I don't count Boom among important happenings in my life. When <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> this film, I didn't know much about India and its film audience". Although Kaif was offered a number of modelling assignments, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her because of her poor command of Hindi. In one instance, Mahesh Bhatt replaced her with Tara Sharma in Saaya (2003) as he found her an [...] "inconsistent performer". Subsequently, Kaif began working on her diction through Hindi classes.|$|E
