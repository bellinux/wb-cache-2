5|$|Caudillos like Facundo Quiroga are seen, at the {{beginning}} of the book, as the antithesis of education, <b>high</b> <b>culture,</b> and civil stability; barbarism was like a never ending litany of social ills. They are the agents of instability and chaos, destroying societies through their blatant disregard for humanity and social progress.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It is not certain, however, {{if it was the}} religion of the majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of <b>high</b> <b>culture</b> and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic by the time the Ayyubids took power there.|$|E
5|$|Some LARPs stress artistic {{considerations}} such {{as dramatic}} interaction or challenging subject matter. Avant-garde or arthaus events have especially experimental approaches and <b>high</b> <b>culture</b> aspirations and are occasionally held in fine art contexts such as festivals or art museums. The themes of avant-garde events often include politics, culture, religion, sexuality {{and the human}} condition. Such LARPs are common in the Nordic countries but also present elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Prog {{is based}} on fusions of styles, {{approaches}} and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of <b>high</b> <b>culture</b> and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and {{only a handful of}} groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.|$|E
5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} his firm. The staff {{had begun to}} shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of <b>high</b> <b>culture</b> as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission {{in part because of the}} unique challenge it presented.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Heian period, the {{aristocracy}} lost political and economical power to warrior clans, but retained the prestige as custodians of <b>high</b> <b>culture</b> and literature. Nostalgia for the Heian court past, considered then as classical Japanese past (as opposed to Chinese past), created a renaissance in the arts and led to a blossoming of waka in the early Kamakura period. Poets of middle and lower rank, such as Fujiwara no Shunzei, Saigyō Hōshi and Fujiwara no Teika, analyzed earlier works, wrote critical commentaries, and added new aesthetic values such as yūgen to waka poetry. Some of the best imperial anthologies and best poetic anthologies, such as Shunzei's Korai fūteishō, were created in the early Kamakura period. The audience was extended from {{the aristocracy}} to high ranking warriors and priests, who began to compose waka.|$|E

5|$|Dylan {{introduced}} a literary element to rock through {{his fascination with}} the Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with <b>high</b> <b>culture.</b> Dylan also {{led the way in}} blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music.|$|E

60|$|I {{believe this}} way of talking about women and their <b>higher</b> <b>culture</b> is almost entirely a growth of the classes which (unlike the journalistic class to which I belong) have always a {{reasonable}} amount of money. One odd thing I specially notice. Those who write like this seem entirely to forget the existence of the working and wage-earning classes. They say eternally, like my correspondent, that the ordinary woman is always a drudge. And what, {{in the name of the}} Nine Gods, is the ordinary man? These people seem to think that the ordinary man is a Cabinet Minister. They are always talking about man going forth to wield power, to carve his own way, to stamp his individuality on the world, to command and to be obeyed. This may be true of a certain class. Dukes, perhaps, are not drudges; but, then, neither are Duchesses. The Ladies and Gentlemen of the Smart Set are quite free for the <b>higher</b> <b>culture,</b> which consists chiefly of motoring and Bridge. But the ordinary man who typifies and constitutes the millions that make up our civilisation is no more free for the <b>higher</b> <b>culture</b> than his wife is.|$|R

25|$|China's Song Dynasty (960–1279), another reunification era after a {{brief period}} of disunity, {{initiated}} a fresh <b>high</b> <b>culture.</b> Several of its greatest poets were capable government officials as well including Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Su Shi (1037–1101), and Wang Anshi (1021–1086). The ci form flourished as a few hundred songs became standard templates for poems with distinctive and variously set meters. The free and expressive style of Song <b>high</b> <b>culture</b> has been contrasted with majestic Tang poems by centuries of subsequent critics who engage in fierce arguments over which dynasty had the best poetry. Additional musical influences contributed to the Yuan Dynasty's (1279–1368) distinctive qu opera culture and spawned the sanqu form of individual poems based on it.|$|E

25|$|Traditionalist conservatism, {{also known}} as {{traditional}} conservatism, classical conservatism, traditionalism and Toryism (in the United Kingdom and Canada), is a political philosophy emphasizing {{the need for the}} principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, tradition, hierarchy, organic unity, classicism, <b>high</b> <b>culture</b> and the intersecting spheres of loyalty. Some traditionalists have embraced the labels reactionary and counterrevolutionary, defying the stigma attached to these terms since the Enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} the Turco-Persian world in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries was tested by invading armies of inland Asia. The Mongols under Genghis Khan (1220–58) and Timur (Tamerlane, 1336-1405) {{had the effect of}} {{stimulating}} development of Persianate culture of Central and West Asia, because of the new concentrations of specialists of <b>high</b> <b>culture</b> created by the invasions, for many people had to seek refuge in few safe havens, primarily India, where scholars, poets, musicians, and fine artisans intermingled and cross-fertilized, and because the broad peace secured by the huge imperial systems established by the Il-Khans (in the thirteenth century) and Timurids (in the fifteenth century), when travel was safe, and scholars and artists, ideas and skills, and fine books and artifacts circulated freely over a wide area. Il-Khans and Timurids deliberately patronized Persianate <b>high</b> <b>culture.</b> Under their rule developed new styles of architecture, Persian literature was encouraged, and flourished miniature painting and book production, and under Timurids prospered Turkic poetry, based on the vernacular known as Chaghatai (today called Uzbek; of Turkic Qarluq origin).|$|E
