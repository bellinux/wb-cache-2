500|$|<b>Domestic</b> {{critical}} <b>reception</b> of Darah dan Doa, {{which was}} advertised as showing [...] "fierce {{fighting against the}} colonials!" [...] and [...] "the joys and sorrows in guerrilla warfare", was predominantly negative. A review in the newspaper Merdeka considered Darah dan Doa unsatisfying, {{with only a few}} acceptable scenes. Armijn Pane, writing four years after the film's release, criticised the troops' neatness during their march, writing that their uniforms should have become progressively dirtier. Foreign reception, however, has been more positive. The Japanese film critic Tadao Sato, for instance, praised the film's concept, comparing it to the work of Andrzej Wajda.|$|R

The Literary Digest observed that year, ‘Most likely to upset the teacups were Chiang’s own civilian, anti-foreign, bombing, stabbing, shooting ‘Blue Shirt’ terrorists, who once useful, no unmanageable, have become something of a Frankenstein monster.” The association of the violent and repressive behaviour of the Blue Shirts compounded the less than enthusiastic reception of the Movement, further attributing to it a negative reputation as well.|$|E

50|$|Despite the grandiose goal of revitalising and revolutionising China, the New Life Movement {{ultimately}} {{ended in}} failure as both <b>domestic</b> and foreign <b>reception</b> remained paltry throughout {{the duration of}} the movement. The combination of the movement’s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and the seeming banality of its concerns caused both Chinese and foreign commentators to ignore the significance of New Life ideology and intentions and instead to stress the more superficial aspects of the movement. Consequently, the movement was approached variously as a joke, or to those taking it more seriously, a shallow and antiquated regression to Chinese tradition when tradition had already proved incapable of solving China’s problems.|$|R
5000|$|From {{a digital}} point of view, ribbon cable was an ideal way to connect two devices. However, from an analog point of view, these cables are problematic. Around 1980, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{discovered}} that ribbon cables were highly efficient antennas, broadcasting essentially random signals {{across a wide}} band of the electromagnetic spectrum. These unintended signals could interfere with <b>domestic</b> TV <b>reception,</b> putting [...] "snow" [...] on the screen. The FCC issued edicts and injunctions to the personal-computer industry, restricting the use of ribbon cables to connect devices together. [...] "Naked" [...] ribbon cable could be used inside {{the case of a}} computer or peripheral device, but any ribbon cable connecting two boxes together had to be grounded. This rule led to solutions such as ribbon cables covered by a copper-braid shield, which made it impossible to see or separate the individual connectors. On the Apple II, these cables passed through the holes {{on the back of the}} computer that were grounded to the power supply. Eventually, ribbon connectors were replaced, for inter-connect purposes, by a wide profusion of custom-designed round cables with molded connectors.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} Australian {{satellite}} pay-television companies have engaged CSIRO {{to measure the}} performance of their <b>domestic</b> <b>reception</b> antennas. These reflector antennas have their feed integrated with a low-noise block-down-converter (LNB), which converts 12. 25 - 12. 75 GHz to 0. 95 - 1. 450 GHz. We calculate the LNB noise temperature and gain by using a hot/cold-load Y-factor technique and a known noise source. For the cold load, we use absorber soaked in liquid nitrogen and ambient-temperature absorber for the hot load. The system noise temperature is calculated from another Y-factor measurement where the antenna is pointed at the sky for the cold load and ambient temperature absorber placed in front of the feed for the hot load. The gain is measured on an antenna range and we use a Fresnel-zone gain correction, as the range is too short for far-field measurements. We have identified the major sources of uncertainty and estimated the overall uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career, Dickens conceived of the home and in particular the hearth as the reception point for his distinctive narrative transmissions. The relationship between writer and reader was imagined in terms of the most intimate and residentially entrenched exchanges even while Dickens contemplated the very profitable consequences of mass proliferation. In order to contextualize Dickens's entrenchment, this essay explores the means by which he fostered an aesthetic of <b>domestic</b> <b>reception.</b> Here the hearth is seen in lights both familiar and unfamiliar, as source and symbol of Victorian virtue, but also as an integral component of a discursive ensemble integrating reader, furnishings, and architecture. In novels like Dombey and Son, Dickens considers the vexing problem of domestic disquiet-the noisy and volatile insecurity of the middle classes at home-while offering a respite, a cure that briefly bound rapt readers to their chairs.

40|$|Mexican {{expressive}} {{culture in}} the twentieth century - from the murals of David Alvaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera to the music of Carlos Chávez and Silvestre Revueltas - was key in constructing nationalist identity; in particular, Mexican cinema during 1930 - 1950 aided in creating new social identities specific to post-Revolutionary Mexican society. The period witnessed the formation and institutionalization of several film genres, the creation of a star system paralleling Hollywood's, and successful <b>domestic</b> and international <b>reception.</b> An area that has not been thoroughly investigated is music and its contributions to nascent cinematic nationalism. This dissertation proposes an interdisciplinary investigation of music in Mexican cinema between 1930 - 1950, concentrating on how orchestral and popular music contributed to creating or enhancing cinematic representations of national identity. I examine several film examples from prominent genres developed during this period, such as the prostitute melodrama and the cabaretera subgenre, the indigenista film (films focusing on an indigenous population), cine de añoranza porfirana (films of Porfirian longing), and the comedia ranchera (ranch comedy). While diverse in narrative and structure, these genres emblematize a nationalist consciousness through tropes that paralleled the constantly changing perspectives in state ideologies on international affairs, popular and transnational culture, and domestic modernization. Music in these films embellished and amplified the varying and evolving constructions of identity. Because of the important role film has in the construction of Mexican national identity during this period, examining the film's musical track provides a fruitful avenue for new interpretations that have gone unnoticed...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of William Cobbett’s personal letters have never been published. This thesis examines these manuscripts alongside the ‘open letter’ form that dominated his published writings, using correspondence to illuminate the hybrid and highly idiosyncratic form of Cobbett’s radicalism. It shows how he responded to continued persecution from the government {{through a series of}} innovative epistolary strategies, creating a popular journalism that incorporated many of the tropes usually associated with letter writing, including familiarity, authenticity, the spontaneity of speech and the <b>domestic</b> scene of <b>reception.</b> These became inseparable from the idealized presentation of Cobbett’s own radical and agrarian domestic life, and this thesis represents the first critical study to address the significance of Cobbett’s family in the physical production and imaginative world of his writings, drawing on many of the letters written by his seven children. Individual chapters concentrate on a series of episodes in Cobbett’s post- 1800 career, including his friendship with William Windham, imprisonment in Newgate, exile in America, support for Queen Caroline and writings on the Captain Swing uprising. During these years, Cobbett’s correspondence helped to establish the modern newspaper leading article as an open letter to readers, although Cobbett’s are stamped with his own personal authority. However, while correspondence invested Cobbett’s journalism with a sense of situatedness unmatched in radical writing of the period, it also highlights some of the tensions within his political and pedagogical practice. By the 1820 s, Cobbett’s correspondence bristles with the contradictions of wanting to recognize the individuality and difference of his readers’ lives, {{and at the same time}} pull them within the orbit of a very paternal political vision.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} highlights {{some of the}} innumerable {{ways that}} participation in UN peacekeeping efforts {{became one of the}} central symbols employed in Canadian self-identification from 1956 to 1997. What emerges is a web encompassing forty or so years of continuity and change in how messages about peacekeeping and Canada were produced, disseminated, and received by Canadians. The strands which comprise this web are: the political rhetoric of peacekeeping, the use of peacekeeping in high school textbooks, National Film Board [NFB] documentaries about peacekeeping, newspaper coverage of peacekeeping, and editorial cartoons about peacekeeping. Peacekeeping's growing adoption as a national symbol in Canada depended considerably on writers' and artists' abilities to discuss more than the successes and failures of individual missions or peacekeeping as a governmental policy. UN peacekeeping operations have not been universally successful; Canadians, therefore, did not become attached to peacekeeping through the actual achievements of their peacekeepers. Rather, what largely determined the content of each medium's messages were persistent discussions which foregrounded Canada's participation in peacekeeping operations, as well as the existence of three parallel discourses about peacekeeping which referred to the past, the present, or the future for audiences. The nostalgic and progressive discourses encouraged Canadians to see peacekeeping as a symbolic activity. The words and images associated with these temporal understandings of peacekeeping helped blunt the impact of any criticisms which were made using functional criteria in the present. While internationalist in emphasis, peacekeeping was seen through domestic frames far more often. Individual missions mattered less than the idea of peacekeeping and Canada's part in its perpetuation. When missions went awry, the impact on Canada was discussed far more than the effects on the host nations. The <b>domestic</b> production and <b>reception</b> of messages about peacekeeping was therefore influenced by internationalism, but remained centred on the Canadian experience of peacekeeping. This domestic emphasis problematizes the Canadian attachment to peacekeeping while also providing answers to why so many Canadians strongly associate with peacekeeping.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the <b>domestic</b> <b>reception</b> of global corporate responsibility is significantly shaped by institutionalized differences among state, business {{and civil society}} actors in the domestic context. In the global diffusion of ideas and practices, the decoupling of global policies and domestic practice is endemic, a process that this paper argues results from competing domestic interests and orientations. I examine this process of ‘lateral decoupling’ in {{a case study of}} the reception of the United Nations Global Compact among corporate responsibility practitioners in the city-state of Singapore. Differences in ceremonial, pragmatic and non-adversarial orientations towards global corporate responsibility generated significant uncertainty for businesses around how to apply corporate responsibility principles. In response, businesses constructed distinct narratives: large transnational and domestic companies emphasized values, community and tradition, while small businesses focused on the competitive advantages of corporate responsibility. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of domesticinstitutions for mediating global principles and local outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Designing Modern Japan is a single-authored book, {{contracted}} {{for publication}} with Reaktion Books. A critical history {{of design in}} Japan since that country’s re-engagement with international politics and trade in the 1860 s, the book charts the relationships between developments in domestic design industries (product, graphic, furniture, fashion and interior), changes in the material culture of everyday life in Japan, perceptions of ‘Japanese design’ oversea and debates within Japan on what 'modern Japanese design' should be. The book {{is the culmination of}} {{more than a decade of}} primary archival research in Japan, the US and the UK as well as a comprehensive survey of existing secondary sources. Surprisingly, it will be the first English-language resource to narrate - let alone critically examine - the history of design in Japan from the nineteenth century to the present day. Research questions include: -	How has ‘design’ been understood in Japan since the late nineteenth century? -	What impact have existing craft traditions, local culture and foreign definitions of design had on the development of design as a discipline, industry and method in Japan? -	What has been the relationship between professional understandings of design in Japan, the <b>domestic</b> <b>reception</b> of designed products and images of ‘Japanese design’ overseas, both in Europe/North America and in neighbouring Asian countries? -	How might the standard ‘history of modern design’ change when Japan’s experience is added to the story? -	How might we understand the story of design in modern Japan (or any local/national context) within the broader framework of global design history? The book progresses chronologically, from early attempts at formulating and implementing a state design policy for product exports in the 1860 s and 70 s through to Japanese design in global economic and cultural circuits today. Publication is expected in autumn 2013; to date, the project has also generated numerous lecture invitations in the UK, North America and Japan. The research also inspired a successful proposal to the Victoria and Albert Museum for an exhibition on Japanese design post- 1991, currently in development...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} global expansion of {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) —the worldwide convergence of CSR around human rights, environmental, and labor issues, and the widespread adoption of CSR frameworks. Contrary to studies that view CSR {{as the product of}} firm-level factors, I argue that the global expansion of CSR stems from factors in a firm’s external environment. In a multi-stage process, I explain how attempts by actors to shape the moral regulation of the global economy, especially in periods with profound contradictions in the institutional regulation of economic activity, drive the emergence, diffusion, and reception of global CSR frameworks. First, I discuss the theories of Emile Durkheim, Karl Polanyi, and John W. Meyer to construct an analytic framework of the moral regulation of the economy that specifies significant events, channels, and factors of moral regulation that stem from institutional and economic domains at both global and domestic levels. Second, I examine institutional emergence and change in the intergovernmental CSR field from 1964 to the present. Utilizing historical documents from the United Nations, I show how external events and changes in internal field composition lead to the emergence of global CSR frameworks and change in institutional outcomes for the intergovernmental CSR field. Third, I compare institutional and economic factors that drive the diffusion of CSR frameworks across various corporations and countries in the world. In cross-national time-series analyses, I show how global pressures through nongovernmental and bilateral trade channels lead to CSR framework adoption. I also demonstrate how corporations in developed and developing countries respond to these environmental pressures with different levels of CSR commitment. Finally, I examine the subsequent <b>domestic</b> <b>reception</b> of CSR frameworks in a case study of the Republic of Singapore. Using fieldwork and interview data with corporate, government, and nongovernmental actors, I examine lateral decoupling among domestic receptor sites and how corporations in Singapore respond to CSR pressures with different recoupling strategies. Throughout the dissertation, I use the case of the global expansion of CSR to critique and refine new institutional and world society explanations of the emergence, diffusion, and reception of social institutions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{question}} of contemporary Japanese cultural identity. Pertaining to the position taken by Cultural Studies that identity is not an essentially fixed entity, it argues for the prospect of cosmopolitan identities as an alternatively self-determined form of autonomous identity. The argument is supported by analyses of emerging cultural public spheres and the everyday cosmopolitanism the thesis finds {{in the work of}} contemporary Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. It is my concern that the prevailing norm of Japanese cultural identity is diminished by its dependence on cultural nationalism. Japanese society in general is under the influence of such a popular discourse concerning ‘Japaneseness’ known as Nihonjinron which is imbued with the myth of “one nation, one people” as its central tenet. This thesis interrogates and critiques this discourse for its intrinsic ethnocentrism and its capacity for facilitating the social exclusion of those who do not conform to it. The development of a cultural public sphere in Japan not only resists such cultural nationalism, but also indicates emergent everyday cosmopolitanism. The “Haruki Murakami phenomenon” is analysed at length by examining its contrasting <b>domestic</b> and international <b>reception</b> in order to demonstrate how its everyday cosmopolitanism could help redefine the concept of Japaneseness. Instead of isolating Japan and its cultural identity, Murakami embodies the possibility of an alternative approach which would position Japan within the inter-connectedness celebrated in the cosmopolitan imaginary. The prospect for cosmopolitan identities is further explored through the examination of recent Korean diaspora writers in Japan and elsewhere. The diasporic status of Korean writers offer coherent example of struggles with belonging and identity for those without nation. The cases of Murakami and the Korean diasporic writers represent a critical enquiry into multiple belongings and multiple identities that fulfil the cosmopolitan promise of the current globalisation process. The thesis concludes that there is an alternative approach to the redefining of Japanese cultural identity by establishing a broader perspective for belonging beyond conventional boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Scholarship on 1950 s American {{science fiction}} cinema {{has tended to}} explore the {{relationship}} between these films and their domestic contexts of production and reception. They are often characterised as reflections of US anxieties about communism and nuclear technology. However, many such films were exported to Britain where these concerns were articulated and understood differently. The ways in which this different national context of reception shaped British interpretations of American science fiction cinema of this era has not yet been accounted for. Similarly, although some research has addressed 1950 s British science fiction, this scholarship has been comparatively concise and has left gaps in our knowledge about the <b>domestic</b> <b>reception</b> of these films. Unable to draw on a British reception history of domestic and US 1950 s science fiction cinema, debates about the genre have sometimes been underpinned by the presumption that western audiences responded to these films in a uniform manner. This thesis seeks to complicate our understanding of the genre by suggesting the specificity of the British reception history of science fiction cinema during the 1950 s. The paucity of documentary evidence of British responses to 1950 s science fiction films makes an audience study impossible. Within the intellectual framework of the New Film History, this thesis instead employs a contextually- activated approach to reception. Making extensive use of archival sources, newsreels, newspapers, magazines and other such documentary evidence, it explores some of the different contexts in which 1950 s science fiction cinema was received in Britain and suggests how these factors might have shaped the interpretation of the genre. The thesis examines the interplay between American and British 1950 s science fiction cinema and the British public understanding of communism, immigration, nuclear technology and scientific advancement. It contributes to our knowledge of these films by demonstrating that Britons did not necessarily understand 1950 s science fiction cinema {{in the same way as}} Americans because they were party to a differently inflected series of public debates. It exposes the flexibility of the metaphors utilised by the genre during this period and their susceptibility to reinterpretation in different national contexts. This research makes visible, in a more extensive manner than has yet been accomplished, the specificity of the British reception history of 1950 s science fiction cinema, and thereby provides a means to resist assumptions about the similarity of western audiences during this decade. Its conclusions call for further research into other national reception histories of these films, so that they too are not overshadowed by the better known American history of the genre, and into the possibility that the British reception history of other genres might similarly have been obscured.
