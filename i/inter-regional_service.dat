40|$|High-speed rail has {{developed}} both {{nationally and internationally}} in Europe as a successful alternative to both air and road over distances of 400 – 600 km. Inter-city traffic, especially between the major metropolitan areas in North-west Europe has benefitted greatly from the investment in this network. This paper explores two issues: {{the impact on the}} intermediate areas between these major metropolitan areas and the creation of potential cross-border <b>inter-regional</b> <b>services.</b> The evidence shows how both levels of service and potential economic impacts have been much less pronounced in these intermediate areas. Such areas have been affected both by a failure to see greatly improved direct access to major cities other than within their own countries and a lack of new cross-border <b>inter-regional</b> <b>services.</b> The paper argues that the creation of the high-speed rail TEN-T has not met the primary objectives of reducing regional disparities in accessibility or reducing the effect of national borders on regional integration. To achieve this requires not just infrastructure provision but an appropriate regulatory framework for service provision and accompanying measures at the local level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In Japan, rapid railway {{lines have}} been {{installed}} and expanded in order to connect regional prime cities to Tokyo, while airlines began to enhance their domestic service after the deregulation of airlines in 1986. In longer term, the influence of competition between railway and airline become more complex, because of network externalities of LOS improvement on networks. This study makes a retrospective assessment of <b>inter-regional</b> transportation <b>services</b> in ODs with their demand by using the Japanese longitudinal data in 1970, and 1995. The inter-regional net passenger traffic, average speed, fare per distance, and least frequency of the link in line-haul route are compared to find the characteristics of inter-regional LOS. Through the analyses, three kinds of inter-regional transportation markets were identified, and the characteristics of those were summarized. The network externality in LOS strongly appeared in railway service and demand. Such modal characteristics should be carefully considered in inter-regional network planning.

40|$|Theme 1 Since {{the late}} 1980 s, the entry {{barriers}} for new bus and railway companies have gradually been reduced in Sweden.

Four parts of the transportation sector are considered: local and regional bus services, long-distance bus services, regional train <b>services</b> and <b>inter-regional</b> train <b>services.</b> Although offering different basic conditions for entry, new as well as old small businesses have often faced a common problem on each of these markets: having to compete with a giant former monopolist or oligopolists, or being dependent on some of its/their factors of production.

5000|$|Téoz was a {{brand name}} used by France’s {{national}} railway company, SNCF, to denote long-distance reservation-obligatory passenger rail services on certain SNCF routes. SNCF established the Téoz system in 2003 {{as an attempt to}} bring certain key routes up to the 'same standards' as TGVs where high speed lines are not available, leaving ordinary Corail trains to serve the rest of the non high speed inter-city and <b>inter-regional</b> network. Téoz <b>services</b> were not universally liked as they required compulsory reservation but went little faster than the traditional services they replaced. Since December 2011 the Teoz brand has been abandoned and all SNCF long distance services have been assimilated into the Intercités brand, along with the overnight sleeper trains which have also lost their previous branding (Lunéa).|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{focusing}} {{on the problem of}} connecting peripheral areas to the European passenger transport network. Remote areas are suffering from insufficient <b>inter-regional</b> transport <b>services</b> and missing links to Europe's economic core regions. Transport infrastructure development has therefore been identified as one of the key issues to bring forward the European integration. The case of Portugal reveals some interesting aspects in transport policy and transport planning that without any doubt are of general relevance for the whole area of European cohesion. The European Commission has contributed a corner stone to the transport planning in Europe with the development of guidelines for a common transport policy and the outlines for a trans-European transport networks. Though in the theoretical framework of the common transport policy interconnection of the European regions with intermodal and interoperable transport networks is a key issue, the first step to realisation, the trans-European networks have been massively criticised for a number of inconsistencies and shortcomings. To sum it up, it can be stated that the trans-European transport networks' design does hardly reflect the necessity ofthe development of intermodality. This TEN scenario is also true for the high-speed train connection planned in Portugal, which out of many reasons will never be realised. The study proposes an alternative approach through using a less costly technology - the pendular train system- to improve the performance of Portuguese railway services and interconnect this service to aviation with Lisbon Airport as an efficient interface. The performance potential of a pendular train system is demonstrated through a computer simulation a part of the corridor Lisbon-Porto. For this simulation the software programme Railway Simulator (RWSJ' running on an Apple TM Macintosh Iiic, is used which originally was designed to build the time schedules for the national Portuguese train network.

40|$|Multimodal policy between railway and {{airlines}} is {{of importance}} in providing seamless transportation <b>service</b> to <b>inter-regional</b> passengers. However, {{it is difficult}} to make coordination among the railway and airline service suppliers, especially when they are fiercely competing for the share in passenger market in the target OD. Inter-regional transportation in Japan, fierce competitions are observed between Japan Railway companies and airlines, especially after the 1990 fs deregulation of the airline entrance; the number of new air service are parallel to the conventionally profitable railway service. Regardless to railway service improvements such as speed-ups, increase of frequency and special tickets of bargain fares, the number of airline passengers has been increased in the middle to long distant regions, while railway passengers continuously decreased. Such consequence would be brought by the multimodal route which has an airline link as the trunk line, and railway links as the access or egress <b>service,</b> considering <b>inter-regional</b> passenger behaviors. In other words, the improvement of railway service of middle to long distance would simultaneously and inevitably improve the short distant railway service, which can be used as the access line to airport. This phenomenon can be called the spatial externality of railway network. Spatial externality much strongly appears in railway network, comparing to airlines. If the above consideration is valid, inter-regional transportation market would not be efficient without considering the unintended multimodal use. This study purposes to clarify the existence and effects of spatial externality of railway service from investigation of longitudinal change in <b>inter-regional</b> transportation <b>service</b> and demand in Japan. The LOS of multimodal routes are calculated by the k-th shortest path algorithm which gives alternative routes to the shortest. In order to assess the LOS for each OD, the mode choice model is estimated, and passenger utilities of ODs are calculated. The results are aggregated for each distance range of ODs, and compared the LOS improvement measured by estimated utilities with the number of passengers of railway and of airlines. Implications for regional transportation administration are finally made. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{units were}} {{primarily}} employed on services between London Waterloo and Weymouth. One or two 4TC units would be propelled from London to Bournemouth by a 3200 HP 4REP unit, controlled from the leading cab. At Bournemouth, {{one or both}} 4TCs would continue over the then unelectrified line to Weymouth, hauled by a Class 33/1 diesel locomotive, leaving the 4REP at the London end of Bournemouth station. Up trains from Weymouth would follow the same procedure in reverse: the Class 33/1 locomotive would propel its train to Bournemouth (controlled from the 4TC leading cab). There the 4TC/s would couple to the waiting 4REP which would then power the whole formation to London, leaving the Class 33/1 locomotive at Bournemouth to await the next such service. 4TC units were occasionally seen on other duties such as Waterloo to Salisbury, the Clapham Junction to Kensington Olympia shuttle before that line was electrified and surplus units were also used on Sundays to operate Portsmouth Harbour to Reading direct services during the late 1970s & early 1980s. They were pressed into general service as needed, often deputising for electric trains when the power was switched off and occasionally on <b>inter-regional</b> Southern Region <b>services.</b> They ventured further afield on special duties or rail-tours, including Birmingham, Cardiff, Barnstaple/Meeth & Meldon Quarry. Until {{the closure of the}} Swanage branch, a small number of through 4TC workings to/from Waterloo were operated, also using class 33/1 locomotives in similar style to the Weymouth trains.|$|R
40|$|The {{trend of}} growing road freight {{transport}} causes significant negative impacts on the society, economy and environment. A substantial share of the road freight sector’s externalities is imposed on urban areas because cities are the main destination for freight flows either for production, consumption or for transfer to other locations. City-regions that host centralized transport facilities of inter-regional networks suffer from congestion, noise and air pollution {{while at the same}} time the urban context challenges their efficient operation. Urban freight transport networks thus need to adjust to the urban environment and to balance different interest which in turn is likely to have an impact on inter-regional freight transport networks. This thesis aims to explore the relationship between urban freight transport and inter-regional freight transport networks for the sustainable development of the freight transport sector. This thesis is based on a multiple case-study. By means of in-depth interviews with freight transport stakeholders in six cities, the urban context of freight transport and how it affects inter-regional freight transport networks and vice versa is investigated. In a complementary theoretical study the case study findings are applied on intermodal rail-{{road freight transport}} with the goal to identify the urban context’s barriers and opportunities for the design of more competitive <b>inter-regional</b> rail transport <b>services.</b> The results confirm the tension in contemporary urban freight transport between local sustainable development and freight transport network performance. Economic interests on the one hand and environmental and social interests on the other hand are perceived as trade-offs and there is no long-term strategy to balance these interests. However, there is indication that adapting freight transport networks to the urban conditions can be beneficial for both the competitiveness of intermodal road-rail transport and local sustainability. Hence, a deeper integration of freight transport and urban sustainability strategies can possibly contribute to more sustainable freight transport...|$|R
