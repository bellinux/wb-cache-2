5|$|Ornstein was {{the first}} {{important}} composer to make extensive use of the tone cluster. As a pianist, he was considered a world-class talent. By the mid-1920s, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> away from his fame and soon disappeared from popular memory. Though he gave his last public concert {{before the age of}} forty, he continued writing music for another half-century and beyond. Largely forgotten for decades, he was rediscovered in the mid-1970s. Ornstein completed his eighth and final piano sonata in September 1990 at the age of ninety-four, making him the oldest published composer in history (a mark since passed by Elliott Carter).|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Pujols doubled again {{and was able}} to score on an error by Mueller. The Red Sox also scored {{in the bottom of the}} inning when Bellhorn doubled to center with two runners on base, to give them a three-run lead. Cal Eldred came in to relieve Morris in the fifth inning, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> the leadoff hitter, having already given up four runs in the {{previous}} four innings. Mueller committed his World Series record-tying third error of the game, in the sixth inning; however, the Cardinals failed to capitalize. In the bottom of the inning, Trot Nixon led off with a single to center, and two more singles by Johnny Damon and Orlando Cabrera enabled two more runs to score to make it 6–1.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November 1469 he {{enrolled}} at Leuven University but {{seems to have}} moved on to Paris very soon afterwards. Here he again performed menial services—this time for the monks of Sainte Genevieve—in return for his education. He got his degree in 1475. He was immediately asked to become Regent—that is, student-master—in the Collège de Montaigu, where he also began his (more advanced) studies in Theology. Soon afterwards, he visited a renowned Italian hermit who {{had been invited to}} France by the King, Charles VIII. This was St Francis of Paola, who had given up all possessions, (<b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> to France from Italy), including the personal use of money, and subjected himself to severe privations in terms of food, clothing, cleanliness, heat and bedding. Jan was tremendously struck by Francis's air of saintliness.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} {{launched}} on 15 July 2010 at the Madras University campus. Genelia D'Souza who had acted opposite Vijay in Sachein {{was chosen for}} the role of a journalist, and Hansika Motwani was chosen as female lead. while Saranya Mohan would play sister to Vijay's character. Art director Veera Samar also was roped in to play a journalist. While Santhanam and M. S. Baskar were chosen to play the comedy lead in the film, Sayaji Shinde, Vineetkumar and Abhimanyu Singh were selected to play negative roles. Tom Delmar, who had worked as a stunt coordinator in several Hollywood films, joined the crew to choreograph the stunts in the film. Due to his commitment to Velayudham, Vijay almost lost his role in S. Shankar's Nanban. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> out of Nanban, since the two films demanded two completely different looks, however, he joined the film later as the scenes involving the protagonist were reserved to be shot later. R. T. Neason who earlier directed Muruga (2007) and went on to direct Vijay in Jilla (2014) worked as a second unit director.|$|E
25|$|After the Test, Ranjitsinhji {{played only}} a few more games that season. After two batting {{failures}} for Sussex, {{he dropped out of}} the team, even though the side were in contention for the County Championship, eventually finishing second. Part of the reason may have been to pre-empt his omission from the England team for the final Test, a match he attended as a spectator, but he did not return to Sussex after the match, preferring to play for MCC against the Australians, where he scored 60 and 10. The press speculated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> out on the team; among the reasons suggested were disappointment with the performances of the side, dissatisfaction with the bowlers and efforts to recruit new players, and his falling out with the professional players. The local press criticised him for abandoning the team at a crucial phase of the season, and praised Brann, his replacement. Nevertheless, Ranjitsinhji preferred to play for MCC against the Australians, scoring 60 and 10. His three substantial innings gave him a batting record for the season which partially masked his difficulties: 1, 106 runs at an average of 46.08, placing him second in the national averages.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E

500|$|Henry Pease, a S {{director}} and Quaker, visited his brother Joseph in mid-1859 {{at his house}} by the sea at Marske-by-the-Sea. Returning late for dinner, he explained <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> to Saltburn, then a group of fisherman's cottages, where {{he had had a}} [...] "sort of prophetic vision" [...] of a town with gardens. With other S directors he planned the town, with gardens and Zetland Hotel by the station, and bought a house at 5 Britannia Terrace, where he stayed for a few weeks every summer. The extension opened in 1861, a station on the through line replacing the terminus at Redcar.|$|E
500|$|Very {{became known}} {{for his ability to}} draw people into literature, and was asked to speak at a lyceum in his {{hometown}} of Salem in 1837. There he was befriended by Elizabeth Peabody, who wrote to Emerson suggesting Very lecture in Concord. In 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson arranged a talk by Very at the Concord Lyceum. Very lectured on epic poetry on April 4 of that year, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> twenty miles from Salem to Concord to deliver it.

500|$|The Yankees {{had high}} {{expectations}} {{when they met}} the New York Giants in the 1921 World Series, every game of which was played in the Polo Grounds. [...] The Yankees won {{the first two games}} with Ruth in the lineup. However, Ruth badly scraped his elbow during Game 2 when he slid into third base (<b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> and stolen both second and third bases). After the game, he was told by the team physician not to play the rest of the series. Despite this advice, he did play in the next three games, and pinch-hit in Game Eight of the best-of-nine series, but the Yankees lost, five games to three. Ruth hit [...]316, drove in five runs and hit his first World Series home run.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} film the episode without {{exceeding}} the budget, director Rob Bowman used {{a combination of}} [...] "clever camera angles, strategic use of breakaway cement, and—in the case of Mulder's trunk lid—the miracle of auto-body repair substance Bondo". Bowman was most proud of the scene where Mulder pushes on the prison's walls, only to have it crumble {{in the shape of}} a man. He explained that, [...] "the first time we did it, all we got was a big square hole [...] but we didn't want it to look like Bugs Bunny with his ears sticking out, either". Eventually, the crew was able to create a breakaway section that [...] "suggested, rather than outlined perfectly", the shape of a human body. Finally, hair department head Dena Green was instructed to sweep Diehl's hair to the back of his head during any scene that featured him after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> through a solid object.|$|E
500|$|In {{the top of}} {{the fourth}} inning, Bronson Arroyo was brought in to replace Wakefield after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> four batters. Those walks, {{combined}} with a throwing error by Millar and a passed ball by Doug Mirabelli, allowed the Cardinals to reduce the lead to two runs. In the sixth inning, So Taguchi reached first on an infield hit and was allowed to advance to second when Arroyo threw the ball into the stands. Doubles by Édgar Rentería and Walker tied the game at seven. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Ramírez singled with two men on base, and a poor throw by Edmonds allowed Bellhorn to score. Ortiz then hit a line drive that appeared to skip off the lip of the infield and hit Cardinals' second baseman Tony Womack with [...] "considerable force." [...] Womack immediately grabbed his clavicle as a second Red Sox run scored. He was attended to once play had ended and replaced by Marlon Anderson. A precautionary X-ray revealed that there was no damage.|$|E

500|$|Manyon {{continued}} to narrate as the programme reconstructed the IRA team's movements through Gibraltar towards the border until McCann and Farrell reached a petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. [...] "Then, suddenly", Manyon told viewers, [...] "shots rang out, and {{in less than}} a minute all three terrorists were dead—shot by the SAS". The commentary again cut to Howe's statement, after which Manyon detailed This Week investigation. He introduced the four eyewitnesses the journalists had discovered (Diana Treacy, Josie Celecia, Stephen Bullock, and Carmen Proetta). Celecia described witnessing McCann and Farrell walking along Winston Churchill Avenue before hearing several shots, and then seeing a soldier continue to fire at the pair while they were on the ground. Proetta told the programme she saw a police car arrive opposite the petrol station, that three armed men in plain clothes then disembarked, jumped across the central barrier, and shot McCann and Farrell while the latter had their hands up. Bullock was interviewed walking the route <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> on the day of the shootings; his account was of two men in plain clothes shooting McCann and Farrell at very close range and continuing to shoot as the pair fell and while they were on the ground. Treacy, meanwhile, was walking along Landport Lane when Savage ran past her, pursued by at least one soldier. She stated that she did not hear any warning before Savage was shot; she ran away after the shooting began. Asquez was not named in the broadcast; his statement—that he saw a soldier firing at Savage while the latter was on the ground—was read out by an actor.|$|E
