The use of silane causes low environmental impact and may represent an alternative to replace chromates and phosphates applied as a pretreatment prior to surface painting. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate experimental parameters for the investigation of the formation of a vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMOS) monolayer on 1010 carbon steel applying electrochemical techniques. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 24 types of coated samples were obtained, following three 23 factorial design of experiments (DOE), and one uncoated. The VTMOS monolayer was formed by hand dip process, followed by curing in a stove, using substrates of sanded, pickled and degreased 1010 carbon steel and <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>silane.</b> Findings – The results of coated samples were satisfactory as compared to those of uncoated carbon steel, as the former were better protected against corrosion. Originality/value – This paper shows an evaluation of experimental parameters that influence the formation of a film of silane VTMOS on 1010 carbon steel by means of electrochemical techniques. The results indicated that the silane monolayer VTMOS promotes enhanced properties that prevent corrosion of 1010 carbon steel and the method of film formation directly influences the properties of such protection...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the silica-silane bond formation present at the filler interface of dental composites. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy was used, and the spectra of pyrogenic silica (Cab-O-Sil) treated with different concen-trations ofy-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy-silane (MPS) were analyzed. The outcome of the study suggested that the y-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) mol-ecules oriented parallel to the colloidal silica surface (Cab-O-Sil) and formed two types of bonds. One of these bonds was a siloxane bridge formed by a condensation reaction between the silanol groups of both the silica surface and the <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>silane.</b> Water formed during this reaction and soon became recaptured by the silanol groups of the silica surface. These water molecules were not available for additional hydrolyzation reactions ofthe unhydrolyzed silane under the experimental conditions. The intensity of the isolated OH-groups decreased because of this reac-tion. Simultaneous with the condensation reaction, the carbonyl group of the MPS molecule formed hydrogen bonds. This hydrogen bond formation resulted in a peak shift of the carbonyl band from 1718 - 1720 cm- 1 to 1700 - 1702 cm- 1. This hydrogen bond formation also occurred with the isolated OH-groups. After consumption of the isolated OH-groups, no additional surface reaction oc-curred because no further OH-groups were available for additional condensation reactions or hydrogen bond for-mation. The findings suggest that the amount of silane needed for filler treatment depends on the number of isolated OH-groups available on the filler surface...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{in-vitro}} study was to evaluate the effects of three different surface preparation methods on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets bonded to zirconia and determine the most appropriate method. Methods: 45 zirconia and 30 leucite-reinforced porcelain mandibular premolar crowns were divided into 5 groups and received the following surface preparations: 37 % phosphoric acid and non-hydrolyzed silane, 4 % hydrofluoric acid and <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>silane,</b> microetch with 50 μ Al 2 O 3 particles. A universal adhesive primer containing MDP was applied and the brackets were bonded with a bis-GMA composite resin. Shear bond strength (SBS) at bond failure and ARI score were recorded. Results: There was {{a statistically significant difference}} among the studied groups for the SBS. The highest mean SBS (11. 03 MPA) was recorded for the zirconia/microetch group, and the lowest SBS (3. 49 MPa) for the zirconia/phosphoric acid group. The leucite-reinforced porcelain/ hydrofluoric acid group had significantly more fractures than any other debond pattern. The zirconia/hydrofluoric acid group was the only one with a SBS (8. 08 MPa) that fell within the recommended range of 6 - 8 MPa. This group also had a favorable debond pattern with most composite remaining on the bracket. Conclusions: Important consideration should be given to the surface preparation of porcelain and zirconia prior to bonding orthodontic attachments. Phosphoric acid etch is not an adequate surface preparation when bonding to zirconia. Hydrofluoric acid is not suitable when bonding to leucite-reinforced porcelain, as it is associated with a higher rate of surface fracture. Microetch with 50 μ Al 2 O 3 particles in combination with an MDP containing universal adhesive primer provided optimal mean shear bond strength, along with favorable debond patterns when bonding to zirconia. Hydrofluoric acid etch in combination with a silane and a universal primer containing MDP provided acceptable shear bond strength to zirconia. This protocol was not significantly different from zirconia prepared with microetch and either method can be successfully employed...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the siloxane, -Si-O-Si-, film formation on Ti substrate by using mono-, bis- and tris-aminosilanes. The ultimate goal was to obtain a smooth, well-organized and stable siloxane film with suitable surface energy. Such films are expected to perform well in adhering resins to dental metal alloys when the films contain reactive functional groups. Aminosilanes were prepared as 0. 5 vol. % solutions in dilute ethanol (50 vol. % ethanol in deionized water), with their natural pH of ∼ 9. The substrates were silanized in two ways: silane was allowed to react at room temperature or was cured for 1 h at 110 °C. The surface characterization was carried out by reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (RA-FTIR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurement and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Siloxane film thickness measurements were not made. According to spectral analysis, all silanes indicated covalent bond formation with titanium. ≡Si-O-Ti≡ and ≡Si-O-Si≡ bonds were clearly seen in the spectra, suggesting that chemical retention had taken place. After curing at elevated temperature, the spectral bands seemed to be stronger than those on samples cured at room temperature. Curing of <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>silanes</b> at elevated temperature seemed to enhance the siloxane layer formation, derived from aminosilanes, on the Ti substrate. This might have an influence on the hydrolytic stability of organosilane-promoted adhesion between Ti and dental resins. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{fabrication of}} microbiosensors utilizing a simple, rapid biomimetic silicification method catalyzed by poly-L-lysine {{at ambient temperature}} to provide a mild and efficient method for entrapment of the enzymes required {{for a range of}} analytes. To obtain a robust poly-L-lysine layer for precipitating silica onto the Pt surface, a Pt microelectrode was first functionalized with abundant carboxyl groups by electrochemical deposition of poly(pyrrole- 1 -propanoic acid). By means of zero length cross-linking reagents N-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (NHSS), poly-L-lysine was covalently immobilized onto microelectrode surface. Under mild chemical conditions, three enzymes including adenosine deaminase (AD, EC 3. 5. 4. 4), nucleoside phosphorylase (NP, EC 2. 4. 2. 1) and xanthine oxidase (XO, EC 1. 1. 3. 22) could then be simultaneously entrapped into a continuous silicate layer formed on top of Pt microelectrode from a mixture of enzymes and <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>silanes</b> in Tris buffer (0. 1 M, pH 7. 2) via the catalytic action of the attached poly-L-lysine. The fabricated adenosine biosensors exhibited good analytical performance with a sensitivity of 153. 0 +/- 2. 4 mu A mM(- 1) cm(- 2) (n= 4, R. S. D. = 2. 1 %), a lower detection limit of 40 nM and a favourable response time (estimated as 10 - 90 % response rise time) of 25 +/- 2 s (n= 4). The good selectivity of the adenosine microbiosensor against coexisting interfering substances such as ascorbic acid, urate and 5 -HT was achieved through formation of a screening barrier from electrodeposited poly(diaminobenzene) following the biomimetic deposition process. We found that our methods were adaptable for other enzymes and analytes allowing fabrication of L-glutamate and lactate biosensors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{protective}} {{performances of}} different coatings for AZ 31 Mg alloy {{have been evaluated}} in 0. 1 N NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 solutions by recording the polarization curves and by EIS measurements. These coatings were formed in permanganate-phosphate or stannate baths {{as well as in}} hydroalcoholic solutions of silanes with a long alkyl-chain (e. g. octyl and octadecyl-trimethoxy-silane). The influence of different parameters (solution pH, treatment time) were examined and the possibility to increase the permanganate coating performance with a subsequent treatment in water-soluble silanes was also evaluated. All the treatments with inorganic compounds showed protective characteristics similar or better than those of chromate treatment. Furthermore, silanes may enhance the efficiency of permanganate bath. However, the best results were obtained with the 18 carbon atom long alkyl chain <b>silane</b> (<b>hydrolyzed</b> at pH 5). In this case no corrosion attack was observed in 1000 h immersion in the aggressive solutions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It {{focused on}} how the low carbon steel surface was pretreated by <b>hydrolyzed</b> KH- 560 <b>silane</b> {{solution}} and the polyethylene (PE) coatings were prepared on the pretreated surface in the paper. Moreover, the comparison of the adhesive strengths of PE coatings has been made between the coating and the steel substrate surfaces pretreated by silane agents and other various conventional pretreatment methods. The {{results show that the}} highest adhesive strength between coatings and steel surface could be acquired on the condition that the concentration of KH- 560 was about 5 % and the hydrolytic time was 48 hours, and the adhesive strength of coatings coated on the steel substrate surfaces pretreated by silane agents was more or less higher than those pretreated by conventional processes such as sandpaper grinding, acid etching, phosphating and sandblasting by 40. 3 %, 46 %, 17. 6 % and 13. 2 %, respectively. The fracture morphology of the coatings coated on silane agent pretreated substrate surface showed cohesive failure, which was also different from the ones coated on the conventional process pretreated substrate surfaces. ...|$|R
