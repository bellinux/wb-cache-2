40|$|Comparing graphs to {{determine}} the level of underlying structural similarity between them is a widely encountered problem in computer science. It is particularly relevant {{to the study of}} <b>Internet</b> topologies, such <b>as</b> the generation of synthetic topologies to represent the <b>Internet’s</b> <b>AS</b> topology. We derive a new metric that enables exactly such a structural comparison, the weighted spectral distribution. We then apply this metric to three aspects of the study of the <b>Internet’s</b> <b>AS</b> topology. (i) we use it to quantify the effect of changing the mixing properties of a simple synthetic network generator. (ii) we use this quantitative understanding to examine the evolution of the <b>Internet’s</b> <b>AS</b> topology over approximately 7 years, finding that the distinction between the Internet core and periphery has blurred over time. (iii) we use the metric to derive optimal parameterizations of several widely used AS topology generators with respect to a large-scale measurement of the real AS topology...|$|R

5|$|Diary of a Camper {{is a short}} American film {{made using}} id Software's 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake, {{released}} in 1996. It was created by United Ranger Films, then a subdivision of a popular group of video game players, or clan, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the <b>Internet</b> <b>as</b> a non-interactive game demo file. The video is generally considered the first known example of machinima—the art of using real-time, virtual 3D environments, often game engines, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone camper, a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces {{five members of the}} Rangers clan in a deathmatch, a type of multiplayer game in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure Time {{crew was}} {{satisfied}} with the episode on its completion. In spite of that, Muto described the reaction from fans on the <b>Internet</b> <b>as</b> largely negative, much to their surprise. It earned an A− grade from Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who compared Cinnamon Bun's evolution from a simple-minded character to one of complexity with the progression of the show itself. Sava opined that the theme of life following a broken romance benefits from this complexity. Sava saw the physical cooling of Flame Princess as a crafty metaphor for the personal changes an individual from a former relationship might experience, {{as well as the}} nostalgia felt over such a relationship. Separate from romance, Sava interpreted the battle between the Flame Lord and the Flame King as to demonstrate Flame Princess is a more sensible ruler.|$|E

According to Fehdrau, no one {{who worked on the}} Evermore project would have been involved in a translation of Seiken Densetsu 3; the Redmond team was specifically hired to create Evermore. In 2000, a fan translation project for Seiken Densetsu 3 led by Neill Corlett was successfully completed and made available on the <b>internet</b> <b>as</b> an unofficial patch, which could be applied to ROMs of the game when played with an emulator or played on a Super NES console with a development kit or backup device.
