In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.|$|E

5|$|Selbie {{also made}} a {{conscious}} effort to attract the wealthy classes to the railway. Stations such as Sandy Lodge (now Moor Park) were built to serve <b>golf</b> <b>courses</b> <b>and</b> hunts along the route, and horse-vans were provided at stations serving hunts and point to points.

5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of <b>golf</b> <b>courses</b> <b>and</b> resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E

The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake, a wider section of the Kalamazoo River that flows between the two towns. A-2 crosses back to the eastern side of the freeway north of Saugatuck, and I-196/US31 continues north-northeasterly toward Holland.|$|E

5|$|Many in the {{conservation}} movement urged {{the state to}} buy back the land, especially after the Curtiss-Wright lease was canceled. In April 1967 Penn State vacated the site and gave the reactor complex to the state. Martin Marietta departed in June 1967, and early in that same year, Pennsylvania bought the remaining land back from Curtiss-Wright for $992,500, about $811,000 more than they had sold it for in 1955. Various usage plans for the area were proposed, including: a vacation resort with a large artificial lake, motels, <b>golf</b> <b>courses,</b> <b>and</b> honeymoon resort; a Penn State game preserve stocked with exotic animals like bison and boar; a large youth camp for several hundred children; and a radioactive waste disposal site. By November 1967, all of the land {{was back in the}} state forests and state game lands.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie prefers open {{areas such}} as grassland, fields and {{residential}} {{areas such as}} parks, gardens, <b>golf</b> <b>courses,</b> <b>and</b> streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly {{on the ground in}} these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.|$|E
