40|$|In {{this study}} unannounced interim {{inspections}} are analyzed in general, and specifically {{in view of}} the recently defined IAEA/EURATOM Partnership Approach. In particular the following aspects are addressed: A general discussion of the problem of unannounced interim inspections which includes an identification and description of all the types of assumptions which are necessary to be made for a quantitative treatment, an outline of the general methods identified and proposed for the solution of problems of that kind, the identification of two examples for a detailed analysis to be carried out with the general method identified in the previous steps, and lessons learned and reflections aiming at identifying also practical recommendations on the matter of unannounced interim inspections. As a major result, for a specific facility and a given number of <b>inspections</b> per <b>reference</b> time, e. g., one year, optimal inspection strategies are determined. Whereas for the case that inspection are perfect the results can be guessed, this does not hold anymore for imperfect inspections, e. g., limited sample sizes of seals to be checked. Also, together with the optimal inspection strategies, optimal expected detection times are determined as functions of the parameters of the model, namely number of <b>inspections</b> per <b>reference</b> time interval and probability of not detecting an illegal activity during an inspection.

40|$|Automotive {{industry}} {{is one of}} the major drivers of the global economic and a leader in the research and development of advanced manufacturing technologies. Machining and automation are primary processes for product development and production for automotive industry because of their high efficiency and flexibility. Today's automotive products are complex, sophisticated and have a large variation for different models. The demand for these products is mostly in small to medium lot sizes but with large variation. Although computerized numerical control (CNC), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) are well developed today but still fall short in efficiency to produce these products due to a variety of designs and customizations, short lead time and low volume production. In order to address some of these deficiencies, Integerated Manufacturing Technologies Institute (IMTI) of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) is working on a number of advanced manufacturing processes. This paper focuses on the new and innovative ideas being developed and IMTI to enhance the performance and flexibility for the manufacturing of automotive products, from the development of parts, moulds, tools and dies to material handling, production, and assembly. In particular, an integrated scheme for the development of a series of machining and automated systems that include automatic CNC programming, online <b>inspection,</b> <b>reference</b> free setup, error detection and compensation, and intelligent monitoring and control will be described.

40|$|Precision {{inspection}} of manufactured components having multiple complex surfaces and variable tolerance definition is an involved, complex and time-consuming function. In routine practice, a jig {{is used to}} present the part in a known reference frame {{to carry out the}} inspection process. Jigs involve both time and cost in their development, manufacture and use. This paper describes 'as is where is inspection' (AIWIN), a new automated inspection technique that accelerates the inspection process by carrying out a fast registration procedure and establishing a quick correspondence between the part to inspect and its CAD geometry. The main challenge in doing away with a jig is that the <b>inspection</b> <b>reference</b> frame could be far removed from the CAD frame. Traditional techniques based on iterative closest point (ICP) or Newton methods require either a large number of iterations for convergence or fail in such a situation. A two-step coarse registration process is proposed to provide a good initial guess for a modified ICP algorithm developed earlier (Ravishankar et al., Int J Adv Manuf Technol 46 (1 - 4) : 227 - 236, 2010). The first step uses a calibrated sphere for local hard registration and fixing the translation error. This transformation locates the centre for the sphere in the CAD frame. In the second step, the inverse transformation (involving pure rotation about multiple axes) required to align the inspection points measured on the manufactured part with the CAD point dataset of the model is determined and enforced. This completes the coarse registration enabling fast convergence of the modified ICP algorithm. The new technique has been implemented on complex freeform machined components and the inspection results clearly show that the process is precise and reliable with rapid convergence.

40|$|Flights at low altitudes {{in close}} {{proximity}} to electrical transmission infrastructure present serious navigational challenges: GPS and radio communication quality is variable and yet tight position control is needed to measure defects while avoiding collisions with ground structures. To advance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation technology while accomplishing a task with economic and societal benefit, a high voltage electrical infrastructure <b>inspection</b> <b>reference</b> mission was designed. An integrated air-ground platform was developed for this mission and tested in two days of experimental flights to determine whether navigational augmentation was needed to successfully conduct a controlled inspection experiment. The airborne component of the platform was a multirotor UAV built from commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software, and the ground component was a commercial laptop running open source software. A compact ultraviolet sensor mounted on the UAV can locate 'hot spots' (potential failure points in the electric grid), so long as the UAV flight path adequately samples the airspace near the power grid structures. To improve navigation, the platform was supplemented with two navigation technologies: lidar-to-polyhedron preflight processing for obstacle demarcation and inspection distance planning, and trajectory management software to enforce inspection standoff distance. Both navigation technologies were essential to obtaining useful results from the hot spot sensor in this obstacle-rich, low-altitude airspace. Because the electrical grid extends into crowded airspaces, the UAV position was tracked with NASA unmanned aerial system traffic management (UTM) technology. The following results were obtained: (1) Inspection of high-voltage electrical transmission infrastructure to locate 'hot spots' of ultraviolet emission requires navigation methods that are not broadly available and are not needed at higher altitude flights above ground structures. (2) The sensing capability of a novel airborne UV detector was verified with a standard ground-based instrument. Flights with this sensor showed that UAV measurement operations and recording methods are viable. With improved sensor range, UAVs equipped with compact UV sensors could serve as the detection elements in a self-diagnosing power grid. (3) Simplification of rich lidar maps to polyhedral obstacle maps reduces data volume by orders of magnitude, so that computation with the resultant maps in real time is possible. This enables real-time obstacle avoidance autonomy. Stable navigation may be feasible in the GPS-deprived environment near transmission lines by a UAV that senses ground structures and compares them to these simplified maps. (4) A new, formally verified path conformance software system that runs onboard a UAV was demonstrated in flight for the first time. It successfully maneuvered the aircraft after a sudden lateral perturbation that models a gust of wind, and processed lidar-derived polyhedral obstacle maps in real time. (5) Tracking of the UAV in the national airspace using the NASA UTM technology was a key safety component of this reference mission, since the flights were conducted beneath the landing approach to a heavily used runway. Comparison to autopilot tracking showed that UTM tracking accurately records the UAV position throughout the flight path...|$|E

The two components are assumed to have identical geometries except for a hypothetical flaw of given type, size, and orientation. If the difference between the predicted output signals for the two components is sufficiently large, compared to system noise, then the hypothetical flaw is said to be detectable...|$|R

40|$|Coordinate {{measurement}} machine (CMM) probing {{techniques can}} involve direct mechanical contact (e. g., tactile probing) or diverse non-contact principles (e. g., laser line scan probing). For some applications, contact methods are {{not capable of}} measuring fast enough to ensure 100 % quality controlled parts. A laser line scanning probe uses a laser triangulation-based method to acquire 3 D measurement points on a workpiece relative to a sensor. Mounting the sensor in a 3 D coordinate frame, e. g., in a CMM provides enough information to fully examine the workpiece. These techniques are most commonly exploited in medical industry and industries involving plate materials. A high data density and measurement speed are significant advantages when measuring free-form surfaces by laser line scanning, making the process much more time-efficient. However, high-precision geometrical features (such as cylinders, spheres, etc.) must be measured for locating and aligning the free-form shapes. The accuracy of the equipment therefore has to be assessed. Probe Maximum Permissible Error (MPEP) values below 10 μm have been reported for cutting-edge laser line scanners. This paper compares the major influences on measurements on cylindrical features. First, the aspect-ratio limitations are considered by comparing two inherently different techniques. The stable <b>inspection</b> of <b>reference</b> features is important, while trying to maximize the spatial extent of the measured features. Second, the measurement method is analyzed in two ways: by using a limited sample of the features to increase stability and eliminate interference from neighboring features; by varying the number of scan tracks, which greatly affects the measurement time. status: publishe...|$|R

Taking this into account, this paper proposes {{a method to}} identify high amplitude artifacts with no requirement for visual <b>inspection,</b> electrooscillogram (EOG) <b>reference</b> channel or user assigned parameters. A potential solution to the high amplitude artifacts (HAA) elimination is presented based on blind source separation methods.

Therefore, the number of components related to HAA is variable and depends on the processed signal, {{which means that the}} method is adaptable to the input signal. The results show, when removing the HAA artifacts, the delta band is distorted but all the other frequency bands are preserved.

We conclude that 3 DCT and 3 D physical modeling provide more accurate fracture classification and characterization of fracture of the radial head with less proposed variability in treatment. We did not demonstrate a clear advantage for modeling over 3 DCT reconstructions. Level of Evidence: Diagnostic, Level...|$|R
40|$|Background  Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent {{widely used}} in {{combination}} with others cytotoxic agents in many cancers (breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, etc.). Today, this costly cytotoxic agent is marketed by several pharmaceutical companies who suggest discarding any remainder immediately after use, making it a very costly drug. Purpose  The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the physical-chemical stability of docetaxel stock solution after the first sampling in the vial. Materials and methods  The study was conducted in accordance with European consensus guidelines for the practical stability of anticancer drugs (1)  and by two societies GERPAC and SFPC (2). The physical-chemical stability was assessed on 3 different vials of docetaxel (Taxotere 20 mg/mL). On day 0, 2, 4 and 30 triplicate samples of each vial of docetaxel were assayed by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with UV detection at 230 nm (method validated following ICH guidelines). Docetaxel concentration at day 0 was considered to be 100 % and if the docetaxel concentrations in samples were greater than 90 % in the following days they were considered stable. The reference concentration was degraded by 20 % by addition of a quantity of 0. 01 N NaOH in order to produce and observe primary degradation products. On each vial and on different days, docetaxel UV absorption spectra between 200 and 600 nm, pH and colour change were compared by a visual <b>inspection</b> with <b>reference</b> at T = 0, and finally a turbidimetry method at 350, 410 and 530 nm was used to evaluate the formation of visible and sub-visible particles. Results  After 30 days, for each sample, no colour or pH change were observed, all UV spectra and turbidimetry measures were strictly similar. From day 2 to day 30, docetaxel concentrations were not significantly different to the day 0 solution and no degradation products were observed in any samples. According to these results, no significant drug loss was shown during the study period. Conclusions  At a storage temperature between 20 to 25 °C for 30 days, docetaxel solution at 20 mg/mL was seen to be stable. The sterility of the solution was not tested because the handling environment (Iso 5) was strictly controlled and operator validations are regularly checked...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{automated}} visual {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) inspection system proposed in this paper is designed specifically to detect various types of defects occurred during circuit printing process in manufactory. Two-dimensional HAAR wavelet transform is incorporated in the PCB inspection algorithm of the inspection system. During the inspection, two type of images are required; reference and tested PCB images. The wavelet transform {{is applied to the}} reference and tested PCB images. According to previously proposed wavelet-based PCB <b>inspection</b> algorithm, a <b>reference</b> comparison between the reference and tested PCB images has been done in wavelet domain by employing image difference operation. However, in practice, this operation also bring along the unwanted noise due to misalignment and uneven binarization. Thus, in this paper, for the real-time implementation, the image difference operation between the reference and tested PCB images is replaced with image subtraction. The output of the image subtraction operation can be differentiated as positive, negative, and zero images. By doing so, a noise elimination procedure is applied to positive and negative images, resulting noise free positive and negative images. Lastly, the noise free images are subjected to XOR logic operation to generate the output of the inspection system. During the manufacturing process, since etching usually contributes most destructive defects found on PCBs, it is important to perform the proposed automated visual PCB inspection after the circuit printing and before the etching process.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: THE {{long-term}} {{course of}} bipolar disorder is typified by recurring mood episodes of opposite polarity {{as well as}} mixed states. Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder refers {{to the presence of}} at least 4 mood episodes in the previous 12 months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode. The {{purpose of this study was}} to synthesize data regarding prevalence, clinical correlates, and familial/genetic aspects related to rapid cycling in bipolar disorder. DATASOURCES: we searched the MEDLINE database through September 7, 2013 for articles regarding rapid cycling in bipolar disorder. Searches were performed using the keywords rapid cycling or rapid-cycling. The search strategy was augmented through the <b>inspection</b> of <b>reference</b> lists of relevant review articles. Eligible articles included original studies in English on rapid-cycling bipolar patients according to the criteria defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. STUDY SELECTION: This study followed the recommendations of the Preferred Items for Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The initial search returned 2, 715 articles; 2, 594 were excluded for several reasons (not aligned with objectives, pertaining to bipolar disorder but not focusing on rapid cycling, case reports, and case series). The final review included 119 articles. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators (K. N. F. and D. D.) independently reviewed articles for eligibility. Final decisions regarding eligibility were made by consensus following the full-text review. RESULTS: The literature suggests that rapid cycling affects a significant proportion of bipolar patients and is related to a longer course of illness, an earlier age at onset, and more illegal drug and alcohol abuse and increased suicidality. Year prevalence of rapid cycling among all bipolar patients ranges between 5 %- 33. 3 %, while lifetime prevalence ranges between 25. 8 %- 43 %. The etiology remains unclear, although a causal or triggering role for the use of antidepressants and hypothyroidism is implicated. Rapid cycling seems to represent a transitory phenomenon rather than a stable pattern that characterizes the individual patient and probably is related to a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid cycling is a frequent, although underrecognized, condition in bipolar disorder, and it constitutes a worsening of the primary disorder. There is no good evidence that rapid cycling represents a discrete subtype. Early recognition of this pattern can lead to better treatment strategy and improvement of the long-term course. Conceptualizing rapid cycling according to Research Domain Criteria will be an important advance...|$|R
