50|$|The tower {{measures}} 11.5 by 10.3 m {{and rises}} four storeys to a corbelled parapet walk, with bartizans (open round towers) at the corners. At the north-west corner is a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>cap</b> house (a small room covering {{the top of}} the stair), with a pyramidal roof. The vaulted basement contains a well, and the main hall is at first-floor level.|$|E
40|$|Arrays of single-crystalline ZnO nanonails with {{tapering}} diameters and ultra-thin caps {{have been}} successfully synthesized on a silicon substrate via a simple catalyst-free thermal evaporation method. Each of the ZnO nanonails consists a nanowire (stem) {{on the bottom and}} an ultra-thin symmetrical <b>hexagonal</b> <b>cap</b> on the top. Structural characterization reveals that the synthesized ZnO nanonail has a wurtzite (WZ) structure with a preferred growth direction of [0001] in the stem and in the cap. Remarkably, the ultra-thin cap shows a diameter-to-thickness ratio of over 20 : 1, which is much higher in magnitude than those reported in previous works. Based on the systematic morphological characterization and structural analysis, a self-catalyzed vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism followed by a vapor–solid (VS) process is proposed to explain the growth of the nanonails. Optical properties are also investigated with Raman and photoluminescence (PL) techniques, which show good crystal quality of the synthesized nanonails...|$|E
50|$|Further {{alterations}} {{had to be}} made in 1954, {{under the}} supervision of the shrine's pastor, Father Anthony Corey. At this time, for reasons of safety, the beautiful original towers were shortened, and the cupolas replaced by heavier, <b>hexagonal</b> <b>caps,</b> thus considerably altering the exterior of the building, and detracting form its former beauty. This was after the Jesuits left the parish and was staffed by priest of the Archdiocese.|$|R
50|$|The WWII models had <b>hexagonal</b> gas <b>caps</b> and {{hourglass}} frames. They {{were also}} called the M2-2, M2 for the tank groups and -2 for the wand type.|$|R
40|$|Worth, Texas, exhibit {{an unusual}} cuticular morphology. Comparison of the cuticle of extant Raninoides louisianensis {{to that of}} C. punctata reveals general {{similarities}} in endocuticular, exocuticular, and epicuticular ultrastructure; however, their gross morphology is strikingly different. The surface of the carapace of C. punctata appears pebbled, much like {{the surface of a}} basketball, with closely packed, <b>hexagonal</b> <b>caps.</b> In cross-section, these caps are the upper portion of fungiform structures within convoluted exocuticle. Along the anterior margin, anterolateral margins, and pterygostomial region of the carapace of C. punctata each cap dips slightly posteriorly, creating a series of tiny terraces. In contrast to terrace lines, questa lines, spines, and nodes that provide frictional resistance in interactions with coarse-grained sediments, the fine relief and contouring of the pebbled surface of the carapace of C. punctata provides frictional resistance in interactions with fine-grained sediments. Cretacoranina dichrous, C. trechmanni, C. testacea, and C. schloen-bachi, as well as Eucorystes carteri were all found to possess variations of the exocuticular structures seen on C. punctata. This pebbled surface has not been recognized in any other decapod taxon, nor has its structure and function been described previously...|$|R
50|$|The Alvah Horace Whitmarsh House is a {{historic}} house at 711 Pecan Street in Texarkana, Arkansas. This 2-1/2 story wood frame structure {{is one of the}} city's finest Queen Anne Victorians, located in a neighborhood that was fashionable {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. The house has an elaborately decorated front porch and a three-story <b>hexagonal</b> tower, <b>capped</b> by a pointed roof, at its northeast corner. The house was built in 1894 for Alvah Whitmarsh, a manager at the local Buchanan Lumber Company and a local leader in civic affairs.|$|R
50|$|This {{polyhedron}} in a space-filling tessellation {{can be seen}} as the Voronoi tessellation of the face-centered cubic lattice. It is the Brillouin zone of body centered cubic (bcc) crystals. Some minerals such as garnet form a rhombic dodecahedral crystal habit. Honey bees use {{the geometry}} of rhombic dodecahedra to form honeycombs from a tessellation of cells each of which is a <b>hexagonal</b> prism <b>capped</b> with half a rhombic dodecahedron. The rhombic dodecahedron also appears in the unit cells of diamond and diamondoids. In these cases, four vertices (alternate threefold ones) are absent, but the chemical bonds lie on the remaining edges.|$|R
40|$|Our {{studies show}} that VSi 12 - adopts a V-centered {{hexagonal}} prism with a singlet spin state. The addition of the second V atom leads to a <b>capped</b> <b>hexagonal</b> antiprism for V 2 Si 12 - in a doublet spin state. Most interestingly, V 3 Si 12 - exhibits a ferrimagnetic, bicapped hexagonal antiprism wheel-like structure with a total spin of 4 mu(B) ...|$|R
5000|$|The symbol {{is usually}} shown as a {{fountain}} enclosed in a <b>hexagonal</b> structure <b>capped</b> by a rounded dome {{and supported by}} eight columns. The fountain of living waters, fons vivus is a baptismal font (a water fountain in which one is baptized, and thus reborn with Christ), and is often surrounded by animals associated with Baptism such as the hart. The font probably represents the octagonal Lateran Baptistery in Rome, consecrated by Pope Sixtus III (432-440), which was iconographically associated with the fountain of the water of life mentioned in [...]The best examples date from the Carolingian period: the Godescalc Evangelistary made to commemorate the Baptism of the son of Charlemagne in 781, and in the Soissons Gospels.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{sits on a}} trapezoidal {{shape of}} the lot in between the Legislative and Post Office buildings. Due to the monotony of the building envelope, one cannot distinguish the principal facade from the main entrance properly. The south entrance has a balcony emphasized by three arches resting on Corinthian columns while the north rear has the same design treatment with {{the east and west}} sides, but has pediments all throughout and a tall, <b>hexagonal</b> clock tower <b>capped</b> by a dome.|$|R
5000|$|In 1879, a large {{monument}} {{was erected}} in St John's churchyard in Stratford Broadway, {{to commemorate the}} 13 and others who were executed or tortured in Stratford during the persecutions. Designed by J T Newman, it consists of an ornate <b>hexagonal</b> column, <b>capped</b> with a 12-sided spire rising to a height of 65 feet. One side of the column carries a terra cotta plaque, sculpted in relief, based on the illustration of the martyrdom in Foxe's book. The other panels carry {{the names of the}} 13 martyrs, together with Elizabeth Warne (burnt 23 August 1555), Stephen Harwood (burnt 30 August 1555), Hugh Laverock and John Apprice (both burnt 15 May 1556). Also included are Patrick Packingham, who was actually executed at Uxbridge and the Reverend Thomas Rose, the Vicar of All Saints Church, West Ham, who [...] "was tortured and exiled for preaching against auricular confession, transubstantiation, purgatory and images". The memorial is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England.|$|R
40|$|D- 2 loaded to {{saturation}} at 25 K {{into the}} porous coordination framework Cu- 3 (1, 3, 5 -benzenetricarboxylate) (2) was studied using neutron powder diffraction. A saturation loading equivalent to 6. 1 wt % H- 2 is reached at 25 K. D- 2 {{is located at}} up to nine distinct sites with six stable at saturation and three "metastable" sites at doses intermediate to saturation. Filling of the trimodal pore system is complex, and a concentration dependency on the optimal D- 2 arrangement is noted. A dynamic rearrangement of the D- 2 in the pores to a cubic-closed packed equilibrium structure occurs at doses close to saturation, with 4 D- 2 molecules arranged tetrahedrally in the smallest pore, 32 D- 2 arranged in a truncated octahedron with <b>capped</b> <b>hexagonal</b> faces in the intermediate sized pore, and 48 D- 2 arranged in a face-capped rhombic dodecahedron in the largest pore. The equilibrium structure of D- 2 in the largest pore at doses close to and at saturation {{was found to be}} the same arrangement that is optimal for 48 circles on a sphere. The structural response of the framework to D- 2 adsorption is dependent on the amount of D- 2, where the host lattice expands with increasing amount of adsorbed D- 2 at low and high D- 2 doses, and contracts upon adsorption of intermediate amounts of D- 2, commensurate with the known flexibility exhibited by this framework. © 2011, American Chemical Societ...|$|R
