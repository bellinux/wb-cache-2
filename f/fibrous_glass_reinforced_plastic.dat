40|$|The {{underground}} Pipeline {{materials in}} Egypt due to frictional losses cause annual service cost {{which makes it}} uneconomic. For pressure pipe, head loss must be remunerated by pumping or larger diameter, while for gravity flow pipe head loss must be remunerated by slope of the installed pipe. The present paper demonstrates the characteristic of pipe, the influence of flow loss and cost of frictional resistance. The performance of head loss of <b>Glass</b> <b>Reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> Pipes to different materials with varying internal roughness were analyzed in this work. The analysis demonstrated that in pressure pipe the head loss of <b>Glass</b> <b>Reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> Pipes is less than ductile, prestressed concrete and steel pipes for different diameters by 4. 65 % to 8. 13 % when the pipes are in normal condition and by 10. 39 % to 15. 35 % when the pipes are in poor condition. For gravity pipe in <b>Glass</b> <b>Reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> Pipe the slope and head loss is less by 68. 87 % than ductile, prestressed concrete and steel pipes when the pipes are in normal condition.
