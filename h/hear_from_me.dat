500|$|Gerard George Lowe {{came from}} Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a {{chemical}} engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore {{to shop for}} electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: [...] "I will call you the moment I check into the hotel {{to give you the}} contact number. If you do not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> on 10 March, it would mean that I would have a seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. But if I do call you on 10 March, that would mean that I have not managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and I apologize for that. That's a thing that you won't <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> again. I hope I didn't offend anybody outside the circle that we trust." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album was {{tentatively}} set to be Hot Like Fire, later changed to Imagination, before being confirmed to be Irresistible on March 16, 2001. In the United States, Irresistible was initially slated for release on March 20, 2001. However, due to undisclosed reasons, the release was pushed to June 5, 2001. A listening party was arranged by AOL on June 4, 2001, a day before the album's release date. The album's release was celebrated with a release party at the New York Water Club. Simpson rode down Manhattan's East River on a yacht decorated with banners for the celebration, which included a water ski show, a fireboat spraying water, and fireworks. Simpson said the album's release was a critical moment in her career, one [...] "which could send her to stardom or obscurity." [...] In an interview, she said [...] "I'm right there ready to explode." [...] "Or I could go pfft [...] No one could ever <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> again," [...] she added. In the United Kingdom, Irresistible was released on July 16, 2001, and in Japan on May 25, 2001.|$|E

2500|$|To {{the views}} of the Gaudiya Sampradaya, the Bhagavad-gita states that this bhakti-yoga is secretive: - [...] "Just <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>Me</b> again about the most {{confidential}} part of the instructions in Bhagavad-gītā." [...] It is also described as such in Bhagavata Purana Vashnavas of ISKCON often stress their view that in both cases Krishna is speaking about himself, aham and me in Sanskrit mean, I am and Me respectively.

2500|$|At another point, a death-obsessed Gordon {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "Better a bullet to the brain than to flicker out unheeded". In a letter that reached Cairo in December, Gordon wrote: [...] "Farewell. You will never <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> again. I fear {{that there will be}} treachery in the garrison, and all will be over by Christmas." [...] On 14 December 1884, Gordon wrote the last entry in his diary, which read: [...] "Now MARK THIS, if the Expeditionary Force and I ask for no more than two hundred men, does not come in ten days, the town may fall; and I have done my best for the honour of our country. Goodbye, C. G. Gordon".

"So {{she is just}} a lay sister, a sort of servant, you know, but she is a {{favourite}} {{and often}} goes to market for them, and when she does she generally drops {{in here for a}} few minutes for a talk; for though she was only a child when I was at the farm we were great friends, and she <b>hears</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> how all the people she used to know are getting on." ...|$|R
