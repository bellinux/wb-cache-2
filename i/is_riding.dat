50|$|Dual-sports, by definition, are compromises - {{giving up}} some dirt {{performance}} to <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> {{on the street}} and some street performance to <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> in the dirt. The merits of a particular model can only be judged relative to the owner’s intended mix of dirt and street riding. Although aficionados may argue the merits of different models, versatile dual-sports can be desirable alternatives to more specialized motorcycles that can only <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> in one environment.|$|R

Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.|$|E

Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she <b>is</b> <b>riding</b> an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.|$|E

25|$|In {{relation}} to this interpretation, William Empson suggests that Katherina was originally performed {{by an adult}} male actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on several occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of over-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the horse falls on her as she <b>is</b> <b>riding</b> to Petruchio's home, and {{she is able to}} lift it off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he is beating. Empson argues that the point is not that Katherina is, as a woman, weak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds herself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a strong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their parts.|$|E
25|$|One night, Melancholia passes {{closely as}} {{predicted}} by the scientists, to great relief. The next day, however, Claire realizes when using a homemade device recommended by John that Melancholia is circling back as {{predicted by the}} Internet article. She begins to panic, looking for John and finding him dead in the black horse’s stable, having poisoned himself. Claire releases the horse. Justine, appearing to recover, had a bath, stating that she is now all clean. A hailstorm starts. Claire tries to escape the estate with her son but the golf cart she <b>is</b> <b>riding</b> shuts down as she attempts to cross the same bridge as Justine did earlier. Returned to the lodge, Claire begins to accept the inevitable and later suggests getting together on the terrace with wine and music. Justine dismisses her idea with brutal honesty.|$|E
25|$|Ipomadon {{follows the}} maiden and her dwarf, with the maiden hurling insults and telling him in no {{uncertain}} terms to go away, {{in much the same way}} as a maiden representing the imprisoned lady of Synadoun will do to the hero of Thomas Chestre's fourteenth century Middle English Arthurian romance Libeaus Desconus. At last, having defeated many hostile knights along the way, Ipomadon, the maiden and her dwarf arrive near the city where the Proud is being besieged. Lyoline is on horseback outside the city wall, shouting great boasts. Ipomadon removes himself to a forest nearby, while the maiden enters the city. Ipomadon sends his cousin out to discover what colour armour Lyoline is wearing. He is wearing black armour and <b>is</b> <b>riding</b> a black horse. Ipomadon dons black armour and rides out on a black horse, to challenge Lyoline to single combat for the hand of the Proud.|$|E

25|$|Dancing {{begins in}} the square and some toreadors try to kidnap the girls they fancy, but their {{relatives}} and lovers hasten to their aid. At this moment Don Quixote arrives mounted on Rocinante, followed by Sancho, who <b>is</b> <b>riding</b> a donkey. At his master's command Sancho sounds his rusted horn, causing the townspeople to cover their ears. Lorenzo runs out of his inn, and Don Quixote, taking him for the lord of a famous castle, dismounts Rocinante and, falling to his knees, begs {{to be allowed to}} serve him. Charmed, Lorenzo invites the knight to sit on his balcony. Sancho remains in the square where he is surrounded by girls who induce him {{to take part in a}} game of blind man's bluff. Then some boys bring in a blanket on which they place Sancho and proceed to toss him into the air. Don Quixote hurries to his assistance and sets him free.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} LucasArts {{adventure}} games, Full Throttle is a single-player video {{game in which}} the player controls {{the actions of the}} player character from a third-person perspective using a computer mouse and point and click interface. By positioning the cursor and clicking the left mouse button, the player causes the player character, Ben, to move around a scene. In certain contexts the cursor will become an arrow (if Ben is on foot) or a directional road sign (if Ben <b>is</b> <b>riding</b> his motorcycle); clicking these causes Ben to travel to another scene. As with other LucasArts graphic adventure games of the era, dialogue plays a large part in the game, presenting story elements and information necessary to advance. During conversations with other characters, several choices of dialogue are presented. The currently selected choice is highlighted, and once clicked, the player character responds with the selected choice. Choosing the correct response allows the player to advance the conversation and ultimately advance the scene.|$|E
25|$|Annoyed at Sir Eglamour’s success, {{the next}} task that the earl gives his daughter’s suitor {{is to kill}} the Boar of Sidon, a dreadful beast that has laid waste to the area where it lives. Sir Eglamour spends a month {{travelling}} out to Sidon where he locates this boar by seeing all the bodies of dead men strewn about the ground; in a scene that is perhaps mimicked by one featuring a Rabbit of Caerbannog in the irreverent Monty Python movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. After a struggle with this boar that lasts for three days, Sir Eglamour kills the ferocious creature. His feat of bravery and skill-at-arms is noticed by the King of Sidon, who <b>is</b> <b>riding</b> nearby {{on the day that}} Sir Eglamour at last overcomes this beast. The king takes Sir Eglamour back to his castle where his daughter (beautiful, of course) is being threatened by a giant. This giant is demanding her hand in marriage and when he appears, Sir Eglamour kills him singlehandedly. The King of Sidon at once offers to confer onto Sir Eglamour all his titles and lands, as well as the hand of his daughter in marriage.|$|E
