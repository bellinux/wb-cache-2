5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek <b>force,</b> <b>the</b> Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian <b>force.</b> <b>The</b> ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|A bout between Kaz and Black Reign {{was next}} on the card. The {{duration}} of the contest was seven minutes and twenty-eight seconds. Kaz won after countering a Reverse DDT by Black Reign, into a reverse DDT of his own to <b>force</b> <b>the</b> back of Black Reign's head into the mat for the pinfall. Afterwards, Kaz stole Black Reign's rat Misty.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to <b>force</b> <b>the</b> Allies into battle but as attempts to <b>force</b> <b>the</b> Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers <b>force</b> <b>the</b> chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to <b>force</b> <b>the</b> bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E

50|$|Untripped rollovers {{occur when}} {{cornering}} <b>forces</b> destabilize <b>the</b> vehicle. As a vehicle rounds a corner, three forces act on it: tire <b>forces</b> (<b>the</b> centripetal <b>force),</b> inertial effects (<b>the</b> centrifugal <b>force),</b> and gravity. <b>The</b> cornering <b>forces</b> from <b>the</b> tire push the vehicle towards {{the center of}} <b>the</b> curve. This <b>force</b> acts at ground level, below the center of mass. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> of inertia acts horizontally through the vehicle's center of mass away {{from the center of}} the turn. These two <b>forces</b> make <b>the</b> vehicle roll towards the outside of <b>the</b> curve. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> of <b>the</b> vehicle's weight acts downward through the center of mass in the opposite direction. When the tire and inertial forces are enough to overcome <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of gravity, <b>the</b> vehicle starts to turn over.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem in}} {{first-class}} free end lever (distal extension base) Removable Partial Denture (RPD) is <b>the</b> lever <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> retention point that may harm the abutment tooth {{which has been}} discussed many times, but <b>the</b> amount of <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> fulcrum point (rest) on the abutment tooth has never discussed yet. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze <b>the</b> amount of <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> fulcrum point in the first class lever of lower free end denture on the two dimension static models. The analysis result reveals that <b>the</b> <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> fulcrum point is bigger than <b>the</b> mastication <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> free end saddle, or <b>the</b> <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> fulcrum point is equal to the sum of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of <b>the</b> saddle and <b>the</b> <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> retention point. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> fulcrum point may cause trauma to the periodontal tissue of the abutment tooth. To decrease <b>the</b> amount of <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> fulcrum point is by mastication <b>force</b> limitation, decreasing <b>the</b> distance between the mastication point and the fulcrum point; and increasing the distance between retention point and fulcrum point. For clinical application, there are many biological variables to be considered...|$|R

5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence <b>Force.</b> <b>The</b> option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E

5|$|Despite these difficulties, the city, {{commanded}} by Deputy Voivode Samuel Drucki-Sokoliński, held out throughout 1633 while the Commonwealth, under its newly elected King Władysław IV, organised a relief <b>force.</b> <b>The</b> Sejm had been {{informed about the}} Russian invasion by 30 October 1632, and, starting in November, had discussed the possibility of relief. However, the process was delayed until the spring of 1633, when the Sejm officially sanctioned {{a declaration of war}} and authorised a large payment (6.5million zlotys, the highest tax contribution during Władysław's entire reign) for the raising of a suitable <b>force.</b> <b>The</b> intended relief force would have an effective strength of about 21,500 men and would include: 24 chorągiews of Winged Hussars (~3,200 horses), 27 chorągiews of light cavalry—also known as Cossack cavalry but not composed of Cossacks—(3,600 horses), 10 squadrons of raitars (~1,700 horses), 7 Lithuanian petyhor regiments (~780 horses), 7 large regiments of dragoons (~2,250 horses), and ~20 regiments of infantry (~12,000 men).
