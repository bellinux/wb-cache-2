Due to low prices in recent years, the entire plant has run largely on natural gas, which has dramatically decreased its emissions profile. A sixth generating unit, {{known as a}} combined-cycle generator was completed in 2011.

50|$|Dry sorbent {{injection}} {{involves the}} addition of an alkaline material (usually hydrated lime, soda ash, or sodium bicarbonate) into the gas stream to react with the acid gases. The sorbent can be injected directly into several different locations: the combustion process, the flue <b>gas</b> <b>duct</b> (ahead of the particulate control device), or an open reaction chamber (if one exists). The acid gases react with the alkaline sorbents to form solid salts which are removed in the particulate control device. These simple systems can achieve only limited acid gas (SO2 and HCl) removal efficiencies. Higher collection efficiencies {{can be achieved by}} increasing the flue gas humidity (i.e., cooling using water spray). These devices have been used on medical waste incinerators and a few municipal waste combustors.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface area}} of the {{building}} covers 144 m2, the lower diameter being 8.25m and the upper diameter 3m. The chimney consists of 4,140 tons of fireproof clay bricks from the Grube Ilse near Senftenberg. The mortar consists of 170 tons of Bohemian lime, 1,030 tons of sand from the river Elbe and 60 tons of cement. The total mass has been estimated to be 5,400 tons. The chimney can be climbed using step irons {{on the inside and}} outside. To stabilise the chimney iron rings were attached which are spaced 5.5m {{at the bottom of the}} chimney down to 2m near the top. It is connected to the smeltering works at the bottom of the valley by a 500m long flue <b>gas</b> <b>duct.</b>|$|E
50|$|Preconcentrated {{waste acid}} from the preconcentrator (III / IV) is {{injected}} into the reactor (I) by means {{of one or more}} spray booms (VIII) bearing one or more injection nozzles each. Injection takes place at reactor top at a pressure between 4 and 10 bar. The reactor is directly fired by tangentially mounted burners that create a hot swirl. Temperatures inside the reactor vary between 700 °C (burner level) and 370 °C (roast gas exit duct).In the reactor the conversion of droplets of preconcentrated waste acid into iron oxide powder and hydrogen chloride gas takes place. Hydrogen Chloride leaves the reactor through the top, while iron oxide powder is removed from the reactor bottom by means of mechanical extraction devices. A cyclone (II) in the roast <b>gas</b> <b>duct</b> ensures separation and feed back of larger oxide particles carried by the roast gas.|$|E

5000|$|In August 1963 {{during a}} hot run test {{on the first}} reactor, which had not then been loaded with nuclear fuel, {{problems}} were encountered due to noise from the single stage axial flow gas circulators. This could be heard up to five miles away, and personnel working at the station had to wear ear defenders. After unexplained drops in the mass flow rate and motor driving current in number 3 and 5 gas circulators, the hot run tests were stopped and the gas circuit opened up. Severe mechanical damage to the blading and diffuser sections of the number 3 and 5 gas circulators was observed. Large sections of the diffusers had broken away, and extensive fatigue cracking {{was found in the}} outer tapering shell and central axial cone. Large pieces of the diffuser casing had entered the gas circulator blades and caused heavy impact damage, and large amounts of debris had been transported down the <b>gas</b> <b>duct.</b> The Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs), which were provided to enable the performance of individual gas circulators to be [...] "trimmed," [...] were found to be extensively damaged, and the rotor blades and outlet guide vanes also had extensive impact and fatigue damage. Large numbers of the nuts and bolts involved had been shaken loose.|$|E
5000|$|The overly complex {{design of}} the reactor, which is {{contrary}} to the general concept of self moderated thorium reactors designed in the U.S., also suffered from the unplanned high destruction rate of pebbles during the test series at the start up, and the resulting higher contamination of the containment structure. Pebble debris and graphite dust blocked some of the coolant channels in the bottom reflector, as was discovered during fuel removal some years after final shut-down. A failure of insulation required frequent reactor shut-downs for inspection, because the insulation could not be repaired. Further metallic components in the hot <b>gas</b> <b>duct</b> failed in September 1988, probably due to thermal fatigue induced by unexpected hot gas currents. This failure led to a long-term shut-down for inspections. In August, 1989, the THTR company almost went bankrupt, but was financially rescued by the government. Because of the unexpected high costs of THTR operation, and this accident, there was no longer any interest in THTR reactors. The government decided to terminate the THTR operation at the end of September, 1989. This particular reactor was built, despite strong criticism at the design phase. Most of those design critique's by German physicists, and by American physicists at the National Laboratory level, went ignored until it was shut down. Nearly every problem encountered by the THTR 300 reactor were predicted by the physicists that criticized it as [...] "overly complex." ...|$|E
5000|$|An anomaly {{occurred}} during the second burn of the Briz-M upper stage. As a result, the satellite failed to reach the planned orbit. The Russian commission investigating the anomaly determined the cause to be a rupture of the <b>gas</b> <b>duct</b> between the gas generator and the propellant pump turbine in the Briz M main engine, which caused the upper stage engine to shut down two minutes early. [...] AMC-14 was the 36th A2100 spacecraft and was expected to provide more than 15 years of service life. SES and Lockheed Martin explored ways to attempt to bring the functioning satellite into its correct orbital position, and subsequently began attempting to move the satellite into geosynchronous orbit {{by means of a}} lunar flyby (as done a decade earlier with HGS-1). In April 2008, it was announced that this had been abandoned after it was discovered that Boeing held a patent on the trajectory that would be required. [...] At the time, a lawsuit was ongoing between SES and Boeing, and Boeing refused to allow the trajectory to be used unless SES dropped its case. Another company had expressed interest in purchasing the satellite, however SES began procedures to expedite the satellite's immediate de-orbit. While it is expected that the patent would not stand up to legal challenge, SES intend to de-orbit the spacecraft in order to collect the insurance payout. If this attempt had been successful, the extra use of fuel needed to correct the orbital error would have significantly reduced AMC-14's originally expected service life of 15 years to just four.|$|E

50|$|Note: the <b>duct</b> <b>gas</b> {{velocity}} {{is chosen}} to minimize duct dust dropout. Cement and lime plant duct velocity at normal operations is 3000 to 3200 foot per minute, lead plant velocities are 4000 to 4500 foot per minute, as the dust is heavier. Other industries, such as grain have lower <b>gas</b> velocities. Higher <b>duct</b> <b>gas</b> velocity may require more powerful fans than lower duct velocities.|$|R

50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the <b>gas</b> <b>duct</b> rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the <b>gas</b> <b>duct.</b> Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|E
40|$|A hot <b>gas</b> <b>duct</b> is an {{indispensable}} component for the nuclear-process heat {{applications of the}} Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR), which has to fulfill three requirements: to withstand high temperature, high pressure, and large pressure transient.

40|$|The {{double-ended}} guillotine break (DEGB) of {{the horizontal}} coaxial <b>gas</b> <b>duct</b> accident {{is a serious}} air ingress accident of the high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed module (HTR-PM). Because the graphite is widely used as the structure material and the fuel element matrix of HTR-PM, the oxidation analyses of this severe air ingress accident have got enough attention in the safety analyses of the HTR-PM. The DEGB of the horizontal coaxial <b>gas</b> <b>duct</b> accident is calculated by using the TINTE code in this paper.
