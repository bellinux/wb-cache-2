5|$|As a consequence, the Indonesians {{planned to}} {{increase}} their activity against the Gumbang, Tringgus and Bukit <b>Knuckle</b> areas, while additional forces were also subsequently redeployed against Serian. In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak, and these would later result in further fighting. Perhaps in retailiation, Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions along the border, firing 13 rounds, while a further 25 rounds were fired at 11:00am. There were no casualties.|$|E
500|$|Sonic & <b>Knuckles</b> {{features}} [...] "lock-on technology" [...] {{that allows}} players {{to open the}} hatch on the cartridge and insert a second cartridge. When Sonic 3 is inserted, the player can play through both games as one, Sonic 3 & <b>Knuckles.</b> This features several changes to the games, such as slightly altered level layouts, the ability to play through Sonic 3 levels as <b>Knuckles</b> or Sonic & <b>Knuckles</b> levels as Tails, {{and the ability to}} save progress in Sonic & <b>Knuckles</b> levels. Additionally, combining the cartridges {{is the only way to}} collect [...] "Super Emeralds", earned by accessing Special Stages in the Sonic & <b>Knuckles</b> levels after collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds from Sonic 3. When all Super Emeralds have been collected, Sonic, <b>Knuckles,</b> and Tails can transform into Hyper Sonic, Hyper <b>Knuckles,</b> and Super Tails respectively, each with unique abilities. Inserting Sonic 2 unlocks <b>Knuckles</b> the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, wherein the player can play Sonic 2 using Knuckles' abilities.|$|R

5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also carried out, {{with the first}} train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 passengers passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to <b>knuckle</b> couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing flashing lights were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E

A fistfight ensues, but Ethan gains the upper hand and subdues Jack. When he regains consciousness, Jack continues on, eventually finding Charlie, who has been hanged by Ethan. Kate cuts him down, and Jack furiously performs CPRdespite Kate's pleas that he is dead. Jack does not give up and brings Charlie back to life.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure of Link has a {{more complex}} combat system than its predecessor. Armed with a sword and shield, Link must {{alternate}} between standing and crouching positions in order to attack enemies and defend himself; for example, the Iron <b>Knuckle</b> enemy changes the height of its attack and its shield depending on Link's current stance, forcing Link to change stances until {{he has a chance}} to attack safely. Link has the ability to jump, which can be used for attacking tall or airborne enemies, and can be used for evasion. Eventually, he can learn techniques for downward and upward stabs in midair.|$|E

5|$|Dyer {{was born}} in 1888 in Cardiff, Wales to a Welsh mother and Irish father. Dyer's mother came from a musical {{background}} {{and was a member}} of the Royal Welsh Glee, while his father was a bare <b>knuckle</b> boxer. Dyer showed promise as a baritone singer and was trained by Clara Novello Davies, mother of Ivor Novello. He was also an impressive sportsman, as a swimmer and, like his father, a boxer; but his family's poverty decreed that he took up boxing over his singing to provide an income. Dyer fought in the travelling show booths for quick money, but when this was discovered by the amateur boxing association, it led to him being stripped of his amateur status, which in turn saw his hopes of competing at the 1908 Summer Olympics in boxing and in swimming dashed.|$|E
5|$|On October 12, Burke {{broke his}} {{right index finger}} below the middle <b>knuckle.</b> He had been a {{favorite}} for NBA Rookie of the Year, but was listed as out indefinitely. On October 14, an October 15 surgery to insert surgical pins was announced. The 2013–14 Jazz were scheduled to begin the 2013–14 NBA season on October 30. Although early reports suggested an 8‑to12-week hiatus, ESPN The Magazine Chris Broussard reported only a 6-week absence was expected. On November 11, Burke's finger was reevaluated. Without Burke, the Jazz began the season 0–8 with Lucas and Jamaal Tinsley playing point guard. On November 12, the Jazz announced that Burke had only been cleared to begin individual drills, {{that he would be}} reevaluated November 25 and that Tinsley had been waived. Jazz head coach Tyrone Corbin reported that by November 13 Burke was dribbling a basketball painfree. On November 20, Burke announced he would make his career debut against the New Orleans Pelicans for the 1–11 Jazz, but he was not expected to start.|$|E
5|$|The first Australian {{fighting}} patrol into Kalimantan began on 24 May with two platoons, 5 and 11 Platoons, from B Company and a forward observation party, departing the company base at Bukit <b>Knuckle</b> {{under the command}} of Major William Broderick. The patrol—designated Operation Article—involved an ambush patrol along the bank of the Sungei Koemba river. After several days of careful and laborious movement through the thick jungle Broderick established a patrol base on the high ground overlooking the river on 26 May and sent forward a small reconnaissance party of three men with Lieutenant Patrick Beale. The forward element subsequently detected a party of Indonesians in a re-entrant below, talking loudly and firing random shots, seemingly unaware of the proximity of the Australians and unconcerned with basic notions of security.|$|E
25|$|<b>Knuckles</b> {{is a minor}} {{character}} in Sonic Underground. Sonic, his sister Sonia, and his brother Manic meet <b>Knuckles</b> atop his home, the Floating Island, while searching for their mother. <b>Knuckles</b> is initially skeptical of them but soon accepts their help in protecting the Island and its guardian Chaos Emerald from villains Sleet and Dingo. Later on, the siblings recruit <b>Knuckles</b> to help them deactivate Doctor Robotnik's giant fortress, as it is powered by Emeralds and he can control them. They succeed, but Sleet and Dingo accidentally break the Emerald, unleashing gradually effective but massive energy upon the planet Mobius, and <b>Knuckles</b> enlists one of his relatives to help them control it, with mediocre results. Reluctantly, <b>Knuckles</b> cuts a deal with Robotnik {{to turn over the}} hedgehogs in exchange for setting Mobius right; Robotnik succeeds and starts turning the hedgehogs into robots, but <b>Knuckles</b> betrays Robotnik to rescue his friends.|$|R

5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels, who {{received}} the fans' vote {{to be part of}} the Triple Threat match. Early in the match, Cena performed a back body drop on Angle, sending him outside. Michaels, who was thrown out of the ring, received the upper hand over Cena until Angle returned to the mat, performing a variety of suplexes on both Michaels and Cena. Mid-way in the match, Angle and Michaels double teamed Cena, lifting him in the air, crashing face-first on the Spanish announce table. Back in the ring, Angle Angle Slammed Michaels from the top turnbuckles. Angle then tried to apply the ankle lock on Michaels, but Cena entered the ring, clotheslining Angle out of the ring. Cena proceeded and back body dropped Michaels, attempting to perform a Five <b>Knuckle</b> Shuffle but Kurt Angle pulled Cena out of the ring, tossing him over the security barricade. Toward the end, Angle caught Cena in the ankle lock. Michaels, who was on the outside, delivered a Diving Elbow Drop, on Angle and performed Sweet Chin Music on him. After that, Cena executed the FU on Michaels and pinned him to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as <b>knuckle</b> joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} a Janney coupler and the buckeye coupler, the <b>knuckle</b> coupler is the {{derivative}} of a coupling device that links and connects rolling railway cars such as passenger, refrigerator, freight, and stock cars together on railroad track. The <b>knuckle</b> coupler have a bifurcated drawhead and a revolving hook, which, when brought in contact with another coupler, automatically interlocks with its mate. <b>Knuckle</b> couplers replaced the much more dangerous link-and-pin couplers and {{became the basis for}} standard coupler design {{for the rest of the}} 19th century. The <b>knuckle</b> coupler was invented and patented by Eli H. Janney in 1873.|$|E
25|$|The {{knuckles}} of {{the four}} fingers of one's hand and the spaces between them {{can be used to}} remember the lengths of the months.

When the <b>knuckle</b> of the index finger is reached (July), go back to the first <b>knuckle</b> (or over to the first <b>knuckle</b> on the other fist, held next to the first) and continue with August. This physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades.|$|E

All new Cape gauge locomotives and rolling stock acquired from that year were equipped with AAR <b>knuckle</b> couplers. Conversion of all older rolling stock was to take several years and both coupler types could still be seen on some vehicles into the late 1950s.
