50|$|Octaved Cs {{begin the}} piece, {{immediately}} {{followed by a}} <b>downward</b> <b>run</b> made up of an arpeggiated C7 chord. A furious set of impetuous notes then climb slowly, and it returns to the octaved Cs and the <b>downward</b> <b>run.</b> The furious set of notes climbs even higher {{and a set of}} loud chords blare in fff. The left hand then plays some loud, low pitched trills in succession. After that, the right hand plays some intense arpeggiated figures, and then a final closing chord. This étude is one of the easiest to play along with Transcendental Étude No.3 (Paysage).|$|E

The first {{versions of the}} St. John Passion contained two additional lines from Matthew mentioning the weeping of the disciple Peter and the tearing of the temple curtain. Bach composed the weeping in an expressive melisma and the tearing in a forceful <b>downward</b> <b>run</b> followed by tremolo, but removed the parts in later versions.|$|E

500|$|The {{second thought}} of the verse, [...] "" [...] (and lifted up the lowly), is sung without {{introduction}} as a melisma of four measures, which includes <b>downward</b> <b>runs</b> but in a steadily rising sequence and ending similarly to the sequence of motif four, on [...] "", but a modest downward line on [...] "" [...] (the lowly). After a shorter ritornello, the tenor sings the complete text again, the first part in a slightly modified version, but the exaltation considerably expanded. Nonetheless, the ritornello in full length is repeated at the end.|$|R
40|$|A Directional Change Event {{can be a}} Downturn Event or an Upturn Event. A <b>Downward</b> <b>Run</b> is {{a period}} between a Downturn Event and the next Upturn Event. An Upward Run is a period between an Upturn Event and the next Downturn Event. In a <b>Downward</b> <b>Run,</b> a Last Low is {{constantly}} updated to the minimum of (a) the current price and (b) the Last Low. In an Upward Run, a Last High is constantly updated to the maximum of (a) the current price and (b) the Last High. In a <b>Downward</b> <b>Run,</b> given a Threshold (a percentage), an Upturn Event is an event when the price {{is higher than the}} Last Low by the Threshold. An Upturn Event terminates a <b>Downward</b> <b>Run,</b> and starts an Upward Run. In an Upward Run, given a Threshold (a percentage), a Downturn Event is an event when the price is lower than the Last High by the Threshold. A Downturn Event terminates an Upward Run, and starts a <b>Downward</b> <b>Run.</b> The above definitions are mutual recursive. Operationally, we set both the Last High and Last Low to the price {{at the beginning of the}} sequence. A Downturn Event is followed by a Downward Overshoot Event, which is ended by the next Upturn Event, which is itself followed by an Upward Overshoot Event, which is ended by the next Downturn Event. So time is defined by sequences of event cycles of four events, as shown in Figure 1...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{discrepancy}} between financial transactions and activities in the real economy has widened. At the same time, the instability of exchange rates, commodity prices and share prices has increased: In 2007 the volume of financial transactions was 73. 5 times higher than global nominal GDP. Since 1990, it has expanded almost 5 {{times faster than the}} global economy. This expansion is driven by derivative markets, in particular futures and options trading on exchanges. In 2007, its volume was 43. 4 times higher than global GDP. The hike in such transactions was steepest in Germany: in 2007, they were already 52. 6 times higher than GDP. Exchange rates, commodity prices and share prices fluctuate in a sequence of medium-term trends ("bulls and bears"). These trends result from an accumulation of short-term runs, whose durations differ according to their directions: upward runs in a bullish market persist longer than <b>downward</b> <b>runs.</b> Finanzkrise Bankenkrise Immobilienkrise Finanztransaktionssteuer Aktienmärkte...|$|R
5000|$|The prophecy {{continues}} in two movements. The Air for soprano, alto, countertenor, or bass, {{as a human}} reaction {{to the words of}} God, shows the trembling in the expectation of the Lord's appearance twofold in a dramatic scene. The Air begins with the pensive question [...] "But who may abide" [...] and continues, in a sharp shift of time and tempo [...] "Prestissimo", with the statement [...] "For He is like a refiner's fire". Forceful <b>downward</b> <b>runs,</b> leaps and trills of the voice are accompanied by fiery figuration in the strings. Like a da capo, the pensive question is repeated, but in a short version, giving way once more to a prestissimo section. The statement returns a final time after a rest, marked Adagio, giving the soloist the opportunity to express it in a cadenza. A prestissimo postlude concludes the dramatic scene. Handel wrote this dramatic scene in London in 1750 for the castrato Gaetano Guadagni, after he had initially set the text as a recitative.|$|R

5000|$|Vaughan Williams utilises rhythm in the Scherzo {{to convey}} {{different}} effects. The {{focus of the}} movement is centred on the rhythm rather than the ambiguous tonality of the Preludio. Lionel Pike points out that [...] "at times it seems more like a counterpoint of rhythms than of pitches." [...] The movement begins with three dotted minims in a fast 3/4 time, then minims for four bars, which create hemiolas and then crotchets. This gives the illusion that the music is accelerating, and so the pulse does not settle. When the melodic line begins, the music is divided into five bar phrases. A sense of stability is established when the theme is repeated by the viola and double bass in stable two bar phrases. However the violins enter with phrasing that does not conform to either pattern, thus adding more confusion. Using this rhythmic phrasing, the dorian line played on the violins and the aeolian woodwind line are differentiated rhythmically, as well as tonally. The rhythmical confusion is halted when the wind and strings alternate <b>downward</b> <b>runs</b> antiphonally.|$|R
5000|$|The Winecoff Hotel (now the Ellis Hotel) {{opened in}} 1913 {{as one of}} the tallest {{buildings}} in Atlanta. The steel-framed structure was built on a small lot measuring 62.75 ft by 70 ft, bounded by Peachtree Street, Ellis Street and an alley, with 4386 sq ft per floor. Guest rooms extended from the third to the fifteenth floors, with fifteen rooms on a typical floor. Corridors on guest floors were arranged in an H-shape, with two elevators and the upward flights of stairs opening into the cross halls, and opposing <b>downward</b> <b>runs</b> of stairs converging on a single landing from the legs of the H. The single stairway, of non-combustible construction, was not enclosed with fire-resistant doors. While the use of multiple stairways was becoming common practice in tall buildings, the Atlanta Building Code of 1911 permitted buildings on lots of less than 5000 sq ft to have a single stairway. The steel structure was protected by structural clay tile and concrete fireproofing. The hotel was touted in advertisements and on its stationery as [...] "absolutely fireproof".|$|R
