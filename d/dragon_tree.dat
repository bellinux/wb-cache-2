25|$|The Afar Depression biome is {{characterized}} as desert scrubland. Vegetation is mostly confined to drought-resistant {{plants such as}} small trees (e.g. species of the <b>dragon</b> <b>tree),</b> shrubs, and grasses. Wildlife includes many herbivores such as Grevy's zebra, Soemmering's gazelle, beisa and, notably, the last viable population of African wild ass (Equus africanus somalicus).|$|E

2500|$|Thermophile forest: [...] Transition zone with {{moderate}} temperatures and rainfall, but {{the area has}} been deteriorated by human activity. Many endemic species: juniper (Juniperus cedrus), <b>dragon</b> <b>trees</b> (Dracaena draco), palm trees (Phoenix canariensis), etc.|$|R
500|$|The {{surrounding}} {{landscape is}} populated by hut-shaped forms, {{some of which}} are made from stone, while others are at least partially organic. Behind Eve rabbits, symbolising fecundity, play in the grass, and a <b>dragon</b> <b>tree</b> opposite is thought to represent eternal life. The background reveals several animals that would have been exotic to contemporaneous Europeans, including a giraffe, an elephant and a lion that has killed and is about to devour his prey. In the foreground, from a large hole in the ground, emerge birds and winged animals, {{some of which are}} realistic, some fantastic. Behind a fish, a person clothed in a short-sleeved hooded jacket and with a duck's beak holds an open book as if reading. To the left of the area a cat holds a small lizard-like creature in its jaws. Belting observes that, {{despite the fact that the}} creatures in the foreground are fantastical imaginings, many of the animals in the mid and background are drawn from contemporary travel literature, and here Bosch is appealing to [...] "the knowledge of a humanistic and aristocratic readership". Erhard Reuwich's pictures for Bernhard von Breydenbach's 1486 Pilgrimages to the Holy Land were long thought to be the source for both the elephant and the giraffe, though more recent research indicates the mid-15th-century humanist scholar Cyriac of Ancona's travelogues served as Bosch's exposure to these exotic animals.|$|E
2500|$|As a consequence, the {{individual}} {{islands in the}} Canary archipelago tend to have distinct microclimates. Those islands such as El Hierro, La Palma and La Gomera lying {{to the west of}} the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist Gulf Stream. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. As one travels east toward the African coast, the influence of the gulf stream diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. Fuerteventura and Lanzarote the islands which are closest to the African mainland are effectively desert or semi desert. Gran Canaria is known as a [...] "continent in miniature" [...] for its diverse landscapes like Maspalomas and Roque Nublo. In terms of its climate Tenerife is particularly interesting. The north of the island lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated, while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of Playa de las Americas and Los Cristianos is arid. The island rises to almost [...] above sea level, and at altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine Pinus canariensis thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the <b>dragon</b> <b>tree,</b> Dracaena draco are endemic, as noted by Sabin Berthelot and Philip Barker Webb in their epic work, L'Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries (1835–50).|$|E
6000|$|In {{those days}} the Great <b>Dragon</b> <b>Tree</b> {{had not yet}} lost its upper cone by the dreadful storm of January 3, 1868; thus it had survived by two centuries and a half the Garoe Laurel, or Arbol Santo, the miraculous tree of Hierro (Ferro). It stood {{in the garden of}} the Marquez de Sauzal, who would willingly have {{preserved}} it. But every traveller had his own infallible recipe, and the proprietor contented himself with propping up the lower limbs by poles. It stood upon a raised bank of masonry-work, and the north-east side showed a huge cavity which had been stopped with stone and lime. About half a century ago one-third came down, and in 1819 an arm was torn off and sent, I believe, to Kew. When we saw the fragment it looked mostly like tinder, or touchwood, 'eld-gamall,' stone-old, as the Icelanders say. Near it stood a pair of tall cypresses, and at some distance a venerable palm-tree, which 'relates to it,' according to Count Gabriel de Belcastel, ...|$|E

50|$|D. americana, D. arborea, D. cinnabari, D. draco, D. ombet, and D. tamaranae are {{commonly}} known as <b>dragon</b> <b>trees</b> and grow in arid semi-desert areas. They are tree-sized with stout trunks and stiff, broad-based leaves. The remaining species are known collectively as shrubby dracaenas. They are smaller and shrub-like, with slender stems and flexible strap-shaped leaves, and grow as understorey plants in rainforests.|$|R

50|$|The parish is {{populated}} by older cottages, orchards and fields in scattered settlements disperesed by mountainous cliffs, and highlighted by small coastal plains. The largest of these fajãs, {{location of the}} parochial church and village port, is the largest settlement (Fajã das Almas), located {{in the middle of}} the southern coast. Its semi-planar surface is in contrast with the cliffs to the east which front the São Jorge Channel, and has produced a micro-climate that has sustained many orchards and fields that produce coffee, wine, tropical fruits and species of <b>Dragon</b> <b>trees</b> (Dracaena draco) typical of the Canary Islands, Cape Verde and Madeira.|$|R

5|$|The {{natural range}} of A.vera is unclear, as the species {{has been widely}} {{cultivated}} around the world. Naturalised strands of the species occur in the southern half of the Arabian Peninsula, through North Africa (Morocco, Mauritania, Egypt), as well as Sudan and neighbouring countries, along with the Canary, Cape Verde, and Madeira Islands. This distribution is somewhat {{similar to that of}} Euphorbia balsamifera, Pistacia atlantica, and a few others, suggesting that a dry sclerophyll forest once covered large areas, but has been dramatically reduced due to desertification in the Sahara, leaving these few patches isolated. For comparison, several closely related (or sometimes identical) species within other plant groups {{can be found on the}} two extreme sides of the Sahara: <b>dragon</b> <b>trees</b> (Dracaena) and Aeonium being two of the most representative examples.|$|R
