25|$|The 2009 Jupiter impact event {{happened}} on July 19 {{when a new}} black spot {{about the size of}} Earth was discovered in Jupiter's southern hemisphere by amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley. Thermal infrared analysis showed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>warm</b> and spectroscopic methods detected ammonia. JPL scientists confirmed that there was another impact event on Jupiter, probably involving a small undiscovered comet or other icy body. The impactor is estimated to have been about 200–500 meters in diameter.|$|E
25|$|This {{process was}} later {{performed}} on the human body (in {{the image on the}} left): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>warm</b> and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood.|$|E

500|$|Julia visited Mimi's house {{nearly every}} day, {{where they would}} chat over tea and cakes in the morning room or stand in the garden when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>warm.</b> On the evening of 15July 1958, Nigel Walley went to visit Lennon and found Julia and Mimi talking by the front gate. Lennon was not there, as {{he was at the}} Blomfield Road house. Walley {{accompanied}} Julia to the bus stop further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her to walk up Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lanes, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Five seconds later, Walley heard [...] "a loud thud", and turned to see her body [...] "flying through the air"—which landed about [...] from where she had been hit. He ran back to get Mimi and they waited for the ambulance, with Mimi crying hysterically.|$|E

[...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E

It gave the drink a hint of smokiness and of course a subtle bacon flavor that really, really worked well." ...|$|E
