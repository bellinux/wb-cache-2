5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

25|$|The {{best known}} brand in strobe tuner {{technology}} is Peterson Tuners who in 1967 marketed their first strobe tuner, the Model 400.

Other LED tuners have a 'strobe mode' that emulates {{the appearance of}} a strobe. However, the accuracy of these tuners in strobe mode, while sufficient for most tuning, is no better than in any other mode, as they use the same technique as any basic tuner to measure frequency, only displaying <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> imitates a strobe tuner.|$|E

25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> may not ordinarily be necessary.

500|$|Prior to {{and since}} the release of Grand Theft Auto III, the game {{generated}} several controversies. GameSpy awarded Grand Theft Auto III with Most Offensive Game of the Year, calling it [...] "absolutely reprehensible". They wrote that the game rewards players for [...] "causing mayhem" [...] and [...] "killing innocent people by the dozen", ultimately questioning its appropriateness within the industry. The notoriety of Grand Theft Auto III resulted in Wal-Mart's decision to check the identification of purchasers {{who appeared to be}} under the age of 17, when purchasing mature titles. In an essay, assistant professor Shira Chess identified the lack of conclusion to player violence, due to the ability to respawn upon death or incarceration, and found that it denies the [...] "reality of mortality and simultaneously [...] it on players". When speaking about the game's depiction of violence, producer Leslie Benzies claims that is intended as comedic, and that the game is [...] "not meant to be taken seriously". Producer Dan Houser stated that the team was conscious of the offence that the game would attract, but [...] "never marketed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> exploited that".|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} game's {{accurate}} recreation of the Nintendo 64 title, additional features, and upgrades. Phil Theobald of GameSpy lauded Super Mario 64 DS, calling it [...] "fantastic" [...] and complimenting the new features: minigames, {{use of a}} second screen, and extra stars.

Harris said the original feel of Super Mario 64 is retained, while the new challenges and features build upon <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> added to the game's longevity. He complimented the graphics and audio, and considered the game a good demonstration of the Nintendo DS's capabilities. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot also complimented the graphics, specifically the higher polygon count and smooth frame rate. He called Super Mario 64 DS a [...] "great update of a classic game", and felt the changes and additional features offered a new experience to fans of the original. In contrast, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish felt the game did not offer enough new content to warrant a purchase. He praised the inclusion of extra characters, calling them a [...] "nice twist", but concluded his review by calling the game a [...] "poorly-conceived port" [...] that should be played on the original system.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character.

Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I could do <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> also {{sent a message to}} the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ...
