When the Catholic reaction set in, Joseph de Maistre, by far its acutest champion {{in the region of}} philosophy, at once made it his first business to attack the principle of relativity with all his force of dialectic, and to reinstate absolute modes of thinking, and the absolute quality of Catholic propositions about religion, knowledge, and government.[73] Yet neither he nor any one else on his side has ever effectively shaken the solid argument which Diderot fancifully illustrated in the following passage from his reply to Voltaire's letter of thanks for the opuscule: [...] "This marvellous order and these wondrous adaptations, what am I to think of them? That they are metaphysical entities only existing in your own mind. You cover a vast piece of ground with a mass of ruins falling hither or thither at hazard; amid these the worm and the ant find commodious shelter enough.

The little animalcule in the square cap, who makes the giant laugh in a Homeric manner by its inflated account of itself as the final cause of the universe, is the type of the philosophy on which Catholicism is based.|$|R

We aimed to identify <b>final</b> molecular <b>entities</b> targeted by the autoimmune assault on pancreatic β cells that are causally related to β cell viability. Here, we show that cyclin D 3 is targeted by the autoimmune attack on pancreatic β cells in vivo. Cyclin D 3 is down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner in β cells by leukocyte infiltration into the islets of the nonobese diabetic (NOD) type 1 diabetes-prone mouse model. Furthermore, we established a direct in vivo causal link between cyclin D 3 expression levels and β-cell fitness and viability in the NOD mice. We found that changes in cyclin D 3 expression levels in vivo altered the β-cell apoptosis rates, β-cell area homeostasis, and β-cell sensitivity to glucose without affecting β-cell proliferation in the NOD mice. Cyclin D 3 -deficient NOD mice exhibited exacerbated diabetes and impaired glucose responsiveness; conversely, transgenic NOD mice verexpressing cyclin D 3 in β cells exhibited mild diabetes and improved glucose responsiveness. Overexpression of cyclin D 3 in β cells of cyclin D 3 -deficient mice rescued them from the exacerbated diabetes observed in transgene-negative littermates. Moreover, cyclin D 3 overexpression protected the NOD-derived insulinoma NIT- 1 cell line from cytokine-induced apoptosis. Here, {{for the first time}} to our knowledge, cyclin D 3 is identified as a key molecule targeted by autoimmunity that plays a nonredundant, protective, and cell cycle-independent role in β cells against inflammation-induced apoptosis and confers metabolic fitness to these cells...|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{concepts}} which are at {{the basis of the}} development associated with a quantitative treatment of the variety of phenomena associated with the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry in nuclei have been instrumental in connection with novel studies of soft matter, namely of protein evolution and protein folding. Although the route to these subjects and associated development does not necessarily imply the nuclear physics connection, such a connection has proven qualitatively and quantitatively inspiring. In particular to model protein evolution in terms of the alignment of quasispins displaying twenty different projections, one for each of the twenty amino acids occurring in nature, and the associated symmetry breaking in information (sequence) space. Emergent properties of the corresponding phase transition are domain walls which stabilize local elementary structures (LES), few groups of 10 - 20 aminoacids which become structured already in the denatured state provide the molecular recognition directing protein folding. In fact, their docking is closely related to the transition state of the process. While the two-step, yes or no, folding process, does not provide direct information concerning LES, one can force LES from virtual to become real, observable <b>final</b> state <b>entities.</b> Getting again inspiration from the nuclear case (virtual processes contributing to pair correlations can be forced to become real {{with the help of a}} probe which itself changes particle number by two), one would expect that to make real virtual LES, that is segments of the protein which already at an early stage of the folding process flicker in and out of their native conformation, one needs a probe which itself displays a similar behaviour.

In the case of all approved agents the time frame has been extended to include the 25 1 / 2 years from 01 / 1981 to 06 / 2006 for all diseases worldwide and from 1950 (earliest so far identified) to 06 / 2006 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. We have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a “natural product mimic ” or “NM ” to join the original primary divisions. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the <b>final</b> drug <b>entity,</b> is still alive and well.

In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, with, as expected from prior information, the antiinfective area being dependent on natural products and their structures. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have, in fact, been used in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are able to identify only one de noVo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this 25 plus year time frame.

40|$|This {{review is}} an updated and {{expanded}} {{version of a}} paper that was published in this journal in 1997. The time frame has been extended in both directions to include the 22 years from 1981 to 2002, and a new secondary subdivision related to the natural product source but applied to formally synthetic compounds has been introduced, using {{the concept of a}} “natural product mimic ” or “NM ” to join the original primary divisions. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the <b>final</b> drug <b>entity,</b> is still alive and well. Thus, in the area of cancer, the percentage of small molecule, new chemical entities that are nonsynthetic has remained at 62 % averaged over the whole time frame. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, particularly in the antihypertensive area, where of the 74 formally synthetic drugs, 48 can be traced to natural product structures/mimics. Similarly, with the 10 antimigraine drugs, seven are based on the serotonin molecule or derivatives thereof. Finally, although combinatorial techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have, in fact, been used in the optimization of a number of recently approved agents, {{we have not been able}} to identify a de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this time frame.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{transformation}} of forms of indication; {{a transition from}} data in one form to a description in another form. The data input indicates a situation; the description output indicates a situation. Though both should, ideally, indicate the same situation, there {{is likely to be}} a drift in what situation is indicated. A theory for transformation by emergence is introduced, as is a framework for the transformation. The framework can transform an available known form of reference to a more accessible, destination form. This destination form is also the form of a domain knowledge source. This kind of reference transformation is a specialization of a more general prob- lem: that of improving indication; using possibly multiple source forms resulting in possibly multiple destination forms. The improvement should outweigh the cumulative error incurred during the act of improvement. In general, automatic interpretation of multimedia or sensory cues remains a challenge. Synthesis of interpretation is partly completed in the mind of the recipient, where association with prior experience, of both notions and indication thereof, takes place. The scope of the thesis is constrained to what a machine can manipulate. Lateral reference transformation should occur during early emergence. The transformation results in a collection of partial descriptions, which can be used to compose a greater situational description. The reference transformation framework is based on an underlying philosophy of emergence. Situational descriptions emerge from the interaction of domain knowl- edge and situational data. An assumption is made that data and knowledge elements can interact. The reference transformation is lateral, in the sense that the principal quality being increased by emergence is clarity rather than complexity. Domain knowledge is converted to a modifiable internal entity known as a bridg- ing entity. The framework is designed to be independent of media types. The framework adopts the destination form as the basis of the internal form of the bridging entity. It is the bridging entity that is gradually manipulated rather than the media of the original situational data indicators or references. Interaction of the bridging entity with situational data, creates a perturbed bridging entity. The bridging entity can be progressively perturbed through interaction with further data, resulting in an entity that is acceptable as a description of the situation. The <b>final</b> bridging <b>entity</b> is mapped back to an accessible knowledge form, based on an auxiliary entity that stores system experience. Confidence in the acceptability of transformation is based on how much of the situation is considered familiar. Context is considered from two perspectives. From the perspective of the data, it is the knowledge and the experience available for interpretation. This includes entities and concepts that aren’t directly observable in the data. From the perspec- tive of the description, context is whatever influences the emergence and subsequent interpretation, without being explicitly indicated by the description. The framework is investigated by considering its various aspects, in the contexts of disparate situational domains. The conclusions, based on this investigation, lead to modifications to the initial theory and framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} degree thesis called ?Development Issues of Sub-Saharan Africa with a Focus on Namibia? deals with basic terms of development cooperation and with international organizations relevant for the topic, e. g. the World Bank and the United Nations. The chapter on selected causes {{of failure and}} on the current situation discusses political regimes, civil wars, indebtedness, remission of debt and approaches of ?planners?, i. e. big international entities providing development aid, such as UNICEF or USAID, versus ?searchers?, represented by non-governmental non-for-profit organizations Karas Huisen Crafts and Namibia People in Need. The thesis had one objective divided into three partial questions. The first partial objective was identical with the research question: Is the living standard in Namibia improving thanks to the traditional approach to development cooperation {{on the side of}} ?planners? or is it rather thanks to the alternative approach of ?searchers?? The answer to the question has been as follows: The improvements of the living standard in Namibia occur rather thanks to the alternative approach of ?searchers?. The second partial objective attempted to identify the influence of developed countries and world´s financial and development organizations on the development of Namibia. The <b>final</b> effect of <b>entities</b> involved in the development cooperation has proved to be favorable. The last partial objective was to evaluate the overall situation. Also this objective has been met and the situation evaluated. The answer mentioned particularly problems Namibia needs to deal with, such as alcoholism and related risks, including sexual promiscuity, violence and unemployment. A major issue is also the relatively widespread AIDS. Development is a very extensive topic and this thesis may continue further with an analysis of other causes of failure and of the current situation. In practice, the thesis will be provided to selected non-governmental non-for-profit organizations in the Czech Republic. The answer to the research question might further clarify the issue of ?searchers? versus ?planners? to those organizations, specifically the real powers of such entities...|$|R
40|$|The Republic of Srpska {{was created}} {{during the civil}} war in the {{territory}} of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 - 1995. Within the general framework of the agreement to establich peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Dayton Peace Agreement), in Novembar 1995 it was recognized as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the Dayton Constitution, by its legal nature The Republic of Srpska was a confederative unit (with some elements of a federal unit) within Bosnia and Herzegovina as a confederation (with the some elements of a federation). During the last ten years, both Bosnia and Herzegovina and The Republic of Srpska underwent deep transformations. An indication of these deep transformations was the decision {{of the president of the}} Arbitration Tribunal to establish the District of Brčko as the third entity sui generis (in addition to The Republic of Srpska and The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina). Two basic levers in the anti-Dayton transformational processes which occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its entities were The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as The High Representative of the international community for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina passed a series of anti-Dayton decisions; by its consequences the most far-reaching decision was related to the issue U 50 / 2000 which declared the constitutionality of the Bosniacs, the Croats and the Serbs in the entities. On the basis of that decision, in 2000 a set of amendments to The Constitution of The Republic of Srpska was passed which deeply changed the legal nature of The Republic of Srpska. It was transformed from a confederative into to a federal unit. The anti-Dayton activity of The High Representative of the international community is even more pronounced. He became the main constitutional and legislative factor of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its entities. Under his pressure, in 2003 new amendments to The Constitution of The Republic of Srpska were passed which further diminished the authorities in The Republic of Srpska, specially in the field of national defence and public security. The High Representative himself brought and declared dozens of laws for Bosnia and Herzegovina with which he transformed Bosnia and Herzegovina from the union of states into a federation. With the police reform he announced, he is preparing to regionalize Bosnia and Herzegovina, not taking into account the entity borders, and thus to pave the way for the <b>final</b> abolition of <b>entities</b> including The Republic of Srpska...|$|R
40|$|Maritime {{operations}} {{perform a}} global interface function connecting international, regional and domestic supply chain networks within a transportation and distribution platform. Due to the pivotal role of trade, maritime operations {{have the potential}} to generate wide-scale disruptive effects along supply chains. Basically, various unwanted internal and external factors that create uncertainty and severe negative consequences in the maritime leg can be defined as maritime disruptions. This includes risks associated with safety and security, the environment, infrastructure, markets, organisation, and leadership factors. However, the short and long-term effects of maritime disruptions {{do not appear to be}} widely understood or in some cases even considered by supply chain entities. By exploring and understanding the causes and effects of maritime disruptions, supply chain entities may be better prepared to manage the challenges presented by maritime disruptions and recognising the benefits of developing disruption management strategies. Due to the globalisation of wheat supply chains, the increased risk of maritime disruption has become a major limiting factor in the efficient movement of wheat from producers (wheat farmers) to global end consumers. This is also evident in the wheat supply chain between Australia and Indonesia, which is the context of this research. Despite wheat being one of the dominant seaborne trade commodities between the two countries, the wheat supply chain is complex because it utilises international shipping (ports in Australia to Indonesia) and the domestic maritime chain (via inter-island shipping in Indonesia). This thesis argues that the maritime leg of the wheat supply chain creates increased operational risks among entities in the wheat supply chain between the two countries. Therefore, the thesis focuses on one major research question: Does the maritime leg contribute to disruptions in the wheat supply chain between Australia and Indonesia? To further examine this research question three sub-research questions are explored:(i) Are shippers and consignees aware of the disruptions that may occur in the maritime leg of the Australian-Indonesian wheat supply chain? (ii) Are shippers and consignees in the Australian-Indonesian wheat supply chain implementing supply risk assessments or mitigation strategies to minimise the maritime disruption events? (iii) Are current risk mitigation and detection processes in maritime operations effective in the Australian-Indonesian wheat supply chain systems? To address the above research questions, the study uses both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. These combined methods analyse the stages of disruptive events in maritime operations and identifies direct and indirect driving factors. The sample for the study consists of senior managers in the wheat supply chain from both Australia and Indonesia because of their key involvement in the decision making process after disruptions occur and when disruption management strategies are developed. The senior managers were interviewed via telephone using a structured questionnaire to obtain information on their perceptions of the risk of disruption, detailed processes of disruption discovery and recovery, and the probability levels of various disruption management scenario assessments. An overall response rate of 68 per cent (34 respondents) was achieved with each in-depth telephone interview averaging 32 minutes with a range of 15 to 90 minutes. Data analysis is conducted in two stages. The first stage analyses the time and financial costs along the wheat supply chain of maritime disruptions in terms of probability, consequences, frequency rate and propagation effects both in Australia and Indonesia, including the role of third and fourth party logistics in both creating and managing maritime disruptions. In this stage, previous disruption management strategies during the three stages of maritime disruption: pre-, during and post-disruption are explored. The study finds the existence of 40 different disruptions in the wheat supply chain of which 17 disruptive events dominantly occur in the Australian-Indonesian wheat supply chain. The study also reveals that mitigation, adaptation, coordination and intervention are supply chain risk management strategies that are normally implemented by entities in managing maritime disruptions along the wheat supply chain. In the second stage, the Markov chain process was used as the prime means to evaluate the disruption management strategies based on four major business scenarios such as contingency plan, flexible inventory strategy, business continuity management, and recovery planning. Compared to other statistical methods, the Markov process enables the prediction of future consequences of maritime disruptions given a previous probability level that involves constantly changing occurrences of maritime disruptive events. In addition, the Markov decision process (MDP) combines. As a result of the MDP analysis, multi-disruption management scenarios are recommended to optimise financial and time costs of strategies implemented when maritime disruptions occur. The study also finds that farmers and <b>final</b> consumers are <b>entities</b> that are highly likely to experience maritime disruptions along the wheat supply chain, as the consequences of disruptions in the chain are passed on to them...|$|R
