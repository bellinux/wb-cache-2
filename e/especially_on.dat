5|$|His tenure {{was marked}} by {{controversy}} as he defended the Bush administration from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> the topics of abstinence-only birth control education, climate change policy, and stem cell research. Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations, saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> the issue of science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues.|$|E

5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> {{the north side of the}} main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing friction between the British and French, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E

5|$|Ancient India, {{particularly}} the centuries {{in which the}} Mahavira and the Buddha lived, were one of intense intellectual debates, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> the nature of reality and self or soul.

5|$|Beginning in 1938 and {{throughout}} World War II, the SS enacted a procedure where offices and {{units of the}} SS could form smaller sub-units, known as SS-Sonderkommandos, to carry out special tasks, including large-scale murder operations. The use of SS-Sonderkommandos was widespread. According to former SS Sturmbannführer Wilhelm Höttl, not even the SS leadership knew how many SS-Sonderkommandos were constantly being formed, disbanded, and reformed for various tasks, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> the Eastern Front.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} feelings and experience, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> the great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E

Additionally, the road sees congestion due to the area's rapid growth in commercial development.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus furuitii, {{described}} by Momiyama in 1927, is {{found on the}} Izu and Ogasawara Islands south of Honshū, Japan. It is non-migratory.

5|$|Falco peregrinus madens, {{described}} by Ripley and Watson in 1963, {{is unusual in}} having some sexual dichromatism.

5|$|From the Abyssinian Crisis of 1935 onwards, the British built many pillboxes in Malta for defence {{in case of}} an Italian invasion. Many {{others were}} built during World War II. Many pillboxes still exist, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> the north eastern part of the island. A few of them have been {{restored}} and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed as they are not considered to have any architectural or historic value.|$|E
5|$|Having {{succeeded in}} {{reversing}} the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next {{to reverse the}} effects of the McKinley tariff. The Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 (US$ today).|$|E
