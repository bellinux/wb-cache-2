5|$|For her thirteenth {{birthday}} on 12 June 1942, Frank {{received a}} book she had shown {{her father in}} a shop window a few days earlier.

In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.|$|E

Along with his acclaimed short film Pikoo (Pikoo's <b>Diary)</b> <b>and</b> hour-long Hindi film, Sadgati, this {{was the culmination of}} his work in this period.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{thought of}} having his diary {{published}} mixed in with FitzRoy's account, but his relatives including Emma and Hensleigh Wedgwood urged that it be published separately. On 30 December the question was settled by FitzRoy taking the advice of William Broderip that Darwin's journal should form the third volume of the Narrative. Darwin set to work reorganising and trimming his <b>diary,</b> <b>and</b> incorporating scientific material from his notes. He completed his Journal and Remarks (now commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle) in August 1837, but FitzRoy was slower and the three volumes were published in August 1839.|$|E
5|$|Magnapop {{have been}} defined genre-wise as power pop by {{multiple}} rock critics, and their performances have drawn comparisons with punk, new wave, and surf rock. Reviewers have {{commented on the}} band's pop-influenced songwriting, specifically their employment of guitar hooks and simple chord structure. To that end, they have been compared to Mould's previous work {{as a member of}} Sugar and Hüsker Dü, as well as fellow Georgia-based rock acts such as Guadalcanal <b>Diary</b> <b>and</b> Let's Active and alternative rock pioneers Pixies and The Replacements. The album Rubbing Doesn't Help represented a stylistic shift for the band away from their more pop-inspired material toward more guitar-oriented rock, but their comeback with Mouthfeel returned to the more pop-inspired sound of Hot Boxing.|$|E

5|$|Victoria was {{physically}} unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy {{and only about}} five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity during {{the first years of}} her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her <b>diary</b> <b>and</b> letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date. The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired. They, and others, conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional, obstinate, honest, and straight-talking.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of more senior officers. Showalter notes that even at this early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel {{as a model for the}} fusion of Germany's new and old orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler had barely looked at his <b>diary</b> <b>and</b> the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine {{had died in}} apartment 5A {{as a result of}} an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's <b>diary</b> <b>and</b> Gerry's laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.|$|E
