According to Mark Edward Nero of About.com, {{the song}} contains familiar qualities of Songz's breakout hit [...] "Can't Help But Wait", also produced by Stargate. The song is lyrically about finding and pleasing the right woman, through lines such as, [...] "I don't even know your name, but I know that I'm your man {{and you are}} my girl, if I ever meet you I'm gonna give you the world, Baby please believe me when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I need a girl."

500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can still see the expression on [...] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to say, Well, didn't <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E

500|$|On 11 June 1847, {{the young}} prince {{was playing in}} the library of the palace when he {{experienced}} a series of strong convulsions and died, not quite {{two and a half years}} old. His death revealed that Afonso suffered from epilepsy, as did his father. The grief of PedroII and his wife was enormous. It was feared that the shock might affect Teresa Cristina's health, as she was pregnant at the time with her third child. She later gave birth without complications on 13 July to a girl, who was christened Leopoldina. The devastated emperor wrote a letter to his stepmother, the Empress Amélia, dated 11 July 1847, telling her of Afonso's death: [...] "With the most piercing grief <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> my little Afonso, your godson, unfortunately died of convulsions, which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month; and a few days ago little Isabel was put at risk by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1785 Leopold visited Wolfgang and Constanze in Vienna, at a {{time when}} his son's career success was at its peak.

[...] The visit was the last time that Leopold saw his son, though they continued to correspond, and Wolfgang sometimes sent copies of his piano concertos and string quartets for Leopold and Nannerl to perform with friends.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred's {{educational}} and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion {{and learning in}} Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as {{the building of the}} burhs. As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people. The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: [...] "Study Wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it".|$|E

Anyone who breaks {{one of the least}} of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

2500|$|The {{cartoonist}} visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono {{at their}} 1969 Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, and their testy exchange later {{appeared in the}} documentary film [...] (1988). Introducing himself with the words [...] "I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist.

You've done it, and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I applaud you for it." [...] Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono ("Good God, you've gotta live with that?"), and is asked to [...] "get out" [...] by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his Ballad of John and Yoko song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify Capp!

2500|$|There are those, however, who {{deny that}} Jesus was a pacifist and state that Jesus never {{said not to}} fight, citing {{examples}} from the New Testament. One such instance portrays an angry Jesus driving dishonest market traders from the temple. [...] A frequently quoted passage is Luke 22:36: [...] "He said to them, 'But now, {{the one who has}} a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.'" [...] Pacifists have typically explained that verse as Jesus fulfilling prophecy, since in the next verse, Jesus continues to say: [...] "It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." [...] Others have interpreted the non-pacifist statements in the New Testament to be related to self-defense or to be metaphorical and state that on no occasion did Jesus shed blood or urge others to shed blood.|$|E

Carleton had taken an ill measure of the influence of the seigneurs & Clergy over the lower order of people whose Principle of conduct founded in fear & the sharpness of authority over them now no longer exercised, is unrestrained, & breaks out in every shape of contempt or detestation of those whom they used to behold with terror & who gave them I believe too many occasions to express it. And they on their parts have been and are too much elated with the advantages they supposed they should derive from the restoration of their old Privileges & customs, & indulged themselves in a way of thinking & talking that gave very just offence, as well to their own People as to the English merchants.|$|E
