5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater <b>interest</b> <b>has</b> developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} research {{investigations of the}} rhodocene system {{was to understand the}} nature of and bonding within the metallocene class of compounds. In more recent times, <b>interest</b> <b>has</b> been rekindled by the desire to explore and apply the metal–metal interactions that occur when metallocene systems are linked. Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics, semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) metallocene polymers (an example of a molecular wire), and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand.|$|E
