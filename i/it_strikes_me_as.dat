2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. How would they show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a very silly argument. We could just as easily apply it to [...] poker players. We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could say this about anything and everything. We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} do. At this point, the reader will appreciate the vacuity of the EMH argument.|$|E
2500|$|Typical scripts for {{an average}} one-hour {{television}} show run 60 pages, but those for Moonlighting were nearly twice as long due to the fast talking overlapping dialogue of the main characters. While the average television show would take seven days to shoot, Moonlighting would take from 12–14 days to complete with episodes and dialogue frequently being written by Caron the same day they were shot. This attention to detail contributed to Moonlighting as {{being one of the}} most expensive television shows being produced at the time. Where most episodes would cost around $900,000 to produce, Moonlighting was running nearly double that. [...] The season 2 episode [...] "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice" [...] could have been filmed much more cheaply by being shot in color and then decolorized, but Caron insisted on the authentic look of black-and-white film which took 16 days to shoot, bringing the cost of the episode to the then-unheard-of sum of two million dollars. Caron often defended his filming practices in the name of giving the audience what they wanted and producing a quality product. He used the following analogy to illustrate the point, [...] "The thinking in television which makes no damn sense to me, is that a half hour of television costs X, and an hour of television costs Y, no matter what that television is, <b>it</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> an insane hypothesis. The parallel is, you're hungry, whether you go to McDonald's or whether you go to '21,' it should cost the same; they both fill your stomach. It's nonsense." ...|$|E

500|$|Den of Geek {{selected}} the episode's special effects {{as a positive}} element, but was more critical of the episode as a whole. [...] "As Fringe goes," [...] the website explained, [...] "this ended up a rather lightweight narrative, which was more about getting Lincoln established with Fringe, and providing a few new plotlines that the subsequent stories can expand on." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was equally ambivalent, and gave the episode a score of 7.5 out of 10. He observed, [...] "It isn't a bad episode. It's a good addition to the Fringe lore. It's well-written, has plenty of action, and the actors are great as usual. But it just doesn't feel like a fulfilling continuation of last season's cliffhanger, nor does <b>it</b> <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a fantastic new direction for the season." ...|$|R

40|$|Wittgenstein’s {{notion of}} ‘hinge propositions’—those propositions that stand fast {{for us and}} around which all {{empirical}} enquiry turns—remains controversial and elusive, {{and none of the}} recent attempts to make sense of <b>it</b> <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> entirely satisfactory. The literature on this topic tends to divide into two camps: either a ‘quasi-epistemic’ reading is offered that seeks to downplay the radical nature of Wittgenstein’s proposal by assimilating his thought to more mainstream epistemological views, or a non-epistemic, ‘quasi-pragmatic’ conception is adopted that goes too far in the opposite direction by, for example, equating ‘hinge propositions’ with a type of ‘animal’ certainty. Neither interpretative strategy, I will argue, is promising for the reason that ‘hinges’ are best not conceived as certainties (or uncertainties) at all. Rather, what Wittgenstein says in respect to them is that doubt is “logically” excluded, and where there can be no doubt, I contend, {{there is no such thing}} as knowledge or certainty eithe...|$|R

But like all youthful impressions it is very sincere and true while it lasts. I don't know whether one gets anything more real when one gets older." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2008 Hudson re-edited Revolution, {{giving the}} film a {{narration}} by Al Pacino. The Observer film critic Philip French {{writing about the}} new version said, [...] "Revolution was misunderstood and unjustly treated on its first appearance twenty years ago. Seeing it again in the director's slightly revised version <b>it</b> now <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a masterpiece - profound, poetic and original.

The music critic Andrew Clements of The Guardian called it [...] "one of the Polish composer's greatest achievements". [...] The writer Michael McManus similarly wrote, [...] "I {{have always had a}} special affection for Witold Lutosławski's Cello Concerto. Like so many of his works, it is tautly composed, relatively short and full of contrasts.
