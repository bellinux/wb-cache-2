50|$|Tropaeolum tricolor, the three-coloured <b>Indian</b> <b>cress</b> or Chilean nasturtium, is {{a species}} of {{perennial}} plant in the family Tropaeolaceae. It is endemic to Chile, where it is called soldadito rojo and relicario.|$|E
50|$|Tropaeolum majus (garden nasturtium, <b>Indian</b> <b>cress</b> or monks cress) is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Tropaeolaceae, originating in the Andes from Bolivia north to Colombia. The species has become naturalized {{in parts of the}} United States (California, New York, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut). It is of cultivated, probably hybrid origin, with possible parent species including T. minus, T. moritzianum, T. peltophorum, and T. peregrinum. It is not closely related to the genus Nasturtium (which includes watercress).|$|E
50|$|At the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, England, three-coloured <b>Indian</b> <b>cress</b> {{is grown}} in a {{frost-free}} Alpine house. Large pots with good drainage {{are filled with}} a loam-based compost and tubers are replanted each September. The plant soon starts into growth and flowers begin forming {{in the spring and}} the plant remains in flower for several months. Propagation is by seed or from the tubers which are often formed at the very bottom of a pot or force their way out through the drainage holes. The USDA Hardiness Zone is 8.|$|E
5000|$|Three-coloured <b>Indian</b> <b>cress</b> {{grows in}} the cloud forest on the coastal {{mountains}} of northern Chile at 300 to 900 m. Further south it grows in inland temperate forests in the central and Los Lagos regions at varying heights. Here it grows on level ground or north facing slopes in full sun or dappled shade. It can endure periods of drought of up to 10 months in the summer. The tubers are well buried and are hardy down to a temperature of about [...] and can tolerate short periods of snow cover.|$|E
50|$|Three-{{coloured}} <b>Indian</b> <b>cress</b> has thin, straggly stems {{growing from}} a reddish coloured root tuber and extending up to 2 or 3 m. The leaves are peltate (with the stalk in the centre), nearly circular with {{five or six}} deeply cut lobes. The numerous flowers are borne singly on long wiry stalks growing from the axils of the leaves. They are narrowly funnel-shaped and about 3 cm long. The five sepals are red, orange or yellow tipped with a purple band, and extending backwards in a red spur. The small, greenish-yellow rounded petals have a clawed base. The sepals turn brown after the flowers fall and enclose the two or three, dark brown seeds.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{analysis}} of <b>Indian</b> <b>cress</b> absolute (Tropaeolum majus L.). <b>Indian</b> <b>cress</b> is an edible cress species that belongs to the Brassicale order. Its absolute, obtained by extraction of the plant with a non-polar solvent (concrete) followed by treatment with ethanol, has never been studied. It was analyzed by GC-MS and GC-O in order to characterize its main volatile compounds and key odorants. This research {{made it possible to}} identify two new volatile compounds: N-benzyl O-ethyl thiocarbamate and O,S-diethyl thiocarbonate. To the best of our knowledge, both compounds were reported in cress extract for the first time. These molecules being of organoleptic interest, 27 homologues were further synthesized and evaluated. Among those new volatiles, N-phenyl thiocarbamates were shown to be particularly interesting for their savory and meaty odors...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: UV-B {{radiation}} {{is an important}} environmental factor for many plants with remarkable influence on defence-related secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Possible consequences of UV-B radiation on plants have been widely reported, but its effect on secondary plant metabolites in ornamental and medicinal plants is poorly understood. The aim of the present research was to establish whether it is feasible to cultivate Tropaeolum majus under conditions of enhanced UV-B radiation to alter the content of total phenolic compounds in leaves and flowers and whether UV-B treatment affect plant physiological response. Material and Method: An outdoor {{study was conducted to}} examine the effect of different levels of UV-B radiation on the morphological (specific leaf area and length of internodes and petiole), biochemical (photosynthetic pigments, UV absorbing compounds) and physiological characteristics (photosynthesis, photochemical yield of PSII, transpiration rate, water use efficiency) of the widely cultivated annual herb <b>Indian</b> <b>cress</b> (T. majus L.). Results and Conclusions: Enhanced UV-B radiation induced increased synthesis of total phenolic compounds in leaves, but not in flowers. Photosynthesis and photochemical yield of PSII were mostly unaffected by UV-B. Transpiration rate was higher at elevated UV-B levels in the beginning and peak of the season. Specific leaf area and length of internodes and petiole were unaffected. UV-B treated specimens of T. majus possessed enhanced amounts of total phenolic compounds, which are important for utilisation of T. majus herbs for human health. Enhanced UV-B treatment affected flowering of T. majus {{at the end of the}} growing season, which may have an important negative implication for success of this species in elevated UV-B radiation environments...|$|E
