5|$|The {{relatively}} {{new field of}} radio astronomy sparked Bacher's interest, and he hired <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> and Gordon Stanley from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in 1955.

5|$|The granite {{church was}} built in 1850 by local stonemasons and paid for {{primarily}} by Creighton and Meade, but also by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including US Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The first services there were held on September 21, 1851. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England {{and is the only}} church with a complete set of <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> (brother of William Jay Bolton) stained-glass windows.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{populations of}} Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia {{are on the}} edge of their natural ranges. The UK {{distribution}} of the former is confined to Angus, Perthshire, Argyll and north Wales, and of the latter to Angus, the Moffat Hills, north Wales and two locations in England. The plants were first identified as separate species by <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century. Cystopteris dickieana, first discovered in a sea cave in Kincardineshire, is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution is confined to Scotland, although recent research suggests that it may be a variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right.|$|E

25|$|Boulton {{was born}} 22 September 1820 at Mose Old Norton, Staffordshire, England to Matthew Robinson Boulton (8 August 1770 – 16 May 1842) and Mary Anne Wilkinson (27 November 1795 – 7 June 1829). He was baptized at St. Mary's Church, Handsworth, Staffordshire on 9 November 1820. M.P.W.'s {{ancestors}} {{can be traced}} back to <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> (his surname missing the 'u, which was included one or two generations later) of Lichfield, Staffordshire, who married (the later-to-be wealthy) Elizabeth, daughter of Matthew Dyott of Stichbrooke, Staffordshire in the late 15th-century. <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> is believed descended from, possibly a grandson of Robert Bolton (1572 – 19 December 1631), rector of Broughton, Northamptonshire in 1609 until his death.|$|E

25|$|In 1962 a {{breakthrough}} was achieved. Another radio source, 3C 273, was predicted to undergo five occultations by the Moon. Measurements taken by Cyril Hazard and <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> {{during one of}} the occultations using the Parkes Radio Telescope allowed Maarten Schmidt to optically identify the object and obtain an optical spectrum using the 200-inch Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar. This spectrum revealed the same strange emission lines. Schmidt realized that these were actually spectral lines of hydrogen redshifted at the rate of 15.8 percent. This discovery showed that 3C273 was receding at a rate of 47,000km/s. This discovery revolutionized quasar observation and allowed other astronomers to find redshifts from the emission lines from other radio sources. As predicted earlier by Bolton, 3C48 was found to have a redshift of 37% of the speed of light.|$|E

25|$|Mullich {{contracted}} the Dreamers Guild {{to do the}} programming, artwork and sound effects. Its S.A.G.A. game engine {{was seen as an}} ideal user interface for the player to interact with the environment and to converse with the characters in AM's world. It was decided early on that high resolution graphics were necessary to capture the nuances and mood of Ellison's vivid imagination, and so Technical Director <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> adapted the engine to utilize SVGA graphics and included the Fastgraph graphics library. Mullich and Cyberdreams art director Peter Delgado had frequent meetings with Dreamers Guild art director Brad Schenck to devise art direction complementing the surreal nature of the story. Since the story takes place in the mind of a mad god who can make anything happen, the team chose a variety of art styles for each of the scenarios, ranging from the unsettling perspectives used in German Expressionist films to pure fantasy to stark reality. Assistant art director Glenn Price and his team rendered more than 60 backgrounds utilizing a number of 2D and 3D tools, including Deluxe Paint and LightWave. Hundreds of animations were drawn by assistant art director Jhoneil Centeno and his team of animators.|$|E

U.S. Ambassador <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> later revealed his instructions from Condoleezza Rice: [...] "We don't want a strong Secretary-General." [...] Tharoor was a protégé of the independently-minded Kofi Annan, and a senior American official told Tharoor that the US was determined to have [...] "No more Kofis." [...] After the vote, Tharoor withdrew his candidacy and declined Ban's invitation to remain in service beyond the expiry of his term as Under-Secretary-General.|$|E
500|$|In 1408, the Abbot <b>John</b> <b>Bolton</b> {{decided that}} the cost of {{maintaining}} the castle was excessive, and attempted to pull down the defences, but was prevented from doing so by Henry IV; this was followed by a period of rebuilding around 1429. The castle was used for smuggling by the Abbey, leading to complaints from merchants in English-controlled Calais that they were illegally trafficking wool, which in this period could only legally be sold through the French port. In 1487 the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel landed on Piel Island. He sought help from potential local supporters and held court at the castle, before advancing inland and ultimately being defeated at the Battle of Stoke Field. By 1534 the castle had fallen in ruin and was described in a report as [...] "sore decayed". In 1537, on the dissolution of the Abbey, it became the property of the Crown, and after 1660, was given to the Duke of Albermarle.|$|E
