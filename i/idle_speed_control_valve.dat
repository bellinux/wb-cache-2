The basic concept of engine <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> and the requirements and strategies of <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> were introduced, and the features and structures of CAN bus technology were analyzed. An <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> system of automobile engine based on CAN bus was designed which included main control module, front control module and rear control module. The overall structure, hardware design and software implementation of the system were given. The system can realize the desired functions, and it has certain application value...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} {{comparison of}} PID controllers for <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> {{internal combustion engine}} (ICE) is presented in this paper. There are three methods of PID tuning applied: heuristic tuning, self-tuning by pole placement, and also iterative learning algorithm (ILA).

40|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of ultra-lean burn engines {{continues}} to be a major focus of automotive engineers owing to the benefits offered in terms of fuel economy and emissions reduction. This paper applies a recently proposed linear time varying model predictive approach for the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of ultra-lean burn internal combustion engines. Unlike conventional gasoline engines, the approach uses fuel flow as the primary control variable to compensate for sudden fluctuations in engine load resulting in a fuel assisted <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> strategy. Simultaneously, the spark angle is maintained at a value so as to yield maximum brake torque while the emissions are reduced to negligibly low levels by constraining the engine operation to ultra-lean burn mode.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of hydrogen fueled internal combustion engine (H 2 ICE) using model predictive control (MPC) and sampled data control (SDC) theories. In the first step, results from SDC theory and a version of MPC are collectively employed to obtain a rigorously developed new generic control strategy. Here, a controller, based on a family of approximate discrete time models, is designed within a previously proposed framework to have guaranteed practical asymptotic stability of the exact (unknown) discrete time model. Controller design, accomplished using MPC theory, is facilitated by successive online linearizations of the nonlinear discrete time model at each sampling instant. In the second step, the technique is implemented in the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> of hydrogen internal combustion engine (H 2 ICE). Various conditions under which this theory can be implemented are presented and their validity for <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> problem are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of the Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automata (CARLA) methodology to PID controller parameter tuning. The PID controller parameters are initially set using the standard Zeigler-Nichols methods. The CARLA then selects parameters stochastically based on a distribution that converges to a Gaussian around the optimal parameter values. The CARLA adaptively tunes the controller parameters on-line, to minimise a performance criterion such as the sum of time error square. The method has the benefit of producing a controller with improved performance over the Zeigler-Nichols settings that is robust to noise and to the system non-linearities. Minimal system modelling is requires since it can be applied on-line optimising the parameters for the actual system. The method is demonstrated on various different systems in simulation. It is also demonstrated as a practical example for parameter tuning of a PID controller of an engine <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> system for a Ford Zetec 1. 8 engine during load change disturbances. <b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> is important to prevent engine stall and to help to reduce vehicle emissions...|$|R

Explicit MPC tools are employed to synthesize the controller to quickly assess controller complexity, local stability of the closed-loop dynamics, and for rapid prototype testing.

In particular, the MPC controller performs better than an existing baseline controller in the vehicle, is robust to changes in operating conditions, and to different types of disturbances.
