40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess {{fluoroscopic}} <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> in contemporary cardiac catheterization laboratories (CCL). BackgroundIncreasing attention is being focused on X-ray exposure during diagnostic and therapeutic cardiovascular procedures. MethodsWe measured fluoroscopic <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> (R/min) in 41 systems using a standardized methodology (National Electrical Manufacturers Association XR 21 phantom). Measurements were obtained at 2 different phantom thicknesses to simulate varying patient body habitus. ResultsFluoroscopic <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> under medium (median 3. 0 R/min, interquartile range 1. 4 R/min) and large (median 12. 5 R/min, interquartile range 4. 8 R/min) habitus conditions showed substantial variation. Fluoroscopic exposure was associated with simulated patient habitus, X-ray system type, vendor, and geographic region. Under medium habitus conditions, only 25 % of systems operated within a zone of lower than average <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> and satisfactory image quality; this frequency diminished to 7 % under large habitus conditions (p[*]< 0. 001). ConclusionsThere is substantial variation (4 - to 6 -fold) in fluoroscopic <b>exposure</b> <b>rates.</b> This variation was not consistently associated with improved image quality. In {{the absence of a}} predictable benefit of higher (or lower) than average <b>exposure</b> <b>rates,</b> CCL quality improvement programs must minimize such potentially harmful variability in X-ray exposure...|$|R

In this study, we use Arizona coccidioidomycosis case data for 1995 - 2006 {{to generate a}} timeseries of monthly estimates of <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> in Maricopa County, AZ and Pima County, AZ. We reveal a seasonal autocorrelation structure for <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> in both Maricopa County and Pima County which indicates that <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> are strongly related from the fall to the spring. An abrupt end to this autocorrelation relationship occurs near the {{the onset of the}} summer precipitation season and increasing <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> related to the subsequent season. The identification of the autocorrelation structure enabled us to construct a "primary" exposure season that spans August-March and a "secondary" season that spans April-June which are then used in subsequent analyses. We show that October-December precipitation is positively associated with <b>rates</b> of <b>exposure</b> for the primary exposure season in both Maricopa County (R =  0. 72, p =  0. 012) and Pima County (R =  0. 69, p =  0. 019). In addition, <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> during the primary exposure seasons are negatively associated with concurrent precipitation in Maricopa (R = - 0. 79, p =  0. 004) and Pima (R = - 0. 64, p =  0. 019), possibly due to reduced spore dispersion. These associations enabled the generation of models to estimate <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> for the primary exposure season. The models explain 69 % (p =  0. 009) and 54 % (p =  0. 045) {{of the variance in the}} study period for Maricopa and Pima counties, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 This thesis evaluates dose {{rates from}} the TRIGA® reactor by {{comparing}} ion chamber measured <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> to <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> calculated from MCNP 5 model data. The first step evaluates the energy distribution required to match ion chamber <b>exposure</b> <b>rates</b> from measurements taken at 1 foot increments above the reactor core. Next, the back calculated source activity {{is used to}} determine the <b>exposure</b> <b>rates,</b> at those same 1 ft increments above the core, {{in the event of a}} loss of coolant accident (LOCA). Then the energies deposited in simulated ion chambers, above the core are {{used to determine the}} dose rate to a person standing on top of the reactor bioshield after a LOCA. The dose rates that are calculated using the MCNP 5 data were compared to calculations from the Oregon State TRIGA® Reactor (OSTR) Safety Analysis Report (SAR). The final step is to determine the maximum dose rate at the OSTR facility perimeter after a LOCA, due to skyshine. The MCNP 5 results showed that OSTR SAR overestimates dose rates at the top of the reactor bioshield. The discrepancy stems from the OSTR SAR using worst case scenario data, while this report uses less conservative, yet accurate, assumptions. The instantaneous dose rates on the reactor building exterior from photon skyshine peak at approximately 30 mrem per hour. The integrated activity resulted in a dose rate of approximately. 005 mrem within the first hour after the reactor has shut down...|$|R

Empirical studies showed that classical item selection procedures based on maximizing Fisher or other related information yielded highly varied item exposure rates; with these procedures, some items were frequently used whereas others were rarely selected. In the literature, methods have been proposed for controlling exposure rates; they tend to affect the accuracy in θ estimates, however.
