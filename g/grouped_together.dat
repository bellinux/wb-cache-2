5|$|Sirenians are {{classified}} within the cohort Afrotheria in the clade Paenungulata, alongside Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Embrithopoda, Desmostylia, and Afroinsectiphilia. This clade was first established by George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as testicondy and similar fetal development. The Paenungulata, {{along with the}} Afrotheria, {{are one of the}} most well-supported mammalian clades in molecular phylogeny. Sirenia, Proboscidae, and Desmotylia are <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> in the clade Tethytheria. Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria, Perissodactyla, and Hyracoidea were considered to be <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> as the Altungulata, but this has been invalidated by molecular data.|$|E

5|$|The {{street is}} a square on the British Monopoly game board, forming {{part of the}} green set (together with Regent Street and Bond Street).

5|$|Until the mid-15th century, organs had no stop controls. Each manual {{controlled}} ranks {{at multiple}} pitches, {{known as the}} Blockwerk. Around 1450, controls were designed that allowed {{the ranks of the}} Blockwerk to be played individually. These devices were the forerunners of modern stop actions. The higher-pitched ranks of the Blockwerk remained <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> under a single stop control; these stops developed into mixtures.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E
5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to the violence and portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers to write letters to NBC in hopes that the show would be pulled off the air. Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a three disc set.|$|E

5|$|Insects can {{be divided}} into two groups {{historically}} treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while Zygentoma and Pterygota are <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not monophyletic, with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).|$|E
5|$|St Edwen's, {{which is}} used for worship by the Church in Wales, is one of seven churches in the {{combined}} benefice (churches <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> under an incumbent priest) of Bro Dwynwen. A service is held every Sunday morning using the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, either Holy Communion or Morning Prayer; there are no midweek services. The parish is within the deanery of Synod Ynys Mon, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2016, the priest in charge is the Reverend E Roberts and the associate priest is Canon Professor Leslie Francis.|$|E
5|$|The Exopterygota likely are paraphyletic {{in regard}} to the Endopterygota. Matters that have {{incurred}} controversy include Strepsiptera and Diptera <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> as Halteria based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs – a position not well-supported in the entomological community. The Neuropterida are often lumped or split on the whims of the taxonomist. Fleas are now thought to be closely related to boreid mecopterans. Many questions remain in the basal relationships among endopterygote orders, particularly the Hymenoptera.|$|E

The institutions are intended to be mixed sex. Playschools are intended for {{children under the age}} of six; the youngest children to attend are at least two years old. Children of single parents and students are given priority, and in some cases children with a handicap are also given priority. In the majority of cases, the children are divided into age groups, but in some smaller communities these may be <b>grouped</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.fallax grow {{scattered}} to <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> on the ground, or on very rotten conifer logs in alpine areas under standing conifers. They are fairly common, and typically found between August and October. L.fallax is {{distributed in the}} western United States and Canada, with the northern range extending to Alaska; the eastern range is bounded on the east by the Great Plains. Field observations suggest that the fungus can form ectomycorrhizal associations with Tsuga heterophylla. Hesler and Smith noted that the variety concolor was prevalent under species of Fir.|$|E
5|$|The {{microscopic}} {{characteristics and}} cytogenetics of C.micaceus are well known, {{and it has}} been used frequently as a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in Basidiomycetes. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> in the genus Coprinus. Based on external appearance, C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E
