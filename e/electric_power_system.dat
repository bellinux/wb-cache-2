25|$|In an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>system,</b> a load with a {{low power}} factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor {{for the same amount}} of useful power transferred. The higher {{currents}} increase the energy lost in the distribution system, and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers where there is a low power factor.|$|E
25|$|The cruise stage {{carried the}} MSL {{spacecraft}} through the void {{of space and}} delivered it to Mars. The interplanetary trip covered the distance of 352 million miles in 253 days. The cruise stage has its own miniature propulsion system, consisting of eight thrusters using hydrazine fuel in two titanium tanks. It also has its own <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>system,</b> consisting of a solar array and battery for providing continuous power. Upon reaching Mars, the spacecraft stopped spinning and a cable cutter separated the cruise stage from the aeroshell. Then the cruise stage was diverted into a separate trajectory into the atmosphere. In December 2012, the debris field from the cruise stage was located by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Since the initial size, velocity, density and impact angle of the hardware are known, it will provide information on impact processes on the Mars surface and atmospheric properties.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s a major battle erupted over {{building}} an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> in the Tennessee Valley, {{based on the}} World War I [...] federal dam at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. [...] It would generate electricity and produce fertilizer. [...] Senator George Norris of Nebraska blocked a proposal from Henry Ford in 1920 to use the dam to modernize the valley. Norris deeply distrusted privately owned utility companies. He did get Congress to pass the Muscle Shoals Bill, but it was vetoed as socialistic by President Herbert Hoover in 1931. The idea behind the Muscle Shoals Bill in 1933 became a core part of the New Deal's [...] TVA.|$|E
2500|$|Induction {{machines}} {{are some of}} the most common types of loads in the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> today. These machines use inductors, or large coils of wire to store energy in the form of a magnetic field. When a voltage is initially placed across the coil, the inductor strongly resists this change in current and magnetic field, which causes a time delay for the current to reach its maximum value. This causes the current to lag behind the voltage in phase. Inductors are said to [...] "sink" [...] reactive power, and thus to cause a lagging power factor. Induction generators can source or sink reactive power, and provide a measure of control to system operators over reactive power flow and thus voltage. Because these devices have opposite effects on the phase angle between voltage and current, they can be used to [...] "cancel out" [...] each other's effects. This usually takes the form of capacitor banks being used to counteract the lagging power factor caused by induction motors.|$|E
