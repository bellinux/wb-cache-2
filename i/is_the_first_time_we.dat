500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Evicted!" [...] {{was largely}} positive. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in [...] "Evicted!" [...] as the fourth best {{moment in the}} series' first season. He wrote that [...] "sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> meet her and she's awesome." [...] He later wrote that [...] "Marceline = best". Marceline {{has gone on to}} be one of the most popular characters with the Adventure Time fan base, and after the release of [...] "Evicted!" [...] her popularity grew enormously. Ward later noted that he felt [...] "good about that. It's nice". Oliver Sava of The A.V.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> really see George as the character we know and love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E
500|$|Marceline has {{attracted}} positive critical attention. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club praised {{that the fact}} that she is one [...] "of this show’s most tragic characters". He later wrote that her addition [...] "was a major turning point for the series, introducing a hip, adventure-loving female to the cast who can hold her own against Finn and Jake and also has a strong connection to Ooo’s past." [...] Furthermore, he noted that [...] "she’s been at the center of some of the show’s most emotional episodes", and [...] "beyond her dramatic value, Marceline tends to just make every episode better" [...] because [...] "her writers clearly enjoy writing scenes for her". Susana Polo of The Mary Sue referred to the character as [...] "one of the radder characters" [...] in the series. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in [...] "Evicted!" [...] as the fourth best moment in the series' first season. He wrote that [...] "sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> meet her and she's awesome." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Piper Maru" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{an overview of}} the third season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated an A. The review described [...] "Piper Maru" [...] as featuring [...] "a tough and sentimental Scully", noting that [...] "action-packed detective work by Mulder enhance an already crackling scenario." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and wrote positively of the unfolding mythology, noting that the [...] "great thing about [...] "Piper Maru" [...] is that it still belongs to the period of time when the mythology episodes were exposing us to more pieces of the puzzle, fitting in various things that we were meant to incorporate into the whole. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> meet the black oil, but it's obvious that others know all about it". Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode eight out of ten, and complimented the introduction of the black oil, writing [...] "this episode is a good introduction to the black oil virus, providing a bridge from the mythology elements earlier in the season to the larger scope of the conspiracy to be revealed." [...] Nick De Semlyen and James White of Empire named it the sixth [...] "greatest" [...] episode of the series, describing it as [...] "thrilling", [...] "pacey" [...] and [...] "balanced".|$|E

2500|$|The name Avalokitasvara {{was later}} supplanted by the Avalokiteśvara form {{containing}} the ending -īśvara, {{which does not}} occur in Sanskrit before the seventh century. The original form Avalokitasvara already appears in Sanskrit fragments of the fifth century. The original meaning of the name [...] "Avalokitasvara" [...] fits the Buddhist {{understanding of the role}} of a bodhisattva. The reinterpretation presenting him as an īśvara shows a strong influence of Śaivism, as the term īśvara was usually connected to the Hindu notion of Śiva as a creator god and ruler of the world. While some of those who venerated Avalokiteśvara upheld the Buddhist rejection of the doctrine of any creator god, Britannica Encyclopedia does cite Avalokiteshvara as the Creator of the World and this position is also taken in the widely popular Karandavyuha Sutra with its famous mantra Om Mani Padme Hum. In addition, the influential Lotus Sutra which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> come across Avalokiteshwara in Chapter 25 does refer to Him as [...] "Lokeshwara" [...] which means (Lord God of all beings) and Lokenath (Lord and Protector of all beings) and ascribes to Him extreme attributes of Divinity. The Lotus Sutra has been dated to between the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE.|$|E
