40|$|This work {{presents}} an efficient method for image multi-zone segmentation under human supervision. As {{most of the}} segmentation methods, our procedure relies on an energy minimization and this energy contains a data-consistent term and a coherence term. In this work, the pixel-by-pixel data-consistent term {{is based on a}} Support Vector Machine designed {{in order to deal with}} color and textural information. For the coherence term, our contribution is to take into account the gradient information of the image through the use of a Canny edge detector. To minimize the energy, as in Blake et al. ([1]), we use a Graph-Cut algorithm. Finally, we obtain excellent segmentation results at low computational cost. We compare our results on an <b>image</b> <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> on-line...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA brightness-dependent {{version of}} Tarpley's model {{adjusted}} to ground data is {{used with a}} thirteen-year GOES satellite <b>image</b> <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> to obtain satellite-derived monthly averages of daily global solar irradiation on a horizontal surface with 20 km spatial resolution. The estimates cover all the territory of Uruguay and neighboring areas. These results are validated against other satellite derived irradiation data and against independent long-term ground data. The comparison with the previous solar map shows that the solar irradiation is 5 - 7 % higher than previous estimates derived from long term sunshine hours observations. The first map of direct irradiation at normal incidence (DNI) for the area is also calculated, using a pre-existing global to diffuse model to separate the direct and diffuse components of hourly global irradiation...|$|E
40|$|Altitudes and {{relative}} ages of mare surface units {{were compared to}} test if a systematic correlation in height of lava eruption surfaces and age might reflect a corresponding increase in depth of the magma chamber with time; in addition the altitudes were studied {{to shed light on}} the time and place of warping of mare surfaces. The laser altimeter data from the Apollo missions {{and relative}} age data based on crater erosion models and crater counts were used for the study. The data were correlated by using the <b>image</b> <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> of the Lunar Geoscience Consortium. Results of {{the first part of the}} study are inconclusive as no systematic increase in height of lavas with time could be shown. The data of the second part of the study support the conclusion that mare surfaces may have warped throughout most of the time represented by sample ages from the Apollo missions, and that the lithosphere may have become strong enough to remain stable after the time of Apollo 12 samples around 3 b. y. ago...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{have been}} {{developing}} a systematic effort to collect good quality {{images of the}} optical counterpart of ICRF sources, in particular for {{those that have been}} regularly radio surveyed either for future implementation at high frequencies and/or those that will be the link sources between the ICRF and the Gaia CRF. Observations have been taken at the LNA/Brazil, CASLEO/Argentina, NOT/Spain, LFOA/Austria, Rozhen/Bulgária, and ASV/Serbia. In complement images were collected from the SDSS. As a step to implement such <b>image</b> <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> and make it publicly available through the IERS service we present its description, that comprises for each source the number of measurements, filter, pixel scale, size of field, and seeing at each observation. The photometry analysis is centered on the morphology, since there remain still cases in which the host galaxy is overwhelming, and many cases in which the host asks for a non-stellar PSF modeling. On basis of the neighbor stars we assign magnitudes and variability whenever possible. Finally, assisted by previous literature, the redshift and luminosity are used to derive astrophysical quantities, in special the absolute magnitude, SED and spectral index. Moreover, since Gaia will not obtain direct images of the observed sources, the morphology and magnitude becomes useful as templates onto which assembling and interpreting the one-dimensional and uncontinuous line spread function samplings that will be delivered by Gaia for each QSO...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Application {{of virtual}} slides (VS), the {{digitalization}} of complete glass slides, {{is in its}} infancy to be implemented in routine diagnostic surgical pathology and to issues {{that are related to}} tissue-based diagnosis, such as education and scientific publication. Approach Electronic publication in Pathology offers new features of scientific communication in pathology that cannot be obtained by conventional paper based journals. Most of these features are based upon completely open or partly directed interaction between the reader and the system that distributes the article. One of these interactions can be applied to microscopic images allowing the reader to navigate and magnify the presented images. VS and interactive Virtual Microscopy (VM) are a tool to increase the scientific value of microscopic images. Technology and Performance The open access journal Diagnostic Pathology [URL] has existed for about five years. It is a peer reviewed journal that publishes all types of scientific contributions, including original scientific work, case reports and review articles. In addition to digitized still images the authors of appropriate articles are requested to submit the underlying glass slides to an institution (DiagnomX. eu, and Leica. com) for digitalization and documentation. The images are stored in a separate <b>image</b> <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> which is adequately linked to the article. The normal review process is not involved. Both processes (peer review and VS acquisition) are performed contemporaneously in order to minimize a potential publication delay. VS are not provided with a DOI index (digital object identifier). The first articles that include VS were published in March 2011. Results and Perspectives Several logistic constraints had to be overcome until the first articles including VS could be published. Step by step an automated acquisition and distribution system had to be implemented to the corresponding article. The acceptance of VS by the reader is high {{as well as by the}} authors. Of specific value are the increased confidence to and reputation of authors as well as the presented information to the reader. Additional associated functions such as access to author-owned related image collections, reader-controlled automated image measurements and image transformations are in preparation.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the problem of {{colorimetric}} fidelity of digitized colour slides representing fine al? paintings. This consists of a comparison between colour measurements provided by spectrophotometry on fourteen original colour samples, which are uniformly painted square-shaped patches and those taken on digitized colour slides of the same colour samples. Digital acquisition of slides were performed by a 3 CCD detector and a combination of colour correction filters. The obtained R-cam, G(cam), and B-cam values were then corrected and transformed into X-cam, Y-cam, and Z(cam) values based on the CIE 1931 XYZ colorimetric system. The colour difference, Delta E-CMC*, in the CMC uniform colour space is also calculated and found to be equal to seven, Delta E-CMC* = 7, in average value, when colour compensating filters are used. This method is finally applied to four art works reproduced on different slides, and colour results were qualitatively compared as an indication to these resulting from Ostwald disk and saturation diagrams of previous research studies related to paintings that are created br the same artists. This comparison led to the same conclusions that were already proposed by the previous researchers. The results clearly demonstrate the contribution of the method to a computer-aided study of art works through <b>image</b> <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> that are realized by slides, taking into consideration, however, that this study consists of a first approach, offering a promising {{solution to the problem of}} colour accuracy of slides.

40|$|The newly {{emerging}} technology of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) {{has the potential}} to revolutionise molecular imaging. XFELs generate very intense X-ray pulses and predictions suggest that they may be used for structure determination to atomic resolution even for single molecules. XFELs produce femtosecond pulses that outrun processes of radiation damage and permit the study of structures at room temperature and of structural dynamics. While the first demonstrations of flash X-ray diffractive imaging (FXI) on biological particles were encouraging, they also revealed technical challenges. In this work we demonstrated how some of these challenges can be overcome. We exemplified, with heterogeneous cell organelles, how tens of thousands of FXI diffraction patterns can be collected, sorted, and analysed in an automatic data processing pipeline. We improved  image resolution and reduced problems with missing data. We validated, described, and deposited the experimental data in the Coherent X-ray <b>Imaging</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Bank.</b> We demonstrated that aerosol injection can be used to collect FXI data at high hit ratios and with low background. We reduced problems with non-volatile sample contaminants by decreasing aerosol droplet sizes from ~ 1000 nm to ~ 150 nm. We achieved this by adapting an electrospray aerosoliser to the Uppsala sample injector. Mie scattering imaging was used as a diagnostic tool to measure positions, sizes, and velocities of individual injected particles. XFEL experiments generate large amounts of data at high rates. Preparation, execution, and data analysis of these experiments benefits from specialised software. In this work we present new open-source software tools that facilitates prediction, online-monitoring, display, and pre-processing of XFEL diffraction data. We hope that this work is a valuable contribution in the quest of transitioning FXI from its first experimental demonstration into a technique that fulfills its potentials...|$|R

40|$|Background: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is widely applied for examination and diagnosis of brain tumors {{based on its}} advantages of high resolution in detecting the soft tissues and especially of its harmless radiation damages to human bodies. The goal of the processing of images is automatic segmentation of brain edema and tumors, in different dimensions of the magnetic resonance images. Methods: The proposed method {{is based on the}} unsupervised method which discovers the tumor region, if there is any, by analyzing the similarities between two hemispheres and computes the image size of the goal function based on Bhattacharyya coefficient which is used in the next stage to detect the tumor region or some part of it. In this stage, for reducing the color variation, the gray brain image is segmented, then it is turned to gray again. The self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is used the segmented brain image is colored and finally the tumor is detected by matching the detected region and the colored image. This method is proposed to analyze MRI images for discovering brain tumors, and done in Bu Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran, in 2014. Results: The results for 30 randomly selected <b>images</b> from <b>data</b> <b>bank</b> of MRI center in Hamedan was compared with manually segmentation of experts.
