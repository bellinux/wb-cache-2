25|$|Tires were 9.00x20 with dual rear tires. Brakes {{were full}} air with drum brakes on all wheels. Trailer air {{connections}} applied trailer-brakes with the truck brakes and a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> could apply the trailer brakes alone.|$|E
25|$|All 2009 models came {{standard}} with Infiniti's new seven-speed {{automatic transmission}} {{that was also}} introduced on the 2009 FX35 and FX50, updated from the previous five-speed transmission. The G37 Sedan or Coupe could be equipped with a six-speed manual transmission by specifying the Sport 6MT model. The Base, Journey and X models could not be ordered with manual transmissions, however the Sport Package included all sport options of the 6MT model (excluding the manual transmission and the <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> parking brake), and was available for the Journey and X models.|$|E
2500|$|The WC, {{with many}} good {{features}} and various first-to-market attributes, {{had at least}} a few drawbacks. Its clutch was not particularly well designed, and, like other tractors of the 1920s through mid-1930s, it lacked usability in the design of its brake controls, with a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> {{on each side of the}} tractor, which meant that applying the brakes took the operator's hands away from other controls. Other tractors had foot pedals on both sides, but that meant that the clutch and left brake could not be operated simultaneously. The solution came in the late 30s, when [...] various brands moved both brake pedals to the right foot.|$|E

50|$|Bennett's team at RM custom-milled the Tomahawk {{components}} from {{blocks of}} aluminum. Under the seat are two alloy pieces that began as 750 lb billets that are machined down to 25 lb each, and polished to a mirror finish. Details like <b>hand</b> <b>levers</b> and the twistgrip use needle and ball bearings.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "rod-actuated brake", {{or simply}} [...] "rod brake", (roller lever brake in Raleigh terminology) uses {{a series of}} rods and pivots, rather than Bowden cables, to {{transmit}} force applied to a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface, which faces the hub, of the wheel rim. They were often called [...] "stirrup brakes" [...] due to their shape. Rod brakes are used with a rim profile known as the Westwood rim, which has a slightly concave area on the braking surface and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads {{on opposite sides of}} the rim.|$|E
2500|$|A press. In {{the past}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> presses were used, but were largely {{superseded}} by hydraulic presses. The press forces the tea into a metal form that is occasionally {{decorated with a}} motif in sunken-relief. Due to its efficiency, this method is used to make almost all forms of pressed pu'er. Tea can be pressed either with or without it being bagged, with the latter done by using a metal mould. Tightly compressed bǐng, formed directly into a mold without bags using this method are known as tié bǐng ( [...] , literally [...] "iron cake/puck") due to its density and hardness. The taste of densely compressed raw pu'er is believed to benefit from careful aging for up to several decades.|$|E
2500|$|Lambert {{stopped the}} work {{at this stage of}} {{fabrication}} and shipped the non-working engine and incomplete automobile to a small machine shop that he owned in Ohio City. This way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there. The automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains, which were connected to a jack shaft. The two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no reverse speed used. The single front wheel of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> This direct steering method provided that the arms could be rested and the steering done by the feet, and vice versa. One item that needed to be solved for completion and a working engine was a means of carburation. Lambert heard of a means of vaporizing gasoline by Gottlieb Daimler of Germany. He went to New York to see the engine that was operating a boat. After seeing this complicated carburetor Lambert developed what he called the [...] "vaporizer." [...] This was a simpler carburetor than Daimler's, which he was then able to get the engine working the way he intended it to. The automobile was completed soon after he had it Ohio City.|$|E

On {{the south side of the}} main platform there was also a long bay platform. In common with most of the island's railway system points and signals were not fully interlocked, but controlled by individual <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> Therefore, there was no signal box or groundframe.|$|R

2500|$|Land sailing {{has evolved}} from a novelty, since the 1950s, [...] {{primarily}} into a sport. The vehicles used in sailing are known as land or sand yachts. They typically have three (sometimes four) wheels and function much like a sailboat, except that they are operated from a sitting or lying position and steered by pedals or <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> Land sailing is best suited for windy flat areas; races often take place on beaches, airfields, and dry lake beds in desert regions.|$|R

50|$|Early cars {{such as the}} Ford Model T had a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> {{to control}} the {{throttle}}. Later cars used both a foot pedal and a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> to set the minimum throttle. This was an early form of cruise control. The 1918 Stutz Bearcat had a central throttle pedal with the clutch and brake {{to the right and}} left. Modern cruise control was invented in 1948.|$|E

50|$|At a {{time when}} most hang gliders used a {{flexible}} Rogallo wing, Icarus I used a rigid flying wing biplane configuration. Unlike other hang gliders of the time, the Icarus was not steered by the pilot shifting his body weight. Instead, Icarus I had two large rudders mounted near the wing tips, controlled by <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> These rudders made Icarus I much more maneuverable than other hang gliders. Pitch was controlled by the pilot shifting his body weight fore and aft. The pilot flew in a reclining position, rather than the prone position used by other hang gliders.|$|R
50|$|The Points Box {{remained}} in use until {{the summer of}} 1970 when the point work of the Port Erin arrival platform and its associated signals were disconnected. These points were then controlled with <b>hand</b> <b>levers</b> and the signals were placed permanently in the 'off' position so that trains could arrive and depart without the box being manned, saving the associated wage costs. Thereafter, it was used only for more complicated shunting movements in which case it would be manned {{by a member of}} the train crew or the stationmaster. The remainder was taken out of use in 1979/80 when the old Port Erin Platforms - 5 & 6 - were removed and the area cleared for parking.|$|R

50|$|When {{this type}} of valve is tripped, the flow is quickly stopped and an {{indicator}} disc tells the operator that the electrical circuit has been opened by a failure somewhere in the system. When the system failure has been corrected so that the circuit is again closed, the valve can be opened {{by the action of}} the <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> If, however, the system failure has not been satisfactorily corrected, the circuit will remain open and moving the <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> will not open the valve, because the valve stem remains disengaged from the handle.|$|E

50|$|The BMW R12 had a four-speed manual gearbox, {{operated}} by a <b>hand</b> shift <b>lever</b> on the fuel tank's right side. Several detail variations were seen in production. In common with most BMW Motorcycles, final drive was via shaft, with the drive shaft {{on the right side}} of the motorcycle.|$|R
5000|$|The front brakes are two-piston design, {{while the}} single rear caliper houses four pistons. Both front brakes are {{activated}} {{by the right}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> The rear brake is activated by the foot pedal on the right.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} form of gab {{valve gear}} or 'gab clutch' {{was a simple}} notch in the valve rod, where it hooked over the valve spindle. A <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> allowed this notch to be lifted, thus disengaging the valve drive and promptly stopping the engine.|$|E
50|$|Some early manned flight {{attempts}} {{may have}} been intended to achieve flapping-wing flight, though probably only a glide was actually achieved. These include the purported flights of the 11th-century monk Eilmer of Malmesbury (recorded in the 12th century) and the 9th-century poet Abbas Ibn Firnas (recorded in the 17th century). Roger Bacon, writing in 1260, was also {{among the first to}} consider a technological means of flight. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci began to study the flight of birds. He grasped that humans are too heavy, and not strong enough, to fly using wings simply attached to the arms. He therefore sketched a device in which the aviator lies down on a plank and works two large, membranous wings using <b>hand</b> <b>levers,</b> foot pedals, and a system of pulleys.|$|R
50|$|Cable-pull 'V' Brakes {{also use}} the hub or metal discs as a braking surface. The <b>hand</b> {{operated}} <b>lever</b> pulls a metal cable to push polyurethane blocks against the braking surface. Advantages include low cost, low weight, and easy installation and maintenance. Disadvantages include low braking power, {{and the need to}} be regularly adjusted.|$|R
5000|$|School buses {{which are}} {{equipped}} with a hydraulic brake system will have a <b>hand</b> brake <b>lever</b> {{to the left of}} the driver (in left hand drive buses) near the floor. It is operated by pushing the lever down with one's hand to apply the brake, and pulling it upwards to release it.|$|R
