40|$|International audienceIn hot dip galvanizing, {{steel strip}} is coated by {{immersion}} in a bath of molten zinc. The principal reactions that {{occur at the}} steel/liquid zinc interface are (1) dissolution of iron and (2) nucleation and growth of intermetallic compounds.

For this purpose, a rotating disk device has been developed to study the dissolution and diffusion of iron in pure liquid zinc at the temperature usually employed in <b>galvanizing</b> <b>baths</b> (465 degreesC).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} a three-dimensional finite element solution algorithm for the prediction of the velocity, temperature and species concentration fields in an industrial continuous <b>galvanizing</b> <b>bath.</b> Simulations were carried out using a parallel CFD software developed at IMI-NRC. The turbulent flow, heat and mass transfer has been solved using a high Reynolds number k 2 ̆ 0133 ̆b 5 model. Simulations were carried out for the case when the density of the molten metal depends only on the temperature and also for the case when both temperature and Al concentration affect the density. When considering the buoyancy effect of the Al concentration, differences are especially apparent during the melting of ingots with high Al content. Otherwise, thermal effects are dominant. The continuous monitoring of the temperature and the Al and Fe content in an industrial bath was used to validate the flow, temperature and compositional variations. A period of three hours, corresponding to three different ingot additions, was simulated successfully, resulting in a good agreement of the temperature and compositional variations.

The cover plate consist of insulating materials compacted to retain the heat in the bath tub. The thermal convection of air is less than thermal resistance of insulating materials used thus heat loss is negligible.

50|$|Production of {{galvannealed}} {{sheet steel}} begins with {{hot dip galvanization}} of sheet steel. After passing through the <b>galvanizing</b> zinc <b>bath</b> the sheet steel passes through air knives to remove excess zinc, and is then heated in an annealing furnace for several seconds causing iron and zinc layers to diffuse into one another causing the formation of zinc-iron alloy layers at the surface. The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 °C. Pre-1990 annealing lines used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{detailed}} failure analysis of galvanized high carbon steel wires, which developed coating cracks during the torsion test performed as a quality control {{at the end of}} the manufacturing process. Careful visual inspections showed that the cracks are already present in the coating before the torsion test. In order to explain the origin of these cracks, systematic metallographic investigations were performed by means of optical and scanning electron microscope on both the wires and the rods that have been cold drawn to produce the wire. The chemical composition of the galvanized coatings was evaluated by means of energy dispersive spectroscopy. Micro bidimensional X-ray diffraction experiments were also performed to measure the residual stresses in the galvanized coating. The results showed that the failure is related to two main factors: the relatively high content of silicon in the steel and the unsuitable cooling rate of the rods at the exit from the <b>galvanizing</b> <b>bath.</b> The mechanism proposed to explain the origin of the defects was supported by Finite Elements Methods simulations and verified with in-plant tests.

40|$|The {{influence}} of copper, cadmium and tin additions in the <b>galvanizing</b> <b>bath</b> on the morphology and thickness of galvanized coatings {{has been studied}} using X-ray diffraction and optical and scanning electron microscopy associated with energy-dispersive spectroscopy microanalysis. Copper promotes the delta(1) phase and hinders the zeta phase growth. In the opposite, cadmium promotes the zeta and Gamma phase formation and hinders {{the growth of the}} delta(1) phase. No change in the morphology of galvanized coatings has been observed with the addition of tin. Mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the effect of the above elements on the formation of intermetallics. The cracking of the coatings after tensile testing in the plastic region of the specimens has been examined. The delta(1) phase is responsible for the nucleation and propagation of transverse cracks parallel to the steel substrate. Cadmium hinders the nucleation and propagation of the transverse cracks during loading up to the yield point of the steel; however, the columnar growth of the zeta phase results in the complete flaking of the coating during loading up to the ultimate tensile strength of steel. The Gamma phase remains always adhered to the steel substrate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — During {{the study}} of {{continuous}} galvanizing line, large amount of waste material is observed near the surface of bath. Dross is formed due to reaction between aluminum, iron and zinc in the zinc bath. The coupled phenomena of aluminum, strip temperature and iron dissolution were simulated in order to predict and {{to better understand the}} generation and movement of inter metallic dross particles within certain regions of a typical <b>galvanizing</b> <b>bath.</b> Solutions for the temperature and aluminum concentration can be correlated with the solubility limits of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) to determine the amount of precipitated aluminum in the form of Fe 2 Al 5 Zn x dross.

40|$|Purpose: An {{analytical}} model {{is provided in}} order to reveal the mechanism of the intermetallic multi-layer formation on a substrate. Thus, formations of the Al 3 Ni 2 – Al 3 Ni intermetallic multi-layer on the Ni – substrate and Fe 3 Zn 10 – FeZn 10 – FeZn 13 intermetallic multi-layer on the Fe (armco) multi-layer are considered.

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis {{has been developed}} to simulate the velocity and temperature fields in an industrial <b>galvanizing</b> <b>bath</b> for the continuous coating of steel strip. Operating variables such as ingot addition, line speed, and inductor mixing were evaluated {{in order to determine}} their effect on the velocity and temperature distribution in the bath. The simulations were carried out using high-performance computational fluid-dynamics software developed at the Industrial Materials Institute of the National Research Council Canada (IMI-NRC) in solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for steady-state and transient turbulent flow using the k- 3 ̆b 5 model. Cases with and without temperature-dependent density conditions were considered. It was found that the strip velocity does not alter the global flow pattern but modifies the velocities in the snout, near the strip, and near the sink and guide rolls. At a low inductor capacity, the effect of induced mixing is small but is considerably increased at the maximum inductor capacities used during ingot-melting periods. When considering the thermal effects, the flow is affected by variations in density especially near the inductors and the ingot, while little effect is observed near the sheet-and-roller region. Thermal effects are also amplified when the inductor operates at high capacity during ingot melting. The simulations allow visualization of regions of varying velocity and temperature fields and clearly illustrate the mixed and stagnant zones for different operating conditions.

40|$|The coupled {{phenomena}} of momentum, heat, and mass transfer were simulated {{in order to}} predict and {{to better understand the}} generation and movement of intermetallic dross particles within certain regions of a typical <b>galvanizing</b> <b>bath.</b> Solutions for the temperature and aluminum concentration can be correlated with the solubility limits of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) to determine the amount of precipitated aluminum in the form of Fe 2 Al 5 top dross. Software developed by the Industrial Materials Institute of the National Research Council of Canada (IMI-NRC), including k- 3 ̆b 5 turbulence modeling for heat and mass transfer, was adapted for the simulation of a sequence of operating parameters. Each case was modeled over a period of 1 hour, taking into account an ingot-melting period followed by a nonmelting period. The presence of an ingot significantly changes the temperature distribution and also results in important variations in the local aluminum concentration, since the makeup ingot has a higher aluminum concentration. The simulation showed that during the ingot melting, the total aluminum concentration is higher at the ingot side of the bath than at the strip exit side. The region below the ingot presents the highest aluminum concentration, whereas lower aluminum concentrations were found in the region above the sink roll, between the strip and the free surface. It was shown that precipitates form near the ingot surface because this region is surrounded by a solution at 420 0 C, which is lower than the average bath temperature of 460 0 C. When no ingot is present, the total aluminum concentration becomes much more uniform and decreases with time at a constant rate, depending on the coating thickness. This information is of major significance in the prediction of the formation of dross particles, which can cause defects on the coated product. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Zinc is used widely as a {{corrosion}} resistant coating on steel. However, in Europe, zinc {{is considered an}} environmental pollutant. Zinc-aluminum alloy coatings {{may be able to}} minimize the leaching of zinc into the environment. There are a number of thermodynamic and chemical variables that make the zinc-aluminum coating on steel more durable, in terms of thickness, hardness, corrosion rate, and roughness, thus minimizing zinc pollution and enhancing the durability of the galvanized product. Among these variables are the <b>galvanizing</b> <b>bath</b> temperature and chemical composition, and item immersion time and withdrawal rate. One way to investigate the interaction of these variables is via the use of neural networks. Neural networks are especially useful in mapping independent variables (such as temperature, percentage of alloying metals) to dependent variables (such as zinc layer hardness and thickness) that may be related to each other in a nonlinear fashion. Neural networks learn to recognize patterns, and subsequently store their knowledge after being exposed to a set of sample patterns. This stored knowledge can be used for prediction given a different set of input patterns. The ability of neural networks to predict output after the learning process has been completed makes them very useful in the study of galvanizing. Instead of having to use a great number of experiments to determine the characteristics of the galvanized zinc layer, a neural network can be used to model the galvanizing process, and can predict the properties of the galvanized layer, again, without having to resort to endless experiments - 2 ̆ 2 a Virtual Galvanizing Laboratory. 2 ̆ 2 Actual laboratory experiments using zinc-aluminum alloy galvanizing baths were conducted in Rhesca Laboratories, Helsinki, Finland, using a Hot Dip Galvanizing Simulator.

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} was to extend the {{lifetime}} of hardware submerged in molten metal by an order of magnitude and to improve energy efficiency of molten metal handling process. Assuming broad implementation of project results, energy savings in 2020 were projected to be 10 trillion BTU/year, with cost savings of approximately $ 100 million/year. The project team was comprised of materials research groups from West Virginia University and the Missouri University of Science and Technology formerly University of Missouri – Rolla, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, International Lead and Zinc Research Organization, Secat and Energy Industries of Ohio. Industry partners included six suppliers to the hot dip galvanizing industry, four end-user steel companies with hot-dip Galvanize and/or Galvalume lines, eight refractory suppliers, and seven refractory end-user companies. The results of the project included the development of: (1) New families of materials more resistant to degradation in hot-dip <b>galvanizing</b> <b>bath</b> conditions were developed; (2) Alloy 2020 weld overlay material and process were developed and applied to GI rolls; (3) New Alloys and dross-cleaning procedures were developed for Galvalume processes; (4) Two new refractory compositions, including new anti-wetting agents, were identified for use with liquid aluminum alloys; (5) A new thermal conductivity measurement technique was developed and validated at ORNL; (6) The Galvanizing Energy Profiler Decision Support System (GEPDSS) at WVU; Newly Developed CCW Laser Cladding Shows Better Resistance to Dross Buildup than 316 L Stainless Steel; and (7) A novel method of measuring the corrosion behavior of bath hardware materials. Project in-line trials were conducted at Southwire Kentucky Rod and Cable Mill, Nucor-Crawfordsville, Nucor-Arkansas, Nucor-South Carolina, Wheeling Nisshin, California Steel, Energy Industries of Ohio, and Pennex Aluminum. Cost, energy, and environmental benefits resulting from the project are due to: i) a reduced number of process shutdowns to change hardware or lining material, ii) reduced need to produce new hardware or lining material, iii) improved product quality leads to reduced need to remake product or manufacturing of new product, iv) reduction in contamination of melt from degradation of refractory and metallic components, v) elimination of worn hardware will increase efficiency of process, vi) reduced refractory lining deterioration or formation of a less insulating phase, would result in decreased heat loss through the walls. Projected 2015 benefits for the U. S. aluminum industry, assuming 21 % market penetration of improved refractory materials, are energy savings of approximately 0. 2 trillion BTU/year, cost savings of $ 2. 3 billion/year and carbon reductions of approximately 1. 4 billion tons/year. The carbon reduction benefit of the project for the hot-dip galvanize and aluminum industries combined is projected to be approximately 2. 2 billion tons/year in 2015.
