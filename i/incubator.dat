5|$|Youngstown's downtown, {{which once}} underscored the community's {{economic}} difficulties, is {{a site of}} new business growth. The Youngstown Business <b>Incubator</b> (YBI), {{in the heart of}} the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies that have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities. Some companies supported by the <b>incubator</b> have earned recognition, and a few are starting to outgrow their current space. One such company–Turning Technologies–has been rated by Inc. Magazine as the fastest-growing privately held software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing privately held company overall. In an effort to keep such companies downtown, the YBI secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion. The project will be funded by a $2 million federal grant awarded in 2006. In 2014, the YBI was ranked as the number 1 university associated business <b>incubator</b> in the world by the Swedish UBII (University Business <b>Incubator</b> Index). In 2015, the YBI was the top University Associated <b>Incubator</b> in North America, and came in second to the Dublin Enterprise & Technology Centre, also known as the Guinness Enterprise Centre, in Dublin.|$|E

30|$|This {{diversity}} is {{taken into account}} in the literature through the proposal of different typologies. Although we are by no means being exhaustive, in this paper we can present some of the most commonly found typologies in the literature. The first typology identifies five types of incubators: regional <b>incubators,</b> university <b>incubators,</b> virtual <b>incubators,</b> independent commercial <b>incubators,</b> and internal business <b>incubators.</b> This typology is often quoted in the literature as being used as the basis for several works (Carayannis and Von Zedtwitz 2005; von Zedtwitz 2003; von Zedtwitz and Grimaldi 2006). It was established {{on the basis of the}} strategic objectives of <b>incubators.</b> The first two are not generally aiming to make a profit. Their focus is more on economic and technological development. As for virtual <b>incubators,</b> they are more focused on the Internet and ICT sectors, with the aim of making large profits but with a reasonably high risk factor. On the other hand, although independent commercial <b>incubators</b> and internal business <b>incubators</b> also hope to make a large profit, these last two generally have a lower risk factor.|$|R

30|$|Albert et al.

These different criteria allow the authors to identify four types of structure: economic development <b>incubators,</b> academic and scientific <b>incubators,</b> business <b>incubators,</b> and private investment <b>incubators.</b> Without going {{into the details of}} all the criteria, let us simply note that the first two types of structure are not for profit, contrary to the last two. We should also note that only economic development <b>incubators</b> support general projects, while the other three specialize in high tech projects.|$|R

40|$|The study {{proposes a}} three stage {{model of the}} {{development}} of business incubation practices in emerging markets. The model addresses the diffusion of incubation practices to new markets, the institutionalization of those practices and the co-evolution of <b>incubators</b> and national networks of incubation.

New <b>incubators</b> in emerging markets often face strong cultural norms and institutional impediments to helping entrepreneurs start new businesses. As incubation becomes better established in a country, <b>incubators</b> provide more advanced technical, legal and market-based advice.

40|$|Internationally, design <b>incubators</b> {{have emerged}} {{as a result of}} clustering. These design <b>incubators</b> serve as artist studios, or as design centers {{providing}} opportunities for young emerging entrepreneurs to acquire studio workspaces located within a cluster of similar economic activities. In South Africa, design <b>incubators,</b> particularly fashion design <b>incubators,</b> have emerged in the Johannesburg Fashion District, situated within the central business district of Johannesburg. Research conducted in 2006 established that {{there were a number of}} emerging fashion designers located within the Johannesburg Fashion District design <b>incubators.</b> However, interviews conducted in 2012 revealed that the number of fashion designers positioned within these design <b>incubators</b> had declined. This paper contextualizes the fashion design <b>incubators</b> within the Johannesburg Fashion District and deliberates the reasons for this decline. The paper then moves on to discuss the fundamental role of fashion design education in sustaining these fashion design <b>incubators.</b> The paper pursues a qualitative research paradigm employing semi-­‐structured interviews with business stakeholder participants affiliated with the fashion design <b>incubators.</b> A content method of data analysis categorized the raw data into themes. Two major themes emerged, namely, the factors contributing to the decline mentioned above, and the role of fashion design education. Given that fashion design <b>incubators</b> may support economic development and the sustainability of the fashion industry, fashion design education could play a central role in sustaining these design <b>incubators.</b> As such, this paper contributes to the development of sustainability within the fashion sector and the discourse of fashion design education within a South African context...|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} of business incubation is achieved through business <b>incubators.</b> <b>Incubators</b> are major {{actors in the}} entrepreneurial ecosystem by linking talent, technology, capital and know-how (Todorovic & Moenter, 2010; Bejarano, 2012; Levakova, 2012; Al-Mubaraki et al. 2013). However, definitional challenges exist on what constitute business <b>incubators</b> or business incubation (Bergek & Norrman, 2008). Sources of this definitional challenge arise from the confusion of virtual <b>incubators</b> with traditional <b>incubators</b> that provide in-house tenancy, the inability to properly define the incubation process or define it but fail to identify with whom the incubation process occurs {{and the use of}} the terms such as science parks, technology centers etc. interchangeably (Bergek & Norrman, 2008; Hackett and Dilts, 2004 a).|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{point out the}} {{importance}} of the infrastructural support offered by business <b>incubators</b> to stimulate high-tech entrepreneurship, like academic spin-offs (ASO).

The paper goals are to investigate the role played by the geographical proximity of business <b>incubators</b> and to analyze the characteristics of the socio-economic context that influence the development of ASO. Using a sample of 405 ASO and 162 <b>incubators</b> we show that the presence of <b>incubators</b> in the geographical area of ASO alone is not enough for them to reach better performance.

40|$|Given the {{increased}} importance of flexibility in company development models, {{it is not}} surprising that start-up support structures such as business <b>incubators</b> give more attention to flexible service offerings. In this paper, we argue that an <b>incubator’s</b> service customization strategy is ideal in situations with high incubatee need heterogeneity. Moreover, we examine how an <b>incubator’s</b> industry segmentation efforts are related to its customization strategy, and examine its subsequent impact on incubatee survival and growth. Based on an empirical study using data from 166 Brazilian <b>incubators,</b> we find that service customization is a significant mediator through which an <b>incubator’s</b> industry focus can influence incubatee survival and growth. Moreover, contrary to the common assumption that an industry focus automatically leads to a higher incubatee performance level, we fail to find any evidence for a significant direct relation between an <b>incubator’s</b> industry segmentation and incubatee survival and growth...|$|R
