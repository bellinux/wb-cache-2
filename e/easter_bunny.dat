25|$|The <b>Easter</b> <b>Bunny</b> is {{a popular}} legendary {{anthropomorphic}} Easter gift-giving character analogous to Santa Claus in American culture. Many Americans follow the tradition of coloring hard-boiled eggs and giving baskets of candy. On Easter Monday, the President of the United States holds an annual Easter egg roll on the White House lawn for young children. Since the rabbit is a pest in Australia, the Easter Bilby is available as an alternative. Easter eggs are a widely popular symbol of new life in Poland and other Slavic countries' folk traditions. A batik-like decorating process known as pisanka produces intricate, brilliantly-colored eggs.|$|E
25|$|Easter {{is linked}} to the Jewish Passover by much of its symbolism, as well as by its {{position}} in the calendar. In most European languages the feast called Easter in English is termed by the words for passover in those languages and in the older English versions of the Bible the term Easter was the term used to translate passover. Easter customs vary across the Christian world, and include sunrise services, exclaiming the Paschal greeting, clipping the church, and decorating Easter eggs (symbols of the empty tomb). The Easter lily, a symbol of the resurrection, traditionally decorates the chancel area of churches on this day {{and for the rest of}} Eastertide. Additional customs that have become associated with Easter and are observed by both Christians and some non-Christians include egg hunting, the <b>Easter</b> <b>Bunny,</b> and Easter parades. There are also various traditional Easter foods that vary regionally.|$|E
