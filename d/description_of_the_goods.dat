40|$|The {{issue of}} strict {{compliance}} of documents in LCs is a never ending story. It {{started with the}} narrow approach that the documents tendered by the seller should strictly comply with buyer's requirement under the LCs. Under this approach, the doctrine of strict compliance must be followed strictly {{to the extent that}} the documents must not contain any discrepancies, even minor typographical errors which do not really affect the underlying contract. Minor discrepancies such as wrongly spelt name of a beneficiary, incorrect <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> sold, wrong measurement of the quantity of the goods were considered as non-compliance which later served as sufficient grounds for the bank to reject the seller's presentation of documents. As pointed out by Lord Sumner in Equitable Trust v. Dawson Pcrtners,' 'There is no room for the documents which are almost the same or which will do just as well. ' This statement denotes that the documents should strictly comply with the terms of the credit and any documents which contain discrepancies should be rejected. Thus, compliance of documents ascertains the success of the LCs transaction. However today, the approach taken by judges seems to be much broader and is open to a more liberal interpretation. This paper discusses the issues of standard of compliance of documents required under the LCs transaction. It also examines whether the literal approach of strict compliance as highlighted by Lord Sumner is still favourable. In relation to this, discussion will be based on case law where the established legal principles from relevant decided cases will be explored. Focus also will be emphasized on other related issues to the compliance of the documents such as provisions under tne Uniform Custom and Practice for Documentary Credit 500...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} article, Standard-Form Contracting in the Electronic Age, 77 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 429 (2002), Jeffery Rachlinski and I {{analyzed}} whether contract law 2 ̆ 7 s {{approach to the}} problem of paper standard forms can effectively govern electronic forms. We thought the rational and cognitive reasons consumers fail to read their paper forms apply in the e-environment. Further, although e-consumers do not face manipulative sales agents or impatient customers waiting in line but, instead, largely contract at home in the evening without time constraints, e-consumers are impatient, even click happy, and therefore still do not read their forms or shop for the best terms. Relying on these assumptions about how consumers treat their e-standard forms and evidence concerning how e-businesses use the Internet, we concluded that Internet contracting is not fundamentally different from the paper world. Accordingly, major changes in the approach of contract law are not imperative. This paper tests our assumptions about consumer behavior when agreeing to e-standard forms by offering some empirical evidence of consumer practices. I report on a survey of 92 contracts students 2 ̆ 7 e-standard form practices. The survey inquired about all aspects of their practices, including frequency of contracting, the place and time of such contracting, whether they read their e-forms or shop for terms, the reasons for reading or failing to read, and the factors that would promote reading. Although the survey results reinforce our assumption that consumers generally do not read their e-standard forms, the truth is a bit more complicated. A large majority of respondents purchase at night and at home. Nevertheless, few respondents read their e-standard forms beyond price and <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> or services 2 ̆ 2 as a general matter. 2 ̆ 2 Further, beyond price and description, a large minority of respondents do not read their forms at all. However, {{more than a third of}} the respondents read their forms when the value of the contract is high and more than a third read when the vendor is unknown. Further, a small cadre of respondents read particular terms beyond price and description, primarily warranties and product information warnings. On the other hand, virtually no respondents read choice of law/forum or arbitration clauses. The survey also reveals that impatience accounts most often for the failure of respondents to read their forms. Not surprisingly, respondents rarely shop for advantageous terms, despite the greater availability of terms on the Internet. The paper concludes by analyzing possible legal responses to e-standard form contracting in light of the survey results...|$|E
40|$|When {{goods are}} sold internationally, {{it is common}} that the seller {{receives}} the purchase price against documents. In many cases, the buyer {{does not have a}} chance to examine the goods before the seller obtains payment. Therefore, the buyer must rely on the accuracy of the information contained in the documents. The objective of the thesis is to discuss the risks that are related to the purchase price being paid against the documents. Furthermore, the thesis analyses what additional roles documents play in the contract of sale and contracts supplementing it. The main focus is on the bill of lading, which is a sea transportation document issued by the carrier, because it enables, for example, the goods to be sold during transit. A documentary credit is a commonly used method of payment. In order for the seller to obtain the purchase price, the seller must deliver conforming documents to the bank. This creates a documentary risk, meaning that there is a risk that documents provided by the seller might not be in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. If this happens the bank must refuse payment. From the buyer’s perspective, there is a risk that the documents do not communicate accurately the status of the goods on loading. The <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> in the bill of lading is subject to the carrier’s obligation to check the quantity, quality, and condition of the goods. In practice, the carrier’s obligation to check is limited in particular when goods are containerised. Therefore, the information cannot be entirely reliable. Moreover, the carrier is not able to assess whether the goods are in accordance with the contract of sale because he is not an expert surveyor and not aware of the terms of the sale contract. According to the Finnish Maritime Code, the carrier is liable for inaccurate information in some situations which enhances the transferability of the document. The research illustrates that the system seeks to ensure that the documents are accurate. However, is not without gaps and thus, there is a risk that the seller obtains the payment even when the goods are not in accordance with the agreement between the seller and the buyer. Moreover, the system has not been constructed in a way which would easily detect the seller’s fraud. This is because the banks that examine the documents supplied by the seller adopt a formalistic approach which does not seek to assess the actual condition of the goods, rather {{it is based on the}} assumption that their description is sufficient. The bill of lading is also a tool needed in the delivery of the goods. Goods might arrive before the documents which certainly increases the likeliness of the carrier delivering the goods to the wrong party without complying with the rules on delivery as stipulated in the Finnish Maritime Code. The industry has developed arrangements to mitigate the risks related to delivery without a bill of lading which shows that the document is not able to meet the needs of today’s trade...|$|E

40|$|Concern {{exists that}} {{hypothetical}} {{willingness to pay}} questions overestimate real willingness to pay. In a field experiment, we compare two methods of removing hypothetical bias, a cheap talk approach and a certainty approach, with real purchases. We find evidence of hypothetical bias for unadulterated contingent valuation. Contingent valuation with certainty statements removes the hypothetical bias, but the cheap talk approach has no significant impact. Our findings suggest that willingness to pay can be accurately estimated by adding a simple follow-up question about <b>the</b> certainty <b>of</b> responses and that cheap talk is not a generally effective approach. Information about the willingness to pay for non-market goods is crucial for under-standing <b>the</b> welfare implications <b>of</b> different policies.

But it is also depicted as a realistic possibility. Though difficult to achieve, the main characters reach the goal through individual improvement towards correct behaviour. The question for the main characters is not whether they are going to marry or not, but how to make their marriages good ones. Other options than marriage are ignored or described as faulty. At the same time, alternatives and resistance to <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> marriage and <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> husband and wife are shown through distortions and discords. This can reveal <b>the</b> <b>good</b> marriage as a constructed ideal. Failure to conform to the expected roles and people standing outside the marital discourse, are ridiculed and described as deviant; but <b>the</b> mere existence <b>of</b> these failures makes the ideal seem less natural...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to explore how {{students}} construct narratives of themselves as information seekers in a school context where their <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> their information activities are assessed and graded. Design/methodology/approach – Blog posts on credibility judgements written by 28 students at a Swedish upper secondary school were analysed through a bottom-up coding process based in <b>the</b> sociocultural concept <b>of</b> narratives of selves. Findings – Two tensions in the students’ accounts are identified. The first tension is that between <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual, independent student and <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> group member. <b>The</b> second tension is between describing oneself as an independent information seeker {{and at the same time}} as someone who seeks information in ways that are sanctioned within the school setting. Research limitations/implications – The study focuses on a specific social practice and on situated activities, but also illustrates some aspects of information activities that pertain to educational contexts in general. It explores how social norms related to credibility judgements are expressed and negotiated in discursive interaction. Practical implications – The study highlights that when information activities become objects of assessment, careful consideration of what aspects are meant to be assessed is necessary. Originality/value – The study is based on <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> information activities as socially and discursively shaped, and it illustrates some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consequences when information activities become objects of teaching, learning, and grading...|$|R
