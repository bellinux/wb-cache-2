5000|$|While {{the media}} often portrays {{domestic}} <b>dogs</b> <b>chewing</b> bones, this is slightly misleading. <b>Dogs</b> <b>chew</b> bones only to eat any residual meat and bone marrow left on them, {{so it is}} not truly a form of osteophagy. Most modern toy [...] "bones" [...] for dogs are actually rawhide, which is simply dried animal skin, as animal bones are actually dangerous for <b>dogs</b> to <b>chew.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Rawhide {{is made by}} {{scraping}} the skin thin, soaking it in lime, and then stretching it while it dries. Like alum-tanning, rawhide is not technically [...] "leather", but is usually lumped in with the other forms. Rawhide is stiffer and more brittle than other forms of leather; it is primarily found in uses such as drum heads and parchment where it {{does not need to}} flex significantly; it is also cut up into cords for use in lacing or stitching and for making many varieties of <b>dog</b> <b>chews.</b>|$|E
50|$|Preventative {{action is}} {{required}} to prevent the continuous accumulation of plaque, tartar, and calculus, and to reduce the long term risk of dental diseases. Although a dental diet is formulated to reduce plaque and/or tartar and {{plays an important role}} in oral care and hygiene, it is not the only method that can be used to care for a dog’s teeth. Daily dental <b>dog</b> <b>chews</b> and teeth brushing will scrape away plaque before it forms into tartar. Regular dental check-ups by a veterinarian will assess the health of the mouth and jaw, and advise whether dental cleanings are required. These are all necessary and crucial steps to maintain oral health, and contribute to the overall health of a dog.|$|E
5000|$|Independent Satie scholar Ornella Volta {{believed}} the composer {{was inspired to}} dedicate {{a piece of music}} to a canine by one of his favorite books, Gargantua and Pantagruel by François Rabelais. In the preface to Gargantua, Rabelais paraphrased the ancient philosopher Socrates to urge readers to look beyond the [...] "curious" [...] titles of written works and explore their contents, just as a <b>dog</b> <b>chews</b> an unappetizing-looking bone to extract the marrow. The idea stayed with Satie long after he had completed his sets of preludes pour un chien. He would later tell author Jean Cocteau, [...] "I want to write a play for dogs, and I already have my set design: the curtain rises on a bone." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Four pet chew treats {{from four}} {{different}} manufacturers were tested for digestibility using in vitro tests in artificial gastric (stomach) and intestinal juices. In vitro tests {{were selected to}} determine the digestibility of <b>dog</b> <b>chews</b> for humane reasons and were conducted under conditions that were designed to simulate the digestive system of dogs. The purpose of the tests was to rapidly and inexpensively determines the rate of degradation of a dog chew in the canine digestive tract to assess product safety for dogs. Dog chew pet treats that are swallowed whole, or in part, should degrade rapidly in the canine digestive system to prevent potentially dangerous blockage. Tests were conducted on one cm and one-half cm cubes of dog chew products. Results of the tests clearly indicated that one product outperformed all others in short-term (under 4 hrs) digestive tests. The Bone-A-Mint Wheat Free formula degraded more rapidly than all other products in tests simulating canine gastric and intestinal juices. Tests conducted in this study will {{form the basis of}} an in vitro procedure that can be used as an industry standard to asses the safety of pet chew treats...|$|E

25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the <b>dog</b> <b>chewed</b> on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or she stared at me. Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|R

50|$|Elephant shrews mainly eat insects, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and earthworms. An {{elephant}} shrew {{uses its}} nose to find prey and uses its tongue to flick small food into its mouth, {{much like an}} anteater. Eating large prey can pose a challenge; an elephant shrew struggling with an earthworm must first pin its prey {{to the ground with}} a forefoot. Then, turning its head to one side, it chews pieces off with its cheek teeth, much like a <b>dog</b> <b>chewing</b> a bone. This is a sloppy process, and many small pieces of worm drop to the ground; these are simply flicked up with the tongue. Some elephant shrews also feed on small amounts of plant matter, especially new leaves, seeds, and small fruits.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: We have {{reported}} earlier that administration of a treat containing a special cellulose preparation (Arbocel BWW 40 ®), {{instead of a}} control treat without cellulose, diminishes the clinical signs of periodontal disease in dogs. Based on the physical characteristics of the cellulose preparation, we hypothesized that treats with cellulose have greater elasticity and induce longer chewing time, leading to more mechanical dental cleansing. Approach: Treats without or with cellulose were subjected to bending and pulling tests in which the threshold before fragmentation, expressed as required force, was determined. The treats were also used in an experiment with <b>dogs</b> to determine <b>chewing</b> times. Results: The addition of cellulose to the treats raised the forced needed for bending and pulling until fragmentation by 12 and 99 %. The inclusion of cellulose into the treats raised <b>chewing</b> by <b>dogs</b> of medium-sized and large breeds by 16 and 11 %. However, in small-breed <b>dogs</b> <b>chewing</b> time was not affected by cellulose. Conclusion: The inclusion of the cellulose preparation into the treats induces a resistant and elastic texture which promotes chewing. It is suggested that the cellulose-containing treats maintain contact with the tooth surface which provides effective mechanical cleansing, explaining the observed improvement of periodontal disease in dogs...|$|R

50|$|Series 2 is set {{three months}} after the series 1 finale. Jana arrives in Stoneybridge, {{claiming}} to have been exiled from the wild wolfblood pack. Despite occasional conflicts with Maddy, she befriends Maddy, Rhydian, Tom and Shannon and falls in love with the human world. Eventually she leaves to become the new wild wolfblood pack leader, her father having been exiled. It is discovered that Shannon is spying on the Smiths and collecting information on werewolves. When Maddy is almost killed as a result, she decides to destroy all of the data she has gathered. Liam, a boy at their school, then also begins investigating werewolves. Suspicious of the Smith family, he steals a <b>dog</b> <b>chew</b> from which Dr. Whitewood is able to extract and analyse a sample of the DNA of Maddy's father.

5000|$|The {{excuse for}} the brevity of the {{document}} did not become the punchline for another 18 years. The first use of the phrase recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1929, in an essay in the British newspaper The Guardian: [...] "It {{is a long time}} since I have had the excuse about the dog tearing up the arithmetic homework." [...] This suggests it had been in use among students for some time prior to that.It was first reported in an American context in 1965. Bel Kaufman's bestselling comic novel, Up the Down Staircase, published that year, includes two instances where the protagonist's students blame their failure to complete their assignment on their dogs. In a section written as drama early in the book, one student refers to [...] "a terrible tragedy ... My dog went on my homework!" [...] Later, a list of excuses includes [...] "My <b>dog</b> <b>chewed</b> it up" [...] and [...] "the cat chewed it up and {{there was no time to}} do it over." ...|$|R
5000|$|Veterinarians usually attempt {{diagnosis}} {{with skin}} scrapings from multiple areas, {{which are then}} examined under a microscope for mites. Sarcoptes mites, because they may be present in relatively low numbers, {{and because they are}} often removed by <b>dogs</b> <b>chewing</b> at themselves, may be difficult to demonstrate. As a result, diagnosis in sarcoptic mange is often based on symptoms rather than actual confirmation of the presence of mites. A common and simple way of determining if a dog has mange is if it displays what is called a [...] "pedal-pinna reflex", which is when the dog moves one of its hind legs in a scratching motion as the ear is being manipulated and scratched gently by the examiner; because the mites proliferate on the ear margins in nearly all cases at some point, this method works over 95% of the time. It is helpful in cases where all symptoms of mange are present but no mites are observed with a microscope. The test is also positive in animals with ear mites, an ear canal infection caused by a different but closely related mite (treatment is often the same). In some countries, an available serologic test may be useful in diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|Much {{like food}} allergies, the dog will develop redness to the skin, become itchy, and may begin chewing in spots.
