25|$|Web {{designer}} Doug Bowman {{has said}} that the original <b>Internet</b> Explorer <b>box</b> model represents a better, more logical approach. Peter-Paul Koch gives the example of a physical box, whose dimensions always refer to the box itself, including potential padding, but never its content. He says that this box model is more useful for graphic designers, who create designs based on the visible width of boxes rather than the width of their content. Bernie Zimmermann says that the <b>Internet</b> Explorer <b>box</b> model is closer to the definition of cell dimensions and padding used in the HTML table model.|$|R

25|$|At the time, {{very few}} browser vendors {{implemented}} the W3C box {{model to the}} letter.

50|$|While the W3C {{recommendations}} {{specify the}} box model {{in a clear}} and unambiguous way, some older browsers do not apply it correctly. Therefore, they may not display the box dimensions of a web page correctly.

5000|$|One {{prominent}} {{difference between}} quirks and standards modes is {{the handling of}} the CSS <b>Internet</b> Explorer <b>box</b> model bug. Before version 6, Internet Explorer used an algorithm for determining the width of an element's box which conflicted with the algorithm detailed in the CSS specification, and due to Internet Explorer's popularity many pages were created which relied upon this non-standard algorithm. As of version 6, Internet Explorer uses the CSS specification's algorithm when rendering in standards mode and uses the previous, non-standard algorithm when rendering in quirks mode.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>Internet</b> Explorer <b>box</b> model bug {{refers to}} the way in which earlier {{versions}} of Internet Explorer handle the box model or sizing of elements in a web page, which differs from the standard way recommended by the W3C for the Cascading Style Sheets language. As of Internet Explorer 6, the browser supports an alternative rendering mode (called the [...] "standards-compliant mode") which solves this discrepancy. However, for backward compatibility reasons, all versions still behave in the usual, non-standard way by default (see quirks mode). Internet Explorer for Mac is not affected by this non-standard behavior.|$|R
