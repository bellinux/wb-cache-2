5000|$|The British Standard Fine (BSF) {{standard}} has {{the same}} thread angle as the BSW, but has a <b>finer</b> <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> and smaller <b>thread</b> depth. This is more like the modern [...] "mechanical" [...] screw and was used for fine machinery and for steel bolts.|$|R
50|$|The British Standard Cycle (BSC) {{standard}} which {{replaced the}} Cycle Engineers' Institute (CEI) standard was used on British bicycles and motorcycles. It uses a thread angle of 60° {{compared to the}} Whitworth 55° and very <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> <b>pitches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Löwenherz thread {{was used}} {{extensively}} in measuring instruments (like micrometers, which achieve greater precision with <b>finer</b> <b>thread</b> <b>pitches)</b> and in shell manufacturing. It was also popular choice {{for use in}} optical instruments, especially in Germany. In addition to seeing its use in instruments designed in Germany, Austria and France, the Löwenhetz thread was once adopted by the Bureau of Standards in the United States {{as a solution to}} the lack of uniformity in the type of screws used in American-made instruments.|$|R

50|$|Screw jacks {{are limited}} in their lifting capacity. Increasing load {{increases}} friction within the screw threads. A <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>thread,</b> which would increase {{the advantage of the}} screw, also reduces the size and strength of the threads. Longer operating levers soon reach a point where the lever will simply bend at their inner end.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and fine threads, {{there is another}} division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>thread.</b> Superfine pitch metric threads are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|William Sellers {{originally}} developed the USS thread, and set forth {{many of its}} details in his paper, [...] "A System of Screw Threads and Nuts", presented in April 1864 to the Franklin Institute. In 1898, the standard for metric threaded fasteners was established. The metric standard used the same thread geometry as the USS standard but differed in that the dimensions and pitch were based on metric units. In 1906, the A.L.A.M developed {{what would be the}} SAE thread standard for threaded fasteners based on the USS standard but with a <b>finer</b> <b>thread</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like {{cylinder}} records, {{the sound}} in a Diamond Disc's groove was {{recorded by the}} [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] method, as variations in {{the depth of the}} groove cut. At that time, with the notable exception of Pathé Records, which used yet another incompatible format, a disc's groove was normally of constant depth and modulated laterally, side-to-side. The vertical format demanded a perfectly flat surface for best results, so Edison made his Diamond Discs about one-quarter of an inch (6 mm) thick. They consisted of a thin coating of a hard plastic virtually identical to Bakelite on a core of compressed wood flour, and later also china clay. With very rare exceptions, all were about ten inches in diameter, but they used a <b>finer</b> groove <b>pitch</b> (150 <b>threads</b> per inch, or [...] "TPI") and could play longer than ordinary ten-inch records—up to five minutes per side.|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Interest in {{wireless}} body area networks (WBAN) {{operating in the}} millimetre-wave regime (60 GHz) is increasing due to concerns over the security of data transfer. Obtaining <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> in this frequency regime is essential, as the design dimensions scale inversely with wavelength. In the area of wearable electronics, printing onto fabrics is challenging, due to the porosity of the material. Some researchers have considered screen printing for realising interconnects onto fabrics. In this paper, inkjet printing is investigated for <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> printing on a nonwoven fabric targeted for high frequency applications...|$|R

40|$|Stencil {{printing}} for SMT and <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> BGA structures {{is established}} as a low cost standard process. Using the same equipment with modified printing parameters and materials, a low cost bumping process has been transferred to serial production. This paper {{presents the results of}} ultra <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> stencil printing of solder paste on wafers (down to 200 mu m and 150 mu m pitch) with regard to quality and yield. A software tool for design of the stencil layout was developed and the predicted bump heights were compared to the experimental results. In {{the first part of the}} paper, a low cost bumping method for flip chip technology is described in detail. This technology is based on chemical Ni/Au deposition on wafers. For solder bumping on wafers, the key aspects of solder paste printing with optimized printable apertures are described and the printing results are presented. The second part of this paper is a comparison of measured standard deviations of bump heights and the quality demands for ultra <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> flip chip assembly...|$|R

The rearward bending of the blades and the <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> of the blade angle indicate propeller rotation {{at the time of}} impact, with low or no power. It was learnt that the engine had problems of cutting off at idling speed on several occasions in the past.

50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger <b>pitch</b> (fewer <b>threads</b> per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller <b>pitch</b> (more <b>threads</b> per axial distance).

In this paper, <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> flip chip (FPFC) interconnection technology (i. e., less than 60 um pitch) will be described. Two types of 50 um pitch bump (Au stud & Cu pillar) will be evaluated and two different flip-chip (FC) bonding methods will be studied. Package structures of bare die flip-chip CSP (chip scale package) and also over molded version will be studied for reliability performance and volume assembly fit. For characterization, structure analysis will be performed at each reliability read point. Finally this paper will conclude by identifying the most robust bonding method for the FPFC devices...|$|R
40|$|Ball Grid Array (BGA) {{component}} packages {{challenge the}} circuit board design with signal routing and layout, creating {{in some cases}} extra board layers and added vias all resulting in increased costs for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB).

This paper will present and profile a cost-effective solution to interconnecting BGAs on PCB's using laser drilled blind vias connecting the outer three or more layers of a multilayer circuit board.
