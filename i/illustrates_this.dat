5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should have {{produced}} a rapid breakthrough but concedes that the battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops, losses they could ill-afford. He <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E
5|$|In the Padma Purana, {{the curse}} of the sages fails. In retribution, Shiva casts a curse on the sages so that they, like Bhikshatana, will become beggars with matted hair and be devoid of knowledge. Those who would still worship him would gain knowledge, wealth, and progeny, and be reborn into good families. In the Skanda Purana, the sages of the Deodar Forest are {{performing}} rituals and start {{to think of themselves as}} gods. To humble these arrogant sages, Shiva takes the form of Bhikshatana—an attractive young beggar—and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, the women wildly chase Shiva. When the sages regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger), and a dwarf, all of which attack Shiva, who overpowers them. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the Cosmic Dancer. The same legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some differences. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja. The ceiling of the Shivakamasundari shrine in the Nataraja temple complex <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> legend in a series of frescos, where Bhikshatana is depicted as a white naked mendicant accompanied by a scantily-scad Mohini.|$|E

5|$|Though {{it was not}} {{the reason}} they were built, castles could often be used as prisons. One such {{instance}} from the 14thcentury <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> aspect of Château de Chinon's history. Founded in the Holy Land as a crusading military order in the early 12thcentury, the Knights Templar had, by the close of the 13thcentury, gained swathes of lands in Europe, particularly France. King PhilipIV of France had the members of the order in his kingdom arrested, accusing them of heretical practices. The leaders of the order, including the Grand Master Jacques de Molay, were imprisoned at Château de Chinon, in the Tour du Coudray built by PhilipII one century earlier. Graffiti carved by the imprisoned knights can be seen {{on the walls of the}} tower. In August 1308, Pope Clement V sent three cardinals to hear the leaders' confessions. The outcome was that in 1312 the pope issued a bull, the Vox in excelso, suppressing the order and its property was given to the Knights Hospitaller. The leaders were sentenced to life imprisonment, apart from Jacques de Molay and Geoffrey de Charney who were burnt at the stake.|$|E

25|$|Friedman's {{assessment}} of autobiography {{with regard to}} women and minority groups explains Kingston's intricate blend of perspective and genre: women and cultural minorities often don't have the privilege of viewing themselves as individuals isolated from their gender or racial group. Kingston <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> condition through her use of Chinese talk-story, her mother's traditional Chinese perspective, and her own first-person view as a Chinese American.|$|E

25|$|Tom Brass {{argues that}} unfree labour {{is not an}} archaic {{holdover}} in today's world, but an active process of deproletarianization of agricultural workers to provide rural agrarian capitalists with cheaper labour. In the constant drive to cheapen the cost of agricultural labour, debt bondage is used to tie workers to specific employers, lower their wages, and extract further unpaid labour from them. He <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> process at work in Peru and India.|$|E
25|$|Horses in the Bronze Age were {{relatively}} small by modern standards, which led some theorists {{to believe the}} ancient horses were {{too small to be}} ridden and so must have been driven. Herodotus' description of the Sigynnae, a steppe people who bred horses too small to ride but extremely efficient at drawing chariots, <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> stage. However, as horses remained generally smaller than modern equines well into the Middle Ages, this theory is highly questionable.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, fasting {{among the}} Jews was resorted to {{in times of}} great distress. The Book of Esther, of late date, <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> for the period {{included}} in the Biblical canon. Rabbinical sources prove the growing tendency to abstain from drink and food whenever memories of disaster marked {{the days of the}} synagogal calendar, or instant danger threatened the community. In the scheme of the synagogue the one fast-day of the Bible received no less than twenty-two as companions (compare Fasting in Judaism).|$|E

25|$|In Travnik, he {{established}} a Divan, a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up the Bosnian government. Gradaščević also collected taxes at this time, and executed various local opponents of the autonomy movement. He gained {{a reputation as a}} hero and a strong, brave, and decisive ruler. One anecdote that <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether he was scared of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. God I fear slightly, Gradaščević replied, the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more than my own horse.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{computational}} experiment <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> idea. Two {{instances of}} a classifier {{were trained to}} distinguish images of planes from those of cars. For training and testing of the first instance, images with arbitrary viewpoints were used. Another instance received only images seen from a particular viewpoint, which was equivalent to training and testing the system on invariant representation of the images. One {{can see that the}} second classifier performed quite well even after receiving a single example from each category, while performance of the first classifier was close to random guess even after seeing 20 examples.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Age of Bulgarian culture under Simeon I exerted {{considerable}} {{influence on}} the empire's transdanubian possessions. Old Bulgarian was established as the language of liturgy and written communication along with the Cyrillic script created in Bulgaria, which {{was used for the}} Romanian language until the 1860s; the first written text in the Romanian language, Neacşu's letter of 1512, <b>illustrates</b> <b>this</b> trend: it was written in Cyrillic, intermixed with Bulgarian sentences and phrases. To this day, a notable part of Romanian's core vocabulary is of Latinized South Slavic origin, although much of it was replaced by Romance and Classical Latin loanwords in the 19th century.|$|E
