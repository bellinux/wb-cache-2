40|$|The land surface {{provides}} a boundary condition to atmospheric forward and flux inversion models. These models require prior estimates of CO 2 fluxes at relatively high temporal resolutions (e. g., 3 -hourly) {{because of the}} high frequency of atmospheric mixing and wind heterogeneity. However, land surface model CO 2 fluxes are often provided at monthly time steps, typically because the land surface modeling community focuses more on time steps associated with plant phenology (e. g., seasonal) than on sub-daily phenomena. Here, we describe a new dataset created from 15 global land surface models and 4 ensemble products in the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), temporally downscaled from monthly to 3 -hourly output. We provide 3 -hourly output for each individual model over 7  years (2004 – 2010), as well as an ensemble mean, a weighted ensemble mean, and the multi-model standard <b>deviation.</b> <b>Output</b> is provided in three different spatial resolutions for user preferences: 0. 5 ° [*]×[*]  0. 5 °, 2. 0 ° [*]×[*]  2. 5 °, and 4. 0 ° [*]×[*]  5. 0 ° (latitude [*]×[*] longitude).

40|$|The {{simplest}} macroeconomic {{models in}} which markets clear instantaneously, and expectations are rational preclude {{the existence of}} "business cycles," that is, of serially correlated <b>deviations</b> of <b>output</b> from trend. This paper studies one of several mechanisms {{that can be used}} to make these so-called "new-classical" models produce business cycles; the mechanism is the gradual adjustment of inventory stocks. Two microeconomic models of inventory holdings are formulated. Both imply, first, that current output should be a decreasing function of the stock of inventories and, second, that inventories, once perturbed from equilibrium levels, should adjust only gradually. These two features are then embedded into an otherwise standard macroeconomic model in which markets clear instantaneously and expectations are rational. Two principal conclusions are reached. First, disturbances such as unanticipated changes in money will set in motion serially correlated <b>deviations</b> of <b>output</b> from trend. Second, if desired inventories are sensitive to the real interest rate, then even fully anticipated changes in money can affect real variables. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Testing using n-detection test sets, {{in which}} a fault is {{detected}} by n (n> 1) input patterns, is being increasingly advocated to increase defect coverage. However, the data volume for an n-detection test set is often too large, resulting in high testing time and tester memory requirements. Test set selection is necessary {{to ensure that the}} most effective patterns are chosen from large test sets in a high-volume production testing environment. Test selection is also useful in a timeconstrained wafer-sort environment. We use a probabilistic fault model and the theory of <b>output</b> <b>deviations</b> for test set selection—the metric of <b>output</b> <b>deviation</b> is used to rank candidate test patterns without resorting to fault grading. To demonstrate the quality of the selected patterns, we present experimental results for resistive bridging faults and nonfeedback zero-resistance bridging faults in the ISCAS benchmark circuits. Our results show that for the same test length, patterns {{selected on the basis of}} <b>output</b> <b>deviations</b> are more effective than patterns selected using several other methods. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} {{the development of}} an academic literature that tries to characterize and quantify monetary policy choices by central bankers or, in more technical language, to formulate and estimate the reaction function of policymakers. Following a long economic tradition such reaction functions are conceptualized as arising from an attempt by policymakers to maximize their objectives subject to a given economic structure. An early, well known illustration of this approach is the Kydland and Prescott (1977), Barro and Gordon (1983) (KPBG in the sequel) example in which policymakers possess target levels of output and of inflation and, in which, any <b>deviation</b> of <b>output</b> and of inflation from those targets is costly for them.

40|$|Abstract—Functional test {{sequences}} {{are often}} used in manufacturing testing to target defects that are not detected by structural test. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the quality of functional test sequences. However, it is very time-consuming to evaluate the quality of functional test sequences by gate-level fault simulation. Therefore, we propose <b>output</b> <b>deviations</b> as a metric to grade functional test sequences at the register transfer (RT) level without explicit fault simulation. Experimental results for the open-source Parwan processor and the Scheduler module of the Illinois Verilog Model (IVM) show that the deviations metric is computationally efficient and it correlates well with gate-level coverage for stuck-at, transition-delay, and bridging faults. Results also show that functional test sequences that are reordered based on <b>output</b> <b>deviations</b> provide steeper gate-level fault coverage ramp-up compared to other ordering methods.

A seed can be computed for each test cube by solving a system of linear equations based on the feedback polynomial of the LFSR. Despite the availability of numerous LFSR-reseeding-based compression methods in the literature, relatively {{little is known about}} the effectiveness of these seeds for unmodeled defects, particularly since there are often several candidate seeds for a test cube. We use the recently proposed <b>output</b> <b>deviation</b> measure of the resulting patterns as a metric to select appropriate LFSR seeds. Experimental results are reported using test patterns for stuck-at and transition faults derived from selected seeds for the ISCAS- 89 and the IWLS- 05 benchmark circuits. These patterns achieve higher coverage for transition and stuck-open faults than patterns obtained using other seed-generation methods for LFSR reseeding. Given a pattern pair (p 1,p 2) for transition faults, we also examine the transition-fault coverage for launch on capture by using p 1 and p 2 to separately compute <b>output</b> <b>deviations.</b> Results show that p 1 tends to be better when there is a high proportion of do-not-care bits in the test cubes, while p 2 is a more appropriate choice when the transition-fault coverage is high.
