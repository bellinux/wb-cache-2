5|$|The five largest ancestry {{groups in}} South Dakota are: German (40.7%), Norwegian (15.3%), Irish (10.4%), Native American (8.3%), and English (7.1%). German-Americans {{are the largest}} ancestry group <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, {{although}} there are also large Scandinavian populations in some counties. American Indians, largely Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux) are predominant in several counties, mostly {{in the western part}} of the state. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 2,000 species of antlion found <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, with the {{greatest}} diversity being in warmer areas. The best known species are those in which the larvae dig pits to trap their prey, {{but by no means}} do all species do this. Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including open woodland floors, scrub-clad dunes, hedge bases, river banks, road verges, under raised buildings and in vacant lots.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E

5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Originally, people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Sugarcane {{was a native of}} tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea. One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in Chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century BC that state that the use of sugarcane originated in India.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the barn}} owl has been much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet have been made <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and {{a great variety of}} other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms {{do not seem to be}} consumed.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} Pennsylvania arrived from Asia between 12000BCE and 8000BCE, when the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age were receding. Fluted point spearheads from this era, {{known as the}} Paleo-Indian Period, have been found <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. Archeological discoveries at the Memorial Park Site 36Cn164 near {{the confluence of the}} West Branch Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek collectively span about 8,000years and represent every major prehistoric period from the Middle Archaic to the Late Woodland period. Prehistoric cultural periods over that span included the Middle Archaic starting at 6500 BCE; the Late Archaic starting at 3000 BCE; the Early Woodland starting at 1000 BCE; the Middle Woodland starting at 0 CE; and the Late Woodland starting at 900 CE. First contact with Europeans occurred in Pennsylvania between 1500 and 1600 CE.|$|E

5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. In Britain, {{there has been}} a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In {{many parts of the world}} {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E
