Tuleu timpuriu and Reine Claude d'Althan distinguish for their high productivity (over 20 kg of fruits per tree), Valor for the large fruits (with the average of 68. 0 g, but with a lower quality), Vinete romanesti and Vinete de Italia for their extreme susceptibility to the most important diseases (Polystigma rubrum and Plum-pox virus). One of the traditional plum cultivars from Romania, still largely spread in Transylvania, Vinete romanesti, which is very appreciated, both for its fruit taste and for the alcohol distillation obtained, confirmed its estimation due to fruit quality. Vinete romanesti has small fruits compared to the actual commercial requirement of the <b>fresh</b> <b>plum,</b> low productivity, and it is extremely susceptible to Plum-pox virus and Polystigma rubrum attack, thus the cultivar unfulfills {{the conditions}} for modern cultivars.

Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking result was that drying at 85 °C doubled antioxidant activity in both cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 °C processed plums...|$|E

40|$|Prune is an {{important}} product in the dried fruit industry. The production of prunes involves drying of high-moisture <b>fresh</b> <b>plums.</b> Drying is an energy intensive food processing operation, which {{plays a significant role}} {{on the quality of the}} product. Increased competition in today 2 ̆ 7 s global market means that avenues to improve the process efficiency and product quality are desirable. In order to do this it is important to understand the physical and chemical changes occurring during drying. Comprehensive physico-chemical investigations of the drying process of plums were conducted. This would help to establish a scientific basis for suggesting improvements to the commercial dehydration of plums with a view of maintaining or enhancing the quality of the dried product. A computer-based laboratory drier was designed and built to study the kinetics of drying plums under controlled conditions. The effects of the process parameters (i. e., temperature, relative humidity and velocity) on the kinetics of moisture loss were studied to ascertain the major factors controlling the rate of drying plums. Results of the study showed a remarkable influence of the process parameters demonstrating the need for better control of the conditions of the drying air. These together with the ancillary experiments revealed that there may be different rate-controlling mechanisms involved during drying implicating {{an important}} role of the skin layer to moisture transfer. Notable differences between the drying curves of plums dried without skin and those with skin intact corroborated the importance of the skin layer to the drying process. Modelling the drying process has also provided more insight into the mechanisms of mass transfer during drying under different conditions. The proposed models predicted well the drying curves and could serve as descriptive tools in predicting the drying process of plums. This is important for the optimisation process. In addition, the study of using chemical pretreatment based on fatty acid esters further disclosed the significant effects of the skin layer to moisture loss during drying. It showed that dipping pretreatment can be employed to enhance the drying process of plums depending upon the composition of the drying emulsions and the drying conditions. The approach of monitoring the kinetics of changes in the carbohydrate constituents of plums using HPLC has shown dramatic alterations in the amounts of the major carbohydrates present in plums (i. e., fructose, sorbitol, glucose and sucrose) during drying and storage. It unveiled the major carbohydrate degradations occurring during drying including the hydrolysis of sucrose, Maillard reactions and caramelisation. Drying conditions and the pH of the fruit were found to affect the rate and onset of these reactions. The study shows the usefulness of the approach in detecting the progress of the chemical degradation reactions and further manifests the importance of controlling the conditions during drying of plums. It is known that the decomposition of carbohydrates would lead to the generation of wide spectrum of volatile flavours depending upon the type of reaction. A solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique in conjunction with GC-MS was used to characterise and follow the changes of volatile flavours during drying of plums. The study of aroma profiling showed significant changes to the volatile constituents of plums during drying identifying relevant routes leading to the formation of the volatile flavours associated with the carbohydrate degradations. The result demonstrates the importance of aroma profiling in diagnosing further the progress of the chemical degradation reactions, which has important implications for the control of the quality of the product. The impetus of controlling the drying process manifests the need for better knowledge of the conditions in which the fruits are experiencing during commercial dehydration. This information is also important for simulating the commercial drying conditions in laboratory studies. In this respect, a computer-based data acquisition system was developed to monitor the conditions during commercial dehydration of prunes. The monitoring work was found to be useful in identifying anomalies in drying conditions in the tunnel exemplifying the utility of the device in assessing the performance of the tunnel...|$|E

Optimum fruit maturity of plum varieties can be achieved by the fruit colour and firmness. For this reason we have studied seven new Romanian plum varieties (‘Alina’, ‘Carpatin’, ‘Roman’, ‘Pitestean’, ‘Sarmatic’, ‘Tita’ and ‘Tuleu timpuriu’), cultivated in field trial of the Genetics and Breeding laboratory in Research Institute for Fruit Growing Pitesti. Fruit skin color was measured by Konica Minolta chromameter model CR 400 based on the Hunter L, a, b-system. Fruit firmness was measured with non-destructive penetrometer Qualitest HPE equipped with a plunger of diameter 0. 10 cm 2. In addition to these two criteria were also measured others, such as: fruit size, fruit color and fruit soluble solids content. For statistical analyses DUNCAN test was used. Fruit colour ranged from red (Roman) to dark blue (Piteștean). According to the colour chart CTIFL, plum varieties were classified as group 4 - light blue (‘Alina’, ‘Carpatin’, ‘Roman’, ‘Tuleu timpuriu’) 5 - blue (‘Sarmatic’ and ‘Tita’) and 6 - dark blue (‘Piteștean’). After firmness, varieties were grouped into two groups: group 2 - beginning of maturation (‘Carpatin’, ‘Roman’, ‘Sarmatic’, ‘Tita’, ‘Tuleu timpuriu’) and group 3 - optimal harvest time (‘Alina’ and ‘Piteștean’). Regarding the other criteria, like fruit weight and soluble solids content, {{it can be said that}} all studied varieties are suitable for fresh consumptio...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. House mite, Glycyphagus domesticus (De Geer) {{belongs to}} synanthropic species and pests infesting various stored {{products}} including fruits (e. g. <b>fresh</b> apples, dried <b>plums),</b> bee products and other food-stuffs. Biological investigations {{of this species}} were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions (+ 20 °C, 85 % RH) using bee-bread as mite food. Some {{of the most important}} results obtained are as follows: complete development – 24. 4 days, eclosion of imagines – 74. 5 %, longevity of adults – 55. 7 days, oviposition period – 36. 9 days, fecundity – 190. 4 eggs per female life-span. These data give evidence that the biological potential of G. domesticus is relatively high and bee-bread seems to be an attractive and effective medium ensuring its complete development and favourable population increase. House mites (all stages) often occur on decaying and mouldy products and feed on mycelia of fungi infesting them. In this connection they may play an important part in transmission of diseases and spreading of pathogenic and saprophagous microorganisms causing damage and putrefaction of infested fruits and other food products...|$|R
