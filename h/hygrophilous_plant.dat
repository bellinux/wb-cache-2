40|$|International audienceOenanthe aquatica (Apiaceae) and Lycopus europaeus (Lamiaceae) are two <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plant</b> species {{found in}} remnant wetland {{habitats}} in agricultural areas. O. aquatica is declining and protected and L. europaeus more common, while still restricted to remnant wet habitats. To gain insights into their population genetic structure, we developed and characterized 16 (O. aquatica) and 15 (L. europaeus) novel polymorphic microsatellite markers from next-generation sequencing. The number of alleles ranged from 1 to 14 for O. aquatica, and from 1 to 9 for L. europaeus. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0. 156 to 0. 903 and from 0. 333 to 0. 749, {{with a mean}} multilocus FIS estimate of 0. 043 and 0. 092 for O. aquatica and L. europaeus, respectively. Overall, these newly developed microsatellite markers showed high levels of polymorphism that will facilitate fine-scaled population genetic studies...|$|E
40|$|Palynological and {{geological}} studies {{carried out}} at Gobero allowed to reconstruct the main palaeoenvironmental and climatic changes {{that occurred in the}} early and middle Holocene. The geological data of the area surrounding the perilacustrine ar- chaeological sites showed that four aeolian (arid) sedimentary units (from the earliest to the latest aeolian unit, a. u. 2, 3, 4 and 5) alternated with four lacustrine (wet) sedimentary units (lacustrine units, l. u. 3, 4, 5 and 6). The earliest Holocene lacustrine unit, l. u. 3, dated 10, 000 – 8160 cal BP, represents the time when the Gobero lake reached its maximum expansion and depth. The pollen data showed a complex environmental scenario including xerophilous and <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plant</b> associations. The floristic changes and the lacustrine units in the Gobero basin match the general wet and dry climate oscillations. The early Holocene humid phase was interrupted by a dry spell ca 8200 BP. Then, a major dry phase, which was also evident in many other lake records, took place at, or just after, 6000 BP with a shift towards more permanent aridity. Nevertheless, the persistence of well-developed wet environments, even in the most recent l. u. 6 (ca 3800 cal BP), suggested that a grassland-type of vegetation continued to develop during late Holocene wet oscillations, following the increase of a lacustrine level...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{determination}} of the impact of phosphogypsum waste heap in Wiślinka (northern Poland) for radiological protection of zone around waste heap. The activity of 210 Po, 234 U, and 238 U were measured using an alpha spectrometer. The values of uranium and polonium concentration in water with immediate area of waste heap are considerably higher than in the waters of the Martwa Wisła river. The values of activity ratio 234 U/ 238 U are approximately about one in the phosphogypsum (0. 97 ± 0. 05) and in the water of retention reservoir and pumping station (0. 92 ± 0. 01 and 0. 99 ± 0. 08), while in the water from the Martwa Wisła river they are slightly higher than one (1. 03 ± 0. 07 and 1. 17 ± 0. 06). In the analyzed plants species the highest amounts of polonium and uranium were found in ruderal plants samples as well as <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plant</b> samples. The more amounts of 210 Po and 238 U radionuclides were accumulated mainly in the roots of the analyzed plant species. The significant source of polonium and uranium in the natural environment is dry and wet atmospheric fallout in the immediate vicinity of phosphogypsum waste heap and the transfer via root for distant areas. The general conclusion of realized study is higher influence of phosphogypsum on radioactive contamination of environmental zone around heap waste in Wiślinka (northern Poland) ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{contains}} anatomical characteristics of vegetative organs of rare, endemic, {{and endangered species}} Taraxacum kok-saghyz, studied in three populations. The {{study found that the}} vegetative organs of plants are characterized by different degrees of development of certain tissues, depending on the place where they grow. The most favorable conditions for plant growth were in the place of population № 3, which was characterized by dark brown mountain soil type, with the layer of black soil (chernozem). It is known that the best soils for the cook-sagyz are strong, regular and leached chernozems – this had main influence on characteristics of growth of plants from population № 3. Since cooksaghyz is <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plants,</b> the distinctive features of the internal structure of these plants also were affected by water conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The Račna Karst Field {{has several}} habitats, {{some of which}} are {{significant}} at the European level. The land is predominantly grassland, with patches of woods and brush here and there. Brush is especially present along the river channels, along with areas covered in sedge or rushes. Spring flowers include the bog violet (Viola uliginosa), snake's head fritillary (Fritillaria meleagris), summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum), spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza spp.), and marsh orchid (Orchis palustris). Specimens of marsh lousewort (Pedicularis palustris) and march gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe) are still present but in decline, and due to fertilizer use the oblong-leaved sundew (Drosera intermedia) and white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba) have disappeared in the last decade. The area is also a habitat for the swamp cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris) and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), and in some drier areas there are also less <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceA deep {{sequence}} of Last Glacial peats and slope deposits {{at the foot}} of the Lascaux hill was investigated using a large array of methods (geology, geophysics, C- 14 and OSL dating, palynology, macro-remain analysis, entomology). The peaty levels, OSL dated to between similar to 73 and 60 ka, are found Within a doline developed in a fluvial terrace of the Vezere River. These gyttja and chalky gyttja deposits covered by fen peat yielded abundant beetle and plant (seeds, pollen) remains. Palaeoecological reconstructions suggest a cool steppe with willow stands compatible with an interstadial of marine isotopic stage (MIS) 4, probably Ognon II (GI- 192). Aquatic and <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plants</b> (sedges), which reflect local vegetation, and their dependent insects are equally well represented in the record. The peats are covered by a {{sequence of}} slope deposits: a coarse-grained lower unit deposited during late MIS 4, overlain by a heavily decalcified sandy unit with a boreal soil complex correlated with early MIS 3, and finally, a coarse grained, calcareous unit formed during late MIS 3 and MIS 2 in connection with slope dynamics typical of periglacial environments. The palaeosols yielded a small Middle Palaeolithic lithic assemblage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractÇataldağ, a {{mountain}} {{located in the}} northeast of Balıkesir, is a granitic mass the summit of which has an elevation of 1327 meters (Çobandede). As it lies in east-west direction {{in terms of its}} location, there is a striking vegetation contrast between the north and south slopes. The wide distribution of characteristically hygrophilous elements such as Uludağ fir (Abies bornmülleriana) and beech (Fagus orientalis) on the north slopes of the mountain makes it very interesting. The {{purpose of this study is}} to reveal the reason behind this interesting situation and to describe the features of these two slopes by comparing them. The vegetation was examined on site, notes were taken, and samples were collected in the preparation phase of the study. Later, these findings were classified. Based on the observations and materials, a vegetation map with a scale of 1 / 25. 000 was prepared by using forest management plans and topographic maps. Data provided by Mustafakemalpaşa and Kepsut meteorological stations, which respectively represent the north and south slopes, was used in order to find out about the relationship between the vegetation and the climate. Besides, 1 / 25. 000 scaled geological and soil maps were drawn with the purpose of demonstrating the edaphic conditions of plant communities. In order to indicate the orographic influence, cross section views of the vegetation along the north and south slopes were generated. Çataldağ lies in east-west direction, and is about 50 km away from the Marmara Sea as the crow flies. Thus, the north slopes are exposed to sea effects. The aspect, geographical position, and the elevation of the mountain led to the formation of a <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plant</b> community. The study not only reveals that the aspect has a great influence on the vegetation of the north and south slopes of mountains, but also demonstrates that this area is a border between the phytogeographical regions of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. In addition, the area is important in that it is the farthest western edge of the land where Uludağ fir (Abies bornmülleriana) grows. Beech communities, a dominant plant species on the north slopes, are found as islets and belts in regions situated in further west and south. This proves that Çataldağ is located in the Black Sea phytogeographical region...|$|E
40|$|The study {{present results}} of geobotanical {{investigations}} conducted in rice {{fields in the}} central Pamir Alai Mts (Tajikistan, Middle Asia), mainly within Syr-Daria, Pyandzh, Zeravshan, Kafirnigan, Khanaka and Surkhandaria river valleys in the years 2009 – 2011. The researches were focused on classification of plant communities developing within this poorly investigated area. Habitat conditions were checked including conductometry, pH reaction, temperature, depth of water and, for several plots, also soil structure. Altogether 114 phytosociological relevés using the Braun-Blanquet method were sampled. The analyses classified the vegetation into 28 communities including 24 associations. Five new plant associations and two new names for the syntaxa were proposed. The main discrimination factors for the data set are depth of water and altitude. Water reaction and conductometry have a minor role. The study shows that anthropogenic rice fields could harbour a relatively rich rush and water vegetation. Particularly extensively cultivated puddles {{could serve as a}} suitable habitat for many <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plants.</b> We found more than 120 species in vegetation plots, including some which are rare and have not been recorded until now in this part of Middle Asia. Moreover several alien species that we found were established in rice field vegetation, e. g. Bidens frondsa or Symphyotrichum graminifolium...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} 2007 - 2009, floristic, habitat and physico- {{chemical}} analysis {{was made of}} the hydraulically improved surrounding ditch of Lake Bikcze in the Łęczna-Włodawa Lakeland. Hemicryptophytes, with a large proportion of geophytes as well as hydrophytes and helophytes, were the main component of the flora of the studied section of the transformed Piwonia River channel. In terms of historical-geographical classification, spontaneophytes were predominant, and apophytes among them, whereas anthropophytes were poorly represented, which was confirmed by the correspondingly high values of the synanthropization and apophytization indices (> 50 %) as well as the low value of the anthropophytization index (approx. 2 %). In the aspect of the range of occurrence, Euro-Siberian and cosmopolitan species were predominant, which are classified in terms of the indicator values as <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plants,</b> neutral to continentality, living in moderately cool or moderately warm climatic conditions, characterized by a wide range of tolerance to the trophic state index and to soil acidity. An analysis of the values of the basic physico-chemical factors of the stagnant water in the surrounding ditch showed variations in the value of pH, electrolytic conductivity and the value of the concentration of organic and ammonium nitrogen as well as of organic phosphorus and phosphates. In spite of the anthropogenic nature of the studied watercourse, the qualitative and quantitative proportions of the flora species indicated the natural state of the flora based on the native vegetation, characteristic of the study area...|$|R
40|$|Ordinary lawns are {{difficult}} to maintain financially and can be time consuming, especialy {{if we try to}} cultivate lawn in places where the grass does not grow naturaly. The use of flowers as a subsitute to lawn brings forward new possibilities for otherwise neglected surface. Applying these alternatives are based on natural principles that initially cost higher but benefit far better in the long run. The chapter Introduction deals with issues of lawn versus flowers. This chapter focuses on typical habitats, groups of plants and works of experts. The chapter Literature Review focuses on different possibilities of ground covers with herbaceous vegetation in five subheads. Subhead Explanation of Basic Terms contains explanations of terms for lawn, flower - blooming plant and lawn substitutes from the perspective of different authors. Subhead Lawns briefly describes the history of the current lawns, mentions their function, types, methods of growing and its maintenance. The important idea is the negative effect of monocultures on the environment and how to reduce it. Subhead Groups of Flowers Used as Temporary Substitutes describes the topic of annuals and biennials in further details. It brings definition and characteristics of these flowers. Their use in different conditions either separately, as perennial plantings or as semi-wild structures are mentioned there. Subhead Groups of Flowers Used as Permanent Substitutes deals with perennials in detail. Flowering plants are divided according to the place of habitat. Describes the growing of flowers as a lawn substitute and its features such as visual similarity with lawn; resistance to pedestrian traffic, height, foliage, flowering time, etc. It focuses on the use of bulbs, alpine plants, xerophilous plants, flowers from the woods, <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plants,</b> aromatic plants and other groups. The last subhead, Specific Groups of Flowers as a Lawn Substitute, discusses the flower meadows, extensive perennial flower bed and roof gardens. It brings insight into the history, the use in different habitats, growing, or flower mixtures on the market. It mentions the financial and environmental burden. The chapter Conclusion evaluates if the objectives of the work have been achieved - giving the overview of flowers as a lawn substitute and the comparision with a lawn...|$|R
40|$|Microscopic plant remains such as pollen {{grains and}} seeds/fruits from archaeological sites, can {{significantly}} increase {{our understanding of}} past human activities. Indeed they are the documents of the past environment and land-use. They are very often considered in a multidisciplinary approach {{to the study of}} an archaeological site. With this aim we investigated the infilling of a small ditch buried {{at the bottom of a}} ca. 4 m thick sequence of archaeological deposits in the city centre of Padua (North-eastern Italy). This research was carried out within the project “Padova Underground: a geoarchaeological investigation of the city”, funded by Fondazione Cariparo. Sediments were sampled through a mechanical coring carried out for geotechnical purposes. This is the first integrated analysis of both pollen and seed/fruits carried out in the city centre. Early settlements in Padua date to the late Bronze Age. In the Iron Age Padua developed as an important urban centre, which later became a Roman Municipium. The stratigraphy of the coring indicate that the analysed sediments most probably date to the Iron Age, and a radiocarbon dating will soon be available. The coring site is well inside the ancient inhabited area where many archaeological records are available from the 9 th century to the beginning of the Roman age. The pollen record is characterized by the dominance of herb vegetation. The high percentage of cereals’ pollen and the co-occurrence of seeds and of their weeds (pollen and seeds) suggest the presence of cultivation quite near the coring site and therefore inside the inhabited area. The occurrence of pollen and seeds of a variety of ruderal plants is in agreement with the presence of settlements nearby. The <b>hygrophilous</b> <b>plants</b> (herbs, trees and shrubs) are quite rare, therefore the soils should have been well drained and suitable for cultivation and dwelling...|$|R

40|$|Piana del Sele" is {{a coastal}} plain {{lying on the}} {{southern}} reach of the Tyrrhenian coast and is of great historical and archeological concern in that here are located the Greek town of Poseidon and the sanctuary devote to Hera Argiva nearby the Sele outlet. A geomorphologic survey and a multidisciplinary study on sediment cores from 16 boreholes drilled along 3 transect close {{to the mouth of}} the River Sele provided the following characterization of sedimentary suite: a - Lowermost unit: it consists of clay and silty clay sediments enriched in peat and/or disperded organic matter up to 20 m thick and ranging in radiocarbon age from 10 to 6 kyr B. P. Ostracods point out an environment trending from brackish to freshwater conditions whereas and benthic foraminifers compatible with low salinity prevail. Pollen analysis revealed abundance <b>hygrophilous</b> and hydrophilus <b>plants</b> along with the recurrent occurrence of alder woods. Thus it results that the unit was deposited in a low salinity/fresh water coastal basin (lagoon/marsh). b- Intermediate unit: it includes up to 10 m of sands and pebbles; based on the overall features the unit is referred to a former beach/dune system. This sediment suite records a marine ingression, 14 C dated from 10 through 5 kyr B. P. as well as the subsequent sea retreat. c - Uppermost unit: it is made up of weathered clay or fine, dark red colored sediments, containing both carbonate concretions and vegetal debris. Such features do reflect the subaerial deposition developed {{at the back of the}} beach/dune system that, since 5 kyr B. P., commenced to migrate seawards up to the present position in response to a progressive marine regression. Radiocarbon datings point out that the Holocene transgression lasted up to 5 kyr B. P. and according to field evidence the relative sea-level rised ca. 1 m above the present one; since then up to now apart from small fluctuations the relative sea-level decreased. It is just during this phase of sea withdraw, in a palaeoenvironmental scenario where the former lagoons and marshes were drying up and a regime of subaerial deposition was in progress, that the sanctuary of Hera Argiva was erected...|$|R
