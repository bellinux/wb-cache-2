5|$|Beddard's Animal Coloration {{is cited}} and {{discussed}} both by historians of science, and by practising scientists {{from a number}} of different fields. For example, the book <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> progress of Darwinism, camouflage research, sexual selection, mimicry and the debate on the purpose of animal coloration triggered by Abbott Thayer. These areas are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{importance}} {{extends to}} the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, {{the realm of the}} dead, and with his rebirth at dawn. In these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, protecting and giving birth to the deceased as they do for Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.|$|E
5|$|The east face of {{the eastern}} wing has four bays with canted bay windows, shaped end gables and a central cartouche. In {{the centre of the}} {{northern}} (garden) face is a large bow window, originally Jacobean, which <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> chapel; it has stone panels decorated with cartouches below arched stained glass lights. This face otherwise reverses the main façade, with the addition of mezzanine windows.|$|E

5|$|The gatehouse's eastwards-facing tower {{contains}} the chapel, an unusual arrangement {{driven by a}} lack of space, with a recently restored east window of reset 15th-century glass designed by Nicola Hopwood, which <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> priest's seat, or sedile. The 15th-century window frame itself replaced an even taller, earlier 13th-century window. The chapel's west window is modern, and commemorates British servicemen who died between 1936–76 in radar development. The altar itself is particularly old, possibly pre-dating the castle.|$|E
5|$|The two {{then follow}} a small {{path through the}} woods until they come to {{a house with a}} stake fence around it. The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} expands on the FPS {{standards set}} by Doom in 1993, and features gameplay elements that are now common in the FPS genre. These include the ability to look up and down, duck, and jump. A variety of power-ups are {{made available to the}} player, including health, shields, weapons and ammunition. The game also features several non-combat items to aid the player. The head lamp <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> area in front of the player, but will reveal the player's position to enemies in dark rooms. Ice cleats provide traction in icy areas, and an air mask protects the player from areas with toxic atmosphere. Many inventory items are powered by batteries (separate from weapon ammunition types) which can be found around the levels.|$|E

5|$|New {{terrain is}} {{available}} in the game: Wasteland, which impedes the movement of ground vehicles; Ruins, which provide a minor defense bonus for ground units and hiding places in Fog of War; Fire, which is impassable and <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area during Fog of War; Rough Sea, which impedes the movement of naval units; Mist, which provides a defense bonus and hiding places for naval units; and Meteors and Plasma. Plasma forms an impassable wall that no unit can cross, and is generated by Meteors. Once a Meteor is destroyed, any Plasma in contact with it disappears, allowing units to pass. Plasma that is not in contact with a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|With two exceptions, the naves {{and eastern}} {{arms of the}} cathedrals have single lower aisles on either side with a {{clerestory}} that <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> central space. At Bristol the aisles are {{at the same height}} as the medieval choir like some German cathedrals, and at Chichester there are two aisles {{on either side of the}} nave like some French cathedrals. At a number of the cathedrals where the transepts are large they also have aisles, either on the eastern side as at Peterborough, Durham, Lincoln and Salisbury or both, as at Winchester, Wells, Ely and York.|$|E
5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and <b>illuminates,</b> <b>the</b> surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young variable star, TY Coronae Australis, illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and {{the brightness of the}} nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E

5|$|Temples {{were built}} {{throughout}} Upper and Lower Egypt, {{as well as}} at Egyptian-controlled oases in the Libyan Desert as far west as Siwa, and at outposts in the Sinai Peninsula such as Timna. In periods when Egypt dominated Nubia, Egyptian rulers also built temples there, as far south as Jebel Barkal. Most Egyptian towns had a temple, but in some cases, as with mortuary temples or the temples in Nubia, the temple was a new foundation on previously empty land. The exact site of a temple was often chosen for religious reasons; it might, for example, be the mythical birthplace or burial place of a god. The temple axis might also be designed to align with locations of religious significance, such as the site of a neighboring temple or the rising place of the sun or particular stars. The Great Temple of Abu Simbel, for instance, is aligned so that twice a year the rising sun <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> statues of the gods in its innermost room. Most temples were aligned toward the Nile with an axis running roughly east–west.|$|E
5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E

25|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the name}} is obscure, but 'the one who <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> world' has been proposed. Heimdallr may be connected to Mardöll, one of Freyja's names.

25|$|Behavioural change {{theories}} are not universally accepted. Criticisms include the theories' emphases on individual behaviour {{and a general}} disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour. In addition, as some theories were formulated as guides to understanding behaviour while others were designed as frameworks for behavioural interventions, the theories' purposes are not consistent. Such criticism <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> {{strengths and weaknesses of}} the theories, showing that there is room for further research into behavioural change theories.|$|E
