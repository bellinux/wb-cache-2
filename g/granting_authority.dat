2500|$|The inquiry was adjourned on 28 August, {{with the}} Sheriff anticipating {{reporting}} his findings by January 2016, although {{this could be}} delayed if it were deemed it would be prejudicial to the planned private prosecution. Upon closure the Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, reiterated the defence of {{the decision not to}} prosecute Clarke for the reasons previously given, explaining that the decision had been based on the fact the Crown would have had to prove Clarke would have known he was unfit to drive, something they doubted could be done based on a number of factors— his four-year history of episode-free driving after the 2010 incident, the fact that First Glasgow's occupational-health doctor had cleared him to drive after the 2010 incident and told him he need not notify the DVLA and the fact that First had given the council an acceptable reference. Citing DVLA procedures, he also pointed out that even if the DVLA had been notified of the 2010 incident [...] "the worst that could have happened" [...] was a maximum 12-month suspension and a return of his licence if there were no further concerns, and that the DVLA had returned Clarke's licence even after the 2014 crash. Based on this lack of evidence, he cast doubt on the prospect of a court <b>granting</b> <b>authority</b> for a private prosecution. The inquiry determined that no reference from First to the council could be found despite a detailed search.|$|E
