25|$|When optimally {{designed}} {{within a}} given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, <b>excitation</b> <b>frequency</b> (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) {{within a given}} air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.|$|E
2500|$|The Raman effect {{differs from}} the process of {{fluorescence}} {{in that it is}} a scattering process. For fluorescence, the incident light is completely absorbed, transferring the system to an excited state. [...] After a certain resonance lifetime, the system de-excites to lower energy states via emission of photons. The result of both processes is in essence the same: A photon with a frequency {{different from that of the}} incident photon is produced and the molecule is brought to a higher or lower energy level. But the major difference is that the Raman effect can take place for any frequency of incident light. In contrast to the fluorescence effect, the Raman effect is therefore not a resonant effect. In practice, this means that a fluorescence peak is anchored at a specific frequency, whereas a Raman peak maintains a constant separation from the <b>excitation</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E

40|$|Spinal {{musculature}} plays a {{major role}} in spine stability, but its importance to spinal stiffness is poorly understood. We studied the effects of graded trunk muscle stimulation on the in vivo dynamic dorsoventral (DV) lumbar spine stiffness of 15 adolescent Merino sheep. Constant voltage supramaximal electrical stimulation was administered to the L 3 –L 4 interspinous space of the multifidus muscles using four stimulation frequencies (2. 5, 5, 10, and 20  Hz). Dynamic stiffness was quantified at rest and during muscle stimulation using a computer-controlled testing apparatus that applied variable frequency (0. 46 – 19. 7  Hz) oscillatory DV forces (13 -N preload to 48 -N peak) to the L 3 spinous process of the prone-lying sheep. Five mechanical excitation trials were randomly performed, including four muscle stimulation trials and an unstimulated or resting trial. The secant stiffness (ky = DV force/L 3 displacement, kN/m) and loss angle (phase angle, deg) were determined at 44 discrete mechanical <b>excitation</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Results indicated that the dynamic stiffness varied 3. 7 -fold over the range of mechanical <b>excitation</b> <b>frequencies</b> examined (minimum resting ky =  3. 86  ±  0. 38  N/mm at 4. 0  Hz; maximum ky =  14. 1  ±  9. 95  N/mm at 19. 7  Hz). Twenty hertz muscle stimulation resulted in a sustained supramaximal contraction that significantly (P <  0. 05) increased ky up to twofold compared to rest (mechanical excitation at 3. 6  Hz). Compared to rest, ky during the 20  Hz muscle stimulation was significantly increased for 34 of 44 mechanical <b>excitation</b> <b>frequencies</b> (mean increase =  55. 1 %, P <  0. 05), but was most marked between 2. 55 and 4. 91  Hz (mean increase =  87. 5 %, P <  0. 05). For lower frequency, sub-maximal muscle stimulation, there was a graded change in ky, which was significantly increased for 32 / 44 mechanical <b>excitation</b> <b>frequencies</b> (mean increase =  40. 4 %, 10  Hz stimulus), 23 / 44 mechanical <b>excitation</b> <b>frequencies</b> (mean increase =  10. 5 %, 5  Hz stimulus), and 11 / 44 mechanical <b>excitation</b> <b>frequencies</b> (mean increase =  4. 16 %, 2. 5  Hz stimulus) when compared to rest.
