30|$|For a low <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> coordination, <b>the</b> company {{prefers to}} use a {{top-down}} budgeting process instead of a participative budgeting process. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> a low <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> coordination, <b>the</b> coordination benefits are small. The additional incentive costs exceed the coordination benefits. Whereas coordination benefits are increasing in <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> coordination <b>the</b> additional incentive costs are decreasing. Thus, for a high <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> coordination, <b>the</b> coordination benefits outweigh the additional incentive costs.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of several Song armies in the north, Emperor Qinzong wanted to {{negotiate}} a truce with the Jin, but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng.

5|$|Although Massachusetts was {{the first}} slave-holding colony {{dating back to the}} early 1600s, in the years leading up to the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of progressivist and {{abolitionist}} activity.

5|$|Although Rappe did not {{completely}} {{rule out the}} possibility of a German or British attack on southern Sweden if the opportunity arose, he felt that Russia was the most realistic threat. There were only two plausible scenarios for war with Russia: either Sweden would become involved in a war between Germany and Russia which would feature southern and central Sweden as the battlegroundand Rappe made no attempt to hide which country the General Staff wanted Sweden to side with in that caseor Russia would make a limited attack on Norrbotten to reach northern Norway and the Atlantic, an attack that Rappe earlier said was not very likely. Rappe had played down the strategic <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ofoten and Iron Ore Lines and played up the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main railway line to Boden, which was under discussion at that time, to speed up its completion. The railway to Boden was nearly finished by 1892, negating the need for Rappe to play that political game any longer. A railway line to Boden was of utmost {{need to be able to}} bring up troops to Lule Riverthe main line of defenceand a future fortress there.|$|E

5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced {{by the fact that}} a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more.
