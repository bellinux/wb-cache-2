50|$|An inverse <b>hypopyon</b> is {{different}} from a standard <b>hypopyon.</b> Inverse <b>hypopyon</b> is seen after a pars plana vitrectomy with an insertion of silicone oil (as a replacement of the vitreous humour that has been removed in the operation; the silicone oil maintains internal tamponade). When the silicone oil emulsifies, it seeps into the anterior chamber and settles {{at the top of}} the anterior chamber. This is in contrast to <b>hypopyon</b> resulting from toxins where the leukocytes settle at the bottom of the anterior chamber. This is due to the effect of gravity, hence the name inverse <b>hypopyon.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hypopyon</b> is {{also known}} as sterile pus, as it occurs due to the release of toxins and not by the actual {{invasion}} of pathogens. The toxins secreted by the pathogens mediate the outpouring of leukocytes that settle in the anterior chamber of the eye[...]|$|E
5000|$|Signs of {{anterior}} uveitis include dilated ciliary vessels, {{presence of}} cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates ("KP") on the posterior {{surface of the}} cornea. In severe inflammation there may be evidence of a <b>hypopyon.</b> Old episodes of uveitis are identified by pigment deposits on lens, KPs, and festooned pupil on dilation of pupil.|$|E
5000|$|Fungal {{keratitis}} causes {{deep and}} severe corneal ulcer. It {{is caused by}} Aspergillus sp., Fusarium sp., Candida sp., as also Rhizopus, Mucor, and other fungi. The typical feature of fungal keratitis is slow onset and gradual progression, where signs are {{much more than the}} symptoms. Small satellite lesions around the ulcer are a common feature of fungal keratitis and <b>hypopyon</b> is usually seen.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} factors in {{differentiating}} TASS from an infectious endophthalmitis is the rapid onset. Most patients with TASS will develop symptoms within 12 to 24 hours of the surgery.

Reported sources of infection can include self intracavernous injections to treat erectile dysfunction as well as phacoemulsification. Histological findings documented in the case study by Weinberger et al. include: necrotizing granulomata, chronic lymphocytic infiltration and fine septate hyphae. Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the infection however, treatment usually consists of antifungal medication such as amphotericin B. [...] Furthermore, the patient may undergo a cataract extraction (if present) and a pars plana vitrectomy. If the patient remains unresponsive to the treatment, then enucleation of the infected eye may be necessary.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>Hypopyon</b> {{in the eye}} is an {{alarming}} sign. A case of tuberculous uveitis which presented with pigmented <b>hypopyon</b> has been described. The aim {{of this paper is}} to report pigmented <b>hypopyon,</b> a rare presentation of tuberculous uveitis in a diabetic patient. Observations: A 42 -year-old patient with diabetes with a known history of miliary tuberculosis, on anti-tubercular therapy since two months presented with complaints of pain and redness followed by diminution of vision in the right eye since one month. Visual acuity was counting fingers close to face in right eye. Anterior chamber (AC) showed grade 4  cells and flare with a pigmented <b>hypopyon</b> measuring two mm. Fundus details were not made out. B scan revealed increased choroidal thickness with moderate vitritis. Routine blood counts revealed leucopenia and anemia suggestive of an immunosuppressed state. AC tap analysis was not helpful in diagnosis initially. Patient was lost to follow up and presented one month later with three - fourth of AC having <b>hypopyon.</b> AC wash was done and the AC sample evaluation revealed acid fast bacilli. Polymerase chain reaction results confirmed it to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Conclusions and importance: Tuberculous anterior uveitis thus presenting as pigmented <b>hypopyon</b> is very rare and can cause diagnostic difficulties. High index of suspicion in tuberculosis endemic areas is a must for a prompt diagnosis. A possible association between immunosuppression and pigmented <b>hypopyon</b> may exist and needs to be studied further...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Hypopyon</b> uveitis has inflammatory, infective, and {{neoplastic}} {{causes and}} a high association with systemic disease. Careful questioning of the patient and detailed examination of the eye for other signs is necessary to guide the differential diagnosis and relevant investigations. Because the underlying causes require very different types of investigation and, if missed, can have serious sequelae for the patient, a rational approach based on {{the understanding of the}} causes of <b>hypopyon</b> uveitis is imperative. In this review, <b>hypopyon</b> uveitis is considered {{in the context of the}} associated ocular and systemic disease...|$|E

40|$|Two female {{patients}} with histories of cancer who showed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) complications and bilateral anterior uveitis with <b>hypopyon</b> were examined. Both patients had suffered from COP and received intermitted systemic corticosteroid administration (SCA). The first patient, a 65 -year-old {{woman with a}} history of breast cancer, showed bilateral uveitis with <b>hypopyon.</b> The topical corticosteroid treatment was ineffective. After SCA for the treatment of COP was started, the <b>hypopyon</b> gradually dissipated. Upon termination of SCA, uveitis relapses were controlled by renewed SCA. The other patient, a 69 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} ovarian cancer, showed bilateral anterior uveitis with <b>hypopyon.</b> Her intraocular outcome did not improve by the topical corticosteroid administration, but SCA that was applied to treat COP led to remission of uveitis. Imaging examinations, biochemical analysis, symptoms or HLA-B 27 antigen screenings in either patient did not explain the development of uveitis. Bilateral anterior uveitis is commonly related to autoimmune disease or systemic syndrome. We report two cases with COP that developed bilateral anterior uveitis with <b>hypopyon</b> resistant to topical administration but responsive to systemic administration of corticosteroid. These findings suggest that COP can be associated with the etiology of anterior uveitis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A {{case report}} to {{highlight}} the association between rifabutin and <b>hypopyon</b> Methods A 56 year old male presented with a one day history of blurred vision in his right eye. He had an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease which was in remission following treatment with rifabutin and clarithromycin. A brisk anterior uveitis with <b>hypopyon</b> and a mild vitritis was detected in the right eye. The acute inflammatory episode resolved following treatment with topical corticosteroids and withdrawal of rifabutin. Results The presence of <b>hypopyon</b> is atypical in uveitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease. The association between rifabutin treatment and <b>hypopyon</b> uveitis is well recognised in Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis. However, use of rifabutin {{in the management of}} Crohn's disease is controversial and not widely known to an ophthalmic readership.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{report the}} {{association}} between bilateral uveitis with <b>hypopyon</b> and metastatic peritoneal carcinomatosis. METHODS. A 76 -year-old woman presented bilateral diffuse uveitis with <b>hypopyon.</b> She was in good health. She reported breast cancer history 20 years before with no recurrence of tumor at periodic examinations. RESULTS. The patient had visual acuity of count fingers in both eyes, <b>hypopyon,</b> and vitritis with no chorioretinal lesions. After 1 week of steroids, visual acuity and intraocular inflammation improved significantly. Given the late age at uveitis onset, clinical picture of uveitis, and breast cancer history, we suspected associated malignancy. Total body computed tomography revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis, which was removed 1 month later. After 12 months, visual acuity was 0. 8 bilaterally and bilateral uveitis resolved completely. CONCLUSIONS. Excluding a masquerade syndrome and a paraneoplastic syndrome {{on the basis of}} clinical features, uveitis represents an immune response to the concurrent tumor. The good response to steroid therapy is in accordance with this hypothesis. This is the first case of uveitis with <b>hypopyon</b> as presenting symptom of a metastatic peritoneal carcinomatosis developing 20 years after the removal of primitive breast cancer.

30|$|Ratra et al. {{in their}} case series {{demonstrated}} that all eyes had severe diffuse endophthalmitis involving the posterior pole. Diffuse vitreous exudates were seen in 47 eyes (77 %). Retina could be visualized in 13 eyes (21.3 %), and 3 (4.9 %) had retinal detachment. None had panophthalmitis [8]. In another case series in 18 -year review of culture-positive cases in 34 affected eyes, the most common findings were decreased visual acuity (91.1 %), vitritis (79.4 %), conjunctival injection (67.6 %), iritis or retinitis (61.7 %), <b>hypopyon</b> (35.2 %), and retinal detachment (5.8 %) [18]. In our study, 27 eyes (19 %) had <b>hypopyon,</b> 64 eyes (44.8 %) had fundus view, and 8 eyes (8.2 %) were noted to have retinal detachment on ultrasound.

40|$|A 79 -year-old male {{patient was}} {{followed}} for unilateral uveitis with 3 attacks in 10 months, despite initial improvement with steroid therapy. The patient had visual acuity (VA) of counting fingers in right eye, <b>hypopyon</b> and vitritis with no chorioretinal lesions. The left eye was normal. The patient was evaluated for intraocular foreign body, intraocular lymphoma and associated systemic disease and malignancy. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a {{mass in the}} bladder. Biopsy confirmed bladder carcinoma. After resection of the mass, intraocular inflammation improved completely and no attack was noted in the follow-up. In his last examination, {{two years after the}} operation, VA was light perception; seclusio pupilla and mature cataracts were seen on biomicroscopy. There was no sign of vitritis on ocular ultrasonography. Evidence is discussed that suggests a link and potential etiology between refractory uveitis with <b>hypopyon</b> and bladder carcinoma.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{positive}} outcome of postcataract endophthalmitis caused by Enterobacter cloacae, which has previously resulted in poor outcomes in endophthalmitis. A 67 -year-old man underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery. On {{the morning of}} postoperative day (POD) # 1, he had significant anterior chamber inflammation without pain, <b>hypopyon,</b> or vitritis but then rapidly developed <b>hypopyon</b> and worsening visual acuity. He underwent a tap and inject with vancomycin and ceftazidime and was prescribed topical steroids and antibiotics as well as oral levofloxacin. On POD # 3, cultures of the vitreous and aqueous returned positive for E. cloacae. By POD # 6, his <b>hypopyon</b> had resolved with improved vitritis, decreased inflammation, and visual acuity of 20 / 200. Two weeks after surgery, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 60.

The diagnosis was further confirmed by the histology of the anterior vitreous membrane, which showed Gram-positive cocci in the macrophages and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. This case shows that corticosteroids may completely mask an endophthalmitis from an organism of low virulence such as Staphylococcus epidermidis. Endophthalmitis from an organism of low virulence should be considered in any case of persistent postoperative inflammation...|$|E
