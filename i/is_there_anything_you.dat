2500|$|As a {{response}} to the record retirement rate the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia issued an extensive questionere to yacht owners seeking comment on suitability of storm sails, adequacy of radio communications and suitability of CYCA's standard safety equipment. They were also asked to comment [...] "As a result of your experience in this race <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> would do before starting, in say, the 1994 race to lessen the possibility of retiring should the same weather and sea conditions be anticipated'â€™.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to have Ibrahim {{burned at the stake}} was affirmed by the temple priests and the king of Babylon, Nimrod. The news spread like fire in the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire people ever witnessed was lit. The flames were so high up in the sky that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. Ibrahim's hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a catapult, ready to be thrown in. During this time, Angel Jibril came to him and said: [...] "O Ibrahim! <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> wish for?" [...] Ibrahim could have asked to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, [...] "Allah is sufficient for me, He is the best disposer of my affairs." [...] The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. Allah then gave an order to the fire, [...] "O fire! Be coolness and safety for Ibrahim." [...] A miracle occurred, the fire obeyed and burned only his chains. Ibrahim came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated and not a trace of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: [...] "Amazing! Ibrahim's God has saved him from the fire!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear little chap!" [...] said Holmes, strategically. [...] "What a rosy-cheeked young rascal! Now, Jack, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> would like?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{your own}} house, my dear sir--and your own nephew--you will not surely persist in hurting his {{feelings}} by seeming to discredit {{what he is}} so strongly interested in affirming. No doubt, you are fully deserving of all his confidence, and I <b>am</b> sure, <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> could do to assist him in this strange affair, he would have recourse to your goodness. But my cousin Frank has been dismissed as an innocent man, {{and no one is}} entitled to suppose him otherwise. For my part, I have not the least doubt of his innocence; and our family honour, I conceive, requires that we should maintain it with tongue and sword against the whole country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no! {{you never}} <b>are</b> asleep when <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> ought to see!' {{returned}} Dame Annora, {{who was standing}} by him with {{her hand on his}} chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't bother," [...] {{interrupted}} Tonia, {{with sweet}} sarcasm. [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> could do, you'd be doing it, of course. There isn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'After all, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> know so {{thoroughly}} insufferable as a ball?' he said, reflectively, as he sipped it with great content.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It will come, sir. You an't used to it. Nothing {{else to do}} {{here but}} to eat. Better try the kidney, sir. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> fancy?' ...|$|E
6000|$|UNDERSHAFT. Rather a {{difficult}} case, Stephen. Hardly anything left but the stage, is there? [Stephen makes an impatient movement]. Well, come! <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> know or care for? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> require, I pray you to call. I {{shall be}} {{in the next room}} all day and entirely at your service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir; I don't {{know that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> {{can do for}} us--except to spare him. The thief on the cross was forgiven, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you like}} me to help you tonight?" [...] she asked brightly. [...] "I thought I would ask if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> wanted me to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Captain Carruthers {{tells me}} that you speak the Spanish {{language}} like a native. Why have you hidden this accomplishment from me? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> do not know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{man smiled}} happily. [...] "All that is mine is yours, and, as it happens, I {{have two or}} three bills in my wallet. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> wish to buy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{got your}} head," [...] he retorted, [...] "full of nonsense, Lou. Try {{and be a}} {{sensible}} woman now, and think of it all quietly. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> would like me to do, for instance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{trust that}} you will {{acknowledge}} that we have shown our good will towards you, our desire to cultivate a Christian friendship with you, and {{that you will}} therefore excuse me if I {{ask you a question}} which might otherwise have the appearance of interference. Miss Mackenzie, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> between <b>you</b> and my husband's curate, Mr Maguire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no, {{not in the}} least. I {{like you}} to be frank. I should hate to think that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> did not dare to tell me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{very soon}} {{reach the end}} of all that I have to tell you," [...] he remarked. [...] "Still, if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> would like to know--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Hetty, I am here at your side; {{these are}} my arms that are around you," [...] sobbed Judith. [...] "Speak, dearest; <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> wish to say, or have done, in this awful moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed; I {{think you}} are not a bad old man. But you look sorry about something. Tell me, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> shall cry about when I leave you by yourself? I used to cry once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you follow}} out your own ideas, and won't {{give in to}} mine when I wish you to leave off this shameful labour. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> dislike in me that you act so {{contrarily}} to my wishes? I am your wife, and why will you not listen? Yes, I am your wife indeed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> that <b>you</b> wish to take, take it. But {{with you}} now, I suppose, {{money is the}} only {{possession}} that has any value.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for my own, I don't care twopence: I {{do it all}} for you. I don't {{even ask}} whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> between <b>you</b> and him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{she said}} deliberately. [...] "I {{do not think}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything.</b> If <b>you</b> could find out Mr. Macheson's address I should be much obliged." ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{a word or}} two of kindly {{greeting}} {{from the}} lady, Major Horsley went on: [...] "I told you a long time back, Smith, that I should not forget the service you did my wife and her sister, and that I would do you a good turn if I ever got the chance. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> particularly want at present?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys, Roger {{tells me}} you think of going West," [...] remarked Senator Morr, who stood near. He was a big man, with a round, florid face and a heavy but {{pleasant}} voice. [...] "Think of trying to locate that lost mine! <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> lads wouldn't try to do?" [...] And the big man laughed in his bluff, hearty manner.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! parsons {{think nothing}} of changes. He can appoint his own successor, and I'll not let things die away. And now, Phoebe, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want to do? I will not have Augusta tie you by the leg. I will look out a lady's horse to-morrow, and come to ride with you; {{or if you want}} to do anything, you can have the brougham any day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. My dear girl, {{whatever}} put such {{a thought}} into your head? We all know if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> could do, you'd {{do it at}} once, would n't she, Peachey? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> no handles to a horse, but the 1910 {{model has}} a string {{to each side}} of its face for turning its head when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want it to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{seems to}} be most satisfactory, Mr. Hurd," [...] she said. [...] "I shall {{probably}} be here for several weeks, so come up again if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want me to sign." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is near enough," [...] {{the doctor}} went on. [...] "As for your papers, you lost them, {{or they were}} burnt or stolen from you. He won't ask you many questions. Then the Buriat will speak up for you--he is rather an {{important}} man, {{being one of the}} richest of his tribe--and say what he can for you. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want done particularly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good Heavens! Is it possible?" [...] Captain Twentyman exclaimed. [...] "Of course I {{remember}} the case perfectly. We {{saw it in}} the English papers somewhere about a year ago, and it was a general matter of conversation, owing, of course, to your being in the army. I didn't know what to think of it then, but now I know you, the idea of your murdering a woman seems perfectly ridiculous. Well, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> would wish me to do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The doctor," [...] Mrs. Gallilee proceeded, [...] "thinks it of {{importance}} to your health {{to be as much}} as possible in the air. He wishes you to drive out every day, while the fine weather lasts. I have ordered the open carriage to be ready, after luncheon. Other engagements will prevent me from accompanying you. You will be under the care of my maid, and you will be out for two hours. Mr. Null hopes you will gain strength. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> don't want to know, ask Dan and he'll {{be sure to}} {{tell you}} all about it," [...] put in Fatty with a grin. [...] "How about it, Dan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The boss is out now," [...] the man said. [...] "He {{will be here}} {{in an hour or}} so. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> for <b>you</b> he {{will know}} about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Annie laughed. [...] "Nonsense," [...] said she. [...] "What {{you want}} is the best meal you can get. Aunt said if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> {{particularly}} liked she would have it made for you." ...|$|R
