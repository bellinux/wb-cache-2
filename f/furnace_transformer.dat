40|$|An {{analytical}} method to calculate eddy loss in a two-dimensional problem is presented. The problem geometry {{consists of a}} current carrying conductor of infinite length parallel to a conducting plate of infinite length and width but of finite thickness, The solution method first transforms the original current distribution into sinusoidal current sheets, It is therefore quite general {{and can be used}} for different current distributions such as single-phase and three-phase current, different shapes of conductors such as line current, rectangular conductor etc., and different problem geometries such as conducting plate shielded by electromagnetic screen. As an example, eddy loss is evaluated for the case when a line current passes parallel to a conducting plate. A laboratory experiment conducted to verify the theoretical results is also presented. Experimental results are also compared with the loss calculated by two-dimensional (finite-element) analysis.

The {{measurement}} of the electrical variables of a submerged-arc furnace is difficult owing to errors in the {{measurement of}} electrode-to-bath voltages and the difficulty in maintaining measurement connections to the hot, harsh environment of a furnace. A system is proposed which provides an accurate, reliable {{measurement of the}} electrode-to-bath voltages so that the electrical variables of the furnace can be determined. A means for measurement of the arcing conditions under each electrode has also been developed. The measurement system {{has been used in}} the examination of the conduction mechanisms occurring in a furnace and this has resulted in a significant improvement in the understanding of the operation. In addition, a method for determination of the lengths of the electrodes has been established. A problem with the measurement system is {{that it is necessary to}} make connections in a hot environment and on occasions, when a furnace eruption has occurred, the measurement leads have to be replaced. As a result, an indirect technique for determination of the resistances under each electrode has been developed and used for control of the power distribution in the furnace. The technique is based on an assumption about the relationship between the reactances in the furnace and all measurements are made on the primary side of the <b>furnace</b> <b>transformers</b> where reliable connections can be made...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Switching {{transients}} {{associated with}} circuit breakers {{have been observed}} for many years. With the widespread applica-tion of vacuum breakers for transformer switching, recently, this phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a significant number of trans-former failures. Vacuum circuit breaker switching of electric arc furnace and ladle melt <b>furnace</b> (LMF) <b>transformers</b> raises concern because of their inductive currents. High-frequency transients and overvoltages result when the vacuum breaker exhibits virtual current chop and multiple re-ignitions. This paper will present a detailed case study of vacuum breaker switching of a new LMF transformer involving current chopping and restrike simulations using the electromagnetic transients program. A technique that involves a combination of surge arresters and snubbers will be applied to the LMF to show that the switching transients can be successfully mitigated. Additionally, some practical aspects of the physical design and installation of the snubber will be discussed.

5000|$|A typical {{alternating}} current furnace {{is powered by}} a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 °C (5000 °F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch hoists or hydraulic cylinders. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the electrode clamps) or be [...] "hot arms", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. Hot arms can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Large water-cooled cables connect the bus tubes or arms with the transformer located adjacent to the <b>furnace.</b> The <b>transformer</b> is installed in a vault and is water-cooled.|$|R

Research Methods. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method of mathematical simulation of nonlinear processes as concerns hydrodynamics and heat transfer in the transformer equipment using finite-element analysis is employed. The results obtained. The paper presents the main elements of technique for creation of mathematical models; it also contains the examples of CFD-calculations as referred to axisymmetrical integrated models of <b>furnace</b> <b>transformer</b> and gapped-core shunt reactor, as well as the models of windings having design approaches of heat exchange intensification owing to «labyrinth» (partitions) and «alternation» (of number and locations) of axial cooling ducts. Scientific novelty. Scientific value of applied methodological approach {{lies in the fact that}} the developed models are the integrated ones, i. e., they consider geometry, loss, thermal parameters not only of the windings, but also of the main structural elements and cooling system. This ensures the quality and the accuracy of simulation of heat-and-mass transfer processes in complex structure of oil ducts and coils in the windings, enables to avoid erroneous «zigzag» oil flow movement through the groups of coil regular structures (without labyrinth and «alternation» of number and locations of axial ducts under conditions of transformer oil natural cooling as was deduced in the certain studies. Practical significance. Integrated models ensure calculation of oil temperature distribution within active part, including winding fields, oil temperature field between the tank and the windings, temperatures at oil outlet from the tank (top) and oil inlet into the tank (bottom). Calculations allow estimation of mean temperature distribution over the crosssection of winding coils, mean winding temperatures by means of averaging of the temperatures within the coils, detection of location and maximum temperature on the surface of conductors relevant to the most heated coil. The latter is treated as winding hot spot temperature (HST) and used to evaluate the aging of the contacting insulation. Determination of winding hot spot locations and temperatures (HST) is used as support data for installation areas of fiber optic probes for measurement during type testing, as well as in operational monitoring systems of the equipment. The results presented above are practically applied for industrial designing and testing of transformers and reactors...|$|E
