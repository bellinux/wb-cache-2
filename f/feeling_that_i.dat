As she matured into a young woman, O'Hara, like many actresses, became increasingly self-conscious, which affected her for a while. In one performance, which was watched by her father {{from the back of}} the theatre, O'Hara [...] "sensed there was someone out front watching me, perhaps critically. My arms felt like lead. I gave a rotten show that night. I grew up with the terrible <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was being laughed at".|$|E
500|$|Mikoyan {{received}} his {{education at the}} Nersisian School in Tiflis and the Gevorgian Seminary in Vagharshapat (Echmiadzin), both affiliated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism: [...] "I had a very clear <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't believe in God and that I had in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; the more I studied religious subjects, the less I believed in God." [...] Before becoming active in politics Mikoyan had already dabbled {{in the study of}} liberalism and socialism.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his cross-examination, {{prosecutor}} Hausner {{attempted to}} get Eichmann {{to admit he}} was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming. Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but stated that he never thought their annihilation was justified. When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets. During later examination by the judges, he admitted he meant the Jews, and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the press}} release, Collins said {{the idea behind}} the album was [...] "not to bring {{anything}} 'new' to these already great records, but to try to recreate the sounds and <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had when I first heard them. My intention was to make an 'old' record, not a 'new' record".|$|R
500|$|The [...] {{advent of}} war in September 1939 did not {{diminish}} Gibbons's creative energy. In November she {{began a series of}} articles, [...] "A Woman's Diary of the War", for St Martin's Review, the journal of the London church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The series ran until November 1943, and includes many of Gibbons's private reflections on the conflict. In October 1941 she wrote: [...] "he war has done me good... I get a dour satisfaction out of managing the rations, salvaging, fire watching, and <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am trying to work for a better world". In July 1940 Webb enlisted in the Middlesex Regiment, and the following year was commissioned into the King's Royal Rifle Corps. He later served overseas, mostly in Cairo.|$|E
500|$|Between {{his time}} in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later {{recalled}} making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot. This was an isolated occurrence, {{but by the time he}} was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: [...] " [...] imbued me with the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had some sort of talent". Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} minute of play, with Phil Esposito, Yvan Cournoyer and Peter Mahovlich out on the ice, Paul Henderson stood up at the bench and called Mahovlich off the ice as he was skating by. [...] "I jumped {{on the ice and}} rushed {{straight}} for their net. I had this strange <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could score the winning goal", recalls Henderson. Bobby Clarke was supposed to replace Esposito, but Phil didn't come off ("There was no way I was coming off the ice in that situation" [...] Esposito said). Cournoyer picked up a puck that had been passed around the boards by the Soviets in a clearing attempt. He missed Henderson with a pass, but two Soviets mishandled the puck in the corner and Esposito shot the puck on Tretiak.|$|E

500|$|The game's combat {{was praised}} by most critics. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Crispin Boyer {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "a thrill ride. And not just 'cause Return of the King unleashes larger hordes of foes than last year's equally slick Two Towers prequel. Many of Return of the Kings levels actually force you to multitask while you hack and slash." [...] PC Gamer UKs Tony Ellis wrote [...] "combat in RotK is superbly satisfying. Your blows connect with a solid, visceral thud you can almost feel." [...] He also noted the variation between levels. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed praised the [...] "subtleties of the combat." [...] In contrast, Game Informers Matthew Kato found the gameplay to be [...] "repetitious", writing [...] "sometimes I got the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was working harder only to have less fun than in Two Towers." [...] The co-op mode was also praised.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography she wrote, [...] "It {{was a unique}} <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had for [...] I {{would have done anything}} for him." [...] Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how [...] "blindingly" [...] in love Hepburn was with the actor. The relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs. Meeting when she was 34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian, but Hepburn said she [...] "knew right away that I found him irresistible." [...] Tracy remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Hepburn did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E

500|$|Displacement and {{alienation}} are regular themes in Manning's books. Characters are often isolated, {{physically and emotionally}} removed from family and familiar contexts and seeking a place to belong. This crisis of identity may reflect that of Manning herself {{as the daughter of}} an Irish mother and a British naval officer. [...] "I'm really confused about what I am, never really <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> belong in either place", she told an interviewer in 1969. In Manning's war fiction, conflict creates additional anxiety, emotional displacement and distance, with characters unable to communicate with each other. Eve Patten notes the [...] "pervasive sense of liminality" [...] and the recurrent figure of the refugee in Manning's work. Early literary interest in displacement was reinforced by Manning's own terrifying and disorientating experiences as a refugee during the war. Her travels also brought her into direct contact with the far worse plight of other war refugees, including Jewish asylum-seekers who were leaving Romania aboard the Struma. Exile had its rewards for literary refugees such as Manning, offering exposure to different cultures and [...] "the sense of a greater, past civilisation", as she described in her 1944 review of British poetry. Her writing, however, reflects her deep concern for the realities of most refugees, who are portrayed as [...] "a degraded and demoralised Other", challenging complacent Western notions of stability and nationality.|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I think is a great thing to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E
500|$|... "This Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Jepsen, Kelly Covell, Matthew Koma, and Stefan Kendal Gordy, also known as Redfoo from electropop duo LMFAO, through e-mails, text {{messaging}} and telephone calls. Jepsen explained that she had [...] "never written a song that way before so I'd definitely say it was new," [...] adding that [...] "there was something really exciting about being {{on the phone and}} singing ideas to each other and then calling each other back and re-writing lyrics in your BlackBerry and iPhone and seeing it all being exchanged." [...] The singer also revealed that she was pleased with the creative process of the song, commenting that [...] "despite all this craziness, [...] remains the same. And that same exciting <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had before anybody knew me, when I was just beginning to work on 'Call Me Maybe', is the same feeling I had today with Redfoo from LMFAO. You can sense the people who really have it are about writing that right word or that right melody to make it lift and make you feel that perfect emotion." [...] "This Kiss" [...] was recorded at Party Rock Studio with Redfoo in 2012 after Redfoo recorded ideas at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza, Spain, and was released as the second single from Kiss on September 10, 2012. [...] "This Kiss" [...] is a mid-tempo dance-pop track which lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved, featuring lyrics such as [...] "This kiss is something I can't resist/ Your lips are undeniable/This kiss is something I can't risk/Your heart is unreliable" [...] during the chorus. Carl Williot of Idolator compared the lyrics to the ones of Hall & Oates' [...] "Kiss on My List" [...] (1981).|$|E

2500|$|Later Tolkien hesitated {{about the}} true {{identity}} of [...] "Trotter" [...] {{for a long}} time. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits as originally planned, and that this would mean that Trotter was either a man, or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was [...] "very well known" [...] (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an early comment of Bingo: [...] "I keep on <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have seen him somewhere before". Tolkien considered that Trotter might be Bilbo Baggins himself, but soon rejected that idea after Aragorn identified himself.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heinze {{spoke of}} the {{creative}} frustration {{that led him to}} leave academia.

I finally took the plunge into a real fiction project... it became clear to me that creative rather than scholarly writing was my real métier." [...] He chose playwriting, in particular, because of Joe Orton; the intensity, intelligence and dark humor of Orton's plays had fascinated him. In 2006 he left his tenured Full Professorship at USF, moved to New York City, and embarked on a career in playwriting.|$|E
