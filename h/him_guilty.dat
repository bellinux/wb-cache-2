5|$|C. Floyd Landis was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Paris {{on the last day}} of the 2006 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during stage 17 of the race. The United States Anti-Doping Agency found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of using synthetic testosterone during the race and stripped him of his title on 20 September 2007.|$|E
5|$|D. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Paris {{on the last day}} of the 2010 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for the prohibited substance Clenbuterol on a rest day. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of using clenbuterol during the race and stripped him of his title on 6 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{was indicted}} on October 14, 1881, {{for the murder}} of the President. In a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often {{interrupted}} and argued, and in which his counsel used the insanity defense, the jury found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> on January 5, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau might have had neurosyphilis, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.|$|E
25|$|After half an {{hour the}} jury {{unanimously}} found <b>him</b> not <b>guilty.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kenny-Dowall's trial {{commenced}} on 24 February 2016 in Sydney. On 29 February, {{the magistrate}} found <b>him</b> not <b>guilty</b> on all 11 charges.|$|R
50|$|Kanerva {{was accused}} of and {{investigated}} in a bribery case in 2010-2013. The Helsinki Court of Appeals found <b>him</b> not <b>guilty</b> in 2013.|$|R
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Liverpool Football Club, he stated that if he wasn't a footballer {{he would have been}} a physio. On 12 September 2010, he was jailed for four months over a drunken attack on a taxi driver which had taken place on 9 August 2009 in Watford, Hertfordshire. He was tried for racially aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm but a jury acquitted him of that charge, but found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of an alternative charge of assaulting the taxi driver.|$|E
5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find <b>him</b> <b>guilty.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} {{the city}} council's hearing into the case, Christine and Briegleb arrive at Los Angeles City Hall, where they {{encounter}} thousands of protesters who are demanding answers from the city. The hearing is intercut with scenes from Northcott's trial. The council concludes that Jones and Davis should be removed from duty, and that extrajudicial internments by police must be stopped. Northcott's jury finds <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of murder and the judge sentences him to death by hanging.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. If Mr. Sachaverell, {{with his}} Bloody Flag, and Banner of Defiance, were Indicted for Moderation, I verily believe no Jury would bring <b>him</b> in <b>Guilty.</b>|$|R
50|$|The defence and {{prosecution}} in Xiang's trial agreed that {{he suffered from}} a paranoid delusional disorder. The prosecution asked the jury to find <b>him</b> not <b>guilty.</b> On 17 June 2004 the Victorian Supreme Court jury found <b>him</b> not <b>guilty</b> {{of the murder of}} Wu and Chan and of the attempted murder of five other people in the tutorial room due to mental impairment. Justice Bernard Teague ordered Xiang be transferred to the Thomas Embling psychiatric hospital. He may be held there for as long as 25 years.|$|R
50|$|Mr Rasalingam {{was charged}} with {{trafficking}} a person (s271.2(1B)) and with intentionally exercising control over a slave, (s270.3(1)(d)). The jury found <b>him</b> not <b>guilty</b> on both counts.|$|R
5|$|Representing himself {{during the}} hearing, he {{admitted}} the violation but {{pleaded not guilty}} and hinted at conspiracies. During a recess the judge apparently suggested a psychiatric evaluation to Reich's ex-wife, Ilse Ollendorff, {{but this was not}} communicated to Reich. The jury found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> on 7 May 1956, and he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Silvert was sentenced to a year and a day, the Wilhelm Reich Foundation was fined $10,000, and the accumulators and associated literature were to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Milan {{on the last day}} of the 2011 Giro d'Italia, but was subsequently found to have tested positive for performing-enhancing drugs on a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France. He was originally suspended on 25 January 2011 for a year, but appealed the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of using clenbuterol during the race; thus his results since the 2010 Tour de France were taken away from him and he was stripped of the win on 6 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{the defence}} {{argued that the}} {{proceedings}} were invalid as Knight had been granted immunity by the Attorney-General's Chambers in 1991 from further charges arising from his corruption investigations, in exchange for him to plead guilty in the earlier trial. They argued that the latest set of charges stemmed from that investigation and thus were subject to the immunity clause. The CPIB revealed {{that it had been}} tipped off about the misappropriation of money only in 1997 by an unnamed informant. The court ruled that the proceedings could continue because the 1991 probe into Knight's dealings did not investigate his misappropriation of money. Eventually the court found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of two charges of misappropriation and sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and another day in jail.|$|E
50|$|After {{a lengthy}} trial, the Sandiganbayan ruled Estrada {{not guilty of}} perjury while ruling <b>him</b> as <b>guilty</b> of plunder and sentenced him to reclusión perpetua. All of his {{co-accused}} were acquitted.|$|R
50|$|On 31 January 2008 a {{jury found}} <b>him</b> not <b>guilty</b> on all six charges. Multiple rugby league personalities defended the {{character}} of Ropati in court including the Mad Butcher Peter Leitch.|$|R
5000|$|Celia White, a nosy {{reporter}} who is digging up dirt on Griffin. She often twists his words, {{and she will}} do anything to make <b>him</b> look <b>guilty,</b> possibly to gain a promotion.|$|R
5|$|Nichols stood trial twice. He {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build {{a weapon of mass destruction}} and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts of first-degree murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E
5|$|The umpires {{reported}} Waddington to the cricket {{committee of}} the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and gestures of displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him {{to write a letter}} of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned {{at the end of the}} season, and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.|$|E
25|$|I'll swear <b>him</b> <b>guilty.</b>|$|E
60|$|After all, should I {{call him}} unlucky? He had escaped the snare I had laid for him, and perhaps (such things have been) even a Newnham jury might find <b>him</b> not <b>guilty.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Ant. [Letting go his hold.] Let <b>him</b> be <b>guilty</b> {{of his own}} death, if he pleases; for I'll not {{be guilty}} of mine, by holding him. [...] [The King shakes off ALV.|$|R
50|$|The {{trial began}} in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014 {{and the jury}} found <b>him</b> not <b>guilty</b> on November 3, 2014. Jurors deliberated just over an hour before {{returning}} a not guilty verdict.|$|R
25|$|Former Bangladesh spinner Shariful Haque {{was banned}} in September 2012 after an inquiry found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of {{spot-fixing}} {{during the first}} edition of the BPL.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} judgment the Appellate Panel partially accepted {{the appeal of}} Petar Mitrović and found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of the criminal offense of genocide, but as an accessory (aiding and abetting), and sentenced him to 28 years of imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|The mutineers killed Captain Worth {{and three}} other officers. Soon after William Humphries, one of the mutineers, was accused of {{plotting}} to take the ship; a kangaroo court of the mutineers tried him and, finding <b>him</b> <b>guilty,</b> hanged him.|$|E
50|$|The Taiwan High Court {{ruled on}} a {{separate}} case involving Feng in 2012, finding <b>him</b> not <b>guilty</b> of breaching the Assembly and Parade Act in a March 2004 protest of presidential election results.|$|R
50|$|Texas Lightsey v. King (1983) {{determined}} that due process {{requires that the}} outcomes of investigation be taken seriously. A student cannot, for instance, be dismissed for cheating after a hearing has found <b>him</b> not <b>guilty.</b>|$|R
50|$|The matter came {{to trial}} at Salisbury Crown Court in April 2012 where Lee Barnard was cleared of all charges after the jury {{took less than}} an hour to find <b>him</b> not <b>guilty</b> of any crime.|$|R
25|$|Mollath {{attempted}} {{to appeal the}} ruling as the court did consider <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of assault (yet had to acquit him on legal grounds), but his appeal was rejected because the reasons for an acquittal technically cannot be grounds for an appeal.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 2006, Warren Jeffs was {{captured}} on Interstate 15 {{just north of}} Las Vegas, Nevada, after a routine traffic stop. Jeffs was tried in St. George, Utah, and a jury found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of two counts of being an accomplice to rape.|$|E
25|$|David Caplan’s {{first trial}} {{ended in a}} deadlocked jury. In December 1916, a second jury found <b>him</b> <b>guilty</b> of second degree manslaughter. The court sentenced him to ten years in prison. He was {{released}} in 1923 after 6 1/2 years, with time off for good behavior.|$|E
