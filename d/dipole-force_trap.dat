40|$|The {{external}} {{fields of}} optical whispering gallery modes {{may be used}} to confine atoms in stable orbits around a dielectric microsphere. As an example, a toroidal <b>dipole-force</b> <b>trap</b> (atom gallery) for three-level atoms is investigated, and the possibility of achieving an atomic (matter-wave) resonator is discussed. The extremely small electromagnetic mode volumes and high Q's of the whispering gallery modes should permit a circulating photon to be repeatedly absorbed and reemitted by a trapped whispering atom...|$|E
40|$|Single Cesium atoms {{are cooled}} and trapped inside a small optical cavity {{by way of}} a novel far-off-resonance <b>dipole-force</b> <b>trap</b> (FORT), with {{observed}} lifetimes of 2 - 3 seconds. The trapping field is provided by a TEM- 00 mode of the cavity at a wavelength of 935. 6 nm, and is such that the external potential for the center-of-mass motion is only weakly dependent on the atom's internal state. Continuous real time observations of single trapped atoms in a regime of strong coupling are reported, with mean duration 0. 4 s and with individual events lasting ~ 1 s...|$|E
40|$|The {{coupling}} {{of individual}} atoms to a high-finesse optical cavity is precisely controlled and adjusted using a standing-wave <b>dipole-force</b> <b>trap,</b> {{a challenge for}} strong atom-cavity coupling. Ultracold Rubidium atoms are first loaded into potential minima of the dipole trap {{in the center of}} the cavity. Then we use the trap as a conveyor belt that we set into motion perpendicular to the cavity axis. This allows us to repetitively move atoms out of and back into the cavity mode with a repositioning precision of 135 nm. This makes it possible to either selectively address one atom of a string of atoms by the cavity, or to simultaneously couple two precisely separated atoms to a higher mode of the cavity...|$|E
40|$|Neutral atoms {{trapped by}} laser light {{are among the}} most {{promising}} candidates for storing and processing information in a quantum computer or simulator. The application certainly calls for a scalable and flexible scheme for addressing and manipulating the atoms. We have now made this a reality by implementing a fast and versatile method to dynamically control the position of neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers. The tweezers result from a spatial light modulator (SLM) controlling and shaping a large number of optical <b>dipole-force</b> <b>traps.</b> Trapped atoms adapt to any change in the potential landscape, such that one can rearrange and randomly access individual sites within atom-trap arrays. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{versatile}} arrangement for the trapping and manipulation of single atoms in optical tweezers {{formed by the}} direct image of a spatial light modulator (SLM). The scheme incorporates a high numerical aperture microscope to map the intensity distribution of a SLM onto a cloud of cold atoms. The regions of high intensity act as optical <b>dipole-force</b> <b>traps.</b> With a SLM fast enough to modify the trapping potential in real time, this technique is well suited for the controlled addressing and manipulation of arbitrarily selected atoms. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} address and {{manipulate}} individual information carriers in a deterministic, coherent, and scalable manner {{is a central}} theme in quantum information processing. Neutral atoms trapped by laser light are amongst the most promising candidates for storing and processing information in a quantum computer or simulator, so a scalable and flexible scheme for their control and manipulation is paramount. This thesis demonstrates a fast and versatile method to address and dynamically control the position (the motional degrees of freedom) of neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers. The tweezers are generated by using the direct image of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) which can control and shape {{a large number of}} optical <b>dipole-force</b> <b>traps.</b> Trapped atoms adapt to any change in the potential landscape, such that one can re-arrange and randomly access individual sites within atom-trap arrays. A diffraction limited imaging system is used to map the intensity distribution of the SLM onto a cloud of cold atoms captured and cooled using a Magneto Optical Surface Trap (MOST).

40|$|Single Cesium atoms {{are cooled}} and trapped inside a small optical cavity {{by way of}} a novel far-off-resonance <b>dipole-force</b> <b>trap</b> (FORT), with {{observed}} lifetimes of 2 to 3 seconds. Trapped atoms are observed continuously via transmission of a strongly coupled probe beam, with individual events lasting ~ 1 s. The loss of successive atoms from the trap N = 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 is thereby monitored in real time. Trapping, cooling, and interactions with strong coupling are enabled by the FORT potential, for which the center-of-mass motion is only weakly dependent on the atom's internal state.

40|$|A {{sample of}} caesium {{atoms in the}} F= 3, m_F=- 3 ground state was evaporatively cooled in a Time-Orbiting Potential (TOP) trap. An {{increase}} in phase-space density of four orders of magnitude was observed, reaching a maximum of 2 x 10 "-" 3. The efficiency of evaporation was insufficient for obtaining BEC, being limited by {{a high rate of}} inelastic collisions causing heating and loss from the trap. The time taken for a trapped cloud of cold caesium atoms in the F= 3, m_F=- 3 state to rethermalise from a non-equilibrium spatial and velocity distribution was measured. From this, the dependence of the elastic scattering cross-section on temperature and magnetic field was inferred. No evidence was found for a Feshbach resonance in the magnetic field range, 0. 5 - 20 G, but a shape resonance was seen in the marked temperature dependence in the data. A lower bound was put on the magnitude of the scattering length of 940 a_ 0, in good agreement with other experimental results. A novel <b>dipole-force</b> <b>trap</b> was developed using a beam from an argon ion laser in a Laguerre-Gaussian mode, focused to form a hollow cone with its axis vertical. Approximately 1000 atoms in the F= 3 state were confined in the dark region above the apex of the cone. With further development, this trap could be used to confine caesium atoms in the F= 3, m_F=+ 3 state, for which spin-flips resulting from two-body collisions cannot occur. A method of compression and evaporation is proposed.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{construction}} of a laser-cooling experiment aimed at investigating the properties of periodic arrays of ultra-cold atoms known as optical lattices. We performed preliminary experiments on atoms in a magneto-optical trap, optical molasses and optical lattices in one and three dimensions, the results of which were used to characterize and optimize our laser-cooling setup. To this end, a variety of diagnostic methods, such as time-of-flight temperature measurements and probe-absorption spectroscopy, were employed. We applied a novel method, introduced by the group at the ENS in Paris, to a study of vibrational Raman transitions between adjacent vibrational levels in optical lattices. The improved frequency-selectivity of this technique over other methods enabled us to measure accurately and {{over a wide range}} of parameters the widths associated with these transitions. We found clear evidence that the latter are dominated by the anharmonicity of the lattice potential, with the dissipative decay of the vibrational coherences strongly suppressed by a transfer of coherence between adjacent, nearly equally-spaced pairs of vibrational levels, as suggested by previous experiments. Furthermore, we used this method to perform time-resolved studies during the equilibration of atoms in optical lattices. On the theoretical side, we propose two schemes which could lead to higher filling factors in optical lattices, which at present are typically on the order of 10 percent. The first of these methods relies on the compression and cooling of an atomic cloud in a novel <b>dipole-force</b> <b>trap</b> based on a focused hollow beam, whereas the second method involves a two-colour lattice with a superperiod that can be much larger than lattice periods in conventional optical lattices.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{resonant}} cavity enhancement of a hollow "optical bottle beam" for the <b>dipole-force</b> <b>trapping</b> of dark-field-seeking species. We first improve upon the basic bottle beam by adding further Laguerre-Gaussian components to deepen the confining potential. Each of these components itself {{corresponds to a}} superposition of transverse cavity modes, which are then enhanced simultaneously in a confocal cavity to produce a deep optical trap needing only a modest incident power. The response of the trapping field to displacement of the cavity mirrors offers an unusual form of mechanical amplifier in which the Gouy phase shift produces an optical Vernier scale between the Laguerre-Gaussian beam components...|$|R
40|$|In the ultracold regime, {{where the}} {{interactions}} between atoms become quantum mechanical in nature, we can investigate the fundamental properties of matter. A natural progression from the catalogue of pioneering experiments using ultracold atoms is to extend {{the size of our}} quantum system by producing ultracold molecules in prescribed low-energy internal states. Techniques for cold molecule production are split into two methods: direct and indirect cooling. While direct cooling methods have yet to realize ultracold temperatures, collisional relaxation in the molecules leads to low internal energy states. By contrast, indirect cooling — the association of molecules from pre-cooled atoms—has produced a range of molecules at ultracold temperatures; the challenge with this technique is to control the internal state. This thesis concentrates on a technique that is complementary to those already in existence: ultrafast photoassociation. Key to this technique is the formation of time non-stationary wavepackets in the excited-state in order to improve FranckCondon overlap of the excited state with deeply bound ground-state vibrational levels. A pump-probe experiment was designed and built to demonstrate the formation of bound excited-state dimers. In this work we show that the initial state from which the wavepacket originates is of critical importance to the evolution of excited-state population. We find that the internuclear separation of the wavepacket produced in a rubidium magneto-optical trap is too large to observe coherent oscillations in the excited state. The implications of this are discussed along with recommendations for future ultrafast photoassociation experiments. Consequently, a new ultracold atom apparatus was built utilizing magnetic and <b>dipole-force</b> <b>trapping</b> to increase the density of the atomic sample; this apparatus will enable future experiments combining the exciting fields of ultracold matter and ultrafast light. </p...|$|R
