She became a regular cast member for Fish Hooks, which premiered in 2010, where she voiced Shellsea and many supporting and guest characters. She landed the role of Tigress in the television adaptation the series premiered in 2011 and has run over four seasons. In 2012, she had the lead role of Allie Underhill in the action series , which spanned 52 episodes, and picked up roles in other cartoon shows such as Gravity Falls, , and Winx Club.

40|$|The {{detection}} and monitoring of preload <b>in</b> <b>bolting</b> is an omnipresent need in structural mechanics without sufficient solution. A detailed study about the preload <b>in</b> <b>bolts</b> and its detection {{with a combination}} of different types of ultrasonic waves is presented. The accuracy of preload measurement based on relative time-of-flight variations between different wave types was investigated. For this purpose a system was built to adjust defined stress states <b>in</b> <b>bolts</b> and correlate them with ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements. In a first step the influence of stress on every single type of wave and the repeatability of time-of-flight measurement <b>in</b> the <b>bolt</b> were determined. This led to a good estimate of the measurement error and defines the minimum and the step size of preload detection. Additionally the bolt's microstructure caused by the production process and the thread geometry are very important factors for the interaction of ultrasound with the bolt. Taking these boundary conditions into account, it is possible to define a material based acoustoelastic parameter which enables detection of stress levels <b>in</b> <b>bolts</b> of the same material and dimension. The necessary verification of this special acoustoelastic parameter is also possible with the preload-adjustment-system. The mentioned system provides full control over ultrasound generation, measurement and data handling in combination with precise mechanical measurement of the applied load. In the following investigations a comparison of parameters between different bolt diameters and lengths were performed to quantify dimensional effects and their contribution to the measurement error. Regarding the potential use in on- or offline monitoring systems a comprehensive database is crucial to investigate bolts of different materials and dimensions as well as easy-to-use GUI...|$|R

As for the scenes of events in fiction you have a plain duty to shun them, for in a city where the great facts of the past are written so deep upon the walls and pavement one over another, it is folly which can be forgiven only to the vacancy of youth to go looking for the places where this imaginary thing happened. Yet this claim of folly has been recognized, and if you wish to indulge it, you can do so at little trouble.

Forty odd years ago I myself, on first arriving in London, lodged at the Golden Cross, because it was there that David Copperfield stopped; and I was insensately pleased the other day that there was still a hotel of that name at the old stand.

The shambling elderly waiter who was part of the furniture in 1861 is very likely dead; and for the credit of our country I hope that the recreant American whom I heard telling an Englishman there in those disheartening days, of our civic corruptions, may have also passed away. He said that he himself had bought votes, as many as he wanted, in the city of Providence; and though I could deny the general prevalence of such venality at least in my own stainless state of Ohio, I did not think to suggest that in such a case the corruption was in the buyer rather than the seller of the votes, and that if he had now come to live, as he implied, in a purer country, he had not taken the right way to be worthy of it. But at twenty-four you cannot think of everything at once, and a recreant American is so uncommon that you need hardly, at any age, provide for him.|$|E

However, increasing the plate width from 25. 4 to 30 mm increased the load carrying capacity by 28 %. This study showed that <b>in</b> single <b>bolt</b> connections, with increasing the edge distance, the failure mode can favourably shift from shear-out to bearing. Also, double bolt joints with wider plates (increased width) can beneficially shift the failure mode from net-tension to bearing.
