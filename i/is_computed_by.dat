5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key <b>is</b> <b>computed</b> <b>by</b> using each byte {{of the key}} as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E

25|$|In a basic digital system, a numeral is a {{sequence}} of digits, which may be of arbitrary length. Each position in the sequence has a place value, and each digit has a value.

25|$|Conditional {{branches}} {{test whether}} the {{least significant bit}} of a register is set or clear, or compare a register as a signed quadword to zero, and branch if the specified condition is true. The conditions available for comparing a register to zero are equality, inequality, less than, {{less than or equal}} to, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The new address <b>is</b> <b>computed</b> <b>by</b> longword aligning and sign extending the 21-bit displacement and adding it to the address of the instruction following the conditional branch.|$|E
25|$|Like B-splines, NURBS {{control points}} {{determine}} {{the shape of}} the curve. Each point of the curve <b>is</b> <b>computed</b> <b>by</b> taking a weighted sum of a number of control points. The weight of each point varies according to the governing parameter. For a curve of degree d, the influence of any control point is only nonzero in d+1 intervals (knot spans) of the parameter space. Within those intervals, the weight changes according to a polynomial function (basis functions) of degree d. At the boundaries of the intervals, the basis functions go smoothly to zero, the smoothness being determined by the degree of the polynomial.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were {{motivated}} by money, as the fighters competed for prize money, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited {{to three or four}} rounds, scoring <b>is</b> <b>computed</b> <b>by</b> points {{based on the number of}} clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts. Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an Automated Boxing Scoring System, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career.|$|E
