500|$|Thorpe {{spoke to}} reporters after his 100m race, saying: [...] "When I started this I {{wanted to get}} back into the pool. I wanted to start racing again, I wanted to be {{competitive}} again and I wanted to go to the Olympics. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to do all of those things. I've missed out on what was a huge goal for me to accomplish in this short period of time, but still the desire I had previous to this, it's still there." [...] Essentially saying that his (relatively) slow times in the 100 and 200 meters were the result of too short a period to train and prepare, Thorpe announced he will continue training, setting as his (new) goal qualifying for the World Championships in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Her love of tattoos, however, gained media {{attention}} in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos {{of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an [...] "Abbey Dawn" [...] on her left forearm and an [...] "XXV" [...] and star on her right. Although she confirmed the [...] "fuck" [...] tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her [...] "favorite word") she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually {{wanted to get a}} [...] "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life." [...] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, [...] "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast. The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E

2500|$|In late 1986, Faith No More {{was signed}} to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had {{recently}} been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. Introduce Yourself was released in 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track [...] "We Care a Lot" [...] saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album Introduce Yourself — during which he fell asleep on stage — and one of Mosley's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Billy Gould reflected [...] "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so ridiculous’. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: ‘Well, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to play with you’. Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these ‘firing somebody without firing them’ scenarios." ...|$|E

You will most likely want another suit of clothes of some sort while going about to look for this man, whom <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> to find.

You can so easily devise a little padding to keep two strong cards or bits of wood separate for one or two to lie happily in. I don't mind giving you this tease, for the throat will be better the less you remember it. But for all of us, a dark sky is assuredly a poisonous and depressing power, which neither surgery nor medicine can resist. The difference to me between nature as she is now, and as she was ten years ago, is as great as between Lapland and Italy, and the total loss of comfort in morning and evening sky, the most difficult to resist of all spiritual hostility.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking of {{the process}} of {{recording}} the album, Angus said: “A lot of the sounds I was working on were samples, they lived inside my computer, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>wanted</b> to have a connection with everything around me.

The truth is, even in New York or LA, <b>I</b> was <b>still</b> pretty isolated. Here, there are no other people around, but I feel much more connected to the environment around me than in a big city”.|$|R

It's like the feeling one would have going out into a storm on a dark night, away from a warm fire--only of the spirit not the body--which makes it worse. I had to tell you this; you mustn't think of it again, I mean to fight it away and forget that it has ever been there. But Uncle Nic--what am I to do? I hate myself because I am young, and he is old and weak--sometimes I seem even to hate him.
