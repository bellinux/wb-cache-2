5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Altar Q and Altar R are {{two small}} {{rhyolite}} disks that probably served as ballcourt markers for the earliest ballcourt, the buried Structure 1B-sub.4. Together {{with a third}} stone they would have marked the central axis of the ballcourt. They both bear seated cross-legged figures carved <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> relief.|$|E

50|$|An {{analysis}} of the sediment samples collected by Kaiko found large numbers of simple organisms at 10900 m. While similar lifeforms {{have been known to}} exist <b>in</b> <b>shallower</b> ocean trenches (> 7,000 m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep possibly represent taxa distinct from those <b>in</b> <b>shallower</b> ecosystems.|$|R

5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa mainly occurs {{from west}} of Yandanooka in the north, south to Badgingarra National Park, and east almost to Coorow. It grows <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> sand over laterite, in deep sand, and {{occasionally}} atop lateritic rises, on flat or gently undulating land, among kwongan shrubland. Around 40% of plants occur on road verges.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when {{bodies of water}} begin to dry up in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.|$|E

5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} harmful to fur-bearing rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses {{were destroyed by}} jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1944, Schlesiens and Schleswig-Holsteins {{anti-aircraft}} armament {{was considerably}} strengthened {{to allow them}} to be used as an air defense ships in the port of Gotenhafen. Schleswig-Holstein was attacked by RAF bombers in December 1944, and although she was sunk <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water, her weapons could still be used. After a fire permanently disabled the ship, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of Marienburg. Starting in 1944, Hannover was broken up for scrap; work lasted until 1945. Schlesien provided fire support for German troops in the vicinity of Gotenhafen between 15 and 21 March 1945. In April, Schlesien was moved to Swinemünde to restock her ammunition supply as well as evacuate 1,000 wounded soldiers from the front. On 3 May she struck a mine outside Swinemünde; the following day she was scuttled by her crew <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water. Both ships were broken up in situ after the war.|$|E
5|$|In the Upper Myall River region, B.serrata {{grows in}} dry sclerophyll forest on sandy soils that have {{recently}} formed (in the Holocene) or <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> soils over differing substrates, while its close relative B.aemula grows on dry heath forest that occurs on ancient Pleistocene sands {{that have not}} been disturbed in 125,000 years. In intermediate communities both species are found.|$|E

5|$|Several {{animal species}} have been {{introduced}} to Everglades waterways. Many tropical fish are released, the most detrimental being the blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus), which builds large nests <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> waters. Tilapia also consume vegetation which would normally be used by young native fishes for cover and protection.|$|E
5|$|Social {{aggregation}} is {{well documented}} in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant adult females have been observed slowly swimming in circles <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water, occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water from March to June. The number of sharks per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the aggregation area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest {{part of the day}} in the afternoon, and dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the aggregation site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be taking advantage of the warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.|$|E
5|$|The German {{heavy cruiser}} , ship #36, survived both the Able and Baker tests but was too {{radioactive}} to have leaks repaired. In September 1946 she was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she capsized <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> water on December 22, 1946, {{five months after}} Baker.

50|$|Fishing is very {{difficult}} in the lake. Bass and trout can be caught. In the spring, lake trout will strike at minnows <b>in</b> cold <b>shallow</b> water. Later <b>in</b> the summer, trout like to stay in cold water below the second thermocline, which is typically 50-70 feet. This requires down-riggers to get the bait to the right depth. Bass can be caught <b>in</b> <b>shallower</b> depths.|$|R
