25|$|In early March of that year, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima {{came from}} the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to {{administer}} their own series of brain exams on Genie. Audiometry tests confirmed that she had regular hearing in both ears, but {{on a series of}} <b>dichotic</b> listening tests Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a hemispherectomy as an adult. When they gave her monaural tests for both language and non-language sounds she answered with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language <b>dichotic</b> listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain only being reversed in dominance for language.|$|E
25|$|Three {{important}} experimental paradigms {{have evolved}} in the search to find evidence for the speech mode hypothesis. These are <b>dichotic</b> listening, categorical perception, and duplex perception. Through the research in these categories {{it has been found}} that there may not be a specific speech mode but instead one for auditory codes that require complicated auditory processing. Also it seems that modularity is learned in perceptual systems. Despite this the evidence and counter-evidence for the speech mode hypothesis is still unclear and needs further research.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the fall}} of 1971, under the {{direction}} of Curtiss, Victoria Fromkin, and Stephen Krashen—who was then also one of Fromkin's graduate students—linguists continued to administer regular <b>dichotic</b> listening tests to Genie until 1973. Their results consistently corroborated the initial findings of Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima. Researchers therefore concluded that Genie was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain, and definitively ruled out the possibility that Genie's language lateralization was only reversed. Due to the lack of physiological problems with Genie's left hemisphere, they believed abnormal neurological activity in her left hemisphere—which they speculated came from her atrophied language center—blocked all language reception in her right ear but did not obstruct non-language sounds.|$|E
2500|$|Auditory {{processing}} disorder can be developmental or acquired. It {{may result}} from ear infections, head injuries or neurodevelopmental delays that affect processing of auditory information. This can include problems with: [...] "...sound localization and lateralization (see also binaural fusion); auditory discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of audition, including temporal integration, temporal discrimination (e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and temporal masking; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals (including <b>dichotic</b> listening); and auditory performance with degraded acoustic signals".|$|E
5000|$|A {{clinical}} diagnosis of amblyaudia is made following <b>dichotic</b> listening testing {{as part of}} an auditory processing evaluation. Clinicians are advised to use newly developed <b>dichotic</b> listening tests that provide normative cut-off scores for the listener's dominant and non-dominant ears. These are the Randomized <b>Dichotic</b> Digits Test [...] and the <b>Dichotic</b> Words Test. Older <b>dichotic</b> listening tests that provide normative information for the right and left ears can be used to supplement these two tests for support of the diagnosis (...) [...] If performance across two or more <b>dichotic</b> listening tests is normal in the dominant ear and significantly below normal in the non-dominant ear, a diagnosis of amblyaudia can be made. The diagnosis can also be made if performance in both ears is below normal but performance in the non-dominant ear is significantly poorer, thereby resulting in an abnormally large asymmetry between the two ears. Amblyaudia is emerging as a distinct subtype of auditory processing disorder (APD).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichotic</b> {{listening}} {{tests can}} be used to measure the efficacy of the attentional control of cochlear inhibition and the inter-hemispheric transfer of auditory information. <b>Dichotic</b> listening performance typically increases (and the right-ear advantage decreases) with the development of the Corpus Callosum (CC), peaking before the fourth decade. During middle age and older the auditory system ages, the CC reduces in size, and <b>dichotic</b> listening becomes worse, primarily in the left ear. <b>Dichotic</b> listening tests typically involve two different auditory stimuli (usually speech) presented simultaneously, one to each ear, using a set of headphones. Participants are asked to attend to one or (in a divided-attention test) both of the messages.|$|E
50|$|An {{emotional}} {{version of}} the <b>dichotic</b> listening task was developed. In this version individuals listen to the same word in each ear but they hear it in either a surprised, happy, sad, angry, or neutral tone. Participants are then asked to press a button indicating what tone they heard. Usually <b>dichotic</b> listening tests show a right-ear advantage for speech sounds. Right-ear/left-hemisphere advantage is expected, because of evidence from Broca's area and Wernicke's area, which are both located in the left hemisphere in most of right-handed people. In contrast, the left ear (and therefore the right hemisphere) is often better at processing nonlinguistic material. The data from the emotional <b>dichotic</b> listening task {{is consistent with the}} other studies, because participants tend to have more correct responses to their left ear than to the right. It {{is important to note that}} the emotional <b>dichotic</b> listening task is seemingly harder for the participants than the phonemic <b>dichotic</b> listening task. Meaning more incorrect responses were submitted by individuals.|$|E

50|$|When {{continuous}} {{white noise}} (with a frequency content below about 2000 Hz) is presented by headphones {{to the left}} and right ear of a listener, and given a particular interaural phase relationship between the left and right ear signals, a sensation of pitch (psychophysics) may be observed. Thus, stimulation of either ear alone gives rise to the sensation of white noise only, but stimulation of both ears together produces pitch. Therefore, as a special case of <b>dichotic</b> listening, such a pitch is called <b>dichotic</b> pitch or binaural pitch. Generally, a <b>dichotic</b> pitch is perceived somewhere in the head amidst the noisy sound filling the binaural space. To be more specific, the <b>dichotic</b> pitch is characterized by three perceptual properties: pitch value, timbre, and in-head position (lateralization). Experiments on <b>dichotic</b> pitch were motivated {{in the context of the}} study of pitch in general, and of the binaural system in particular, relevant for sound localization and separation of competing sound sources (see cocktail party effect). In the past, various configurations of <b>dichotic</b> pitch were studied and several auditory models were developed. The great challenge for psychophysical and physiological acoustics is to predict both the pitch value and pitch-image position in one model.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s Donald Shankweiler and Michael Studdert-Kennedy of Haskins Laboratories used a <b>dichotic</b> {{listening}} technique (presenting different nonsense syllables) {{to demonstrate the}} dissociation of phonetic (speech) and auditory (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning {{is an integral part}} of language and is typically processed in the left cerebral hemisphere. A <b>dichotic</b> listening performance advantage for one ear is interpreted as indicating a processing advantage in the contralateral hemisphere. In another example, Sidtis (1981) found that healthy adults have a left-ear advantage on a <b>dichotic</b> pitch recognition experiment. He interpreted this result as indicating right-hemisphere dominance for pitch discrimination.|$|E
5000|$|According to the CISG's (Canadian Inter-Organizational Steering Group for Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology) 'Canadian Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorder in Children and Adults: Assessment and Intervention' (December 2012), [...] "In 1961, Doreen Kimura {{proposed}} {{a theory that}} would attempt to explain <b>dichotic</b> listening abilities in humans. As a testament to her theory, her views on <b>dichotic</b> processing of auditory information recently celebrated a 50th anniversary." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dichotic</b> {{listening}} {{tests can}} also be used as lateralized speech assessment task. Neuropsychologists have used this test to explore the role of singular neuroanatomical structures in speech perception and language asymmetry. For example, Hugdahl et al. (2003), investigated <b>dichotic</b> listening performance and frontal lobe function in left and right lesioned frontal lobe nonaphasiac patients compared to healthy controls. In the study, all groups were exposed to 36 <b>dichotic</b> trials with pairs of CV syllables and each patient was asked to state which syllable he or she heard best. As expected, the right lesioned patients showed a right ear advantage like the healthy control group but the left hemisphere lesioned patients displayed impairment when compared to both the right lesioned patients and control group. From this study, researchers concluded [...] "dichotic listening as into a neuronal circuitry which also involves the frontal lobes, and that this may be a critical aspect of speech perception." [...] Similarly, Westerhausen and Hugdahl (2008) [...] analyzed the role of the corpus callosum in <b>dichotic</b> listening and speech perception. After reviewing many studies, it was concluded that [...] "...dichotic listening should be considered a test of functional inter-hemispheric interaction and connectivity, besides being a test of lateralized temporal lobe language function" [...] and [...] "the corpus callosum is critically involved in the top-down attentional control of <b>dichotic</b> listening performance, thus having a critical role in auditory laterality." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichotic</b> {{listening}} is {{an experimental}} procedure used {{to demonstrate the}} selective filtering of auditory inputs, and was primarily utilized by Broadbent. In a <b>dichotic</b> listening task, participants {{would be asked to}} wear a set of headphones and attend to information presented to both ears (two channels), or a single ear (one channel) while disregarding anything presented in the opposite channel. Upon completion of a listening task, participants would then be asked to recall any details noticed about the unattended channel.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} involving the <b>dichotic</b> listening test, {{with emphasis on}} subtypes of schizophrenia (particularly paranoid and undifferentiated), demonstrated that Paranoid schizophrenia have the largest left hemisphere advantage - with undifferentiated schizophrenics (where psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met) having the smallest. The application of the <b>dichotic</b> listening test helped to further the beliefs that preserved left hemisphere processing {{is a product of}} paranoid schizophrenia, and in contrast, that the left hemisphere's lack of activity is a symptom of undifferentiated schizophrenia. In 1994, M. F. Green tried to relate “the functional integration of the left hemisphere in hallucinating and nonhallucinating psychotic patients” using a <b>dichotic</b> listening study. The study showed that auditory hallucinations are connected to a malfunction in the left hemisphere of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{it would}} become {{apparent}} that binaural hearing, whether <b>dichotic</b> or diotic, is {{the means by which}} the geolocation and direction of a sound is determined.|$|E

5000|$|Some data {{gathered}} from <b>dichotic</b> listening test experiments {{suggests that there}} is possibly a small-population sex difference in perceptual and auditory asymmetries and language laterality. According to Voyer (2011), [...] "Dichotic listening tasks produced homogenous effect sizes regardless of task type (verbal, non-verbal), reflecting a significant sex difference in the magnitude of laterality effects, with men obtaining larger laterality effects than women. However, the authors discuss numerous limiting factors ranging from publication bias to small effect size. Furthermore, as discussed in [...] "Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused <b>dichotic</b> words test," [...] women reported more [...] "intrusions" [...] of words presented to the uncued ear than men when presented with exogenous cues in the Fused <b>Dichotic</b> Word Task which suggests two possibilities: 1) Women experience more difficulty paying attention to the cued word than men and/or 2) regardless of the cue, women spread their attention evenly as opposed to men who may possibly focus in more intently on exogenous cues.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dichotic</b> Listening is a {{psychological}} test {{commonly used to}} investigate selective attention within the auditory system and is a subtopic of cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Specifically, it is [...] "used as a behavioral test for hemispheric lateralization of speech sound perception." [...] During a standard <b>dichotic</b> listening test, a participant is presented with two different auditory stimuli simultaneously (usually speech). The different stimuli are directed into different ears over headphones. Participants are asked {{to pay attention to}} {{one or both of the}} stimuli. Later, they are asked about the content of either the message they were asked to attend to or the message that they were not told to listen to.|$|E
50|$|Attention is the {{selection}} of important information. The human mind is bombarded with millions of stimuli and it must {{have a way of}} deciding which of this information to process. Attention is sometimes seen as a spotlight, meaning one can only shine the light on a particular set of information. Experiments that support this metaphor include the <b>dichotic</b> listening task (Cherry, 1957) and studies of inattentional blindness (Mack and Rock, 1998). In the <b>dichotic</b> listening task, subjects are bombarded with two different messages, one in each ear, and told to focus on only one of the messages. At the end of the experiment, when asked about the content of the unattended message, subjects cannot report it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dichotic</b> {{listening}} {{can also}} be used to test the hemispheric asymmetry of language processing. In the early 60s, Doreen Kimura reported that <b>dichotic</b> verbal stimuli (specifically spoken numerals) presented to a participant produced a right ear advantage (REA). She attributed the right-ear advantage [...] "to the localization of speech and language processing in the so-called dominant left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex." [...] According to her study, this phenomenon was related to the structure of the auditory nerves and the left-sided dominance for language processing. It is important to note that REA doesn't apply to non-speech sounds. In [...] "Hemispheric Specialization for Speech Perception," [...] by Studdert-Kennedy and Shankweiler (1970) examine <b>dichotic</b> listening of CVC syllable pairs. The six stop consonants (b, d, g, p, t, k) are paired with the six vowels and a variation in the initial and final consonants are analyzed. REA is the strongest when the sound of the initial and final consonants differ and it is the weakest when solely the vowel is changed. Asbjornsen and Bryden (1996) state that [...] "many researchers have chosen to use CV syllable pairs, usually consisting of the six stop consonants paired with the vowel \a\. Over the years, a large amount of data has been generated using such material." ...|$|E
50|$|During his experimentation, Broadbent {{made use}} of the <b>dichotic</b> {{listening}} test. This task has been used extensively to test numerous psychological phenonomena such as response times of specific auditory information, as well as testing for attended and unattended information presented to a participant. It is widely used {{as it is a}} non-invasive method of testing cerebral dominance. In a typical <b>dichotic</b> listening paradigm, the participant is wearing a headphone, in which a different auditory stimuli are presented to each ear at the same time, and the participant's attention is divided. The participant is instructed to attend (attended channel) the information coming from one of the ear pieces and neglect (unattended channel) the information presented from the other. Following the listening period, the participants are tested on whether they recall any information presented in the unattended channel.|$|E

5000|$|The {{manipulation}} of voice onset time (VOT) during <b>dichotic</b> listening tests have given many insights regarding brain function. To date, {{the most common}} design is the utilisation of four VOT conditions: short-long pairs (SL), where a Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllable with a short VOT is presented to the left ear and a CV syllable with a long VOT is presented to the right ear, as well as long-short (LS), short-short (SS) and long-long (LL) pairs. In 2006, Rimol, Eichele, and Hugdahl [...] first reported that in healthy adults SL pairs elicit the largest REA while, in fact, LS pairs elicit a significant left ear advantage (LEA). A study of children 5-8 years old has shown a developmental trajectory whereby long VOTs gradually start to dominate over short VOTs when LS pairs are being presented under <b>dichotic</b> conditions. Converging evidence from studies of attentional modulation of the VOT effect shows that around age 9 children lack the adult-like cognitive flexibility required to exert top-down control over stimulus-driven bottom-up processes. Arciuli et al.(2010) further demonstrated {{that this kind of}} cognitive flexibility is a predictor of proficiency with complex tasks such as reading.|$|E
50|$|The term 'binaural' {{literally}} signifies 'to hear {{with two}} ears', and {{was introduced in}} 1859 to signify the practice of listening to the same sound through both ears, or to two discrete sounds, one through each ear. It was not until 1916 that Carl Stumpf (1848-1936), a German philosopher and psychologist, distinguished between <b>dichotic</b> listening, which refers to the stimulation of each ear with a different stimulus, and diotic listening, the simultaneous stimulation of both ears with the same stimulus.|$|E
5000|$|Amblyaudia (amblyos- blunt; audia-hearing) {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Dr. Deborah Moncrieff from the University of Pittsburgh to {{characterize}} a specific pattern of performance from <b>dichotic</b> listening tests. <b>Dichotic</b> listening tests are widely used to assess individuals for binaural integration, a type of auditory processing skill. During the tests, individuals are asked to identify different words presented simultaneously to the two ears. Normal listeners can identify the words fairly well and show a small {{difference between the two}} ears with one ear slightly dominant over the other. For the majority of listeners, this small difference is referred to as a [...] "right-ear advantage" [...] because their right ear performs slightly better than their left ear. But some normal individuals produce a [...] "left-ear advantage" [...] during <b>dichotic</b> tests and others perform at equal levels in the two ears. Amblyaudia is diagnosed when the scores from the two ears are significantly different with the individual's dominant ear score much higher than the score in the non-dominant ear Researchers interested in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of amblyaudia consider it to be a brain based hearing disorder that may be inherited or that may result from auditory deprivation during critical periods of brain development. Individuals with amblyaudia have normal hearing sensitivity (in other words they hear soft sounds) but have difficulty hearing in noisy environments like restaurants or classrooms. Even in quiet environments, individuals with amblyaudia may fail to understand what they are hearing, especially if the information is new or complicated. Amblyaudia can be conceptualized as the auditory analog of the better known central visual disorder amblyopia. The term “lazy ear” has been used to describe amblyaudia although it is currently not known whether it stems from deficits in the auditory periphery (middle ear or cochlea) or {{from other parts of the}} auditory system in the brain, or both. A characteristic of amblyaudia is suppression of activity in the non-dominant auditory pathway by activity in the dominant pathway which may be genetically determined and which could also be exacerbated by conditions throughout early development.|$|E

50|$|Older {{research}} involved {{looking at}} the limits of people performing simultaneous tasks like reading stories, while listening and writing something else, or listening to two separate messages through different ears (i.e., <b>dichotic</b> listening). Generally, classical research into attention investigated the ability of people to learn new information when there were multiple tasks to be performed, or to probe the limits of our perception (c.f. Donald Broadbent). There is also older literature on people's performance on multiple tasks performed simultaneously, such as driving a car while tuning a radio or driving while telephoning.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that PC based spatial hearing {{training}} software can help {{some of the children}} identified as failing to develop their spatial hearing skills (perhaps because of frequent bouts of otitis media with effusion). Further research is needed to discover if a similar approach would help those over 60 to recover the loss of their spatial hearing. One such study showed that <b>dichotic</b> test scores for the left ear improved with daily training. Related research into the plasticity of white-matter (see Lövdén et al. for example) suggests some recovery may be possible.|$|E
50|$|The speech {{shadowing}} {{technique is}} used in <b>dichotic</b> listening tests. During these tests, subjects are presented with two different messages, one in their right ear and one in their left. The participants are often asked to focus on {{only one of the}} different messages and this is where the speech shadowing technique is used. Participants are instructed to shadow the attended message by repeating it out loud with a delay of a few seconds between hearing a word and repeating the word. The speech shadowing technique is significant for these experiments because it ensures that the subjects are attending to the desired message.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electrophysiologic}} study {{demonstrated that}} children with amblyaudia (referred to then as a [...] "left-ear deficit") were less able to process information from their non-dominant ears when competing information is arriving at their dominant ears. The N400-P800 complex showed a strong and highly correlated response from the dominant and non-dominant ears among normal children while the response from children with amblyaudia was uncorrelated and indicated an inability to separate information arriving at the non-dominant ear from the information arriving at the dominant ear. The same children also produced weaker fMRI responses from their non-dominant left ears when processing <b>dichotic</b> material in the scanner.|$|E
