5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of <b>display</b> <b>equipment,</b> such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are {{the reasons for the}} use of polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and <b>display</b> <b>equipment.</b> For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{displays}} {{were driven}} by the Coordinated <b>Display</b> <b>Equipment</b> (CDE). Inside the CDE, a [...] telephone stepper switch was used to periodically connect {{to each of the}} displays in turn. Depending on which button was being held down on the input console at that time, the switch connected the trackball to one of 96 pairs of servomotors connected to potentiometers that were used a storage mechanism. The output of the potentiometers was sent back to the input consoles, creating a [...] "blip" [...] on the screen that matched the underlying radar data but did not move, allowing the operators to choose which blips required updating. [...] In the prototype versions, there were only three input stations allowing a total of 24 targets to be tracked, but they could also read up to eight more inputs from external sources, nominally data from other ships. A production version would have more input stations to fully expand the capabilities of the CDE.|$|E
