5|$|A church, or <b>group,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{unable to}} fully {{provide for the}} {{religious}} needs of its members is called a mission. Missions are dependent on a congregation which is administered by a minister. A group of several congregations with their missions form a district. The Church in each nation is divided into multiple districts. In Mexico, several districts form together into five jurisdictions that act as legal entities.|$|E
5|$|Tamil dialects are {{differentiated}} by the phonological {{changes and}} sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCE–7th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct from the}} dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, Moors and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.|$|E
5|$|The Crimson Blades, under direct {{orders of}} Cardinal Batistum, are a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} Cardinal's Knights of the Cross, in charge of seeking heretics and quelling cults.

Under orders of the Cardinal, he pursues Sydney with a small army in his command and his captains: Samantha, Duane, Grissom, Tieger and Neesa.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} elements are often {{displayed in a}} periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with {{the same number of}} valence electrons form a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases.|$|E

5|$|The oldest <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} {{foundation}} of the Pentecostal Holiness Church originated in 1895 as the Fire-Baptized Holiness Association in Olmitz, Iowa. The leader, Benjamin H. Irwin of Lincoln, Nebraska, a former Baptist preacher, organized the body into the national Fire-Baptized Holiness Church at Anderson, South Carolina, in August 1898. By this time, Irwin's group had organized churches in eight U. S. states and two Canadian provinces.|$|E

5|$|Within Inocybe, it {{is placed}} within the {{subgenus}} Inosperma, and was previously categorised within the section Rimosae. However, phylogenetic analysis {{has shown that}} section Rimosae as formerly defined does not form a monophyletic <b>group</b> (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> descended from a single exclusive ancestor), and former Rimosae species are better grouped into two clades, Maculata and Rimosae. Phylogenetic analysis has placed the species in the clade Maculata. Other species joining I.cookei in the Maculata clade include I.maculata, I.quietiodor, I.rhodiola, I.adaequata, and I.erubescens.|$|E
5|$|Four Albatrellus {{species were}} {{included}} in a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of the order Russulales published in 2003. Based on their ribosomal DNA sequences, the four form a clade, or monophyletic <b>group</b> (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> they derived from a single ancestor). Of the four tested species, A.ovinus was most closely related to A.subrubescens. The polypore Wrightoporia lenta (type species of the genus Wrightoporia) occurred on a single branch basal to the albatrellus clade, implying that it shared with the Albatrellus species a common ancestor from which both were descended. In a more recent (2010) molecular analysis by Canadian mycologist Serge Audet aimed at clarifying relationships among species formerly placed in Scutiger, A.subrubescens grouped in a clade with A.ovinus and A.citrinus. According to Audet, these species, in addition to A.avellaneus and A.piceiphilus, are the constituents of an Albatrellus with limits defined by molecular genetics. Other Albatrellus species were transferred to segregate genera: A.fletti and A.confluens to Albatrellopsis; A.caeruleoporus and A.yasudae to Neoalbatrellus; A.pes-caprae and A.ellisii to an amended Scutiger.|$|E
