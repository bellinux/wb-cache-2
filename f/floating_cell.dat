We lose patience, and extricate ourselves from the cushions: the sea air blows keenly by, as we stand leaning on the roof of the <b>floating</b> <b>cell.</b> In front, nothing to be seen but long canal and level bank; to the west, the tower of Mestre is lowering fast, and behind it there have risen purple shapes, of the color of dead rose-leaves, all round the horizon, feebly defined against the afternoon sky,--the Alps of Bassano. Forward still: the endless canal bends at last, and then breaks into intricate angles about some low bastions, now torn to pieces and staggering in ugly rents towards the water,--the bastions of the fort of Malghera. Another turn, and another perspective of canal; but not interminable. The silver beak cleaves it fast,--it widens: the rank grass of the banks sinks lower, and lower, and at last dies in tawny knots along an expanse of weedy shore. Over it, on the right, but a few years back, we might have seen the lagoon stretching to the horizon, and the warm southern sky bending over Malamocco to the sea. Now we can see nothing but what seems a low and monotonous dock-yard wall, with flat arches to let the tide through it;--this is the railroad bridge, conspicuous above all things. But at the end of those dismal arches, there rises, out of the wide water, a straggling line of low and confused brick buildings, which, but for the many towers which are mingled among them, might be the suburbs of an English manufacturing town. Four or five domes, pale, and apparently at a greater distance, rise over the centre of the line; but the object which first catches the eye is a sullen cloud of black smoke brooding over the northern half of it, and which issues from the belfry of a church.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Our paper {{presents}} the results of several direct ex vitro rooting and acclimation experiments in blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), thornless cultivar 'Loch Ness'. The plant material consisted of plants propagated on Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium with 0. 5 mg/l benzyladenine (BAP). The shoots excised from the plantlets were rooted directly ex vitro in various substrates: floating perlite, plastic sponge inserted in <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> trays, rockwool in plastic trays covered with transparent lids, as well as potting mixes available commercially: Florasol, Sol Vit G, Florimo. These experimental variants yielded good results regarding the rooting and acclimation percentages.

40|$|The {{effect of}} human cell {{immersed}} in culture liquid under a micro-gravity environment has been investigated. The study {{is based on}} the numerical simulation of the configuration of human cell affected by the time dependent variation of gravity acceleration ranging from 10 (exp - 3) to 2 g(sub o) (g(sub o) = 9. 81 m/s(exp 2)) in 15 seconds. Both the free <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> and the cell contacted to the upper and lower inclined walls imposed by the time-dependent reduced gravity acceleration are considered in this study. The results show that the cell configuration changes from spherical to horizontally elongated ellipsoid for both the free <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> and the cell sitting on the lower inclined wall while the cell configuration varies from spherical to vertically elongated ellipsoid for the cell hanging to the upper inclined wall when the gravity acceleration increases. Experimental observations, carried out of human cells exposed to the variation of gravity levels, show that the results of experimental observations agree exactly with the theoretical model computation described in this paper. These results sre significant for humans exposed to the micro-gravity environment...|$|E
40|$|The mos {{protooncogene}} encodes a serine/threonine kinase {{and is a}} key regulator of oocyte meiotic maturation. After acute infedion of Swiss 3 T 3 {{cells with}} virus containing the v-mos oncogene, cells expressing high levels of v-Mos round up and detach from the monolayer (<b>floating</b> <b>cells),</b> while cells that remain attached express 1 0 -fold lower levels of v-Mos and are transformed. The <b>floating</b> <b>cells</b> are growth arrested with their chromosomes partially condensed {{in the absence of}} histone Hi kinase adivity, while mitogen-adivated protein kinase adivity is very high. Collectively, these properties are similar to properties observed in maturing oocytes between meiosis I and II. In v-mos-transformed cell populations, mitogen-adivated protein kinase adivity is also elevated, correlating with the degree of morphological transformation and the level of Mos expression. Moreover, phosphoprotein modifications specific for M are found in both the <b>floating</b> <b>cells</b> and in v-mos-transformed cells, regardless of their cell cycle stage. One explanation for both morphological transformation and the phenotypes of the <b>floating</b> <b>cells</b> is that Mos imposes a meiotic program on different stages of the somatic cell cycle. The extent of this meiotic phenotype is proportional to the level of v-Mos expression. These results suggest that both morphological transformation and the phenotypes of the <b>floating</b> <b>cells</b> induced by Mos in Swiss 3 T 3 cells are related to its normal adivities during oocyte maturation...|$|R

40|$|Cells {{from the}} human teratocarcinoma line NTera- 2 can be induced to terminally {{differentiate}} into postmitotic neurons when treated with retinoic acid. However, this differentiation process is rather time consuming as it takes between 42 and 54 days.

The introduction of a proliferation step as free <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> spheres cuts the total time needed to obtain high yields of purified NT- 2 neurons to about 24 - 28 days. The cells obtained show neuronal morphology and migrate to form ganglion-like cell conglomerates.

Moreover, the generation of neurons in sphere cultures induced immunoreactivity to the ELAV-like neuronal RNA-binding proteins HuC/D, which have been implicated in mechanisms of nerve cell differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is a {{specific}} subtype of lung cancer presenting as highly metastatic disease with extremely poor prognosis. Despite responding initially well to chemo- or radiotherapy, SCLC almost invariably relapses and develops resistance to chemotherapy. This is suspected {{to be related to}} tumor cell subpopulations with different characteristics resembling stem cells.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{proposed}} project {{was to develop a}} novel fine coal separator having the ability to clean 1 mm x 0 size coal in a single processing unit. The novel fine coal separator, named as EG(Enhanced Gravity) <b>Float</b> <b>Cell,</b> utilizes a centrifugal field to clean 1 mm x 250 micron size coal, whereas a flotation environment to clean minus 250 micron coal size fraction. Unlike a conventional enhanced gravity concentrator, which rotates to produce a centrifugal field requiring more energy, the EG <b>Float</b> <b>Cell</b> is fed with a tangential feed slurry to generate an enhanced gravity field without any rotating part. A prototype EG <b>Float</b> <b>Cell</b> unit having a maximum diameter of 60 cm (24 inch) was fabricated during the first-half of the project period followed by a series of exploratory tests to make suitable design modification.

The cytotoxicities of Melphalan, hexamethylmelamine and seven derivatives, and daunorubicin were measured on P 388 D 1 mouse macrophage-like cell line, RC mouse renal carcinoma cell line, and B 16 mouse melanoma cell lines. Growth inhibition was determined after one hour as well as after continuous (48 hours) exposure to drugs.

The addition of mitomycin C to the culture media 3 h after inoculation resulted in increased amounts of Salmonella toxin in culture filtrates but had the reverse effect on cell sonic extracts. Our data suggested that the increased amounts of Salmonella toxin culture filtrates caused by mitomycin C were due to cell lysis, resulting in the release of intracellular toxin, rather than to an increase in the synthesis of Salmonella toxin. The biological activity of Salmonella toxin was heat labile at 100 degrees C. The antigenic structure of the toxin appeared to remain intact after exposure to temperatures as high as 100 degrees C but was altered somewhat when the toxin was subjected to autoclaving. The toxin had an isoelectric point in the pH range from 4. 3 to 4. 8 and an estimated molecular weight which appeared to be more than 110, 000. With the exception of the range for its isoelectric point, its molecular weight, and its low concentration in filtrates and sonic extracts, Salmonella toxin was very similar in biological and antigenic characteristics to cholera toxin.

40|$|Embryonic neural {{progenitors}} {{isolated from}} the mouse striatal germinal zone grow in vitro as <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates called neurospheres, which, upon adhesion, can be induced to differentiate into the three main cell types of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), that is, astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes. To study the possible role of connexins and junctional communication during differentiation of neural progenitors, we assessed cell-to-cell communication by microinjecting Lucifer Yellow into neurospheres at various times after adhesion. Cells located in neurospheres were strongly coupled, regardless of the differentiation time. Microinjections performed on the cell layers formed by differentiated cells migrating out of the neurosphere established that only astrocytes were coupled. These observations suggest the existence of at least three distinct communication compartments: coupled proliferating cells located in the sphere, uncoupled cells undergoing neuronal or oligodendrocytic differentiation and coupled differentiating astrocytes. A blockade of junctional communication by 18 -β-glycyrrhetinic acid (βGA) reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, the viability of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells. This effect appeared to be specific, inasmuch as it was reversible and that cell survival was not affected {{in the presence of the}} inactive analog glycyrrhyzic acid. Addition of βGA to adherent neurospheres also decreased cell density and altered the morphology of differentiated cells. Cx 43 was strongly expressed in either undifferentiated or differentiated neurospheres, where it was found both within the sphere and in astrocytes, the two cell populations that were dye coupled. Western blot analysis further showed that Cx 43 phosphorylation was strongly increased in adherent neurospheres, suggesting a post-translational regulation during differentiation. These results point to a major role of cell-to-cell communication and Cx 43 during the differentiation of neural progenitor cells in vitro. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The in vitro differentiation of hPSC-RPE is still poorly understood and current differentiation protocols rely on spontaneous differentiation on fibroblast feeder cells or as <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates in suspension. The fibroblast feeder cells may have an inductive effect on the hPSC-RPE differentiation, providing variable signals mimicking the extraocular mesenchyme that directs the differentiation in vivo. The effect of the commonly used fibroblast feeder cells on the hPSCRPE differentiation was studied by comparing suspension differentiation in standard RPEbasic (no bFGF) medium to RPEbasic medium conditioned with mouse embryonic (mEF-CM) and human foreskin (hFF-CM) fibroblast feeder cells. The fibroblast secreted factors were found to enhance early hPSC-RPE differentiation. The onset of pigmentation was faster in the conditioned media (CM) compared to RPEbasic for both human embryonic (hESC) and induced pluripotent (iPSC) stem cells, with the first pigments appearing around two weeks of differentiation. After four weeks of differentiation, CM conditions consistently contained higher number of pigmented cell aggregates. The ratio of PAX 6 and MITF positive cells was quantified to be clearly higher in the CM conditions, with mEFCM containing most positive cells. The mEF cells were found to secrete low levels of activin A growth factor that is known to regulate eye field differentiation. As RPEbasic was supplemented with corresponding, low level (10 ng/ml) of recombinant human activin A, a clear increase in the hPSC-RPE differentiation was achieved. Thus, inductive effect provided by feeder cells was at least partially driven by activin A and could be substituted with {{a low level of}} recombinant growth factor in contrasts to previously reported much higher concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Hearing {{loss and}} {{vestibular}} dysfunction are inner ear disease states {{that arise from}} an array of diverse etiologies that interfere with mechanosensory hair cell function, including: congenital syndromes, noise-induced trauma, ototoxic drugs, and aging. The investigation of normal inner ear development and the pathological aberrations that cause inner ear disease has been previously advanced through formation of an easily generated, scalable, accurate in vitro model system that readily facilitates experimental applications. This model utilizes a 3 D <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> culture protocol which guides differentiation of stem cell aggregates into inner ear organoids, which are vesicles containing a sensory epithelium with functioning mechanosensory hair cells. Inner ear organoid formation enables studying the effects of modulating the signaling pathways that guide developing inner ear structure and function. The Notch signaling pathway heavily influences {{the formation of the}} inner ear through two major mechanisms: lateral induction of sensory progenitor cells and lateral inhibition to determine which of those progenitors differentiate into mechanosensory hair cells. The effects of inhibiting Notch signaling within the inner ear organoid system were explored through application of the ɣ-secretase inhibitor MDL 28170 (MDL) at a concentration of 25 μM on day 8 of organoid culture. Aggregates were harvested on day 32, fixed, sectioned, and stained according to a standard immunohistochemistry protocol. Sections were stained for the mechanosensory hair cell markers Myosin 7 a (Myo 7 a) and Sox 2. MDL-treated aggregates demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the total number of vesicles and the number of vesicles containing hair cells compared to control aggregates. In contrast to control aggregates which demonstrated two distinct organoid variants (protruding and embedded), MDL-treated aggregates only formed the embedded variant. Differences in the expression pattern of Sox 2, which is also a marker of stemness and neural progenitor cells were also noted between the two conditions. MDL-treated aggregates demonstrated regions of ‘ectopic’ Sox 2 expression whereas Sox 2 expression in control aggregates was consistently expressed within Myo 7 a+ regions...|$|E

Previous studies demonstrated that lung cancer with <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> clusters in histology {{is more likely}} to develop metastasis. In the present study, we investigated whether cancer cells in long-term, three-dimensional low attachment cultures acquire high metastatic potential; these cells were then used to examine the mechanisms underlying metastasis. Two KRAS-mutated adenocarcinoma cell lines (A 549 and H 441) were cultured and selected on ultra-low attachment culture dishes, and the resulting cells were defined as FL (for floating) sublines. Cancer cells were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice via an intracardiac injection, and metastasis was evaluated using luciferase-based imaging and histopathology. In vitro cell growth (in attachment or suspension cultures), migration, and invasion were assayed. A whole genomic analysis was performed to identify key molecular alterations in FL sublines. Upon detachment on low-binding dishes, parental cells initially formed rounded spheroids with limited growth activity. However, over time in cultures, cells gradually formed smaller spheroids that grew slowly, and, after 3 - 4 months, we obtained FL sublines that regained prominent growth potential in suspension cultures. On ordinary dishes, FL cells reattached and exhibited a more spindle-shaped morphology than parental cells. No marked differences were observed in cell growth with attachment, migration, or invasion between FL sublines and parental cell lines; however, FL cells exhibited markedly increased growth potential under suspended conditions in vitro and stronger metastatic abilities in vivo. A genomic analysis identified epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and c-Myc amplification in A 549 -FL and H 441 -FL cells, respectively, as candidate mechanisms for metastasis. The growth potential of FL cells was markedly inhibited by lentiviral ZEB 1 knockdown in A 549 -FL cells and by the inhibition of c-Myc through lentiviral knockdown or the pharmacological inhibitor JQ 1 in H 441 -FL cells. Long-term three-dimensional low attachment cultures may become a useful method for investigating the mechanisms underlying metastasis mediated by decreased cell-substratum adhesion...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{fundamental}} understanding of microbial physiology is based on laboratory studies of freely suspended cells. While these studies have been essential for our foundational understanding of the genetics, physiology and behavior of microbes, it is now recognized {{that a majority of}} bacterial cells in nature exist in biofilms [1] associated with surfaces or as <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates. In fact, it has recently been proposed that microbial communities originally developed on surfaces, including the first bacterial and archael cells, and that the planktonic cell phenotype evolved as a dispersal mechanism [2]. Hallmarks of cells residing in biofilm communities are increased metabolic efficiency [3] as well as increased resistance to environmental stresses such as desiccation, ultraviolet radiation and oxidative stress [4 – 6]. This correlation has dramatic consequences as residing in aggregates has been shown to confer increased resistance of bacterial cells also to biocides such as antibiotics, disinfectants and detergents [7 – 9]. In addition, once established, these biofilms are able to resist invasion by other organisms and predation by protozoans in nature or host immune cells in the human body [5, 6, 10]. This is especially problematic as it is also recognized that the majority of bacterial infections involve biofilms [11]. The recent explosion of research in the field of biofilm biology has led to an enhanced appreciation for the multicellular aspects of microbiology and has resulted in the general acceptance of a model of the biofilm mode of life. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has become a model organism for the study of biofilms due to its metabolic versatility and variability in its response to environmental signals, which promotes successful colonization of different habitats and growth under varying environmental conditions [12, 13]. This ability is likely a reflection of its large genome, allowing for metabolic plasticity and quick responses to varying stimuli. P. aeruginosa is also a human pathogen that causes infection in burn patients, and is the predominant cause of lung infections and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) [14, 15]. This chapter will address various aspects of biofilm development, dispersal and resistance, and its role in the infection process...|$|E
40|$|New insulin-secreting {{cell lines}} (INS- 1 and INS- 2) were {{established}} from cells isolated from an x-ray-induced rat transplantable insulinoma. The continuous growth of these cells {{was found to}} be dependent on the reducing agent 2 -mercaptoethanol. Removal of this thiol compound caused a 15 -fold drop in total cellular glutathione levels. These cells proliferated slowly (population doubling time about 100 h) and, in general, showed morphological characteristics typical of native beta-cells. Most cells stained positive for insulin and did not react with antibodies against the other islet hormones. The content of immunoreactive insulin was about 8 micrograms/ 10 (6) cells, corresponding to 20 % of the native beta-cell content. These cells synthesized both proinsulin I and II and displayed conversion rates of the two precursor hormones similar to those observed in rat islets. However, glucose failed to stimulate the rate of proinsulin biosynthesis. In static incubations, glucose stimulated insulin secretion from <b>floating</b> <b>cell</b> clusters or from attached cells. Under perifusion conditions, 10 mM but not 1 mM glucose enhanced secretion 2. 2 -fold. In the presence of forskolin and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine, increase of glucose concentration from 2. 8 - 20 mM caused a 4 -fold enhancement of the rate of secretion. Glucose also depolarized INS- 1 cells and raised the concentration of cytosolic Ca 2 +. This suggests that glucose is still capable of eliciting part of the ionic events at the plasma membrane, which leads to insulin secretion. The structural and functional characteristics of INS- 1 cells remained unchanged over a period of 2 yr (about 80 passages). Although INS- 2 cells have not been fully characterized, their insulin content was similar to that of INS- 1 cells and they also remain partially sensitive to glucose as a secretagogue. INS- 1 cells retain beta-cell surface antigens, as revealed by reactivity with the antigangloside monoclonal antibodies R 2 D 6 and A 2 B 5. These findings indicate that INS- 1 cells have remained stable and retain a high degree of differentiation which should make them a suitable model for studying various aspects of beta-cell function...|$|E

Most primary production in the ocean is performed by microscopic organisms, the phytoplankton.|$|R
50|$|Chemotherapy (typically {{the agent}} Mitomycin C) may be infused {{directly}} into the abdominal cavity after cytoreductive surgery to kill remaining microscopic cancerous tumors and free <b>floating</b> <b>cells.</b> The heated chemotherapy (HIPEC) is perfused throughout the abdominal cavity {{for an hour or}} two as the last step in the surgery, or ports are installed to allow circulation and/or drainage of the chemicals for one to five days after surgery, known as early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC). EPIC is may be given in multiple cycles for several months after surgery.|$|R
30|$|The {{resultant}} {{culture was}} centrifuged (8000 rpm, 15 min) {{to separate the}} cells, the centrifugal supernatant filtered through a 0.22 μm filter to remove <b>floating</b> <b>cells</b> and the supernatant assayed for protein yield. Protein content was measured using a modified Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) and plate read at 595 nm in a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) (Ma et al. 2013). A standard curve was created using bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein, and protein concentration of samples was determined by comparison to the standard curve.|$|R
