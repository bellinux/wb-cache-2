Although scientists have made great progress in developing this animal as a model for numerous areas of biomedical research, genomic resources for the baboon, such as a quality annotated genome, are still lacking. To this end, we characterized the baboon kidney transcriptome using high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify genes, gene variants, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion-deletion polymorphisms (InDels), cellular functions, and key pathways in the baboon kidney to provide a <b>genomic</b> <b>resource</b> for the baboon. Analysis of our sequencing data revealed 45, 499 high-confidence SNPs and 29, 813 InDels comparing baboon cDNA sequences with the human hg 18 reference assembly and identified 35, 900 cDNAs in the baboon kidney, including 35, 150 transcripts representing 15, 369 genic genes that are novel for the baboon.

A total of 37, 969 contigs (57 %) possessed significant similarity with proteins in the non-redundant database.
