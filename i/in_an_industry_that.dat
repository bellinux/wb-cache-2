500|$|In a 2010 {{article for}} PopMatters, music writer Tyler Lewis said that neo soul has been {{received}} with much controversy: [...] "Given the way black {{music has been}} named by (usually) outsiders ever since the blues, {{the reaction to the}} name by artists who ostensibly fit into the 'neo-soul' category represents a wonderful example of black self-determination <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> is still defiantly wedded to narrow definitions and images of black folks." [...] Jason Anderson of CBC News compares the etymology of neo soul to that of [...] "new wave" [...] and comments: [...] "As imperfect as the term may be, neo-soul is still an effective tag to describe the mix of chic modernity and time-honoured tradition that distinguished the genre's best examples. Neo-soul artists tried to look both backward and forward, acting in the belief that a continuum might exist." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> addition, <b>a</b> reverse {{takeover}} is {{less susceptible}} to market conditions. Conventional IPOs are risky for companies to undertake because the deal relies on market conditions, over which senior management has little control.

If <b>a</b> company <b>in</b> registration participates <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that's</b> making unfavorable headlines, investors may shy away from the deal. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> reverse takeover, since the deal rests solely between those controlling the public and private companies, market conditions have little bearing on the situation.|$|R

According to author Diane Negra, Cher was presented in the beginning of her career as a product of male creativity; Cher remembers, [...] "It was a time when girl singers were patted on the head for being good and told not to think".

500|$|During Greenfield's premiership, Alberta's major {{non-agricultural}} {{industry was}} coal mining, {{and the industry}} was not prospering. [...] Production was more than 50% greater than demand, and {{fewer than half of}} the province's mines were profitable. [...] The industry as a whole was earning a profit of less than one cent per ton of coal. [...] Miners' wages had more than doubled (in nominal terms) between 1909 and 1920 but had barely held their own against the wartime inflation. In the 1920s mine owners began to roll them back. [...] Besides the low wages, miners were unsatisfied with working conditions <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> saw more than 3,300 workplace accidents per year. [...] The results had been labour militancy and violence. [...] A general strike in the industry in 1920 had seen strikers assault strikebreakers, throw them off their bicycles, and throw rocks through the windows of buses. [...] Police were used to aid the strikebreakers and had been sometimes attacked as well. One constable was partially paralyzed from the beating he received. [...] Provincial police commissioner W.C. Bryan was warned against inspecting one strike site in a note reading [...] "You spoilt the strike, and if you go...you will be killed." [...] He went anyway, and was greeted by an ambush in which three bullets were fired into his car, missing him.|$|E
