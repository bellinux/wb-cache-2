30|$|The models {{developed}} {{here have}} quantified much previous knowledge about intra-stem variation in MFA. Visualisations of the two-dimensional patterns in MFA highlight {{the issue of}} juvenile wood (corewood) in radiata pine, which {{in addition to having}} high MFA also has low wood density and high spiral grain angle (Burdon et al. [2004]; Cown [1992]). Solid timber cut from this part of the tree will inevitably have low stiffness because of low density and high MFA, and a high propensity to twist because of high spiral grain (Cown et al. [2010]), so will be unsuitable for many appearance and structural applications. It is clear from this and other studies that high microfibril angle is a characteristic feature of the juvenile core of radiata pine and many conifers, and it is adversely affected by increased growth rates (Dumbrell and McGrath [2000]; Herman et al. [1999]; Sarén et al. [2004]; Watt et al. [2011]). The impact of the presence of juvenile wood is exacerbated by the positive relationship between growth rate and MFA. This presents a challenge since silviculture in New Zealand has traditionally favoured rapid diameter growth – so not only is the core larger, but its properties are poorer. However, if increasing site productivity is the main goal of forest management there are options for increasing overall volume while restraining individual stem growth. Unfortunately, {{it is very difficult to}} restrict the size of the juvenile core and the overall proportion of juvenile wood through spacing, except at the extremes (West [1997]), but more conservative thinning may give more uniform <b>final</b> <b>crops</b> with better average stem form, smaller branches and less radial variation in wood properties. Silvicultural influences on the distributions of internal wood properties were not examined in this study, but analysis of data from replicated silvicultural trials has shown that tree spacing does have a significant influence on MFA (Lasserre et al. [2009]; Watt et al. [2011]). Therefore, while increased stand density may not reduce the size of the juvenile wood zone and the overall proportion of juvenile wood, it may improve the properties of the wood found in the first 10 - 15 growth rings from the pith.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{literature}} {{review of the}} free-growth system, which may have potential for the rehabilitation of some poorly-performing pole-stage broadleaf stands. It involves releasing of a selected number of good quality stems from crown competition {{as a basis for}} the <b>final</b> <b>crop.</b> Generally, only stems with crowns adjacent to the potential <b>final</b> <b>crop</b> trees are removed. The aim is to increase diameter growth of the selected stems and thereby shorten the rotation length needed to achieve a given diameter. The treatment may result in a greater incidence of epicormic shoots, particularly in oak (Quercus spp.). To maintain stem quality, epicormics may need to be removed, which may make the free-growth system uneconomic. There is, however, some evidence to believe that {{this may not be the}} case. In addition, the free-growth system may also be applicable in species less prone to epicormics, such as ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.).

40|$|In Australian {{sugarcane}} crops, {{growth in}} terms of radiation use efficiency (RUE) can appear to slow down well before <b>final</b> <b>crops</b> are harvested, despite conditions that are considered favourable for growth. In order to assess the extent and cause of this reduced growth phenomenon (RGP), 14 experiments conducted in Australia were examined. From these experiments, 34 treatments were selected where nutrients and water {{were likely to be}} non-limiting and consequently the yields obtained were likely to be limited only by temperature and radiation. Radiation use efficiency is defined as the measured amount of net biomass accumulated above ground per unit radiation intercepted. Accumulated biomass may have been lost through loss of stalks. In almost half of the treatments RUE significantly declined between approximately 223 and 665 days after crop start. The high incidence of RGP found in the analyses (a) challenges the previously held assumption that a constant value of RUE can be used to adequately describe biomass accumulation in sugarcane as a function of cumulative radiation interception and (b) suggests that relatively low growth rates during the later phases of the cropping season are frequently experienced throughout the Australian sugar industry. Reduced growth phenomenon resulted in actual biomass at final harvest being on average 21 % less than potential yield, compared with 5 % in crops that did not display a slowdown in growth. Mean maximum RUE in the plant crop was greater than in ratoon crops, at 1. 37 and 1. 19 g MJ− 1, respectively. As there was no effect of location, cultivar, crop duration, ratoon crop class or fumigation treatment on RUE for the periods either before or after the onset of reduced growth, {{it would appear that the}} value of RUE is predominantly influenced by crop class. Despite the differences in RUE between the two crop classes, RGP occurred at a similar frequency in both plant and ratoon crops. In order to gain a greater mechanistic understanding of the factors likely to be associated with the onset of the RGP, the relative time of lodging, specific leaf nitrogen (SLN), number of stalks and seasonal temperature were all considered individually. Whilst declining SLN and increasing stalk loss were associated with reductions in growth during the later periods of crop growth, it is likely that lodging also contributed to the widespread slowdown in biomass accumulation, whereas photosynthetic stress, as a result of extreme temperatures, did not play a substantive role in reducing growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these studies is to {{determine}} the effect of different production systems (Aeroponic (AP), Deep flow (DF), Nutrition film technique (NFT) and Bark) on production of first generation (prebasic) potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) minitubers with different cultivars (Russet Burbank, Rua, Kenebec, Atlantic and Diésrée). Prebasic tubers usually multiplied in a greenhouse in a bark medium. Replacing the bark based system by a highly intensive aeroponic system is viable. The aeroponic system significantly produced higher tuber numbers per plant and produced a higher percentage (82 %) of 1 - 2 g size tuber than other systems evaluated. In aeroponic and deep flow systems, the time to tuberization is higher. When tuberization is delayed, stolons grow continuously in the deep flow and aeroponic systems. In hydroponic systems a developing stolons did not encounter sufficient mechanical resistance to limit growth, they grew extremely vigorously and very wide of diameter (1. 92 - 2. 42 mm). When roots and stolons filled the aeroponic and deep flow containers some root rustication occurred then tubers were initiated. Acid treatment efficiently synchronised tuberization in the aeroponic systems, tubers were visible four days after acid treatment. Optimum acid treatment depends on the specific cultivar or stage of stolon development. Rua produced the highest yield per plant and highest tuber number per plant. The pH and treatment time significantly affected the tuber number per plant. Acid treatment at pH 3. 5 produced the highest tuber number (19. 8) per plant. Minitubers show a dormant period immediately after they are harvested. Application of GA is a useful method to break minituber dormancy. Fifty percentage of the GA treated tubers sprouted within 20 days after treatment, while untreated control took 37 days. Overall, sprouting was highest for 100 ppm treatment, but was not significantly different from 30 ppm. The highest and lowest sprouting cultivars were Russet Burbank and Atlantic respectively. Potato cuttings can be propagated in an aeroponic system. Application of IBA treatment at 0. 1 to 0. 3 % significantly induced root formation and root growth. About 80 % of the IBA treated cuttings rooted and produced longer roots than untreated cuttings. From these studies we found the aeroponic system to be suitable for minituber production as well as the propagation of potato cuttings.
