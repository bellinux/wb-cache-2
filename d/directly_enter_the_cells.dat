30|$|While Pd NPs {{have usually}} been {{considered}} a toxic group, {{they have not been}} widely studied and they have only recently been recognised as important antibacterial NPs [41]. It is generally believed that the small size (1.5 – 3  nm) of Pd NPs contributes toward their antibacterial attributes, possibly facilitating transport to cells through bacteria or algal cell wall pores, which have diameters ranging from 5 to 20  nm [82, 83]. In our study, Pd NPs of 1.5  nm mean size could directly enter algal cell walls and cause damage when releasing ions in the cell membrane and chloroplasts (Chl fluorescence, PS II, ROS). There is clear evidence that soluble Pd salt was able to enter P. subcapitata cells, where Pd precipitates were mostly formed in chloroplasts [78] which could increase generation of ROS and thus oxidative stress. It was also reported that Pd NPs (127  nm z-average hydrodynamic size) were less toxic toward P. subcapitata than soluble Pd salt [69] maybe due to larger size of NPs that could not <b>directly</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells,</b> while Pd salt could. On the other hand, Pd NPs could form hetero-aggregates with algal cells leading to physical entrapment. Surprisingly, the entrapment is not inevitably lethal because the cells could recover their growth after transfer to clean medium [69].|$|E
40|$|When {{fibroblasts}} contract collagen matrices, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> activate a Ca(2 +) -dependent cyclic AMP signaling pathway. We {{have found}} that contraction also stimulates uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran molecules from the medium. Our results indicate that fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran <b>enters</b> <b>directly</b> into <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cytoplasm through 3 - to 5 -nm plasma membrane passages. These passages, which reseal in less than 5 s {{in the presence of}} divalent cations, also are likely sites of Ca 2 + uptake during contraction and the first step in contraction-activated cyclic AMP signaling. The formation of plasma membrane passages during fibroblast contraction may reflect a general cellular response to rapid mechanical changes...|$|R

40|$|Materials {{that can}} {{interact}} with and transit membranes without toxic bilayer disruption or poration are {{of great interest}} in the drug delivery field. These materials can presumably bypass endocytosis to <b>directly</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cytosol through <b>the</b> plasma membrane, which is often the desired site of action for therapeutics, thereby avoiding potential and likely cargo degradation if trapped in endosomes. Alternatively, if these materials are endocytosed, they are often able to escape the endosome by interacting with and transiting the endosomal membrane, and moving into the cytosol. Here, we present a unique membrane-interacting, amphiphilic gold nanoparticle (amph-AuNP) system, which we show can interact with, embed within, and even penetrate through multiple adjacent lipid bilayers without evidence of membrane disruption or poration. By virtue of these key properties, we also present these amph-AuNPs as effective carriers for therapeutic molecules. Using a one-step reaction, we synthesized small - 2 - 4 nm core size amph- AuNPs with an amphiphilic ligand shell comprised {{of one or two}} alkanethiols. Each amph-AuNP is coated by a mixture of long-chain mercaptoundecanesulfonate (MUS) terminated by a water-soluble sulfonate group, and in some cases, short-chain hydrophobic octanethiol (OT). First, we describe our efforts to adapt and develop a method to synthesize giant multilamellar model membranes to study amph-NP-membrane interaction in a well-defined setting. We show that giant membranes can be synthesized and fine-tuned by varying lipid composition and buffer salt concentration, can be fluorescently labeled with lipid tracers, and can be analyzed robustly with confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Second, we describe our systematic analysis of amph- AuNP and membrane characteristics that influence mechanisms of NP association with bilayers. We study effects of general membrane properties such as electrostatics and phase that govern NP-membrane interactions, and found that NP penetration of bilayers was blocked under conditions where strong electrostatic repulsion or gel-phase lipids were employed. We further studied effects of AuNP core diameter, surface charge, and surface hydrophobicity on NP-membrane interactions at the nanoscale. We found that MUS particles with an optimal gold core size - 2 - 3 nm in diameter and MUS:OT particles of a broader size range were capable of inducing hemifusion between liposomal membranes, while MUS:OT 2 : 1 particles of intermediate hydrophobicity were capable of spontaneously aggregating within the bilayer of vesicles to form Janus egg-like morphologies. Third, we built on these NP membrane-embedding properties to explore and characterize NP-embedding in erythrocyte membranes, with particular attention to the glycocalyx and membrane fluidity, for the future application of constructing therapeutic erythrocyte 'pharmacytes' in situ. Finally, we describe work in engineering amph-AuNPs to carry short antigenic peptide cargoes for in vivo vaccine applications, where immunization experiments have shown much promise for antigen-ferrying amph-AuNPs in eliciting robust and long-lasting CD 8 + T cell responses. by Prabhani U.

40|$|The {{peptides}} {{derived from}} the heptad repeat (HRP) of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} coronavirus (SCoV) spike protein (sHRPs) are known to inhibit SCoV infection, yet their efficacies are fairly low. Recently our research showed that some proteases facilitated SCoV's direct entry from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface, resulting in a more efficient infection than the previously known infection via endosomal entry. To compare the inhibitory effect of the sHRP in each pathway, we selected two sHRPs, which showed a strong inhibitory effect on the interaction of two heptad repeats in a rapid and virus-free in vitro assay system. We found that they efficiently inhibited SCoV infection of <b>the</b> protease-mediated <b>cell</b> surface pathway but had little effect on the endosomal pathway. This finding suggests that sHRPs may effectively prevent infection in the lungs, where SCoV infection could be enhanced by proteases produced in this organ. This is the first observation that HRP exhibits different effects on virus that takes the endosomal pathway and virus that <b>enters</b> <b>directly</b> from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The times {{required}} for a steady rate of miniature end-plate potential discharge to be reached in response to changes in extracellular [K+], [Na+], and [Ca ++] have been measured. In the presence of 15 mrs KCI, Ca ++ raises and Na + lowers the steady-state mepp frequency; but the depressive effect on Na + is not specific: Li + can replace Na + to a large extent. Mepp frequency {{has been found to}} depend on the ratio of [Ca,++]/[Nao+]. It is assumed that in the steady state, intracellular sodium will change when extracellular sodium is changed.

40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) {{is known}} to take an endosomal pathway for cell entry; however, it is thought to <b>enter</b> <b>directly</b> from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface when a receptor-bound virion spike (S) protein is affected by trypsin, which induces cleavage of the S protein and activates its fusion potential. This suggests that SARS-CoV bearing a cleaved form of the S protein can <b>enter</b> <b>cells</b> <b>directly</b> from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface without trypsin treatment. To explore this possibility, we introduced a furin-like cleavage sequence in the S protein at amino acids 798 to 801 {{and found that the}} mutated S protein was cleaved and induced cell fusion without trypsin treatment when expressed on <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface. Furthermore, a pseudotype virus bearing a cleaved S protein was revealed to infect <b>cells</b> in <b>the</b> presence of a lysosomotropic agent as well as a protease inhibitor, both of which are known to block SARS-CoV infection via an endosome, whereas the infection of pseudotypes with an uncleaved, wild-type S protein was blocked by these agents. A heptad repeat peptide, derived from a SARS-CoV S protein that {{is known to}} efficiently block infections from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface, blocked <b>the</b> infection by a pseudotype with a cleaved S protein but not that with an uncleaved S protein.
