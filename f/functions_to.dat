5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning.

As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also <b>functions</b> <b>to</b> control the insect immune response.

Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the mechanical and electrical reliability of the Mark 3 Fat Man bomb, but this work was disrupted by the Crossroads tests.|$|E

The metabolism of NAD has remained an area of intense research into the 21st century, with interest being heightened after the discovery of the NAD-dependent protein deacetylases called sirtuins in 2000, by Shin-ichiro Imai and coworkers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|$|E

Hornet maintenance at Williamtown was the responsibility of No.481 Wing, which had evolved from No.481 Squadron. One of No.77 Squadron's Hornets crashed near Rockhampton, Queensland, on 19May 1992, killing the pilot and his passenger, a defence scientist. In September that year, the squadron undertook a proving exercise over Halifax Bay in Far North Queensland, when four of its Hornets—refuelled in flight on the round trip from Williamtown by a Boeing 707 tanker—became the first jet aircraft in Australia to drop aerial mines. No.481 Wing was reorganised as No.402 Wing in July 1996; the latter transferred its <b>functions</b> <b>to</b> No.81 Wing's flying squadrons in July 1998.|$|E
