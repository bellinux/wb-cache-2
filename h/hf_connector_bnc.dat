5000|$|Gender changers {{are used}} for RS-232C ports in either the {{original}} DB-25 or the IBM AT DE-9 format. They are also used when extending any sort of cable that normally has plugs on both ends (rather than a socket on one and plug on the other), however {{in this case it}} is usually called just an [...] "extender", such as with F <b>connectors,</b> <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors,</b> and various RJ connectors used in telephony and computer networking.|$|R

5000|$|The {{coupling}} system is usually made of two bayonet ramps machined on the external {{side of the}} receptacle connector and 2 stainless steel studs mounted inside the plug connector’s coupling nut. Several classes of electrical cable connectors, including audio, video, and data cables use bayonet <b>connectors.</b> Examples include <b>BNC,</b> C, and ST <b>connectors.</b> (The <b>BNC</b> <b>connector</b> is not exactly as described in this article, as the male, not female, connector has the slots and spring.) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{threaded}} {{version of}} the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector,</b> known as the TNC connector (for Threaded Neill-Concelman) is also available. It has superior performance to the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector</b> at microwave frequencies.|$|R

Its product range includes XLR-type connectors, speakON connectors, powerCON <b>connectors,</b> patch bays, <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> and special connectors for industrial applications.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{relatively}} large {{compared to the}} DE 15, and some attention is needed to make sure each cable goes to the correct socket. Additionally, extra signal lines such as +5 V, DDC, and DDC2 are not supported using <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Video (particularly HD video signals) and DS3 Telco {{central office}} {{applications}} primarily use 75 ohm <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors,</b> whereas 50 ohm connectors {{are used for}} data and RF. Many VHF receivers used 75 ohm antenna inputs, so they often used 75 ohm <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|DS3 uses 75ohm {{coaxial cable}} and <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|In many applications, UHF {{connectors}} {{were replaced}} by designs that have a more uniform surge impedance over {{the length of the}} connector, such as the N <b>connector</b> and the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector.</b> UHF connectors are still widely used in amateur radio, Citizens Band radio, and marine VHF radio applications.|$|R
50|$|In home applications, the {{composite}} video signal is typically connected using an RCA connector (phono plug), normally yellow. It is often accompanied with red and white (or black) connectors for right and left audio channels respectively. <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> and higher quality coaxial cable are often used in professional television studios and post-production applications. <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> were also used for composite video connections on early home VCRs, often accompanied by either phono connectors or a 5-pin DIN connector for audio. The <b>BNC</b> <b>connector,</b> in turn post dated the PL-259 connector which featured on first generation VCRs.|$|R

50|$|Internally, the Naim design {{approach}} {{can be seen by}} their use of materials - the semiconductors, heavy toroidal transformers, their obsessive attention to earthing, screening and isolation from electronic and mechanical interference, through to their preference for XLR connector, DIN <b>connector</b> and the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector</b> for phono (as opposed to the RCA connector used by almost all other manufacturers).|$|R
50|$|Smaller {{versions}} of the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector,</b> called Mini <b>BNC</b> and High Density BNC (HD BNC), are manufactured by Amphenol. While retaining the electrical characteristics of the original specification, they have smaller footprints giving a higher packing density on circuit boards and equipment backplanes. These connectors have true 75 ohm impedance making them suitable for HD video applications.|$|R

5000|$|RX signals may be input via a front <b>BNC</b> <b>{{connector}}</b> or a rear UHF SO-239 connector (Yaesu {{calls it}} a type [...] "M" [...] connector) using a relay on the PA unit.

50|$|Before SCART was introduced, TVs did {{not offer}} a {{standardised}} way of inputting signals other than RF antenna connectors, and these differed between countries. Assuming other connectors even existed, devices made by various companies could have different and incompatible standards. For example, a domestic VCR could output a composite video signal through a German-originated DIN-style connector, an American-originated RCA connector, an SO239 <b>connector</b> or a <b>BNC</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|R

50|$|Twin BNC (also {{known as}} twinax) {{connectors}} {{use the same}} bayonet latching shell as an ordinary <b>BNC</b> <b>connector</b> but contain two independent contact points (one male and one female), allowing the connection of a 78 ohm or 95 ohm shielded differential pair such as RG-108A. They can operate up to 100 MHz and 100 volts. They cannot mate with ordinary <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors.</b> An abbreviation for twinax connectors has been BNO (Sühner).|$|R

50|$|The <b>BNC</b> <b>connector</b> is {{used for}} {{composite}} video on commercial video devices. Consumer electronics devices with RCA connector jacks {{can be used with}} BNC-only commercial video equipment by inserting an adapter. <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> were commonly used on 10base2 thin Ethernet network cables and network cards. BNC connections can also be found in recording studios. Digital recording equipment uses the connection for synchronization of various components via the transmission of word clock timing signals.|$|R
5000|$|The TNC (Threaded Neill-Concelman) {{connector}} is a threaded {{version of}} the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector.</b> The connector has a 50 Ω impedance and operates best in the 0 - 11 GHz frequency spectrum.

50|$|The 7-16 DIN {{connector}} or 7/16 (seven and sixteen millimeter DIN) is a 50 Ω threaded RF connector used to join coaxial cables. It {{is among}} the most widely used high power RF connectors in cellular network antenna systems. Originally popular in Europe, it has gained widespread use in the USA and elsewhere. It is {{not to be confused with}} the similar-sounding EIA flange adaptors which are referred to by the outer diameter in fractions of an inch.The 7-16 DIN connector out performs other non-flange options, such as N <b>connectors</b> or <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors,</b> when it comes to interference and intermodulation rejection or higher power handling at RF frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Crimp {{connections}} are used typically to fix <b>connectors,</b> such as <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors,</b> to coaxial cables quickly, {{as an alternative}} to soldered connections. Typically the male connector is crimp-fitted to a cable, and the female attached, often using soldered connections, to a panel on equipment. A special power or manual tool is used to fit the connector. Wire strippers which strip outer jacket, shield braid, and inner insulation to the correct lengths in one operation are used to prepare the cable for crimping.|$|R
50|$|Triaxial (also {{known as}} triax) {{connectors}} are a variant on BNC that carry a signal and guard {{as well as}} ground conductor. These are used in sensitive electronic measurement systems. Early triaxial connectors were designed with just an extra inner conductor, but later triaxial connectors also include a three-lug arrangement to rule out an accidental forced mating with a <b>BNC</b> <b>connector.</b> Adaptors exist to allow some interconnection possibilities between triaxial and <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors.</b> The triaxial may also {{be known as a}} Trompeter connection.|$|R
50|$|RG-58 {{cable is}} often used as a generic carrier of signals in laboratories, {{combined}} with <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> that are common on test and measurement equipment such as oscilloscopes.|$|R

50|$|While {{working at}} Hazeltine Corporation, Dr. Salati was awarded United States patent #2,540,012 {{which was the}} basis for what is now {{commonly}} known as the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector.</b> The patent for Electrical Connector was filed May 19, 1945, and issued January 30, 1951. BNC is an acronym for Bayonet Neill-Concelman. The <b>BNC</b> <b>connector</b> is still in common use for coaxial cables that carry high frequency currents between pieces of electronics and communications equipment. Canadian patent #487446 was also awarded to Dr. Salati for this invention on October 21, 1952.|$|R
50|$|Composite {{monitors}} usually use RCA jacks or <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> {{for video}} input. Earlier equipment (1970s) often used UHF connectors. Typically simple composite monitors give a picture inferior to other interfaces.|$|R
