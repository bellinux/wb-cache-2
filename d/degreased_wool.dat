The effects of different factors including pH from 2. 0 to 4. 5, time from 4 h to 24 h, temperature from 20 °C to 40 °C, concentration of Cr（III）from 0. 343 g/L to 2. 185 g/L were investigated by single factor and static experiment. The adsorption of Cr（III）includes chemical and physical processes, the wool of WAW mainly depends on physical adsorption, the wool of SKW and the wool of SWW are mainly suported by chemical adsorption. The results showed that each step of treatment to wool can increases its adsorption capacity obviously and the maximum absorption capacity of swelling wool, <b>degreased</b> <b>wool,</b> washed wool reached 13. 4 mg/g, 9. 76 mg/g, 4. 22 mg/g respectively under pH 4. 5, 30 °C, the concentration of Cr（III ） 2. 185 g/L conditions absorb 12 h. The wool will be a promissing biomass adsorbtion meatrials...|$|E
40|$|Wool scoured in {{tap water}} with no special {{degreasing}} and containing a balanced humidity responding to usual laboratory conditions was irradiated by accelerated electron beam {{in the range}} of 0 – 350 [*]kGy dose. Time variations of the wool structure were measured using FTIR, Raman, and EPR spectroscopy. The aim was to determine whether preexposure treatment of the wool, as well as postexposure time, affects the properties of the irradiated wool. Reactive products such as S-sulfonate, cystine monoxide, cystine dioxide, cysteic acid, disulphides, and carboxylates displayed a considerable fluctuation in quantity depending on both the absorbed dose and time. Mutual transformations of S-oxidized products into cysteic acid appeared to be faster than those in dry and <b>degreased</b> <b>wool</b> assuming that the present humidity inside the fibres is decisive as an oxygen source. EPR results indicated a longer lifetime for free radicals induced by lower doses compared with the radicals generated by higher ones. The pattern of the conformational composition of the secondary structure (α-helix, β-sheet, random, and residual conformations) also showed a large variability depending on absorbed dose as well as postexposure time. The most stable secondary structure was observed in nonirradiated wool but even this showed a small but observable change after a longer time, too...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{distribution of}} keratinophilic fungi bas {{been studied in}} the soils surrounding an outdoor swimming pool and in soils of summer pens of hedgehogs. The species isolated were conidial and cleistocarpic Arthroderma uncinatum, Trichohyton terrestre, Chrysosorium keratinophilum, Microsporum cookei and Microsporum gypseum. A correlation between some species and. The numbers of hedgehogs in the pens was seen, due {{to the influence of}} keratin provided by the quills and scales of the hedgehogs. No such relationship was seen at the swimming pool, although conidial A. uncinatum was seen to decrease when the swimming pool was open to the public in the summer. However, this appears to be the normal seasonal occurrence since a similar pattern of distribution in soils collected from outside the swimming pool was seen. The effects of the addition of fungicides to soil upon the isolation of keratinophilic fungi have been studied, using the hair-baiting technique. The general pattern showed an initial fall in percentage colonisation of baits followed by a fairly rapid recovery to give greater colonisation of greasy baits compared with controls, and a return to the same or less than the control on <b>degreased</b> <b>wool.</b> This contrasts with the normal observation that the majority of keratinophilic fungi grow better on degreased than greasy wool. A study of the keratinophilic flora of soils of different pH values and from coastal regions has been made as ground work for the experimental section. The new intake of students living in halls of residence at Nottingham University was studied in relation to tinea pedis over an academic year. The initial level in October 1972 was 9 % by May 1973 it had increased to 24 % but returned to 11 % in October 1973. In addition to any seasonal influence, {{there seemed to be a}} correlation between the sports played by the students and the incidence of tinea pedis. The showers in halls of residence and the University sports centre were thought to be the main points of cross transfer of the infection. In the experimental section, the effects of pH, temperature, fungicides and sea water upon certain keratinophilic fungi have been examined in vitro. Aspects of the nutrition of C. keratinophllum, A. uncinatum and T. terrestre were studied and the most suitable combinations of carbon and nitrogen sources for optimal growth were determined. A study of the competitive saprophytic ability of several dermatophytes was made using various techniques. By use of the fluorescent antibody technique, it was found that A. uncinatum was a good competitive saprophyte in the presence of keratin and can thus be regarded as a true soil inhabitant. Finally, the mating structures of Arthroderma benhamiae, A. tuberculatum, A. uncinatum, Nannizzia cajetani, N. gypsea and N. incurvata were studied using the scanning electron microscope...|$|E
50|$|The pits {{were created}} by {{removing}} soil to create a depression about 12-13 feet (4m) in diameter, breached by a 'spout' and thus forming a 'Q' shape. The pits were dug {{from the end of}} the Middle Ages up to around 1760, the start of the Industrial Revolution. Potash pits were of a similar shape and size, however they were used to make potash for use in coursing or <b>degreasing</b> <b>wool</b> and were once found in sheep rearing areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{quarrying}} {{of building}} stone around Maidstone {{has always been}} important and continues even today. Some of the sandstone is also used in the glass industry. The nearby chalk pits in Burham had been in use {{as long ago as}} the Roman occupation. In the 17th century the Wealden cloth industry reached as far north as the town; for here were deposits of Fuller's earth used for <b>degreasing</b> the <b>wool</b> and, perhaps more importantly, the means of transporting the finished products — the river.|$|R
50|$|The potash pit was a basic stone lined ashery {{in which}} {{hardwoods}} such as birch wood or bracken were burned to produce ashes {{which were then}} placed in a copper cauldron manufactured from strips of copper and boiled together with water and quicklime. The alkaline solution produced by the ashes and added quicklime could be filtered to remove particles and once the required alkalinity was reached fats were added to produce a soft soap for the scouring or <b>degreasing</b> of the <b>wool</b> as a vital step {{in the production of}} wool for spinning into yarn.|$|R
40|$|Publications on roman {{textiles}} {{have described}} the processing of wool in the following operational sequence: shearing, scouring, combing and spinning. As one can exclude large scale spinning of ‘crude’ <b>wool</b> and <b>degreasing</b> makes fibers too dry and tangled to be worked with, {{it seems likely that}} even in the classical world it was common practice to oil wool before combing and spinning. This procedure has been regularly attested from the late Medieval period up to the present day but was first described in detail in a fifteenth century manuscript from Florence. There are however a few clues that might suggest that the oiling of wool was already known and indeed widespread in classical times and that olive oil was in common use for this purpose. Archaeological evidence for a connection between oil and wool would seem to be limited to a site in Cyprus where it is believed that scented oils were produced, amongst other things, to perfume wool. A reference to this technique could be inferred by Homer’s description of the looms in Alcinoo’s palace “dripping with oil”; and on several attic vases there are scenes of women engaged in processing or perhaps more specifically in the oiling of wool. The possibility that the Romans used oil for softening wool seems convincing above all for the number of classical references to the initial <b>degreasing</b> of untreated <b>wool</b> to remove lanolin, {{as well as to the}} degreasing of finished textiles with fuller’s earth, perhaps to remove oil added in the process. Further information may be gleaned from inscribed lead tags that refer to initial washing and degreasing (indicating lana purgata as opposed to lana sucida), perhaps followed by softening (lana mulsa). Confirmation of the antiquity of this missing link in wool to textile processing has clear implications for future archaeological research in the fields both of textiles and the production/distribution of olive oil for industrial use...|$|R
