40|$|International audienceGamma {{radiolysis}} {{was investigated}} on a nuclear grade mixed bed {{ion exchange resin}} and its pure components under different irradiation conditions. Screening designs were performed to identify the factors influencing gas production after their γ-radiolysis and to compare their γ-degradation stability. Only hydrogen and trimethylamine quantities were considered as the response in the experimental designs. The other detected gases and water-soluble products were used to improve the resins degradation. Aerobic irradiation atmosphere decreased the H 2 <b>g</b> <b>production</b> of AmbOH, MB 400, and amines. The water presence increased the H 2 g quantities for AmbH and decreased those for MB 400 resin. Liquid water {{had no effect on}} H 2 <b>g</b> <b>production</b> from AmbOH but was favorable to increased amine production. The H 2 <b>g</b> <b>production</b> of AmbH increased with the absorbed dose that had little effect on the AmbOH resin.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} single and multiple additions of the oligosaccharide elicitors, obtained from alginate and locust bean gum, on penicillin <b>G</b> <b>production</b> and the transcript level of penicillin G biosynthetic genes. Methods and Results: The transcript copy numbers and penicillin G concentration in liquid cultures of Penicillium chrysogenum grown under control and elicited conditions were compared using quantitative PCR and HPLC assay respectively. An increase in the penicillin <b>G</b> <b>production</b> rate and transcript copy numbers {{of the three major}} penicillin G biosynthetic genes pcbAB, pcbC and penDE was observed in the elicited cultures compared to control cultures. The effects were observed to be higher in multiple elicitor added cultures compared to single elicitor supplemented and control cultures. Conclusions: The results show, {{for the first time in}} bioreactor cultures, the enhancement of penicillin G transcript copy number of the penicillin biosynthetic genes using qPCR with a corresponding increase in the penicillin <b>G</b> <b>production</b> upon multiple elicitor addition of two different types of elicitors. Significance and Impact of the Study: Establishment of the effect of multiple elicitor addition on penicillin <b>G</b> <b>production</b> and investigating the role of oligosaccharide elicitors as transcriptional activators has wide spread impact for antibiotic industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{spectrum of}} leishmaniasis {{and control of}} the infection are influenced by the parasite-host relationship. The role of cellular immune responses of the Th 1 type in the protection against disease in experimental and human leishmaniasis is well established. In humans, production of IFN- g is associated with the control of infection in children infected by Leishmania chagasi. In visceral leishmaniasis, an impairment in IFN- <b>g</b> <b>production</b> and high IL- 4 and IL- 10 levels (Th 2 cytokines) are observed in antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Moreover, IL- 12 restores IFN- <b>g</b> <b>production</b> and enhances the cytotoxic response. IL- 10 is the cytokine involved in down-regulation of IFN- <b>g</b> <b>production,</b> since anti-IL- 10 monoclonal antibody (mAb) restores in vitro IFN- <b>g</b> <b>production</b> and lymphoproliferative responses, and IL- 10 abrogates the effect of IL- 12. In cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis, high levels of IFN- g are found in L. amazonensis-stimulated PBMC. However, low or absent IFN- g levels were observed in antigen-stimulated PBMC from 50 % of subjects with less than 60 days of disease (24 ± 26 pg/ml). This response was restored by IL- 12 (308 ± 342 pg/ml) and anti-IL- 10 mAb (380 ± 245 pg/ml) (P g and TNF- a are produced both in cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis. After treatment there is a decrease in TNF- a levels (366 ± 224 pg/ml before treatment vs 142 ± 107 pg/ml after treatment, P = 0. 02). Although production of IFN- g and TNF- a might be involved in the control of parasite multiplication in the early phases of Leishmania infection, these cytokines might also be involved in the tissue damage seen in tegumentary leishmaniasi...|$|E

All P. chrysogenum soil isolates showed remarkable antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis (MTCC- 435) as test strain. Besides this penicillin <b>G</b> <b>production</b> by P. chrysogenum isolates was found with a total positivity from Haridwar (87. 39 %) and Dehradun (89. 78 %).

40|$|Maltohexaose-producing amylase (G 6 -amylase) from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 707 {{predominantly}} produces maltohexaose (G 6) in {{the yield}} of > 30 % {{of the total}} products from short-chain amylose (DP = 17). Our previous crystallographic study showed that G 6 -amylase has nine subsites, from − 6 to + 3, and pointed out {{the importance of the}} indole moiety of Trp 140 in <b>G</b> 6 <b>production.</b> <b>G</b> 6 -amylase has very low levels of hydrolytic activities for oligosaccharides shorter than maltoheptaose. To elucidate the mechanism underlying <b>G</b> 6 <b>production,</b> we determined the crystal structures of the G 6 -amylase complexes with G 6 and maltopentaose (G 5). In the active site of the G 6 -amylase/G 5 complex, G 5 is bound to subsites − 6 to − 2, while G 1 and G 6 are found at subsites + 2 and − 7 to − 2, respectively, in the G 6 -amylase/G 6 complex. In both structures, the glucosyl residue located at subsite − 6 is stacked to the indole moiety of Trp 140 within a distance of 4 Å. The measurement of the activities of the mutant enzymes when Trp 140 was replaced by leucine (W 140 L) or by tyrosine (W 140 Y) showed that the <b>G</b> 6 <b>production</b> from short-chain amylose by W 140 L is lower than that by W 140 Y or wild-type enzyme. The face-to-face short contact between Trp 140 and substrate sugars is suggested to regulate the disposition of the glucosyl residue at subsite − 6 and to govern product specificity for <b>G</b> 6 <b>production...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{apparently}} paradoxical {{role for}} IFN- g in human Chagas' disease was observed when studying {{the pattern of}} cytokine production by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) obtained from two groups of chagasic patients after specific stimulation with Trypanosoma cruzi-derived antigens. The groups studied were 1) patients treated with benznidazole during the acute phase of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and 2) chronically infected untreated patients. In the treated group, higher levels of IFN- g were produced by PBMC from individuals cured after treatment when compared to non-cured patients. In contrast, in the chronically infected group (not treated) higher levels of IFN- g were produced by PBMC from cardiac patients in comparison with asymptomatic (indeterminate) patients. This apparently paradoxical role for IFN- g in human Chagas' disease is discussed in terms of the possibility of a temporal difference in IFN- <b>g</b> <b>production</b> during the initial stages of the infection (acute phase) in {{the presence or absence of}} chemotherapy. The maintenance of an immune response with high levels of IFN- <b>g</b> <b>production</b> during the chronic phase of the infection may favor cure or influence the development of the cardiac form of the diseas...|$|E
