6000|$|... “No,” said Palliser sympathetically. “I {{never go}} into such places except when I want money, as I {{frequently}} do. Still, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> open to you?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tell him. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> I {{can do for}} you, Cousin?" [...] he asked, {{holding the}} cold hand that had been serving him so helpfully.|$|E
60|$|We came {{abreast of}} Southern California, {{abreast of the}} Peninsula of Lower California, abreast of the coast of Mexico; and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no flying fish. Nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> No life moved. As the days went {{by the absence of}} life became almost uncanny.|$|R
6000|$|To this {{he made no}} reply, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> said {{upon the}} subject before the {{carriage}} {{drove up to the}} railway station. [...] "Do not get out, dear," [...] he said, seeing that her eyes had been filled with tears. [...] "It is not worth while. God bless you, my child! You will be up in London I hope in a fortnight, and we must try to make the house a little less dull for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He put {{the roses}} in his breast {{and they walked}} on for a little while, slowly and silently, under the umbrageous trees. Then he asked her, in a voice of cheerful kindness, <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that she would say to him as her friend and her father's friend, many years older than herself; <b>was</b> <b>there</b> any trust she would repose in him, any service she would ask of him, any little aid to her {{happiness}} that she could give him the lasting gratification of believing {{it was in his}} power to render? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{did well}} to steer for here at once; but I am {{inclined}} {{to believe that the}} enemy will move very soon. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to be said?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{that road}} {{the next one}} leaves in about an hour. I will have the best men I know of waiting at the depot. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to be done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter Ruff," [...] he said, [...] "you're {{a clever}} scoundrel, but you've earned your five hundred guineas. Hang it, you're welcome to them! <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> I {{can do for}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lydia, {{after some}} consideration, {{put down her}} pen and said, [...] "I shall not enjoy riding if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> left undone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{he wants}} very much, {{how could he}} let me know?' mused Gillian. 'Oh, I see! What time are you at the works?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} my purse," [...] she said, [...] "and Chloe has got some food. I don't think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> worth {{taking in the}} house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{are seeing}} him {{at any time and}} feel at a loss for {{something}} to say, perhaps you might mention it. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> I can do for you, Comrade Parker?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor fellow," [...] {{said the}} old lady, her eyes a little dimmed as she spoke, [...] "the fates have not been using you well. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{you want me to}} inquire about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was there}} {{about half an}} hour waiting for father," [...] said Joan, eying him very steadily. [...] "I thought {{that he was in the}} other office. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> I can tell you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have {{collected}} the young lady's belongings, {{so far as}} possible, sir," [...] he remarked. [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> belonging to her, she {{may be able to}} get it later on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{see that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to do, Major. I trust with you that the men will prove faithful; if not, it is a black lookout {{whichever}} way we take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just so, ma'am--and {{relating}} what I knew. I am not aware,' said Mr. Littimer, after a moment's reflection, 'that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> I am {{at present}} out of employment, {{and should be}} happy {{to meet with a}} respectable situation.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George, {{do you see}} {{to getting}} these traps down to the boat. I shall {{be there in a}} quarter of an hour. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that you can think of, or that you want yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the formal}} order to Ben Isaje," [...] he said, [...] "to pay over {{the money to}} this knave. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> Jan?" [...] he {{continued}} excitedly, [...] "a thinner paper?--shaped like a letter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, sir," [...] Godolphin said, with a grim smile. [...] "I {{must really}} {{compliment}} you all on your fertility of resource and invention. And now, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that I {{can do for}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{for us to}} do," [...] said Marilla rather grimly, {{although}} she felt a secret relief. [...] "Anyhow they're not so much trouble as they were [...] . or else we've got used to them. Davy has improved a great deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought, perhaps," [...] Vine said, [...] "you {{might find}} out where she is and go and talk common sense to her. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> we can do, I'd like to, only I hate {{the thought of a}} pretty child like that {{wandering}} about London on such an absurd quest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she begged. [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> really <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> Henry, you {{can send}} up a note, or I dare say we shall meet at the Club to-night. Now, please, both of you go away. I must change my clothes for motoring. In half an hour, Mr. Draconmeyer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has struck}} me," [...] said Kirk meditatively, [...] "that your Aunt Lora, if I {{may make the}} suggestion, is the least bit of what Steve would call a shy-dome. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> she had mentioned?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, ma'am,' said Bitzer, knuckling his {{forehead}} again, {{in return for}} the favour of Mrs. Sparsit's improving conversation. 'Would you wish a little more hot water, ma'am, or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that I could fetch you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can I do {{to comfort}} you most, Joe? I'll send my good Ben {{to help you}} to bed, and will be here myself when the surgeon goes his rounds. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{that would make you}} more easy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's that or go," [...] she said. [...] "There ain't a livin' {{for us on}} {{the farm}} any more, {{and we got to}} do somethin'. If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> I could do! But I've thought it out and thought it out, and I guess <b>there</b> ain't <b>anything</b> I can do but take boarders--if I can get them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Richards flew {{to it all}} in a tremble {{and locked}} it, then pulled down the window-shades and stood frightened, worried, and {{wondering}} if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> she could do toward making herself and the money more safe. She listened awhile for burglars, then surrendered to curiosity, {{and went back to}} the lamp and finished reading the paper: ...|$|R
6000|$|The king {{sent for}} the seven Simons. 'A {{thousand}} thanks to you, my brave fellows,' he cried. 'Take what gold, silver, and precious stones you will out of my treasury.

6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} Noah," [...] went on Oro. [...] "Perhaps he lived after my time and caused some other local deluge. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> you wish to ask me before I leave you that I may study this map writing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In half an hour's time, sir," [...] he said, [...] "I {{shall be}} going on {{business}} to Narrabee, our market-town here. Can I take any letters to the post for you? or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that I {{can do in the}} town?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Lisle {{responded with}} forced quietness, [...] "if it's any relief to you, I'll write to Nasmyth {{the first chance}} I get, asking what he's heard. Now we'll drop the subject. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> of general {{interest}} in your letter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Become a baronet yourself," [...] {{once more}} {{interrupted}} my noble friend, with an evident relief from suspense; for I verily believe he thought I {{was about to}} ask for something better. [...] "Your affair shall be arranged {{by the end of the}} week--and if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> I can do for you, I beg you to name it without reserve." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{terms of}} peace having been read, Elepoo the senior {{commissioner}} paused, expecting something more, and at length said [...] "is that all?" [...] Mr. Morrison enquired of Lieutenant-colonel Malcolm secretary if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> and being answered in the negative, Elepoo immediately {{and with great}} tact closed the negotiation by saying, [...] "all shall be granted—it is settled—it is finished." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] Vane {{agreed with}} a {{significant}} absence of embarrassment. [...] "In this case a good deal depends on the singing--the interpretation, isn't it? The thing's on the border, and I've struck places where they'd have made it gross; but the girl only brought out the mischief. Strikes me she didn't see <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in it" ...|$|R
