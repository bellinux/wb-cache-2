The main factors that encourage migration include: unfavorable economic situation in Ukraine, lack {{of jobs in the}} labor market, low motivation of legal employment and as a result, the problem of adequately paid work. All these factors provide grounds for departure of Ukrainian citizens for employment abroad. <b>External</b> labor <b>migration</b> ? a process of organizing or spontaneously movement of the working population from country to country for economical reasons. As a social phenomenon, <b>external</b> labour <b>migration</b> has positive and negative manifestations. The positive implications include: improving the financial situation of the labor migrants and their family, getting experience abroad, reducing tension on the labor market in Ukraine. The negative implications include: Ukraine lose highly skilled professionals, social orphanhood of migrants children, human traffic. The main objective is to minimize the negative effects and maximizing the positive for the migrants and the Ukrainian society in a whole. The purpose of the state migration policy of Ukraine in the part of labor migration is closer to international standards of migration legislation in this area, ensuring effective management of migration, social and legal protection of migrant workers, and to ensure observance of their rights, freedoms and legitimate interests in accordance with current legislation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to {{disclose}} the migratory threats which are connected with external and mass internal inter-regional migrations, which are caused by the annexation of the Crimea and military aggression in Donbas by Russia. Methodological and practical aspects of improving the management of intensive interstate and inter-regional migratory processes, negative consequences of which threaten national security of the country because of hybrid war in Donbas, illegal migration, worsening of the demographic situation, departure of scientists and specialists abroad are described in the article too. The main strategic objective, which consists of maintenance of state sovereignty, territorial integrity of Ukraine, and also integration in European and migratory space, ensuring close to the world standards of quality and length of life, realization of rights and freedoms of citizens, is formulated. Actions and tasks of the state migratory policy, ways and methods of regulation of <b>external</b> <b>migrations</b> of the population are considered. Principal reasons of <b>external</b> <b>migrations</b> of population are identified and analysed. The inwardly-regional, interregional and intergovernmental migrations of population of Ukraine in the years of its state independence (1991 - 2014) are analyzed in details. The results of analysis showed that migratory activity goes down on inwardly-regional and interregional levels. Also intensity of exchange of population went down between the regions of country. At the same time Ukraine for years state independence through depopulation processes lost 6, 5 million persons, and in the external migratory moving of population of loss made over 1 million persons. The problem of illegal <b>external</b> labour <b>migration</b> is considered. It is noted that illegal migration from Ukraine to the threats to national security in the Law of Ukraine "On the National Security of Ukraine" is not included, and a {{threat to national security}} posed by illegal migration from Ukraine state authorities and management of both central and local underestimated. Attention is accented on that adjusting of migratory processes at the macrolevel must become to the ponderable component of socio-economic policy of the state, and the measures of migratory policy consist of that to obtain organization of migratory space of country and take under effective state control those migratory processes that take place in it.

40|$|CARIM-East is co-financed by the European University Institute and the European Union. Since its {{independence}} in 1991, the Republic of Armenia has faced difficult challenges in its policies and legal framework for labour migration. In {{the last two}} decades many Armenians have left for overseas employment given the socio-economic situation at home. At the same time, Armenia has inspired a certain interest in foreigners who, themselves, have come to work in Armenia. Given these in- and outflows Armenia has experienced a raft of problems with legal regulations. In spite of the topicality of these problems, they have not yet been comprehensively studied. Problems have, to some extent, been touched upon by a number of authors. But the research carried out to date is mainly socio-economic or deals with the policy aspects of labour migration. Legal regulations for internal and <b>external</b> <b>migrations</b> is conditioned by the fact that, as in other areas, a relevant normative basis is a necessary condition for implementing state policy. In the absence thereof, it is impossible to talk about state policy in a given area. This study addresses the legal aspects of labour migration governance in the Republic of Armenia. It analyses the legal framework and institutional mechanisms for internal and <b>external</b> labour <b>migration</b> and examines legal problems related to regulating the in- and outflow of migrant workers. Certain conclusions and recommendations have been made, on the basis of research. These conclusions and recommendations can be used to improve the legal framework with a view to regulating labour migration in Armenia.

Forward emigration rates and immigration flows are adopted to describe the <b>external</b> <b>migrations.</b> The model is used to make consistent multiregional population projections of China at a provincial level. The model is calibrated using the 1982 census data and 1987 one-percent population survey data. Other data sources have also been used to estimate and prepare necessary input data for the multiregional population model. Three sets of multiregional population projections of China at provincial level are made for the period 1987 - 2087. It is found that the national population trend is a combination of various regional population trends. Some regions, such as Zhejiang, will reach their population peak as early as the beginning of the next century while other regions, such as Xinjiang, will face continuous population growth in the first half of the next century.

On the one hand, the HPC Grid hides to users the complexity of the virtual cluster management, but on the other hand, the Virtual Machines (VM) are managed in the execution domain of the node’s resource manager. Hence, local decisions must be done to meet the quality of service required by each VM. Moreover, a user should be able to define a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with strong and soft requirements for a given resource (CPU, disk, network, etc) without detailed knowledge of the hardware configuration of each node. In this work, we present a fine-grain approach for virtualized resource management in HPC nodes. Our approach improves the resource usage in nodes enabled with virtualization by efficiently partitioning and fine-grain management through multiple dimension slotting. We show in preliminary results that the management of single physical resources gives accurate usage information to a local resource manager (LRM). The assignment of resources is improved by adding a virtual partitioning layer for the subsets of physical resources. Relocating and resizing assigned single resources in the LRM scope improves internal migration mechanisms that could potentially reduce the overhead of <b>external</b> <b>migrations...</b>|$|R

50|$|Japanese {{economic}} success {{has led to}} an increase in certain types of <b>external</b> <b>migration.</b> In 1990, about 11 million Japanese went abroad. More than 80 percent of these people traveled as tourists, especially visiting other parts of Asia and North America. However, about 663,100 Japanese were living abroad, approximately 75,000 of whom had permanent foreign residency, more than six times the number who had that status in 1975. More than 200,000 Japanese went abroad in 1990 for extended periods of study, research, or business assignments. As the government and private corporations have stressed internationalization, greater numbers of individuals have been directly affected, decreasing Japan's historically claimed insularity. Despite the benefits of experiencing life abroad, individuals who have lived outside Japan for extended periods often faced problems of discrimination upon their return because others might no longer consider them fully Japanese. By the late 1980s, these problems, particularly the bullying of returnee children in the schools, had become a major public issue both in Japan and in Japanese communities abroad.|$|E

[...] According to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Salvador, which recorded many events, during the high instability of the early 1980s, there were many political killings, many of which were done by the government. Crops were also destroyed which worsen the already unstable economy and farmers who lived off their crops. With the amount of instability increasing in El Salvador, large numbers of internal migration occurred within the country that eventually resulted in the <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> of many people. It must also be noted that the U.S government played a role in these situations. The U.S was supportive of the Salvadoran government during the civil war due to their mutual dislike of the leftist rebel group FMLN (Farabundo Mardi National Liberation Front). However, the U.S State and Justice departments argue that increased violence has only caused the economic hardship to worsen which then gives more people more reason to emigrate. [...] The Reagan administration first refused to classify incoming Salvadoran immigrants as refugees because it believed that they were merely seeking economic prosperity.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how the European Commission incorporated and implemented migration policy {{as part of}} the European Union’s external relations, also known as the <b>external</b> dimension of <b>migration.</b> The focus of the thesis is on the period between the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999, when migration largely came to fall under the Commission’s remit, and the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The study compares how the Commission’s Directorates-General (DGs) involved in the <b>external</b> dimension of <b>migration</b> during this period—Justice, Liberty and Security, External Relations and Development—made sense of the changes introduced to their responsibilities. The thesis proposes that the concept of organisational culture, drawn from organisational sociology, can explain how actors interact with and collectively make sense of their organisational environment. The main argument of the thesis is that each of the DGs possesses an organisational culture based on its members’ shared readings of priorities and the function of their unit. The thesis examines these divergent organisational cultures to gauge how policies are internalised and translated into output. The analysis contributes to the external governance literature, which has theorised the <b>external</b> dimension of <b>migration</b> as a continuation of European integration processes without accounting for internal organisational dynamics. It also leads to reflections on organisational sociology theorising, and the implications of the findings on studies of organisational change and implementation. This thesis is divided into five chapters. The first provides a background for how the Commission came to be involved in migration policy. The second provides a theoretical framework for the study, building on organisational sociology. The remaining chapters empirically analyse the three elements of organisational culture: DG members’ sources of organisational identity, their perceptions and prioritisations of the <b>external</b> dimension of <b>migration,</b> and their reading of the Commission’s implementation practices, focusing on relations with Morocco as a tool for illustrating the latter...|$|R
