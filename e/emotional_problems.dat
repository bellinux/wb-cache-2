A friend told Nicks that Manning could be emotionally fraught, describing an evening they had watched two movies together—The Last King of Scotland and Dancer in the Dark—after which Manning cried for hours. By September 2009 her relationship with Watkins was in trouble; they reconciled for a short time, but it was effectively over.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and <b>emotional</b> <b>problems,</b> is less strong.|$|E

40|$|Background: Childhood <b>emotional</b> and {{behaviour}} <b>problems</b> are antecedents for later psychopathology. This study investigated genetic and environmental influences shaping the longitudinal association between childhood <b>emotional</b> {{and behaviour}} <b>problems</b> and specific PEs. Method: In a community-based twin sample, parents reported on <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems</b> when twins were ages 7 and 12 years. At age 16 years, specific PEs were measured using self-reports and parent reports. Structural equation model-fitting was conducted. Results: Childhood <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems</b> were {{significantly associated with}} paranoia, cognitive disorganisation and parent-rated negative symptoms in adolescence (mean r =. 15 –. 38), {{and to a lesser extent}} with hallucinations, grandiosity and anhedonia (mean r =. 04 -. 12). Genetic influences on childhood <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems</b> explained significant proportions of variance in adolescent paranoia (4 %), cognitive disorganisation (8 %) and parent-rated negative symptoms (3 %). Unique environmental influences on childhood <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems</b> explained ≤ 1 % of variance in PEs. Common environmental influences were only relevant for the relationship between childhood <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems</b> and parent-rated negative symptoms (explaining 28 % of variance) and are partly due to correlated rater effects. Conclusions: Childhood <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems</b> are significantly, if weakly, associated with adolescent PEs. These associations are driven in part by common genetic influences underlying both <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems</b> and PEs. However, psychotic experiences in adolescence are largely influenced by genetic and environmental factors that are independent of general childhood <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems,</b> suggesting they are not merely an extension of childhood <b>emotional</b> and behaviour <b>problems...</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and <b>emotional</b> <b>problems</b> seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to examine the prevalence and predictors of <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> in a general population sample of Moroccan immigrant children aged 4 through 18 living in the Netherlands. In chapter 1, it was described that Moroccan immigrant youth are expected to be at high risk of <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems,</b> as they are over-represented in the population of juvenile delinquents and they increasingly apply for youth assistance. Moreover, Moroccan immigrant youth may have to cope with several risk factors related to migration and culture. An overview was provided of levels of <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> in immigrant youth samples, and factors associated with <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> were lined out. As presented in the first chapter, with this study we aimed to: 1. Determine the prevalence of <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant children and adolescents, and to compare this with the prevalence of <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> in Turkish immigrant and Dutch native children and adolescents. 2. Identify patterns of psychological acculturation in Moroccan immigrant adolescents and adults. 3. Determine the factors associated with <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant youth. a. Examine the relation between acculturation and <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant adolescents. b. Gain insight into the association between parenting and <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant children and adolescents. c. Determine other factors associated with <b>emotional</b> and behavioral <b>problems</b> in Moroccan immigrant adolescents. Children, aged 4 through 18 with at least one parent born in Morocco, were randomly selected from municipal registers of two major cities in the Netherlands, The Hague and Rotterdam. Eight hundred nineteen parents (response rate 73 %); 387 adolescents aged 11 through 18 (response rate 91 %); and 541 teachers (response rate 83 %) participated in the study. Parents and adolescents were interviewed and teachers were sent a questionnaire...|$|R
40|$|Difficulties in peer {{acceptance}} during {{elementary school}} {{have been associated}} with <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems.</b> This study used a randomized controlled intervention design to test whether improvements in peer acceptance mediated reduced rates of <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems</b> in intervention compared to control-group children. A total of 615 elementary school children in the Netherlands were followed annually from kindergarten through second grade. Intervention children showed reductions in <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems,</b> and improved peer acceptance compared to controls. Improved peer acceptance mediated reductions in <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problem</b> development. However, this mediation pathway held only for boys with low receptive vocabulary skills. These results indicate poor peer acceptance as a common underlying factor in <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problem</b> development, particularly for children who are at risk for developing problems...|$|R
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and <b>emotional</b> <b>problems</b> such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of <b>emotional</b> <b>problems.</b> For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Understanding the {{psychological}} reasons underlying children’s <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems</b> can guide appropriate interventions. This study examined <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems</b> in Australian children and unhealthy family {{functioning as a}} psychological factor associated with development of these <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems.</b> Methods: The study utilised stratified surveys conducted by the New South Wales, Ministry of Health, during the years 2005 - 2008. A computer assisted telephone interviewing method was employed. The surveys collected information on demographics, family functioning measured by the General Functioning Scale, and <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems</b> measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Children aged 4 - 15 years (n= 7, 210 children) were included. Logistic regression analyses {{were used for the}} <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problem</b> outcomes. Results: Analyses adjusting for demographics revealed that unhealthy family functioning increased substantially the risks of emotional symptoms (OR = 2. 53; 95 % CI = 1. 36 - 4. 69), peer problems (OR = 6. 26; 95 % CI = 4. 43 - 11. 42), conduct problems (OR = 3. 83; 95 % CI = 1. 88 - 7. 84), and the overall <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems</b> (OR = 5. 06; 95 % CI = 2. 42 - 10. 58). Conclusions: Children from unhealthy family functioning backgrounds have a potential risk factor for <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems.</b> Mental health interventions aiming at improving the quality of parent-child relationships may reduce this potential risk for <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems</b> among the children...|$|R

40|$|We {{profiled}} {{a cohort}} of CSA cases referred for assessment to a specialist child sexual abuse (CSA) centre in a national paediatric hospital in Ireland. Historical and clinical data were drawn from records of 171 cases. The majority of cases were referred by social workers following purposeful disclosure of CSA. Three quarters of the cases were female {{with a mean age}} of 9 years. They were from a wide spectrum of socioeconomic groups and many had suffered a range of family adversities. In most cases, the abuse involved masturbation of the child by the abuser. Almost all of the perpetrators were male {{with a mean age of}} 28 years and in 60 % of cases extrafamilial abuse had occurred. In 23 % of cases, the perpetrator had a history of previous sexual offending. Anxiety was the most common <b>emotional</b> <b>problem</b> before disclosure and after disclosure the most common <b>emotional</b> <b>problem</b> was guilt. Before disclosure school refusal was the most common behavioural problem and after disclosure fighting was the most prevalent behavioural difficulty. The most common factors supporting the credibility of CSA allegations were labile mood, the child's ability to differentiate fact from fantasy and a detailed disclosure of contextual details. More adolescents showed deterioration in schoolwork after disclosure and for more pre school children clinginess following disclosure was a significant <b>emotional</b> <b>problem.</b> More primary school aged children were abused by perpetrators who had abused a number of children. For children abused by such perpetrators, vaginal intercourse was less common. Vaginal intercourse was more common in 6 – 11 -year-old victims and those who were abused on a daily basis. The threat that disclosure posed to the integrity of the family structure was more often a factor hindering disclosure in victims abused by father figures and abused very frequently...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>emotional</b> and {{behavioural}} <b>problems</b> {{are relatively}} common {{in children and}} adolescents, they are rarely {{brought to the attention}} of general practitioners (GPs) or mental health professionals. The main aim of this study was to investigate the process of help-seeking for child and adolescent psychopathology. The contribution of various characteristics of child, family, and broader social context on (1) parents’ need for help for child <b>emotional</b> or behavioural <b>problems,</b> (2) help-seeking in general practice for these problems, (3) identification of child <b>emotional</b> and behavioural <b>problems</b> by the GP, (4) help-seeking in mental health care, and (5) help-seeking from informal sources of care, was investigated.
