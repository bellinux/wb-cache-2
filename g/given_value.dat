5|$|The above {{procedure}} only performs exact matches, {{finding the}} position of a target value. However, due to the ordered nature of sorted arrays, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a <b>given</b> <b>value,</b> its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually <b>given</b> <b>value</b> of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E

25|$|Computer algebra, {{also called}} {{symbolic}} computation or algebraic computation is a scientific area {{that refers to}} the study and development of algorithms and software for manipulating mathematical expressions and other mathematical objects. Although, properly speaking, computer algebra should be a subfield of scientific computing, they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on numerical computation with approximate floating point numbers, while symbolic computation emphasizes exact computation with expressions containing variables that have not any <b>given</b> <b>value</b> and are thus manipulated as symbols (therefore the name of symbolic computation).|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{probability}} distributions can {{be described}} in several ways. The probability density function describes the infinitesimal probability of any <b>given</b> <b>value,</b> and the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by integrating the probability density function over that interval. On the other hand, the cumulative distribution function describes the probability that the random variable is no larger than a given value; the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by taking the difference between the values of the cumulative distribution function at the endpoints of the interval. The cumulative distribution function is the antiderivative of the probability density function provided that the latter function exists.|$|E
25|$|Sentinel node may simplify certain list operations, by {{ensuring}} that the next or previous nodes exist for every element, and that even empty lists {{have at least one}} node. One may also use a sentinel node {{at the end of the}} list, with an appropriate data field, to eliminate some end-of-list tests. For example, when scanning the list looking for a node with a <b>given</b> <b>value</b> x, setting the sentinel's data field to x makes it unnecessary to test for end-of-list inside the loop. Another example is the merging two sorted lists: if their sentinels have data fields set to +∞, the choice of the next output node does not need special handling for empty lists.|$|E

500|$|In 1983 the 17thCGPM {{found that}} {{wavelengths}} from frequency measurements and a <b>given</b> <b>value</b> for {{the speed of}} light are more reproducible than the previous standard. They kept the 1967 definition of second, so the caesium hyperfine frequency would now determine both the second and the metre. To do this, they redefined the metre as: [...] "The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/ of a second." [...] As a result of this definition, the value of {{the speed of light}} in vacuum is exactly [...] and has become a defined constant in the SI system of units. Improved experimental techniques that prior to 1983 would have measured the speed of light, no longer affect the known value of the speed of light in SI units, but instead allow a more precise realization of the metre by more accurately measuring the wavelength of Krypton-86 and other light sources.|$|E
