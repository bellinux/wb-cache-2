He {{does not like}} the strategy to retreat the Bb4 in d6 <b>either,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are too drawish. He recommends the strategy to retreat the bishop in c5, and maintain its position there {{with the help of}} the a7–a5 pawn advance.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses bring {{captured}} prey {{back to the}} den {{where they}} can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share the den with the octopus, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have arrived as scavengers, or because they have survived capture.|$|E
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
50|$|Taken together, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the integration of framing into agenda-setting is <b>either</b> impossible <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are based on different theoretical premises or imprudent because merging the two concepts would result in the loss of our capabilities to explain various media effects.|$|R

Cotterill also found that daughters-in-law didn't find them funny <b>either,</b> largely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> saw that one day they {{could be applied to}} them.|$|R

5|$|Some {{players who}} participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into the NFL Draft, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> hoped to finish their {{education}} or because they were not three years removed from their high school graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. Examples of these players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, but who was taken with the first overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> refused to change their style of play and {{expected}} the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October, SAO Krajina police picked up 53 civilians in Hrvatska Dubica. Most of them were Croats, but there were several Serbs and Muslims by nationality. They were told they were being taken to a meeting, but they were {{detained}} under armed guard in the town's fire station. During the day, eleven people escaped or were released, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were Serbs or because they had Serb relatives. On 21 October, SAO Krajina forces moved 43 detainees from Hrvatska Dubica. The detainees were placed on a bus and told {{that they would be}} taken to Glina and released in a prisoner exchange. However the group, all of them Croats except for two Serbs, were taken to Krečane and killed. In the same period, an additional 24 civilians from villages around Hrvatska Dubica were killed by Serb forces at unknown locations.|$|E
40|$|The {{dilemma of}} free will is that if actions are caused deterministically, then they are not free, {{and if they are}} not caused deterministically then they are not free <b>either</b> <b>because</b> then <b>they</b> happen by chance and are not up to the agent. I propose a {{conception}} {{of free will}} that solves this dilemma. It can be called agent causation but it differs from what Chisholm and others have called s...|$|R

3000|$|... 1 When we have non-hidden terminals, e.g., AP 2 transmits to HDTV, and AP 1 transmits to I 6 only, {{it is not}} {{necessary}} to ZF at the interfered terminals. The absence of the HTs can be regarded as a normal traffic condition in a network, meaning that there is no collision of signals at <b>either</b> client <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are not in the transmission overlapping region. Whenever we have a normal traffic condition, we usually use the standard contention-based DCF.|$|R
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accounts}} about Murrell's {{activities have}} been preserved, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were reported {{on by the}} regional press or because they were passed down in oral tradition. One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent local women were malevolent witches. One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson, {{the wife of the}} Reverend William Atkinson, the vicar of Canewdon. The other was Eliza Lodwick, a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her, while another died accidentally on her property. Locals concerned that these women were witches approached the vicar with their beliefs, but he dismissed them. They subsequently turned to Murrell, asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches. According to claims made in the 1950s by the-then 94-year-old local man Arthur Downes, the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling. However, the vicar intervened, with locals believing that he was doing so to protect his wife. The vicar himself died in March 1847.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} Solar System object can be deduced {{from its}} optical magnitude, its distance, and its albedo. Objects appear bright to Earth {{observers}} <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (albedo) can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the albedo is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over {{as little as a}} hundred days, a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid. It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth.|$|E

50|$|The plaintiffs {{argued that}} sexual {{harassment}} constituted sex discrimination and that Yale University was thus in contravention of Title IX, which stated that educational institutions receiving federal money could not discriminate {{on the basis}} of sex. The District Court upheld this legal view, ruling that, “It is perfectly reasonable to maintain that academic advancement conditioned upon submission to sexual demands constitutes sex discrimination in education.” The Court, however, found that Price had not been sexually propositioned in exchange for better grades. It dismissed the other plaintiffs’ allegations as <b>either</b> moot <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had graduated, or untenable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cancer risk}} caused by BRCA1 and BRCA2 {{mutations}} are inherited in a dominant fashion even though usually only one mutated allele is directly inherited.

A mutated BRCA gene can be inherited from <b>either</b> parent. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> are inherited from the parents, they are classified as hereditary or germline mutations rather than acquired or somatic mutations. Cancer caused by a mutated gene inherited from an individual's parents is a hereditary cancer rather than a sporadic cancer.|$|R

25|$|Child {{slavery is}} also {{considered}} a contemporary form of slavery, although its does come with debate {{as to what}} constitutes child slavery. However, child prostitution is widely considered a form of slavery in which children, mostly from South East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, “are sold by their parents <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are destitute, have too many mouths to feed, or are simply greedy”. On the other hand, in some cases of child prostitution, when parents give their children up to traffickers, they are deceived into believing that their child will earn good money, get an education, or learn a trade.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different keyboard layouts arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting, computer programming, or other purposes. The United States keyboard layout is used as default in the currently most popular operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The common QWERTY-based layout was designed early in the era of mechanical typewriters, so its ergonomics were compromised to allow for the mechanical limitations of the typewriter.|$|E
25|$|Although several {{witnesses}} came to {{the conclusion}} that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect. Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, <b>either</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since this is the only way that most land carnivores have to catch their prey.|$|E
