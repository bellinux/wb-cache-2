5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant.

As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children.

5|$|Stories also link Bahuchara {{to gender}} {{variance}} after she becomes divine. One myth concerns a king who prayed to Bahuchara for a son. Bahuchara complied, but the prince {{grew up to}} be impotent. One night Bahuchara appeared to the prince <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> and ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and become her servant. Bahuchara is believed to continue to identify impotent men and command them to do the same. If they refuse, she punishes them: for their next seven incarnations they will be impotent. This myth is the origin of the cult of Bahuchara Mata, whose devotees are required to self-castrate and remain celibate.|$|E

On the morning of battle white clouds forming the shape of an X were said to have appeared in the sky. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious.
