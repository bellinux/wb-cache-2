With respect to manufacturing, there has been considerable work for rotating machinery, including PHM development and solutions for the machine tool industry. Examples include methods and software for monitoring spindle bearing health based on vibration and motor current, a cloud based monitoring architecture for relating tool wear health to part quality, and numerous works on monitoring the health condition of a machine tool <b>feed</b> <b>axis.</b> A low cost and practical method for monitoring the machine tool <b>feed</b> <b>axis</b> was demonstrated in a production environment, in which only controller signals were used to detect the early symptoms of pulley degradation prior {{two weeks before the}} pulley axis failed. For automotive manufacturing, there has recent developments on monitoring the health condition of industrial robots, using available controller signals such as motor current; this approach represents a practical approach for monitoring a fleet of industrial robots. Methods based on frequency analysis and classification algorithms for detecting the early symptoms of surge for air compressors have also been successfully demonstrated and implemented for an automotive manufacturing plant. Data mining and advanced analytical approaches have also been developed for continuous manufacturing production lines and semiconductor manufacturing applications. In terms of success in the manufacturing sector for PHM solutions, there is some economic numbers that can be reported. For example, the National Science Foundation funded in independent economic impacts study on Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) and surveyed 5 industrial members of the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems; the 5 companies (predominantly manufacturing applications) reported a savings of over $855 Million U.S dollars based on the successful implementation of the predictive monitoring and PHM solutions.|$|E

40|$|A {{continental}} depositional sequence {{was developed}} in a NW-SE trending syncline basin, which was formed during the late tectonic-sedimentary evolutionary phases of the Sant'Arcangelo piggyback basin (SE Apennines). This continental sequence (San Lorenzo Cycle) is early-middle Pleistocene in age and {{can be divided into}} three units: - a lower sandy conglomerates (alluvial dominated) unit, - a middle silty claystones (lacustrine or palustrine) unit, - an upper sandy conglomerates (alluvial dominated) unit. A stratigraphic study of the middle lacustrine unit of the San Lorenzo Cycle has been carried out and preliminary results are shown. In the northern and southern sectors of the middle unit of the San Lorenzo Cycle the stratigraphic features and facies are different. The studied southern 200 m-thick succession, in the depocentral area, is represented by elaystones and silty claystones with interbedded calcareous and volcaniclastic layers, and organic-matter rich beds. The fossil content is represented by Ostracodes, Gastropods, plant and Vertebrate remains. This succession records the sedimentation developed in the inner zone of a terrigenous dominated diluite fresh water lake; the minor occurrence of organic matter-rich laminites suggests the episodic setting of meromictic, water stratified conditions, while minor carbonate deposits may record a more concentrated lake water body. The northern succession, some tens of meters thick, located in a marginal area, in its lower part displays similar facies to those observed in the SE basin zone; in the upper part shows, on the contrary, a clear change testified by sand-mudstones beds and the occurrence of thin coal seams which bear fossil plant remains and mammal bones. This succession records the late evolutionary stage of encroachment of a fan delta-alluvial fan and marginal lacustrine environments over the inner lacustrine zone.

40|$|Abstract: Contouring {{control that}} employs {{tracking}} error components normal to desired contour curves as feedback signals {{is an effective}} method of improving contouring accuracy in machine tool control. In this paper, a contouring control method for biaxial feed drive systems is presented, which transforms tracking errors in each <b>feed</b> drive <b>axis</b> into errors that are reference to a moving frame around the desired position. The method is extended to include a referenced adjustment function for reducing inherent contour errors in the moving frame approach. Because friction is a major disturbance in motion control of feed drive systems, a friction compensation method for the contouring control systems is proposed. Since properties of friction cannot be predicted accurately, an estimation method of the friction model parameters is developed, and a robust controller for the estimation errors is designed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by experimental results with circular contour curves...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{machine tools}} for micro {{manufacturing}} feature unfavorable ratios of installation space to work space {{as well as}} moving masses compared to the work piece mass. Therefore, these machines show potential for optimization [1]. Machine tool components leading to these drawbacks are the currently used feed axes. The required features of such feed axes for micro manufacturing comprise high functional integration, high damping and high precision. Compared to electromechanically build up feed axes incorporating high installation space as well as small damping ratios due to linear guide rails, hydraulic feed axes feature the potential of a high force density and high damping ratios. However, a drawback is the poor precision. At the wbk Institute of Production Science Karlsruhe a novel approach has been realized: A highly integrated hydraulic <b>feed</b> <b>axis</b> with high compactness due to the hydraulic force density. Additionally, it features high functional integration by piezoelectric seat valves built into the piston rod and an integrated hydrostatic guidance system.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the impact of filleted edges variations on heat transfer. In real gas turbines, sharp edges are an approximation, because of manufacturing tolerances and/or geometrical modifications occurring during operation. The value of fillet radius is not exactly known a priori. It can be assumed that a specific radius occurs with a probability following a probabilistic distribution. For this reason, the effect of variation of the filleted edge on internal channel of a film cooling configuration has been studied numerically using an in house solver. The hole exit is fan-shaped and the <b>feeding</b> duct <b>axis</b> and the main stream are perpendicular to each other. A response surface has been generated varying the internal Mach number of coolant and the pressure ratio range between coolant and main gas. Four fillets radii for the internal duct have been analysed, r/D= 0. 0 - 5 %. A Gaussian distribution for the fillet radius has been assumed. Using the over mentioned distributions it is possible to obtain the probabilistic functions of the corresponding discharge coefficient, C d, and adiabatic effectiveness, h. The overall variation of C d and h can be more than 10 % the value without fillet. Furthermore the differences on Cd due to the uncertainties on fillet radius are bigger than those obtained modifying the exit duct shape (i. e. from cylindrical to fanshaped). This paper shows that the effect of variation of fillet radii must be included in numerical simulations. This has direct consequences on LES and DNS simulations, which normally include sharp corners or mean radii. A probabilistic approach must be included in the analysis of the results and the equivalent fillet radius assumed instead...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{organization}} {{is an important}} feature of biological systems and its main function is to facilitate adaptation of the organism to the environment. The daily variation of biological variables arises from an internal time-keeping system. The major action of the environment is to synchronize the internal clock to a period of exactly 24 h. The light-dark cycle, food ingestion, barometric pressure, acoustic stimuli, scents and social cues have been mentioned as synchronizers or" zeitgebers". The circadian rhythmicity of plasma corticosteroids has been well characterized in man and in rats and evidence has been accumulated showing daily rhythmicity {{at every level of}} the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Studies of restricted feeding in rats are of considerable importance because they reveal feeding as a major synchronizer of rhythms in HPA axis activity.

40|$|While many {{realistic}} {{manual control}} tasks require human operators to control multiple degrees-of-freedomsimultaneously, {{our understanding of}} such multi-axis manual control has not moved far beyond considering it simply as the control of multiple fully-independent axes. This investigation aims to further our understanding of multi-axis control by focusing on one phenomenon that is known to occur in such tasks: crossfeed. Crossfeed occurs when operators’ inputs in one controlled <b>axis</b> <b>feed</b> into another controlled degree-of-freedom, thereby affecting overall control performance. A human-in-the-loop experiment, in which operators performed a dual-axis aircraft roll and pitch tracking task with physical motion feedback, was conducted in the SIMONA Research Simulator at TU Delft. Three conditions were tested: the full dual-axis control task, supplemented with reference single-axis roll and pitch tasks. Through the use of independent target and disturbance forcing function signals in both controlled axes, {{we were able to}} detect the presence of crossfeed in this dual-axis task from spectral analysis. Furthermore, these signals facilitated the objective identification of the dynamics of the crossfeed contribution, in parallel with estimating operators visual and motion responses. The crossfeed dynamics were found to resemble the well-known dynamics of human operators’ visual responses. The crossfeed contribution was found to explain up to 20 % of the measured control inputs, thereby indicating that crossfeed can be a factor of significance in multi-axis manual control.

The glucocorticoid effect on both glutamate and GABA release was blocked by inhibiting postsynaptic G protein activity, suggesting a dependence on postsynaptic G protein signaling and the involvement of a retrograde messenger. Biochemical analysis of hypothalamic slices treated with dexamethasone revealed a glucocorticoid-induced rapid increase in the levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG). The glucocorticoid suppression of glutamate release was blocked by the type I cannabinoid receptor cannabinoid receptor antagonist, AM 251, and was mimicked and occluded by AEA and 2 -AG, suggesting it was mediated by retrograde endocannabinoid release. The glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release was also blocked by AM 251 but was not mimicked by AEA, 2 -AG, or a synthetic cannabinoid, WIN 55, 2122, nor was it blocked by vanilloid or ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, suggesting that it was mediated by a retrograde messenger acting at an AM 251 -sensitive, noncannabinoid/nonvanilloid receptor at presynaptic GABA terminals.

40|$|Lifetime {{performance}} variability is {{a powerful}} tool for evaluating herd management. Although efficiency is a key aspect of performance, it has not been integrated into existing studies on the variability of lifetime performance. The goal of the present article is to analyse the effects of various herd management options on the variability of lifetime performance by integrating criteria relative to feed efficiency. A herd model developed for dairy goat systems was used in three virtual experiments to test the effects of the diet energy level, the segmentation of the feeding plan and the mean production potential of the herd on the variability of lifetime performance. Principal component analysis showed that the variability of lifetime performance was structured around the first axis related to longevity and production and the second related to the variables used in feed efficiency calculation. The intra-management variability was expressed on the first axis (longevity and production), whereas the inter-management variability was expressed on the second <b>axis</b> (<b>feed</b> efficiency) and was mainly influenced by the combination of the diet energy level and the mean production potential. Similar feed efficiencies were attained with different management options. Still, such combinations relied on different biological bases and, {{at the level of the}} individual, contrasting results were observed in the relationship between the obtained pattern of performance (in response to diet energy) and the reference pattern of performance (defined by the production potential). Indeed, our results showed that over-feeding interacted with the feeding plan segmentation: a high level of feeding plan segmentation generated a low proportion of individuals at equilibrium with their production potential, whereas a single ration generated a larger proportion. At the herd level, the diet energy level and the herd production potential had marked effects on production and efficiency due to dilution of fixed production costs (i. e. maintenance requirements). Management options led to similar production and feed efficiencies at the herd level while giving large contrasts in the proportions of individuals at equilibrium with their production potential. These results suggested that analysing individual variability on the basis of criteria related to production processes could improve the assessment of herd management. The herd model opens promising perspectives in studying whether individual variability represents an advantage for herd performance...|$|R
