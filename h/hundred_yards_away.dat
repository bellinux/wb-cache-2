5|$|Goodensnake's body is cremated in a {{traditional}} ceremony, while the agents watch from a distance. Mulder shares with Scully his belief that both the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. The elder Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|Hunter's force {{advanced}} {{towards the}} town in a semi-circle formation, composed by the four battalions arranged {{from left to right}} in the following order: the 10th Sudanese, 9th Sudanese, the reduced 3rd Egyptian, and the 11th Sudanese. The artillery battery was with the 3rd Egyptian. The force reached the ridge of the plateau overlooking the town, about three <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> at a quarter past six. Major-General Hunter, finding the Mahdist garrison prepared for the assault and entrenched in their defenses, ordered the artillery to bombard their positions, which commenced at six-thirty. However, the artillery proved ineffective, as the guns were unable to strike within the narrow trenches or blast aside the cover behind which the Mahdist infantry waited. Hunter ceased the barrage, and ordered Lieutenant MacDonald to lead his brigade in a general advance. The command to fix bayonets was given, and the troops began an orderly advance across the three hundred yards that separated them from their objective. However, facing a line of Mahdist riflemen well-protected in their trenches, the soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders. The uncoordinated volleys of the advancing brigade were moderately effective against the Mahdist riflemen, who had not yet returned fire. When the battalions were about halfway across the three hundred yard stretch, their lines of fire began to converge due to their semi-circle formation, and the 10th Sudanese, on the left, was forced to halt to avoid coming under the fire of the rightmost 11th Sudanese.|$|E

Bainbridge was equipped with a ScanEagle UAV and Rigid-hulled inflatable boats. Both vessels stayed several <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> out of the pirates' range of fire. A P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft secured aerial footage and reconnaissance. Radio communication between the two ships was established. Four foreign vessels held by pirates headed towards the scene.

25|$|The {{condemned}} soldiers (one sergeant, four corporals, {{and eight}} privates) {{were transferred to}} a barracks on December 10.

The designated place of execution was several <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away.</b> Army engineers completed their work {{by the light of}} bonfires. The thirteen condemned men were awakened at five in the morning and brought to the gallows. They were hanged simultaneously, at 7:17am, one minute before sunrise. The scaffolds were disassembled and every piece returned to Fort Sam Houston. The New York Times, commenting on the clean-up operations, observed the place of execution and place of burial were ‚Äúindistinguishable.‚Äù Only army officers and County Sheriff John Tobin had been allowed to witness the execution.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 1941, {{the night}} before the {{invasion}} of the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign, Dayan's unit crossed the border and secured two bridges over the Litani River. When they were not relieved as expected, at 04:00 on 8 June, the unit perceived that it was exposed to possible attack and‚Äîon its own initiative‚Äîassaulted a nearby Vichy police station, capturing it. A few hours later, as Dayan was {{on the roof of the}} building using binoculars to scan Vichy French positions on the other side of the river, the binoculars were struck by a French rifle bullet fired by a sniper from several <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> propelling metal and glass fragments into his left eye and causing severe damage. Six hours passed before he could be evacuated, and he would have died if not for Bernard Dov Protter, who took care of him until they were evacuated. Dayan lost the eye. In addition, the damage to the extraocular muscles was such that Dayan could not be fitted with a glass eye, and he was compelled to adopt the black eye patch that became his trademark.|$|E
25|$|An AHL playoff-record {{crowd of}} 20,103 NHL-lockout hockey starved fans filled the seats as the puck dropped that night {{hoping to see}} a Philadelphia {{professional}} hockey team win a playoff title on home ice for just the fifth time in the 78 years since the C-AHL Philadelphia Arrows first played a professional hockey game in the city in 1927. The Phantoms did not disappoint the SRO crowd as they defeated the Wolves handily, 5‚Äì2, with center Ben Stafford (who retired after the playoffs {{and is now a}} Lieutenant in US Marine Corps serving in Iraq) collecting the Cup-winning goal. Rookie Jeff Carter's 23 points (12 goals and 11 assists) earned him individual honors as the AHL's top scorer in the playoffs, while Niittymaki won the Jack Butterfield Award as the Calder Cup MVP. After the Phantoms shook hands with the Wolves players at center ice, AHL President Dave Andrews handed the Calder Cup to team captain Boyd Kane, who skated it around the ice. Ironically, exactly seven years earlier to the day, Phantoms Head Coach John Stevens had received the same Cup from the same hands a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> at the Spectrum as captain of the 1997‚Äì98 Phantoms. The Phantoms' victory was just the fifth time that a professional hockey title in any league had been won in a game taking place in Philadelphia since the sport was first played in the city in 1927.|$|E

No one in any of the boats standing off a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> can have escaped the paralysing shock of knowing that so short a distance away a tragedy, unbelievable in its magnitude, was being enacted, which we, helpless, could in no way avert or diminish." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{foundation}} of Newton Heath LYR F.C., {{at the request of}} the employees of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) company's Carriage and Wagon Works, the club needed a pitch to play on. The chosen site was owned by the Manchester Cathedral authorities, but although conveniently sited next to the wagon works it was a [...] "bumpy, stony patch in summer, [...] a muddy, heavy swamp in the rainy months". The railway company agreed to pay a nominal rent to the authorities and to lease the ground to the football club. As it was next to the railway line operated by the LYR, the ground was often clouded in a thick mist of steam from passing trains. Players had to get changed in TheThreeCrowns public house, a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> on Oldham Road, as there were no facilities nearby. There may have been some kind of refreshment offered to supporters at the eastern end of the site.|$|E

Before a big exam, teachers frisk their students for explosives," [...] while Perigard said, [...] "at night, their neighbourhoods are riddled with gunfire and explosions". In the New York Daily News, Patrick Huguenin wrote, [...] "American teens wouldn't recognize other scenes showing how life slips into a heavily regulated series of checkpoints and curfews." [...] Hale said, [...] "The way the boys can tell without looking whether it's an Apache or a Chinook helicopter overhead, the way the curtains are always drawn, the level of physical contact and affection among the men ... would be alien to American sensibilities." ...|$|E

50|$|Unconventional {{infantry}} tactics {{often put}} a conventional enemy at a disadvantage. During the Second Boer War, the Boers used guerrilla tactics {{to fight the}} conventional British Army.
