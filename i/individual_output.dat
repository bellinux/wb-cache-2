5000|$|High {{generator}} output resistance: In {{order to}} get voltage output levels in the range required by digital electrical devices, a common approach is to place many thermoelectric elements in series within a generator module. The element's voltages add, but so do their <b>individual</b> <b>output</b> resistance. The maximum power transfer theorem dictates that maximum power is delivered to a load when the source and load resistances are identically matched. For low impedance loads near zero ohms, as the generator resistance rises the power delivered to the load decreases. To lower the output resistance, some commercial devices place more individual elements in parallel and fewer in series and employ a boost regulator to raise the voltage to the voltage needed by the load.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Noll (1871-1925) was a {{resident}} of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania made famous in a (fictionalized and error-riddled) anecdote used by Frederick Winslow Taylor to illustrate his theories of scientific management.Noll came to public attention in the writing and speaking of 'scientific management' proponent Frederick Winslow Taylor. In Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management, he describes a study conducted at Bethlehem Steel in 1898 regarding the loading of pig iron onto railroad cars. At {{the start of the}} study, workers were loading an average of 12.5 tons of pig per laborer per day and received a wage of $1.15 per day, regardless of <b>individual</b> <b>output.</b> The Bethlehem Steel management wanted to increase workers' output and shift to a piece-rate wage of $.0375 per ton. Under the target piece-rate, workers would have to load more than 30 tons per day (or 250% of the current output) to earn the same wage. Two of Taylor's employees worked at the Bethlehem Steel plant, experimenting with loading strategies and searching out exemplary workers to serve as models for the assertion that [...] "a good day's wages could be made at the existing rates by a good man" [...] (original research reported quoted by Wrege & Perroni, 1974, p. 17).|$|E
50|$|Rickenbacker was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} who began producing stereo bass guitars with a stereo output for each pickup section. The neck pickup had one output and the bridge pickup had one. Also Teisco produced a guitar with a stereo option. Teisco divided the two sections in the upper three strings and the lower three strings for each <b>individual</b> <b>output.</b> The Gittler guitar was an experimental guitar with six pickups, one for each string. The Go! Team has modified a Fender Telecaster with an additional rotated pickup for the upper string, causing a simulation of a one string bass sound.Gibson also created the HD.6X Pro guitar with The Hex Pickup that captures a separate signal for each individual string and sends it to the onboard analog/digital converter, which uses Gibson's digital transport technology to send the signal out of the guitar via Cat 5 Ethernet Cable. The output can be routed as a single summed mono signal to an amplifier or recording console. It can also send the E, A, and D strings to one amp or recording channel and the G, B, and high E to a separate amp or channel. Or it can send the output of all six individual strings to six different amps or channels. These six individualized outputs can used to create various effects.|$|E
