5|$|In January 2010, Gill was {{appointed}} manager of Weymouth, then {{bottom of the}} Conference South. With the club already in financial difficulty, many first-team players left. Budgetary constraints meant Gill was unable to bring in replacements, and after 44 days in post, he resigned, feeling the <b>job</b> <b>had</b> become untenable. Weymouth's chairman claimed the cost of travelling from his Midlands home {{was a factor in}} his departure, a suggestion that Gill refuted. In mid-2010, he joined Bristol Rovers as youth team coach. He led the team to the third round of the FA Youth Cup, in which they lost narrowly to Aston Villa's youth team, before a management restructure at the club resulted in his departure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the {{prospect}} of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff <b>job</b> <b>had</b> fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.|$|E

Khánh began growing a small goatee, which he customarily grew when he was attempting a new project and would only shave once the <b>job</b> <b>had</b> been completed.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, the share of middle-skill jobs in the United States has fallen sharply. Middle-skill jobs are those in which workers {{primarily}} perform routine tasks that are procedural and repetitive.

5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the <b>job</b> <b>had</b> been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

30|$|Hence, {{with respect}} to job quality we find a clear {{cascading}} pattern across skill groups after 2000, which may hint at an oversupply of high-skilled workers (since skills have grown over time, see above). Although the share of all young workers in top-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>has</b> remained relatively stable over the 2000 s (after an increase over the 1990 s), for the groups of high-skilled workers there have been clear declines in the respective shares. This means that less young workers <b>have</b> obtained a top-paying <b>job</b> after 2000. On the contrary, their share in medium-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>has</b> risen continuously. Concurrently with that, the share of medium- and low-paying workers in medium-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>has</b> shrunk, while – vice versa – their share in bottom-paying <b>jobs</b> <b>has</b> increased. These patterns clearly indicate that relatively better skilled groups have crowded out relatively lower skilled groups in Germany – at least over {{the first decade of}} this century.|$|R

25|$|In January 1943, Hungary's {{enthusiasm for}} the war effort, never {{especially}} high, suffered a tremendous blow. The Soviet army, in the full momentum of its triumphant turnaround after the Battle of Stalingrad, punched through Romanian troops at {{a bend in the}} Don River and virtually obliterated the Second Hungarian Army in a few days' fighting. In this single action, Hungarian combat fatalities jumped by 80,000.

25|$|Austin {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on WWE programming in a year at WrestleMania 21 where he was confronted by Roddy Piper in Piper's Pit, until Carlito interrupted to insult both. This resulted in Carlito receiving a stunner from Austin and Piper throwing {{him out of the}} ring. The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a Stone Cold Stunner as well. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at ECW One Night Stand in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Eric Bischoff. He returned at Raw Homecoming, delivering Stone Cold Stunners to Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, Stephanie McMahon and Linda McMahon. An angle including Jim Ross being fired led to a match in which Austin agreed to face Jonathan Coachman at Taboo Tuesday, with the stipulation of Ross regaining his announcing <b>job</b> <b>had</b> Austin won and Austin losing his own <b>job</b> <b>had</b> he lost. Austin hurt his back prior to the match and could not wrestle unless he was heavily medicated, so the match was cancelled. To explain away his failure to appear at Taboo Tuesday, Vince McMahon said on Raw that Austin had been involved in an accident, thus preventing him from competing. Batista substituted for Austin, defeating Coachman along with Vader and Goldust. The stipulation was dropped due to Austin not competing.|$|E

During a shootout, Curry was shot through the wrist, and his horse was shot from under him, resulting in his capture. George Curry and Walt Putnam were also captured. All three were held in the Deadwood, South Dakota jail, but only briefly; they overpowered the jailer and escaped. They headed back into Montana and robbed two post offices.|$|E

They missed out on the play-offs altogether after a 3–0 defeat at home to Reading on the last day of the season, when a point would have sufficed. The drastic loss in form was attributed by McClaren to injuries to key players, especially striker Chris Martin, although local press and supporters also believed that constant speculation linking McClaren to the Newcastle United <b>job</b> <b>had</b> been a contributing factor.
