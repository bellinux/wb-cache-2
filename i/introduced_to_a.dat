5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new ecosystem. Classified as an {{invasive}} species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Scully are soon <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strike-force {{that will}} be going into the subway to investigate. The group {{includes}} Steven Melnick, a structural engineer, and Dr. Hellura Lyle, CDC employee specializing in pathogens. Scully, however, decides the plan will work better if Doggett acts as her eyes and ears while she analyzes the situation from up in the Transit Control Center. Using cameras and microphones, she will watch and hear what is happening. After the plans are made, Doggett leads the team into the dark tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Ender, now {{ten years}} old, is {{promoted}} to Command School on Eros {{after a brief}} respite on Earth. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> former war hero, Mazer Rackham. From now on, Ender participates in simulations created and controlled by Mazer. As the skirmishes become harder, he is joined by {{some of his friends}} from the Battle School as sub-commanders. Despite this, Ender becomes depressed by the battles, his isolation, and by the way Mazer treats him.|$|E

5000|$|... "Wildflower" [...] is not {{an exact}} term. Terms like native species (naturally {{occurring}} in the area, see flora), exotic or, better, introduced species (not naturally occurring in the area), of which some are labelled invasive species (that out-compete other plants - whether native or not), imported (<b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> area whether deliberately or accidentally) and naturalized (<b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> area, but now considered by the public as native) are much more accurate.|$|R
5|$|Jarre {{was raised}} in Lyon by his mother and grandparents, and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> variety of art forms, {{including}} those of street performers, jazz musicians, and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{itself is}} {{four and a}} half minutes long but {{original}} footage for the ride {{can be seen in the}} queue, and there is also a pre-show video. In the ride, patrons are <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. Sideshow Bob, however, is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. At least 24 regular characters from the series make an appearance, all voiced by their original actors. Along with the attraction is a gift shop modeled after the Kwik-E-Mart, which opened in late 2007.|$|E
5|$|We {{are also}} <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{few of the}} other workers in the office, such as Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), a {{socially}} awkward salesman and part-time, volunteer sheriff’s deputy; Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), another salesman who enjoys playing pranks on Dwight; Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), the receptionist on whom Jim harbors an obvious crush; and Ryan Howard (B.

5|$|As {{the country}} {{continued}} to expand, {{the issue of}} slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican–American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on the slavery issue.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, Monroe {{spent most of her}} {{childhood}} in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen. While working in a radioplane factory in 1944 as part of the war effort, she was <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946–1947) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story resulted in increased interest in her films.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot's {{return to}} work {{reassured}} the doctors and insurers and {{he returned to the}} film studio to make his final film La Prisonnière. The film began production in September 1967 and was halted when Clouzot fell ill and was hospitalized until April 1968. He began filming La Prisonnière again in August 1968. Clouzot incorporated stylistic elements of his aborted film L'enfer into La Prisonnière. La Prisonnière is about a woman who is <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> photographer who takes masochistic submissive pictures of young women. The woman volunteers herself as a model for these pictures and is surprised at her own pleasure in the activity. After finishing La Prisonnière, Clouzot's health grew worse. In the 1970s, he wrote a few more scripts without ever filming them, including a feature about Indochina. He also planned to direct a pornographic film in 1974 for Francis Micheline, but the film was abandoned. Clouzot's health grew worse and he required open-heart surgery in November 1976. On 12 January 1977 Clouzot died in his apartment while listening to The Damnation of Faust. Clouzot is buried beside Véra in the Montmartre Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Forensic {{anthropologist}} Clyde Snow {{learned of}} the massacre {{during his visit to}} Zagreb in October 1992. Snow travelled there as a United Nations (UN) team member sent to investigate reports of war crimes. In a meeting Snow had with the dean of the Zagreb University School of Medicine, he was <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> former soldier who claimed to have survived the massacre and told Snow where it took place. Three days later, Snow went to Vukovar and drove to Ovčara accompanied by Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Larry Moore who was deployed to the region with the UNPROFOR. At the site, Moore spotted a human skull in the mud. A few days later, the UN declared the site a crime scene and deployed Russian UNPROFOR troops to guard it.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride, would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood. It officially opened May 15, 2008 in Florida and May 19, 2008, in Hollywood. In the ride, patrons are <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. However, Sideshow Bob is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. It {{features more than}} 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features {{the voices of the}} regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer did not participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts.|$|E
5|$|In April 1903, she was <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Blue Cuirassier Guards officer Nikolai Kulikovsky by {{her brother}} Michael during a royal {{military}} review at Pavlovsk Palace. Olga and Kulikovsky {{began to see}} each other, and exchanged letters regularly. The same year, {{at the age of}} 22, she confronted her husband and asked for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he might reconsider after seven years. Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an aide-de-camp, and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya Street. The relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public, but gossip about their romance spread through society.|$|E

5|$|Martinez {{began working}} as a model {{in order to further}} her {{professional}} wrestling career. She also worked as an actress, and after being cast in an independent film about wrestling, she was <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wrestling promoter and trainer. She trained at his school {{for two and a half}} years. Martinez first wrestled in Southern California under the ring name Desire, appearing in several independent promotions such as Revolution Pro Wrestling, Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF) and Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), where she worked as the storyline sister of Kyra. While in UPW, she also competed under the name Halloween Barbie. She also had a run in Women's Extreme Wrestling, where she played the storyline cousin of Mercedes Martinez. On July 19, 2002, Martinez, under the name Desire, teamed with Threat to win the vacant EWF Tag Team Championship in a battle royal. They held the championship for 28 days, before losing it to PHAT (Eric Matlock and Devon Willis) on August 16. In December 2004, Martinez trained at World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Stern, in January 1973 Heidemann photographed the Carin II, a yacht that {{formerly}} belonged to Göring. The boat {{was in a}} poor state of repair and expensive to maintain, but Heidemann took a mortgage on his Hamburg flat and purchased it. While researching {{the history of the}} yacht, Heidemann interviewed Göring's daughter, Edda, after which the couple began an affair. Through this relationship and his ownership of the boat he was <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> circle of former Nazis. He began to hold parties on the Carin II, with the former SS generals Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke as the guests of honour. Wolff and Mohnke were witnesses at Heidemann's wedding to his third wife in 1979; the couple went on honeymoon to South America accompanied by Wolff, where they met more ex-Nazis, including Walter Rauff and Klaus Barbie, who were both wanted in the West for war crimes.|$|E
5|$|While {{he reads}} the diary {{over the course of}} several months, Jake is confronted by his {{siblings}} about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister’s human fiancée and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father’s diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‘’Gallus Rex’’, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake’s perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about their effect on Jake in his diary.|$|E

5|$|God of War: Ascension is {{the only}} {{installment}} in the series to offer an online multiplayer feature, and up to eight players can take part. The main objective for players is {{to take control of}} a map to earn rewards from the gods. Before entering multiplayer battles, each player is <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> warrior, who, like Kratos, is an oath-breaker and is imprisoned in the Prison of the Damned—the warrior's backstory is explored in Rise of the Warrior. The player takes control of the warrior and aligns with one of the four deities: Ares, Hades, Zeus, or Poseidon. Each god offers a unique combat play-style and in-battle abilities. The attack style of the god with whom the player aligns is critical to their warrior's path. Players who ally with Ares are brute force experts with an up-close focus, although they are weak defensively, specifically to long range magical attacks. Players who ally with Zeus are magical experts with a focus on space control, although they are balanced by their lack of melee strength. Players who ally with Poseidon are supports with a focus on team synergy and self-sustenance; his synergistic powers can be replaced by more self-defense abilities if desired, although never as much as the other 3 gods. Players who ally with Hades are versatile, unlike the other 3, featuring other unique mechanics such as lifesteal, stealth and curses, making them excellent at controlling the flow of combat, although they can also choose to specialize in certain roles with certain armors or weaponry. Players can create up to three more warriors and have a champion representing each god.|$|E
5|$|She is then tasked {{to escort}} Dr. Otto Schenker, an East German scientist, to England. Later on, as Cate and Dr. Schenker {{fly back to}} England, he is {{captured}} by H.A.R.M., led by Magnus Armstrong, who knocks Cate unconscious. Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of the bowels of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E
