60|$|Whichever way the eye turned, no tree, no {{speck of}} any green thing was seen--no {{more than in}} smithies. All laborers, of {{whatsoever}} sort, were hued like the men in <b>foundries.</b> The <b>black</b> vistas of streets were as the galleries in coal mines; the flagging, as flat tomb-stones, minus the consecration of moss, and worn heavily down, by sorrowful tramping, as the vitreous rocks in the cursed Gallipagos, over which the convict tortoises crawl.|$|R

60|$|So {{again he}} walked down to Lumley to post his letters. And he looked at Lumley. And he found it a damn god-forsaken hell of a hole. It was a long straggle of a dusty road down in the valley, with a pale-grey dust and spatter from the pottery, and big {{chimneys}} bellying forth black smoke right by the road. Then {{there was a short}} cross-way, up which one saw the iron <b>foundry,</b> a <b>black</b> and rusty place. A little further on was the railway junction, and beyond that, more houses stretching to Hathersedge, where the stocking factories were busy. Compared with Lumley, Woodhouse, whose church could be seen sticking up proudly and vulgarly on an eminence, above trees and meadow-slopes, was an idyllic heaven.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the night}} of July 15, 1965, a white racist rally was held in Anniston, after which Willie Brewster, a <b>black</b> <b>foundry</b> worker, {{was shot and killed}} while driving home from work. A $20,000 reward was raised by Anniston civic leaders, and {{resulted}} in the apprehension, trial and conviction of the accused killer, Damon Strange, who worked for a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Historian Taylor Branch called the conviction of Damon Strange a [...] "breakthrough verdict"¬ù on p.391 of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, At Canaan's Edge. Strange was convicted by an all-white Calhoun County jury to the surprise of many people, including civil rights leaders who had planned to protest an acquittal. This was the first conviction of a white person for killing a black person in civil rights era Alabama.|$|R
500|$|Although {{known in}} their early days as [...] "the Throstles", the club's more popular {{nickname}} among supporters came to be the Baggies, a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain. One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, {{because of the large}} baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and <b>foundries</b> of the <b>Black</b> Country. Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the [...] "bagmen", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club's early years. The official club mascots are named Baggie Bird and Albi; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest.|$|R
