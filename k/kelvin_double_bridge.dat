Since {{the initial stages of}} reversion have never been examined in earlier work and since the currently accepted mech-anisms for reversion predict as yet unobserved, kinetic regimes, cap-acitor discharge pulse heating techniques were used to study the rev-ersion of alloys aged to the slow reaction. A sensitive resistivity measuring instrument, based on a <b>Kelvin</b> <b>Double</b> <b>Bridge,</b> was used to observe small resistivity changes only half a millisecond after the specimen had been pulsed to the reversion temperature. The nescessary design requirements to achieve this resolution were discussed in detail. A second pulse heating circuit was also incorporated so that the time and temperature dependencies of the instantaneous activation energy for reversion could be obtained using the'change of slope ' method, and the results generated enabled the kinetic stages to be readil...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Damping in <b>double</b> Cables {{suspension}} <b>bridge</b> {{composed of}} steel reinforcement beams and reinforced concrete tower is non-classical, {{which leads to}} coupled equations of motion in main coordinate system. Based on the complex damping theory, the viscous damping ratio is solved, {{which can be used}} to describe energy dissipation characteristics of non-classical damping system approximately. Seismic response of <b>double</b> chains suspension <b>bridge</b> is analyzed through an example of <b>double</b> chains suspension <b>bridge,</b> considering the geometric nonlinearity and non-classical damping. And numerical calculation is presented for seismic response subjected to independent effect or combination effect of three orthogonal components of seismic wave. Single cable suspension bridge can be taken as a special case of <b>double</b> cable suspension <b>bridge,</b> after the main cable shape coefficient is introduced. The dynamic responses of <b>double</b> cable suspension <b>bridge</b> and single cable suspension bridge are compared to reveal the characteristics of Seismic Response of <b>double</b> cable suspension <b>bridge.</b> The study of the dynamic responses characteristics of <b>double</b> cable suspension <b>bridge</b> has a positive significance on structural form selection of such type bridge during designing, dynamic performance evaluation and reinforcement design has positive significance...|$|R

40|$|Fluorozirconate glasses, such as ZBLAN (ZrF 4 -BaF 2 -LaF 3 - AlF 3 -NaF), {{have a high}} {{infrared}} {{transparency and}} large rare-earth solubility, which makes them an attractive platform for highly efficient and compact mid-IR waveguide lasers. We investigate the structural changes within the glass network induced by high repetition rate femtosecond laser pulses and reveal {{the origin of the}} observed decrease in refractive index by using Raman microscopy. The high repetition rate pulse train causes local melting followed by rapid quenching of the glass network. This results in breaking of bridging bonds between neighboring zirconium fluoride polyhedra and as the glass resolidifies, a larger fraction of single bridging fluorine bonds relative to <b>double</b> <b>bridging</b> links are formed in comparison to the pristine glass. The distance between adjacent zirconium cations is larger for single <b>bridging</b> than <b>double</b> <b>bridging</b> links and consequently an expansion of the glass network occurs. The rarified glass network can be related to the experimentally observed decrease in refractive index via the Lorentz-Lorenz equation. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for {{excitation}} of coil-less fluxgate is presented. The {{purpose of this}} method {{is to reduce the}} spurious component of the output voltage, allowing us to increase the amplification. The method is based on the employment of two coil-less fluxgates in a <b>double</b> <b>bridge,</b> which injects pulsing current in opposite direction in each wire. By taking the difference of the voltages on the two wires, we suppress the component of the voltages, which does not change under application of external measured field. The sensitive axes are in opposite direction, so the wire feels opposite field. As a result, we will obtain an output voltage with low peak value, including only the component of the voltage that changes when we apply external field. Finally, we propose an improved version of the <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> to allow the employment of two sensing elements with difference characteristics. This is obtained by optimizing the suppression of the spurious voltages and, at the same time, setting independently chosen values of exciting current for each wire...|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of the title complexes (A) and (B) have been determined and those of (C) and (D) redetermined {{in order to obtain}} new and more accurate data for explanation of the trans influence of the terminal oxo- oxygen atom in the di-/c-oxo and di-/c-sulphido molybdenum(V) complexes with oxalato and isothiocyanato ligands. The interatomic distances are discussed and the results compared with similar dimeric structures with molyb- denumCV) in distorted octahedral coordination. Whereas a considerable lengthening of the bonds trans to the multiple-bonded terminal oxo-ligand was found in all structures with a <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> of oxygen atoms and, therefore, this influence confirmed as a generally valid rule, no such trans influence was observed in the structures with a <b>double</b> <b>bridge</b> of sulphur atoms. In the structures of di-^-sulphido-oxalato complexes, the Mo-L bonds cis to the terminal oxo ligand (i. e. trans to the bridging sulphur atoms) are longer them the bonds in trans position. These results indicate that the sulphur atom has a greater trans influence than the oxygen atom. This effect is not so conspicuous in the isothiocyanato complexes...|$|R

40|$|The B {{chromosome}} {{of maize}} {{has been used}} in a study of dicentric chromosomes. TB- 9 Sb is a translocation between the B and chromosome 9. The B- 9 of TB- 9 Sb carries 60 % of the short arm of 9. For construction of dicentrics, a modified B- 9 chromosome was used, B- 9 -Dp 9. It consists of the B- 9 chromosome plus a duplicated 9 S region attached to the distal end. In meiosis, fold-back pairing and crossing over in the duplicated region gives a chromatid-type dicentric B- 9 that subsequently initiates a chromatid-type breakage-fusion-bridge cycle. In the male, it forms a single bridge in anaphase II of meiosis and at the first pollen mitosis. However, the cycle is interrupted by nondisjunction of the B centromere at the second pollen mitosis, which sends the B- 9 dicentric to one pole and converts it from a chromatid dicentric to a chromosome dicentric. As expected, the new dicentric undergoes the chromosome-type breakage-fusion-bridge cycle and produces <b>double</b> <b>bridges.</b> A large number of plants with chromosome dicentrics were produced in this way. The presence of <b>double</b> <b>bridges</b> in the root cells of plants with a chromosome dicentric was studied during the first 10 wk of development. It was found that the number of plants and cells showing <b>double</b> <b>bridges</b> declined steadily over the 10 -wk period. Several lines of evidence indicate that there was no specific developmental time for dicentric loss. "Healing" of broken chromosomes produced by dicentric breakage accounted for much of the dicentric loss. Healing produced a wide range of derived B- 9 chromosomes, some large and some small. A group of minichromosomes found in these experiments probably represents the small end of the scale for B- 9 derivatives...|$|R
