500|$|According to Triotech and Cedar Fair, the {{response}} from the public during the ride's opening weekend was positive.

500|$|Hed PE {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Blackout, on March 18, 2003. It peaked at No.33 on the Billboard 200, while its title track peaked at No.21 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No.32 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Allmusic's Johnny Loftus wrote that [...] "While it expands on melodic elements {{that had previously}} played a supporting role in the band's sound, Blackout also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm. And {{whether or not it}} is the presence of a top-line producer, (hed) pe <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> a way to imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks." [...] Guitarist Jaxon joined the band in early 2004. He is the fourth person to fill this position.|$|E
500|$|The British tonnage {{allowance}} {{granted by}} the Washington Naval Treaty permitted them to keep the three sisters in service until the two [...] were completed in 1927. While King George V and Ajax were scrapped, Centurion was demilitarized by the removal of her armament and was converted into a radio-controlled target ship. In addition to {{being used as a}} target for surface ships, Centurion was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} various types of aerial bombing. During the Second World War, she was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. In preparation for that operation (subsequently cancelled), she was modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians may <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> the deception. The ship was scuttled off Omaha Beach in June 1944 to form a breakwater to protect a mulberry harbour built to supply the forces ashore.|$|E

2500|$|Side Note: This joke is {{a play on}} {{the fact}} that in Russia it is {{believed}} that three is the optimal number of people for drinking. This in turn goes back to when in the Soviet Union a bottle of vodka cost 2.87 Soviet rubles, 3 rubles being a convenient price for three men to buy a bottle and have 13 kopecks left for a snack. The classic for the latter was a rectangular pack of soft processed cheese [...] "Druzhba" [...] (Friendship), with that exact price. Therefore, a natural company is 3, each contributing 1 ruble. This procedure was dubbed [...] "to have arranged for three (persons)" [...] ( [...] ; soobrazit' na troikh, literal translation: [...] "to <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> for three"). Much of Soviet folklore is based on this interpretation of the [...] "magic of the number 3".|$|E
2500|$|Wila can be {{collected}} {{at any time}} of year, {{but it is important to}} choose the right type of lichen. [...] There are numerous other species of Bryoria that look very similar to wila, but that are bitter and mildly toxic. [...] As well, there are some specimens of wila that contain toxic levels of vulpinic acid. [...] Most people that traditionally harvest wila <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> ways to make sure that they are collecting the right lichen. [...] The species of tree on which the lichen is growing and the general location of that tree are both thought to be important factors for deciding if it is the right type of lichen to eat, but not everyone agrees on which locations and tree species are better. [...] Many people taste the lichen first to make sure that it isn't bitter, and some people choose the lichens that are darker coloured.|$|E
2500|$|Victoria awakes and confronts Kaftan, who {{threatens to}} shoot {{her if she}} tries opening the hatch. A small, {{mechanical}} cybermat revives and attacks Kaftan, rendering her unconscious. Victoria grabs Kaftan's pistol and shoots the cybermat. Not knowing which lever opens the hatch, she leaves to find Hopper. In the tombs, the Cybermen free their leader, the Cyber Controller, from his cell. When Klieg attempts {{to take credit for}} reviving them, the Cyber Controller crushes his hand, declaring, [...] "You belong to us; You shall be like us." [...] The Doctor realises that the tombs were an elaborate trap: the Cybermen were waiting for beings intelligent enough to decipher the controls to free them. The expedition will be converted into Cybermen in preparation for a new invasion of Earth. In the control room, Hopper and Callum <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> how to open the hatch. Hopper descends into the tombs, and uses smoke grenades to distract the Cybermen while the rest make their escape– all but Toberman.|$|E

60|$|Again I see {{the lantern}} {{come forward to}} the engine. But this time it comes conspicuously. A bit too conspicuously to suit me, and I wonder what is up. At any rate I have {{something}} else {{to be afraid of}} than the shack on the engine. The train pulls by. Just in time, before I make my spring, I see the dark form of a shack, without a lantern, on the first blind. I let it go by, and prepare to board the second blind. But the shack on the first blind has jumped off and is at my heels. Also, I have a fleeting glimpse of the lantern of the shack who rode out the engine. He has jumped off, and now both shacks are on the ground on the same side with me. The next moment the second blind comes by and I am aboard it. But I do not linger. I <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> my countermove. As I dash across the platform I hear the impact of the shack's feet against the steps as he boards. I jump off the other side and run forward with the train. My plan is to run forward and get on the first blind. It is nip and tuck, for the train is gathering speed. Also, the shack is behind me and running after me. I guess I am the better sprinter, for I make the first blind. I stand on the steps and watch my pursuer. He is only about ten feet back and running hard; but now the train has approximated his own speed, and, relative to me, he is standing still. I encourage him, hold out my hand to him; but he explodes in a mighty oath, gives up and makes the train several cars back.|$|E

50|$|During the Hush story arc, {{while working}} with Superman, Batman {{discusses}} {{whether or not}} Perry White <b>has</b> <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> Superman's secret identity. Theorizing that White is too good a reporter to not <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> it <b>out,</b> he draws the same comparison to himself and Gordon, stating that Gordon is too good a cop to not <b>have</b> <b>figured</b> it <b>out.</b> In that same story arc, Gordon, {{in an attempt to}} stop Batman from killing the Joker, tells Batman to remember who his role models are (his parents) and the beliefs they instilled in him. As well, he asks Batman to remember who and what made him who he is, a rather obvious reference to the criminal who gunned down his parents in front of him, suggesting that Gordon knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman.|$|R
