The results indicate that the relationship between ICE and per capita output presents an inverted N-shaped curve with two turning points, resulting from the comprehensive influence of scale, composition, and technique effects, and that most sub-sectors remain in the second stage of the curve.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of huko point massage with <b>ice</b> on <b>intensity</b> of pain due of Phlebotomy In children with thalassemia. The relationship between anxiety and pain in children was also studied. Materials and Method: A randomized, clinical trial was conducted on 86 children of 6 - 12 years of age undergoing transfusion and referred to the thalassemia ward of Kerman Samen Alhojaj Medical Center in 2014. The children were selected using convenience sampling and assigned to the interventional and control groups using randomized block design. In the interventional group, 5 minutes before performing phlebotomy, huko point massage with ice was performed. In the control group, no intervention was performed. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Scale (FLACC scale). Data were analyzed using Spearman's correlation and Mann-Whitney test by SPSS software version 22. Results: The mean pain score in the interventional group was 0. 65 ± 0. 75 and in the control group was 3. 81 ± 1. 84.

40|$|Energetic ion {{dynamics}} play {{an important}} role in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) plasmas, as well as in the solar wind. In the former case, energetic ions such as neutral beam injection (NBI) ions and fusion-born alpha-particles, can interact with global modes in tokamak plasmas leading to instabilities that might result in loss of confinement and energy. In the latter case, ion dynamics must be taken into account in order to explain in situ and remote observations of heating of the solar wind, which show the occurrence of anisotropic heating of ions, as well as magnetohydrodynamics turbulence and intermittency all at the same time. In this thesis we address two scenarios in plasma physics where ion dynamics play a key role modifying the mass and energy transport in the plasma, specifically, ion cyclotron emission (ICE) in MCF plasmas, and preferential ion heating due to intermittent magnetic fields in the solar wind. ICE results from a radiative instability, probably the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI), driven by energetic ions in MCF plasmas. Understanding the underlying physics of ICE is important for the exploitation of ICE as a non-perturbative diagnostic for confined and lost alpha-particles in deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasmas in future thermonuclear fusion reactors [McClements et al., Nucl. Fusion, 55, 043013 (2015); Dendy and McClements, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion, 57, 044002 (2015) ]. On the other hand, preferential ion heating in the solar wind, observed as the occurrence of an ion beam which drifts along the background magnetic field with a velocity close to the local Alfven speed, is still an open problem. Despite the large amount of studies conducted in this issue, none of them included intermittency self-consistently. Therefore, the relationships between preferential ion heating and intermittency have remained unknown, until now. We study in detail the previously mentioned scenarios through numerical simulations using the hybrid approximation for the plasma, which treat ions as kinetic particles and electrons as a neutralizing massless fluid. Our hybrid simulations of the MCI confirm predictions of the analytical theory of the MCI, and recover some features of ICE as observed in D-T plasmas in JET. Furthermore, by going deep into the nonlinear stage of the MCI, we recover additional features of ICE which are not predicted by the linear theory of the MCI but are present in the measured ICE signal, resulting in a good match between our simulation results and the measured <b>ICE</b> <b>intensity</b> in JET. On the other hand, we present the first study of preferential ion heating in the fast solar wind including intermittent electromagnetic fields in a self-consistent way. We find that the temporal and spatial dynamics of the mechanisms driving preferential ion heating in our simulations (gyrobunching and ion trapping by the electric field), the ion temperature anisotropy T=T (perpendicular temperature/parallel temperature), and the degree of correlation between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, show strong dependence on the level of intermittency in the electromagnetic fields...|$|R

A total of six seals were fitted with Conductivity Temperature Depth Satellite Relayed Data Loggers (CTD-SRDL) at Dumont D'Urville (∼ 67 °S, 140 °E) during the austral winters in 2007 and 2008. The tags transmitted positions and dive information over 169 ± 31 day, providing a total of 20, 400 dive profiles and 2350 CTD profiles. Significant environmental influences on seal diving behaviour and habitat use were detected. Seals dived deeper, longer and increased their foraging effort during the day than at night with intermediate values for twilight. During the winter season the maximum dive depth decreased in association with an increase in dive duration, but foraging effort was unchanged. Seals spent more time at the bottom of their dives in shallow waters associated with relatively smooth bathymetry and dominated by Antarctic Surface Water. Considering the whole winter, Weddell seals tended to favour enriched, warmer and less dense water masses following their seasonal appearance on the shelf (Antarctic Surface Water and Modified Circumpolar Deep Water).

The orientation of ice crystals in cirrus is capable of having a strong impact on their radiative budget: a cirrus cloud composed of horizontally oriented ice crystals has a larger plane albedo than a cirrus cloud composed of randomly oriented particles. Until recently, space-borne sensors were not adapted to observe ice crystal orientations. The POLDER instrument onboard the ADEOS platform (October 1996 }June 1997) enabled us to observe bidirectional polarized radiances. These data are useful to determine the frequency of occurrence of ice crystals horizontally oriented in space within cirrus clouds. This paper describes how the POLDER bidirectional polarized radiances have been analyzed to determine the fraction of ice crystals preferably horizontally oriented.

Another aim is to develop theoretical models of the FPSO icing considering its dimensions and design features. The goal is to analyze all known anti – icing strategies, deicing and ice detection technologies for application and workability in the certain case of the Shtokman field. Finally possible affects of ice presence and icing on the FPSO productivity and stability are studied. The results of the work might be taken into account in further vessel’s design improvements and for efficient anti – icing strategies. One of several major features of the FPSO from icing point of view is sophisticated deck geometry with a number of deck structures of different height and width. Another issue is a presence of different equipment and engines that may act as sources of heat. This problem hasn’t been studied yet due to its specificity. The work combines both theoretical research basing on the new proposed mathematical model and numerical calculations of icing on the FPSO according to different international rules and standards.

40|$|China has {{overtaken}} the United States as the world’s largest {{producer of}} carbon dioxide, with industrial carbon emissions (ICE) accounting for approximately 65 % of the country’s total emissions. Understanding the ICE decoupling patterns and factors influencing the decoupling status {{is a prerequisite}} for balancing economic growth and carbon emissions. This paper provides an overview of ICE based on decoupling elasticity and the Tapio decoupling model. Furthermore, the study identifies the factors contributing to ICE changes in China, using the Kaya identity and Log Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) techniques. Based on the effects and contributions of ICE, we close with a number of recommendations. The results revealed a significant upward trend of ICE during the study period 1994 to 2013, with a total amount of 11, 147 million tons. Analyzing the decoupling relationship indicates that “weak decoupling” and “expansive decoupling” were the main states during the study period. The decomposition analysis showed that per capita wealth associated with industrial outputs and energy intensity are the main driving force of <b>ICE,</b> while energy <b>intensity</b> of industrial output and energy structure are major determinants for ICE reduction. The largest contributing cumulative effect to ICE is per capita wealth, at 1. 23 in 2013. This factor is followed by energy intensity, with a contributing cumulative effect of − 0. 32. The cumulative effects of energy structure and population are relatively small, at 0. 01 and 0. 08, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Large single {{crystals}} do {{allow for}} easy Raman spectroscopic identification, {{but do not}} give {{an indication of the}} bulk chemistry of the inclusion. Comparison of relative peak intensities in low-temperature Raman spectra of synthetic mixtures in the NaCl-CaCl 2 -H 2 O system allows for semi-quantitative estimates of the relative abundance of NaCl and CaCl 2 in some of the fluid inclusions studied. It was possible to obtain such spectra from very small, low salinity inclusions, although the peaks present in the spectra are of very low <b>intensity.</b> <b>Ice,</b> hydrohalite and antarcticite were detected by low-temperature LRS in inclusions from the South Platte fluorite-REE pegmatites, Colorado, however, only ice and hydrohalite were detected in inclusions from other environments, including the Mt. Pleasant Sn-W-Mo deposit, New Brunswick. These data confirm that the phase behaviour of fluid inclusions in these deposits can be modeled using the H 2 O-NaCl and H 2 O-NaCl-CaCl 2 systems. EDS/WDS analyses of fluid inclusion decrepitates from the deposits studied, generally agree with the Raman results but indicate the presence of small concentrations of K in some cases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{investigate}} the phenomenon of vessel icing in general and examine {{the problem for the}} Shtokman FPSO, which is now being designed to operate in severe conditions in the Barents Sea. Ice properties, <b>icing</b> conditions and <b>intensity,</b> geography of possible vessel icing are studied in details. Another aim is to develop theoretical models of the FPSO icing considering its dimensions and design features. The goal is to analyze all known anti – icing strategies, deicing and ice detection technologies for application and workability in the certain case of the Shtokman field. Finally possible affects of ice presence and icing on the FPSO productivity and stability are studied. The results of the work might be taken into account in further vessel’s design improvements and for efficient anti – icing strategies. One of several major features of the FPSO from icing point of view is sophisticated deck geometry with a number of deck structures of different height and width.

The observation of precipitation in the tropics has been greatly enhanced trough the launch of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite n 1997. TRMM'S ability to continuously and simultaneously observe precipitation processes with the first quantitative space-borne radar (the 13. 8 5 Hz Precipitation Radar), the TRMM Microwave Imager, and the Lightning Imaging Sensor has created a large database of high-resolution data for intercomparison. Focusing on the TRMM data set in two land and two ocean regions during August, September and October 1998, this study used radar retrievals and 85 GHz Polarization Corrected Temperatures (PCTs, which passively measure relative concentrations of precipitation-sized ice particles within a cloud system) to identify TRMM Precipitation Features (TPFs) greater than 75 km: in size. These features were classified by intensity criteria to identify Mesoscale Convective Systems, precipitation with PCTs below 250 K, and other features without PCTs below 250 K. Analysis of the TPFs revealed similar areas of features when the entire distribution was taken into account. However the TPFs with MCSs had significantly larger rain areas over the ocean than over land. Despite the larger rain areas, the ice scattering signatures < 250 K were similar over land and ocean, meaning more rain is falling outside of the ice scattering MCS area. Oceanic systems were much less intense in terms of their maximum height of the 30 dBZ contour and maximum reflectivity at 6 km altitude. Rainfall distributions for land and ocean storms were found to be very different when classified by intensity. Despite similar total rainfall over the four regions, the rainfall patterns differ among the land and ocean regions. Oceanic storms have a bimodal contribution to rainfall from two types of systems: very weak systems with little ice scattering and moderately strong systems that do not produce high lightning flash rates. Continental systems that produce the bulk of the rainfall as sampled are likely to have higher lightning flash rates, which is shown to be linked to stronger radar and <b>ice</b> scattering <b>intensities...</b>|$|R
30|$|Samples were {{prepared}} {{according to a}} standard two step procedure (Otto 1990). About 50  mg of young and fresh incompletely expanded leaf tissue of test sample and internal standard were co-chopped with a sharp razor blade in a plastic petridish containing 2  ml of ice-cold Otto I buffer (0.1  M citric acid, 0.5  % Tween 20). This was kept at − 4  °C for 40  min for releasing nuclei from cells to buffer. The nuclear suspension was filtered through a 40  µm Nylon mesh and centrifuged at 150 g for 5  min. Nuclei were gently resuspended in 100 µl of fresh Otto I buffer after removing the supernatant. 1  ml of Otto II buffer (0.4  M Na 2 HPO 4 · 12 H 2 O) supplemented with propidium iodide for absolute DNA content determination and RNase (both at a final concentration of 100  µg/ml) was added (Bures et al. 2003; Leong-Skornickova et al. 2007; Lysak et al. 2000; Palomino et al. 2003; Pecinka et al. 2006; Roux et al. 2003). All the sample preparation methods were done on <b>ice.</b> The fluorescence <b>intensity</b> of 5000 particles was recorded using a BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences, California, USA). Solanum lycopersicum L. Stupicke polni rane, Glycine max Merr. Polanka and Zea mays L. CE- 777 were used as internal reference standards to determine the genome size of cardamom and Z. mays L. CE- 777 {{was found to be}} appropriate reference standard there exist around a twofold variation between the mean peak intensity of the sample and the standard (Petr et al. 2012).
