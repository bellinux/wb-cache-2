40|$|Pinworms {{continue}} to beset modern rodent facilities, 4, 18, 19, 22 likely because the eggs of 2 species (Aspiculuris tetraptera and Syphacia muris) are environmentally persistent 25 and resistant to common disinfectants 8 while infections for all species {{can be difficult}} to detect due to intermittent shedding of eggs and reduction in parasite load with age. 20, 26 Although often thought to be merely nuisances 2 (older reports of rectal prolapse 11 did not rule out Helicobacter spp. or Citrobacter rodentium), pinworms can affect immunologic parameters, 1, 23 and their presence can inhibit <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>transfer</b> of mice for research collaborations. Once pinworms are detected, attempts at eradication are common. Of the available anthelminthics, fenbendazole in-corporated in the feed at 150 to 450 mg/kg, intermittently or continuously for as long as 8 wk, is a popular choice because of its ease of use and perceived safety, efficacy, and lack o...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{angioplasty}} {{is increasingly}} being advocated as the pre-ferred approach for treating acute ST-segment elevation myocar-dial infarction {{regardless of whether}} <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>transfer</b> is required. This review critically analyzes the evidence comparing primary angioplasty with thrombolytic therapy and concludes that reasonable health care professionals may still find considerable uncertainty about the superiority of primary angioplasty for all situations. The magnitude of benefit for primary angioplasty over thrombolysis is probably less than 1 to 2 lives saved/ 100 patients treated and largely depends on the choice of thrombolytic agent, time to treatment, place of treatment, and adjunctive therapy. There {{is little evidence that}} systematically transferring patients for primary angioplasty in routine practice will provide any health benefits over thrombolysis. Consequently, it may be most useful to view these treatments as complementary rather than competi-tive. Thrombolysis remains a clinically and economically attractive option for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction that does not require the radical restructuring of our health care systems.

40|$|Context Anemia is {{a common}} problem in {{critically}} ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), but the consequences of anemia on morbidity and mortality in the. critically ill is poorly defined. Objectives To prospectively define the incidence of anemia and use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in critically ill patients and to explore the potential benefits and risks associated with transfusion in the ICU. Design Prospective observational study conducted November 1999, with 2. components: a blood sampling study and an, anemia and blood transfusion study. Setting and Patients The blood sampling study included 1136 patients from 145 western European ICUs, and the anemia and blood transfusion study included 3534 patients from 146 western European ICUs. Patients were followed up for 28 days or until hospital discharge, <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>transfer,</b> or death. Main Outcome Measures Frequency of blood drawing and associated volume of blood drawn, collected over a 24 -hour period; hemoglobin levels, transfusion rate, organ dysfunction (assessed using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score), and mortality, collected throughout a 2 -week period. Results The mean (SD) volume per blood draw was 10. 3 (6. 6) mL, with an average total volume of 41. 1 (39. 7) mL during the 24 -hour period. There was {{a positive correlation between}} organ dysfunction and the number of blood draws (r= 0. 34; P<. 001) and total volume drawn (r= 0. 28; P<. 001). The mean hemoglobin concentration at ICU admission was 11. 3 (2. 3) g/dL, with 29 % (963 / 3295) having a concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The transfusion rate during the ICU period was 37. 0 % (1307 / 3534). Older patients and those with a longer ICU length of stay were more commonly transfused. Both ICU and overall mortality rates were significantly higher in patients who had vs had not received a transfusion (ICU rates: 18. 5 % vs 10. 1 %, respectively; chi(2) = 50. 1; P<. 001; overall rates: 29. 0 % vs 14. 9 %, respectively; chi(2) = 88. 1; P<. 001). For similar degrees of organ dysfunction, patients who had a transfusion had a higher mortality rate. For matched patients in the propensity analysis, the 28 -day mortality was 22. 7 % among patients with transfusions and 17. 1 % among those without (P=. 02); the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test confirmed this difference. Conclusions This multicenter observational study reveals the common occurrence of anemia and the large use of blood transfusion in critically ill patients. Additionally, this epidemiologic study provides evidence of an association between transfusions and diminished organ function as well as between transfusions and mortality...|$|E
40|$|This report details a focus group's {{efforts to}} {{ascertain}} if the Articulation System Stimulating <b>Interinstitutional</b> Student <b>Transfer</b> (ASSIST) implemented on the World Wide Web {{was easy for}} students to navigate and use. Another purpose of the analysis was to discover if the information contained within ASSIST was easily understood by community college students. ASSIST is a Web-based transfer planning tool that shows students courses they must complete at California community colleges {{so that they can}} successfully transfer to a California state university or University of California campus. Since its inception as a voluntary, pilot activity in 1985, ASSIST has grown substantially and has evolved into California's official repository of transfer and articulation information. A survey, an interactive packet, and focus group interviews were used to collect data regarding the usability/navigability and content of the ASSIST Web site, {{as well as on the}} format and content of articulation contained within the ASSIST database...|$|R
