5|$|Soon, blue whales {{were being}} hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), Newfoundland (1898), and Spitsbergen (1903). In 1904–05 the first blue whales were taken off South Georgia. By 1925, {{with the advent}} of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> and sub-Antarctic began to {{increase}} dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> alone. By the end of World War II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.|$|E
5|$|Three types {{have been}} {{documented}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic.</b> Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to the types described below is difficult.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{population}} {{estimates are}} uncertain, but recent consensus suggests an absolute minimum of 50,000.

5|$|Another study {{analysed}} {{the tissues}} of Adamussium colbecki and compared them {{with those of}} Pecten jacobaeus, a temperate water species of scallop. It was found that copper, iron, cadmium and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the Antarctic scallop. Cadmium levels in particular were higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> scallop than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in the kidney, were considerably lower.|$|E
5|$|During the Antarctic {{winter of}} 1902 Discovery became {{locked in the}} ice. Efforts to free her {{during the summer of}} 1902–03 failed, and {{although}} some of the expedition's members (including Ernest Shackleton) left in a relief ship, Crean and the majority of the party remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> until the ship was finally freed in February 1904. After returning to regular naval duty, Crean was promoted to petty officer, first class, on Scott's recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Humpback whales were hunted {{as early}} as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean {{and to a lesser extent}} in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century {{introduction}} of the explosive harpoon allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic,</b> {{species were}} found in the South Shetland Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula. Species from the Antarctic or subantarctic regions are rarer than {{specimens}} in the Arctic regions, although lack of access may be a factor. Until 1983, only five records were made, with only individual finds since then. According to two studies of the myxomycete flora of these regions, more species were discovered in the subantarctic forests, for example 67 species in Argentinian Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and 22 on high ground on Macquarie Island.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's first Antarctic {{experience}} was as second officer on Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09. Shortly {{after his arrival}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic,</b> a shipboard accident destroyed his right eye, and he {{was sent back to}} New Zealand. He returned in 1909 to participate in the later stages of the expedition; his will and determination in adversity impressed Shackleton, and led to his Ross Sea party appointment in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Sea ice extent expands {{annually}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> {{winter and}} most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The extent of sea ice around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the whaling ban, studies have examined whether the conservation reliant global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic,</b> best estimates show an increase of 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels. Recovery varies regionally, and the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population (historically a relatively small proportion of the global total) has rebounded to about 2,200 individuals, an estimated 97% of its pre-hunting population.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The southern rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Species in {{this order}} have a small, {{inflexible}} disc and 6–20 long, thin arms, which they use for suspension feeding. They {{have a single}} series of marginal plates, a fused ring of disc plates, a reduced number of aboral plates, crossed pedicellariae, and several series of long spines on the arms. They live almost exclusively in deep-sea habitats, although a few live in shallow waters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic.</b> In some species, the tube feet have rounded tips and lack suckers.|$|E
