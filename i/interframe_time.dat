A direct impact Hopkinson bar (DIHB) was used to measure the polymer stress-strain curves at this strain rate at both temperatures. High-speed photography (<b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> 7 µs) was a major tool in determining the fracture strain at both temperatures, particularly for those polymers that had such large failure strains that they did not fail within the time window of the DIHB (285 µs) ...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the time-resolved analysis of high-speed sequences of particle images is presented. The proposed method aims at the minimization of PIV {{errors in the}} lower velocity range by adjusting locally and dynamically the <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> interval of the PIV pairs in a recorded high-speed sequence. The algorithm performs the operation on a local basis, thus providing {{the same level of}} accuracy across the full velocity dynamic range of the flow. The present results indicate a greater performance than state-of-the-art PIV analysis based on multi-grid offset PIV and is successfully applied to synthetic and real flow cases.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose and {{investigate}} {{the performance of a}} multi-channel scheduling algorithm based on the well-known deficit round-robin (DRR), which we call multi-channel DRR (MCDRR). We extend the original DRR to the case of multiple channels with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers to provide efficient fair queueing in hybrid time division multiplexing (TDM) /wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. We take into account the availability of channels and tunable transmitters in extending the DRR and allow the overlap of `rounds' in scheduling to efficiently utilize channels and tunable transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed MCDRR can provide nearly perfect fairness with ill-behaved flows for different sets of conditions for <b>interframe</b> <b>times</b> and frame sizes in hybrid TDM/WDM optical networks with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers.

30|$|The working {{principle}} of this HFD-MAC {{is based on}} the distributed coordination function (DCF) in IEEE 802.11. This protocol uses CSMA/CA and a back-off mechanism to access the channel and to avoid collisions. For simplicity, the DCF <b>interframe</b> space (DIFS) <b>time</b> and back-off time are not shown in the figures, but the short <b>interframe</b> space (SIFS) <b>time</b> is shown by “S” in all of the figures. In this MAC, a node ignores collisions or the reception of erroneous packets during the NAV period. Moreover, it is assumed that FDNs can perform self-interference cancelation perfectly.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years several {{observations}} have been made of compressive failure in glass by a so called fracture wave. A high-speed photographic study has been conducted in order to observe the propagation of fracture waves in glass. Streak and framing photography have been used to determine details of the wave speed and surface structure of fracture waves induced in glasses by planar impact. A 50 mm single stage gas gun was used to launch copper flyer plates at velocities of up to 1 km s- 1. A computer controlled high-speed camera was used capable of exposure and <b>interframe</b> <b>times</b> from 50 ns upwards. Simultaneous measurements of the longitudinal stresses were made using manganin pressure gauges embedded in the samples. Results will be presented showing separation between the shock and fracture fronts suggesting that the failure mechanism is by compression rather than resulting from relief waves propagating from the free surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in high-voltage switching developed {{in this project}} allow a camera user to rapidly vary the number of output frames from 1 to 25. A high-voltage, variable-amplitude pulse train shifts the deflection location to the new frame location during the interlude between frames, making multiple frame counts and locations possible. The final deflection circuit deflects to five different frame positions per axis, including the center position, making {{for a total of}} 25 frames. To create the preset voltages, electronically adjustable {+-} 500 V power supplies were chosen. Digital-to-analog converters provide digital control of the supplies. The power supplies are clamped to {+-} 400 V so as not to exceed the voltage ratings of the transistors. A field-programmable gated array (FPGA) receives the trigger signal and calculates the combination of plate voltages for each frame. The <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> and number of frames are specified by the user, but are limited by the camera electronics. The variable-frame circuit shifts the plate voltages of the first frame to those of the second frame during the user-specified <b>interframe</b> <b>time.</b> Designed around an electrostatic image tube, a framing camera images the light present during each frame (at the photocathode) onto the tube’s phosphor. The phosphor persistence allows the camera to display multiple frames on the phosphor at one time. During this persistence, a CCD camera is triggered and the analog image is collected digitally. The tube functions by converting photons to electrons at the negatively charged photocathode. The electrons move quickly toward the more positive charge of the phosphor. Two sets of deflection plates skew the electron’s path in horizontal and vertical (x axis and y axis, respectively) directions. Hence, each frame’s electrons bombard the phosphor surface at a controlled location defined by the voltages on the deflection plates. To prevent the phosphor from being exposed between frames, the image tube is gated off between exposures...|$|E
40|$|The short pulse duration, small {{effective}} source {{size and}} high flux of synchrotron radiation is ideally suited for probing {{a wide range}} of transient deformation processes in materials under extreme conditions. In this paper, the challenges of high-resolution time-resolved indirect X-ray detection are reviewed in the context of dynamic synchrotron experiments. In particular, the discussion is targeted at two-dimensional integrating detector methods, such as those focused on dynamic radiography and diffraction experiments. The response of a scintillator to periodic synchrotron X-ray excitation is modelled and validated against experimental data collected at the Diamond Light Source (DLS) and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). An upper bound on the dynamic range accessible in a time-resolved experiment for a given bunch separation is calculated for a range of scintillators. New bunch structures are suggested for DLS and ESRF using the highest-performing commercially available crystal LYSO:Ce, allowing time-resolved experiments with an <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> of 189 ?ns and a maximum dynamic range of 98 (6. 6 bits) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSilicon carbide {{ceramics}} {{are generally}} used in armour configurations for the foot-soldier or military vehicles. However, their behaviour during impact {{is not fully}} understood. In this work, the dynamic fragmentation of silicon carbide has been characterised through different impact configurations: Edge-on impact tests and normal impact tests have been conducted in open and sarcophagus configuration. In the first configuration, an ultra-high speed camera is used to visualise the fragmentation process with an <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> set to 1 pis. The sarcophagus configuration provides a post-mortem view of the damage pattern. Moreover, a comparison with numerical results given by an anisotropic damage model shows a good capacity to predict the damage patterns and the cracking densities of the ceramic after impact but also the damage kinetics observed during impact. In addition, an original impact configuration is proposed for characterising the dynamic behaviour of a pre-fragmented ceramic. The tests have been compared to experiments performed with a plane aluminium alloy target. The results underline the good penetration resistance of the fragmented ceramic...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} introduces tomographic shadowgraphy, {{a volume}} resolving imaging technique which {{is capable of}} recovering the liquid phase of a spray both spatially and temporally. The method {{is based on a}} multiple view camera setup with inline illumination provided by current pulsed LEDs which results in droplet shadows being projected onto the sensor plane. Each camera records image pairs with short <b>interframing</b> <b>times</b> which allows the trajectories of the individual droplets to be estimated using conventional three-dimensional particle tracking approaches. The observed volume is calibrated with a traversed micro target. A comparison is made between several photogrammetric and polynomial least square camera calibration techniques regarding their accuracy in deep volume calibration at magnifications close to unity. A calibration method based on volume calibration from multiple planar homographies at equally spaced z-planes was found to produce the most reliable calibration. Sequential combination of back-projected images at each voxel plane efficiently reproduces the droplet positions in three-dimensional space. The quality of spray reconstruction is investigated using experimental data from multiple view shadowgraphs of a hollow cone spray...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Doppler {{ultrasound}} {{is standard}} for measurements of blood velocity. Aninherent limitation is that Doppler methods only measure the velocity parallelto the ultrasound beam. In Ultrasound Image Velocimetry (UIV) regions of two sequential B-mode images are cross-correlated to calculate 2 -D velocity vectors. UIV results {{were compared with}} Doppler and transit-time flow measurements. Methods: In vitro experiments were performed in a pulsatile flow loop. Theworking fluid was water/glycerol with ultrasound contrast agent (microbubbles). The latex tube was imaged using an Ultrasonix RP 500 and a novelimaging sequence was used to interleave two ultrasound frames, enabling ashort and variable (0. 3 - 39 ms) <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> separation (δt). A rabbit wasanaesthetised and imaged through the abdomen, with microbubbles administered via the ear vein. Radiofrequency data were post-processed offlineusing in-house code which calculates the local correlation between successiveframes, then sums correlation results for identical phases of all cardiaccycles. Results: Peak velocities > 2 m/s were accurately measured across the entirefield-of-view in vitro, while peak systolic velocities in the rabbit were 0. 99 m/sand 1. 04 m/s with UIV and Doppler respectively. As δt was increased flow instability during deceleration caused the UIV velocity measurement to drop to zero. Comparing velocity measurements of decelerating flow with different values of δt leads to a new method for investigating flow instability. Conclusions: With short δt UIV and derived flow rates agreed excellently withDoppler and transit time flow rates...|$|E
40|$|Benefiting {{from the}} {{development}} of increasingly advanced high speed cameras, flow visualization and analysis nowadays yield detailed data of the flow field in many applications. Notwithstanding this progress, for high speed and supersonic flows {{it is still not}} trivial to capture high quality images. In this study we present a Schlieren setup that uses pulsed LEDs with high currents (up to 18 Ampere) to increase the optical output to sufficient levels. The bright and short pulses, down to 130 nanoseconds, allow detailed and sharp imaging of the flow with a high spatial resolution adequate for supersonic flow. The pulse circuit and pulse width determination are explained in detail. As a test case we studied the near field of a 2 mm diameter sonic jet injected transversely into a supersonic cross flow. This is a model flow for fuel injection in scramjet engines, which is not yet fully understood. Owing to the high resolution and accuracy of the images produced by the newly developed system we prove the existence of a large (density) gradient wave traveling in the windward subsonic region between the Mach barrel and the bowshock, which hitherto was observed only in some numerical studies but not yet shown in experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate with this Schlieren setup that time-correlated images can be obtained, with an <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> of 2 microseconds, so that also flow unsteadiness can be studied such as the movement of shock waves and trajectories of vortices. The obtained results of the jet penetration height are presented as a power law correlation. The results of this study show that the designed setup using a low-cost LED and low-cost control system is a high potential option for application in visualization studies of high speed flows.

40|$|Engineers are {{increasingly}} applying polymers in structures {{that have to}} withstand impact. However, compared to metals, relatively few studies of their mechanical properties at high rates of deformation have been carried out. Ibis paper describes {{an investigation of the}} high strain-rate behaviour in compression of a number of widely used polymeric materials. The necessity of proper materials characterization is discussed, as the variation of commercial grades bearing the same name is considerable. Also polymers are much more susceptible to change during storage than, for example, metals. A knowledge of thermal properties is important when considering rapid (and hence adiabatic) deformation, and tables of such properties are presented. Extensive use was made of high-speed photography (<b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> 7  μs) to study qualitatively the behaviour of solid discs of polymers at strain rates of 2. 5 × 103  s- 1 both at room temperature (300  K) and at 100  K. The framing speed was sufficiently fast to capture fracture initiation and subsequent failure of all the polymers studied, including polycarbonate (PC) which fails in an almost explosive manner at a natural strain of ca. 1. 1.  PC was also seen to fail at this level of strain at 100  K. Quantitatively, this technique was used to check the applicability of Avitzur's analysis of a deforming annulus to polymers. Agreement was found to be good and hence friction could be measured during deformation at high rates of strain. The best lubricant (i. e. the one that reduces friction closest to zero) was found to be petroleum jelly. Similar studies were also carried out at low strain rates using an Instron mechanical testing machine. Agreement with Avitzur's analysis was found to be poorer, and no lubricant was found to reduce friction below about 3 - 4 %. Higher strain rates were achieved using two sizes of direct impact Hopkinson bars, both developed in this laboratory. Care was taken to eliminate sources of error, including friction and calibration errors. In addition, a study was carried out into unlubricated deformation at strain rates of 103  s- 1 using specimens of different thickness. Each polymer was found to have a different variation of friction with thickness, some showing zero friction. The strain rate sensitivity of the yield stress of lubricated polymers varied in the range 5 - 15  MPa per decade of strain rate at room temperature. However, many showed some softening as the strain rate was raised from 103 to 104  s- 1. The stress-strain response of polymers to deformation at strain rates of 103  s- 1 at 100  K was also investigated...|$|E

30|$|Each {{transmitted}} MAC {{frame in}} wireless LANs should be promptly acknowledged, {{after a short}} <b>interframe</b> space (SIFS) <b>time</b> interval, if it has been correctly delivered to the receiving station (only unicast frames are acknowledged). Nonetheless, random errors and collisions due to the channel contention mechanism can corrupt the transmission of the original frame or of its returning ACK, and consequently, the ACK frame might not be received; so, the sender has to enter a new contention phase of the wireless channel for gaining the opportunity to retransmit the unacknowledged packet, until a maximum number of attempts (i.e., retry limit parameter) is achieved.|$|R
40|$|A new {{application}} of a fast CCD drift scanning technique {{that allows us to}} perform speckle imaging of binary stars is presented. For each observation, an arbitrary number of speckle frames is periodically stored on a computer disk, each with an appropriate exposure time given both atmospheric and instrumental considerations. The CCD charge is shifted towards the serial register and read out sufficiently rapidly to avoid an excessive amount of <b>interframe</b> dead <b>time.</b> Four well-known binary systems (ADS 755, ADS 2616, ADS 3711 and ADS 16836) are observed in to show the feasibility of the proposed technique.

A new approach for self-calibrating this analysis is also presented and validated.

30|$|Finally, we {{compared}} {{the differences between the}} Matlab and the NS 2 results. One possible explanation for the differences is that even though we did account for overhead in Matlab, we were unable to model some types of overhead, such as the random amount of time a node backs off after a successful transmission, because linear programs require fixed amounts of flow on each link. Instead, we assumed that the channels only sit idle for the minimum amount of <b>interframe</b> space <b>time</b> between transmissions when we calculated the effective data rate on each of the links. This is not the case in NS- 2. After the AP finishes transmitting a packet, 802.11 's binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism requires that the transceiver sit idle in order to give other nodes a chance to access the channel. Upon receiving either an RTSBC or an RACK frame, the AP counts this as a successful transmission, and must give other nodes a chance to transmit before it sends its next packet. Since we underestimated the overhead, the improvement in throughput seen in reality will be lower than that calculated by Matlab, which does match with our results.|$|R

A simulation of the laboratory test is developed using the artificial workload parameters and the 802. 3 CSMA/CD standard of the Consultative Committee for International Telephony and Telegraphy (CCITT).

50|$|Since {{the setup}} of HS {{transactions}} over an EfEx channel occurs between the HS transfers themselves, like the implementations of STANAG 3910 that {{wait for the}} preceding HS transfer to complete before initiating the next, the maximum bandwidth is necessarily less than 20 Mbps; though it is {{higher than that of}} this type of STANAG 3910 channel, because the HS control formats on the HS channel require less time than those on the LS channel. However, where a STANAG 3910 channel implementation performs the setup of an HS transfer in parallel with the preceding one, an implementation of STANAG 3910 could provide a very slightly higher throughput than an EfEX implementation, even allowing for the longest possible transmission of the HS message at the lowest possible data transmission rate. Also, assuming that the RTs met the requirements of the standard for a minimum 4 μs <b>interframe</b> gap <b>time,</b> this should have meant modifying only the BC to predict the end times of the HS messages, and initiate the HS control just before this; rather than modifying both the BC and multiple RTs to send and receive HS control formats on the HS channel.|$|R
30|$|The MAC {{layer of}} the 802.11 {{standard}} {{is based on the}} CSMA/CA mechanism [2, 3]. Collision avoidance is achieved through a distributed coordination function (DCF) that specifies the timing rules of accessing the wireless medium. Stations running DCF have to wait for an <b>interframe</b> space (IFS) <b>time</b> before they can access the wireless medium. The IFS is frame-type dependent. An arbitration IFS (AIFS) is used for data frames. The access point (AP) uses a PIFS (point coordination function IFS), which is shorter than AIFS, for management and polling messages; therefore, it can interrupt normal contention and take over the channel to create periods of contention free access called controlled access phase (CAP). As a result, the timeline of a WLAN can be viewed as being always in contention mode, interrupted occasionally by AP controlled CAPs.|$|R
