5|$|Syria {{missed a}} 15 March {{deadline}} for destroying its 12 chemical weapons production facilities. Syria has proposed to instead render the facilities inoperable by sealing their entrances; the U.S. {{and its allies}} oppose this proposal and <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> destruction.|$|E
5|$|Mohandar {{tried to}} <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> only sending Nerazim to the sanctuary, but Selendis talked him into {{allowing}} {{a small number}} of templar warriors to accompany the expedition. He agreed, but only if there was no disrespect. Vartanil went along with them, and (much to Mohandar's annoyance) so did Dahl. Mohandar pointed out the protoss were still evaluating her, a terran female.|$|E
5|$|Molly Haskell {{has argued}} that nevertheless, women are mostly {{uncritical}} of the scene, and that by and large it is consistent with what women have in mind if they fantasize about being raped. Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett {{to take the initiative}} and <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> having sexual intercourse.|$|E
50|$|Ōno {{consulted}} {{his principal}} retainer, Ōishi Yoshio. Ōno <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> surrendering to the Tokugawa shogunate, whereas Ōishi and other retainers <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> defending the castle. However, Ōno <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> {{the necessity of}} distributing remaining money according to annual earnings, while Ōishi <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> favoring those with lower incomes. It was distributed according to Ōishi's wish.|$|R

60|$|There was no {{satisfying}} Miss Sampson with rides, new places, new faces, new adventures. And {{every time}} we rode out she <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> first riding through Linrock; and {{every time we}} rode home she <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> going back that way.|$|R
5|$|Only one of {{the small}} {{detachment}} of marines on board participated in the mutiny. While the half-dozen remaining were too outnumbered and taken by surprise to fulfill their role of shipboard police and oppose the mutineers, they did <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> being treated as prisoners of war by the Spanish and were accordingly exchanged six months later, along with the surviving warrant officers.|$|E
5|$|At the {{marriage}} venue, Govindayya plots revenge by inciting Venkatapathy to <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the dowry being paid before {{the marriage}}. Viyyanna issues a promisory note; Venkatapathy rejects it and drags Ramana from the marriage hall. However, Ramana leaves for Madras and lives there with Ammadu. When Venkatapathy arrives, Ramana feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja {{pretend to be}} a nurse and a doctor. Ammadu endears herself to Venkatapathy by showing interest in his recitals of the puranas.|$|E
5|$|In 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, prior of {{the monastery}} of St. Andrew in Rome, to England as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by Augustine, landed on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. According to Bede, Æthelberht was {{sufficiently}} distrustful of the newcomers to <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> meeting them under the open sky, {{to prevent them from}} performing sorcery. The monks impressed Æthelberht, but he was not converted immediately. He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Heribert Schwan Helmut Kohl's biographer {{described}} Richter as [...] "more than conservative, rather German National", {{and said}} she <b>insists</b> <b>on</b> the right to [...] "interpretational sovereignty" [...] in relation to Kohl's life and that she has <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> many proven falsehoods.|$|R
50|$|These changes had no {{long-term}} significance because Zhang and Mao {{disagreed with the}} direction of the army. Zhang <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> going southwest, while Mao <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> going northwards, towards Shaanxi. No agreement was reached, and the two armies eventually split, each going their separate ways.|$|R

5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} left {{to devise a}} Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically {{in a state of}} chaos and urged him to use his leverage to <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{included}} lyrics in {{more of his}} compositions at this point, {{although these}} were sometimes regarded as doggerel or proselytizing. The first album to contain vocals, That Healin' Feelin' (1970), was commercially unsuccessful and Silver had to <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the support of Blue Note executives to continue releasing music of the same, new style. They agreed to a further two albums that contained vocals and Silver on an RMI electric keyboard; the three were later compiled as The United States of Mind, but were soon dropped from the catalog.|$|E

50|$|From the outset, {{the musical}} director, Richard Galloway, <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> auditioning {{everyone}} interested in joining, and <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> high vocal quality {{and level of}} professionalism from company members. Despite this, for the company's first full-scale production from 1979, Bizet's Carmen, a cast of 54 took to the stage, accompanied by a 37-piece orchestra.|$|R
5|$|The {{action would}} prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley {{had tried to}} <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E
5|$|The folly and {{absurdity of}} the Queen in {{allowing}} this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may {{occur on the}} occasion. The idea... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us {{in the eyes of}} Europe.|$|E
5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E
50|$|In 1569, when Royal Prussia's estates {{agreed to}} {{incorporate}} the region into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the city <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> preserving its special status. It defended itself through the costly Siege of Danzig in 1577 {{in order to preserve}} special privileges, and subsequently <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> negotiating by sending emissaries directly to the Polish king.|$|R

5|$|As the House of Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} on-site inspections. The two sides disagreed over the number of black boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three. On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E

5|$|Rowson cites as {{an example}} of the last {{phenomenon}} the well-regarded Zaitsev Variation of the Ruy Lopez. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 (initiating the Zaitsev Variation), White can repeat moves once with 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. This puts Black in an awkward situation, since he must either (a) <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the Zaitsev with 12...Re8, which allows White to choose whether to draw by threefold repetition with 13.Ng5 Rf8 14.Nf3, or play on with a different move, or (b) play a different (and possibly inferior) variation by playing something other than 12...Re8.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} {{statements of the}} beliefs of Reformed churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in the Supper. They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{was obliged}} to state {{the terms of the}} armistice. He demanded the {{dissolution}} of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to <b>insist</b> <b>on</b> the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Zurich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence. The first Land Peace of Kappel, der erste Landfriede, ended the war on 24 June.|$|E
