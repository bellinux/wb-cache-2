5|$|Some {{activities}} {{that were once}} considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, {{have been removed from}} the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants,</b> at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What entertainment is for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} of the frieze begins at the southwest corner where the procession appears to divide into two separate files. The first third of the west frieze {{is not part of}} the procession, but instead, seems to be the preparatory stages <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants.</b> The first figure here is a marshal dressing, W30, followed by several men preparing the horses W28–23 until figure W22 who, it has been suggested, may be engaged in the dokimasia, the tryout or enrollment of the knights. W24 is an ambiguous figure who might be either the protesting owner of a rejected horse or a keryx (herald) whose hand held part of an otherwise lost salpinx (trumpet), but either way this point marks the beginning of the procession proper.|$|E

5|$|This year, {{the first}} ever EA Sports Jersey Creator Contest was held to design the jerseys for both the rookie and the sophomore team. The contest called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> {{to come up with}} a computer-generated jersey design that would replace the {{individual}} team jerseys worn by the players during the Rookie Challenge. Of 12,000 participants, 18-year-old Tim Ahmed, a freshman at Baruch College, won the contest. Ahmed won a free trip to Phoenix and a chance to meet players. This marks the first time that a fan-designed uniform has ever been worn during an NBA game or NBA event. The Sophomores wore fan-designed white jerseys and the Rookies wore fan-designed purple jerseys in the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants,</b> and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
5|$|The first {{atomic bombs}} were {{developed}} by the wartime Manhattan Project. This {{was carried out in}} secret, lest its discovery induce the Axis powers, particularly Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects, or undertake covert operations against the project. The military and scientific leaders of the Manhattan Project anticipated a need to release details of their wartime accomplishments, principally as a form of recognition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> who had labored in secrecy. Press releases were prepared in advance of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and an official account, known as the Smyth Report after its author, the physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth, was commissioned in April 1944 to provide a history of the project for public release. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie Groves, his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman, and Smyth agreed that information could be publicly released if it was essential for an understanding of the project, or was already generally known or deducible, or had no significance to the production of atomic bombs. The first copies went on sale on August 12, 1945.|$|E

5|$|The website asserts to its {{visitors}} {{that all}} performers engaged in sexual activities {{depicted in the}} videos appear of their own volition and feel bliss and gratification from the experience. The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview that Fucking Machines {{did not have a}} focus on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants.</b> By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey.|$|E

30|$|Participants {{completed}} seven {{tasks that}} were classified {{into one of}} three security levels: Low, Medium and High based on the general level of privacy or sensitivity a particular task warranted.

The transparent authentication mechanism needs to have that level of confidence that <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> is indeed <b>the</b> authorized device owner. Since the experiment does not last long enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> to build up a device confidence of sufficient level, the device confidence was initially set to “Low” and <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> was instructed to assume that it was based on previous interaction with the device.|$|R
