5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the <b>earthshine</b> which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E
25|$|The {{phase curve}} of the Earth has not been {{determined}} as accurately as those for Mercury and Venus because its integrated brightness is difficult to measure from the surface. Instead of direct observation, <b>earthshine</b> reflected from {{the portion of the}} Moon not lit by the Sun has served as a proxy. A few direct measurements of the Earth's luminosity have been obtained with the EPOXI spacecraft. While they do not cover much of the phase curve they reveal a rotational light curve caused by the transit of dark oceans and bright land masses across the hemisphere. P. Goode and colleagues at Big Bear Solar Observatory have measured the <b>earthshine</b> and T. Livengood of NASA analyzed the EPOXI data.|$|E
500|$|Aristarchus, {{named after}} the Greek {{astronomer}} Aristarchus of Samos, is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the northwest part of the Moon's near side. It is considered the brightest of the large formations on the lunar surface, with an albedo nearly double that of most lunar features. The feature is bright enough to be {{visible to the naked}} eye, and displays unusually bright features when viewed through a large telescope. It is also readily identified when most of the lunar surface is illuminated by <b>earthshine.</b> The crater is larger than the Grand Canyon.|$|E
500|$|One rather complex {{task that}} falls to STScI is {{scheduling}} observations for the telescope. Hubble is in a low-Earth orbit to enable servicing missions, but {{this means that}} most astronomical targets are occulted by the Earth for slightly {{less than half of}} each orbit. Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly due to elevated radiation levels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations of Mercury), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50°, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, however, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), at roughly 90° to the plane of Hubble's orbit, in which targets are not occulted for long periods. Due to the precession of the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks. Because the [...] of the Earth is always within about 30° of regions within the CVZ, the brightness of scattered <b>earthshine</b> may be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Monnerie, I remember, was in {{an unusually}} vivacious humour at that meal; and devoured immense {{quantities}} of salmon mayonnaise. One might have supposed that Fanny's influence had added a slim crescent of silvery light to her habitual <b>earthshine.</b> None the less, when our guest was gone, she seemed to subside into a shallow dejection; and I into a much deeper. We sate on together in an uneasy silence, she pushing out her lips, restlessly prodding Cherry with her foot, and occasionally uttering some inarticulate sound that was certainly not intended as conversation.|$|E
60|$|At last I felt my moonward start was sufficient. I {{shut out}} {{the sight of the}} moon from my eyes, and in a state of mind that was, I now recall, {{incredibly}} free from anxiety or any distressful quality, I sat down to begin a vigil in that little speck of matter in infinite space that would last until I should strike the earth. The heater had made the sphere tolerably warm, the air had been refreshed by the oxygen, and except for that faint congestion of the head that was always with me while I was away from earth, I felt entire physical comfort. I had extinguished the light again, lest it should fail me in the end; I was in darkness, save for the <b>earthshine</b> and the glitter of the stars below me. Everything was so absolutely silent and still that I might indeed have been the only being in the universe, and yet, strangely enough, I had no more feeling of loneliness or fear than if I had been lying in bed on earth. Now, this seems all the stranger to me, since during my last hours in that crater of the moon, the sense of my utter loneliness had been an agony....|$|E
50|$|In {{preparation}} for these missions, astronomers have performed detailed <b>earthshine</b> observations, since <b>earthshine</b> has the spectroscopic characteristics of light {{reflected by the}} Earth. Astronomers have paid particular attention to whether <b>earthshine</b> measurement can detect the red edge, a spectral feature that is due to plants. The detection of a similar spectral feature in light from an extrasolar planet would be particularly interesting, since it {{might be due to}} a light-harvesting organism. While the red edge is almost certainly the easiest way to directly detect life on Earth via <b>earthshine</b> observations, it could be extremely difficult to interpret a similar feature due to life on another planet, since the wavelength of the spectral feature is not known in advance (unlike most atomic or molecular spectral features).|$|E

50|$|Another {{interesting}} phenomenon visible {{with the}} naked eye is <b>Earthshine.</b> Best visible shortly before or after new a moon (during the waning and waxing crescent phases respectively), <b>Earthshine</b> is the faint glow of the non-illuminated (night) side of the Moon caused by sunlight reflecting off the surface of Earth (which would appear nearly full to an observer situated on the Moon at this time) and onto the night side of the Moon. By the time the Moon reaches first its quarter however, the sunlight illuminated portion of the Moon becomes far too bright for <b>Earthshine</b> to be seen {{with the naked}} eye, however it can still be observed telescopically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Earthshine</b> {{is used to}} help {{determine}} the current albedo of the Earth. The data are used to analyze global cloud cover, a climate factor. Oceans reflect {{the least amount of}} light, roughly 10%. Land reflects anywhere from 10-25% of the Sun's light, and clouds reflect around 50%. So, the part of the Earth where it is daytime and from which the Moon is visible determines how bright the Moon's <b>earthshine</b> appears at any given time.|$|E
