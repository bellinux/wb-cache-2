5|$|According to {{consolidated}} {{figures the}} episode was watched by 3.28 million viewers on its BBC two debut, aggregated to 4.74 million viewers after {{taking into consideration}} two repeat broadcasts the same week. Reviews of the episode ranged from mostly negative to very positive. Most commentators praised the larger role of Rhys in the episode, the performance of actor Kai Owen and the realism of the acting and dialogue overall. However, {{a large proportion of}} reviewers criticised the special effects used to create the alien and it was subsequently compared by some to resembling a sock puppet or <b>hand</b> <b>puppet.</b> Whilst some reviewers identified with the plight of the alien, others felt that its poor realisation meant that it was hard to feel any sympathy for it.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} <b>hand</b> <b>puppet</b> mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage {{at the top of}} a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} day of filming on June 23 was {{predominantly}} shot on the set representing {{the bridge of the}} Enterprise. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay. One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a <b>hand</b> <b>puppet</b> controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up her skirt throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.|$|E

The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha-Streisand, a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his hermaphroditic mother was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher Mr. Garrison and Garrison's old <b>hand</b> <b>puppet</b> Mr. Hat, who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends.|$|E

500|$|... "The Springfield Connection" [...] {{was written}} by Jonathan Collier and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. According to Collier, {{the inspiration for the}} episode was former The Simpsons executive producer Mike Reiss' wife. At one point, she had seriously decided that she wanted to become a police officer but it did not happen. The joke where the police officers laugh at Marge for a long time was pitched by David Mirkin and features a [...] "crazy twist" [...] at the end where Wiggum says [...] "welcome aboard". Mirkin liked the joke so much that he repeated it again {{at the end of the}} episode. Marge uses a [...] "McGriff the crime dog" [...] <b>hand</b> <b>puppet</b> who says [...] "Help me bite crime". The <b>hand</b> <b>puppet</b> is a homage to McGruff the Crime Dog [...] the producers had wanted to use the real McGruff, but could not get permission to use the character. The idea to have a counterfeit jeans ring was pitched because at the time there had been an explosion in the jeans market, and David Mirkin thought it was right to satirize it.|$|E
500|$|Although these {{elements}} {{were established in}} [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] and the Spirit of Christmas precursor cartoons, [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] further pushed the conventions of television, and especially of animated television entertainment. In addition to a continued stream of profanities and the promiscuous activities of Chef, an elementary school employee, the episode presents the character of Mr. Garrison {{as more and more}} unhinged. Although entrusted with the care of an elementary school class, Mr. Garrison demonstrates a questionable gender identity, poor teaching and unusual relationship with his Mr. Hat <b>hand</b> <b>puppet.</b>|$|E
500|$|Several other {{references}} to previous South Park episodes are featured throughout [...] "200". It marks the reappearance of Mr. Hat, a <b>hand</b> <b>puppet</b> {{that had been}} frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early South Park seasons, but had long been abandoned in later episodes. During {{the second half of}} [...] "200", an army of red-haired [...] "ginger kids" [...] attempt to capture Muhammad themselves. Several South Park episodes, most prominently the ninth-season episode [...] "Ginger Kids", have featured the ginger kids, which are children with fair skin, freckles and red hair. In most cases, they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman, who views them in an offensively stereotypical way.|$|E

500|$|In January 2014, Havas Worldwide and the Turkish {{branch of}} the condom company Durex created a {{television}} commercial titled [...] "Farewell Elizabeth" [...] that parodied Oobi. It featured a man breaking up with his girlfriend and resorting to dating his right hand, which was dressed up {{like one of the}} characters from the series. The Oobi <b>hand</b> <b>puppet</b> (named [...] "Elizabeth") was intended to be a metaphor for masturbation, which is generally regarded as a taboo subject in the country. The company had produced other anti-masturbation advertisements in the past, all of which were unsuccessful in Turkey. Havas Worldwide stated in an interview with La República that they chose to parody Oobi after deciding that doing [...] "something never said or done" [...] before would {{be the only way to}} make such a commercial popular with Turkish viewers.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{ends with}} a cliffhanger {{involving}} Cartman's father. The identity of Cartman's father made up a major plot point {{at the end of}} the first season, culminating in the second season episode [...] "Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut", in which it is revealed Cartman's mother, Liane Cartman, is a hermaphrodite and, in fact, is Cartman's father. [...] "200" [...] is the first episode to return to the matter and suggest this was not the actual truth. Throughout the episode, Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner, who had, presumably, just been made up by Cartman in trying to fool Kyle in the seventh-season episode [...] "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", resuming his role in pretending to be Jennifer Lopez and utilizing many offensive Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her. The <b>hand</b> <b>puppet</b> portrayal is very similar to the work of Spanish ventriloquist Señor Wences.|$|E
500|$|Unbeknownst to {{the rest}} of town, Mr. Garrison relives a {{traumatic}} childhood memory in which a young Gifford defeated him in a national talent show. Mr. Garrison is manipulated by his <b>hand</b> <b>puppet,</b> Mr. Hat, to assassinate Gifford out of revenge. He purchases a large rifle from Jimbo's gun shop and plots to shoot Gifford. Meanwhile, Cartman is excited to appear on live television, and Mayor McDaniels instructs him to get into shape for Gifford's visit. Seeing a television commercial for a bodybuilding supplement called [...] "Weight Gain 4000", Cartman asks his mother to buy it for him. Cartman becomes extremely fat from the product, although he believes he is in excellent shape and the excess weight is strictly muscle. Back at the school, Wendy looks through Mr. Garrison's papers and confirms Cartman indeed cheated on the contest by writing his name on a copy of Walden by Henry David Thoreau. Wendy also learns about Mr. Garrison's assassination plan, and enlists the help of her friend Stan to stop him.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2010s, Foster {{has focused}} on {{directing}} and taken fewer acting roles. In February 2011, she hosted the 36th César Awards in France, and the following month released her third feature film direction, The Beaver (2011), about a depressed man who develops an alternative personality based on a beaver <b>hand</b> <b>puppet.</b> It starred Maverick co-star Mel Gibson and featured herself, Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence in supporting roles as his family. Foster called its production [...] "probably the biggest struggle of my professional career", {{partly due to the}} film's heavy subject matter but also due to the controversy that developed around Gibson as he was accused of domestic violence and making anti-semitic, racist, and sexist statements. The film received mixed reviews, and failed the box office, largely due to the controversy surrounding its star. In 2011, Foster also appeared as part of an ensemble cast with John C. Reilly, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz in Roman Polanski's comedy Carnage, focusing on middle class parents whose meeting to settle an incident between their sons descends into chaos. It premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival in September 2011 to mainly positive reviews and earned Foster a Golden Globe for Best Actress nomination.|$|E
