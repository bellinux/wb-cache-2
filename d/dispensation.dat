5|$|The {{requisite}} Papal <b>dispensation</b> {{was obtained}} dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks {{has suggested that}} the terms of the <b>dispensation</b> deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. First degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case the papal <b>dispensation</b> was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richard's case, there would have been first degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.|$|E

5000|$|In Evangelical Christian theology, {{progressive}} dispensationalism is {{a variation}} of traditional dispensationalism. All dispensationalists view the <b>dispensations</b> as chronologically successive. Progressive dispensationalists, in addition to viewing the <b>dispensations</b> as chronologically successive, also view the <b>dispensations</b> as progressive stages in salvation history. The term [...] "progressive" [...] comes from {{the concept of an}} interrelationship or progression between the <b>dispensations.</b> Progressive dispensationalism is not related to any social or political use of the term progressive, such as progressive Christianity.|$|R

40|$|Time series {{analysis}} of fine particulate matter and asthma reliever <b>dispensations</b> in populations affected by forest fires Catherine T Elliott 1, 2 *, Sarah B Henderson 1, 2 and Victoria Wan 1 Background: Several studies have evaluated {{the association between}} forest fire smoke and acute exacerbations of respiratory diseases, but few have examined effects on pharmaceutical <b>dispensations.</b> We examine the associations between daily fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and pharmaceutical <b>dispensations</b> for salbutamol in forest fire-affected and non-fire-affected populations in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Methods: We estimated PM 2. 5 exposure for populations in administrative health areas using measurements from central monitors. Remote sensing data on fires were used to classify the populations as fire-affected or non-fire-affected, and to identify extreme fire days. Daily counts of salbutamol <b>dispensations</b> between 2003 and 2010 were extracted from the BC PharmaNet database. We estimated rate ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each population during all fire seasons and on extreme fire days, adjusted for temperature, humidity, and temporal trends. Overall effects for fire-affected and non-fire-affected populations were estimated via meta-regression. Results: Fire season PM 2. 5 was positively associated with salbutamol <b>dispensations</b> in all fire-affected populations, with a meta-regression RR (95 % CI) of 1. 06 (1. 04 - 1. 07) for a 10 ug/m 3 increase. Fire season PM 2. 5 was not significantly associated with salbutamol <b>dispensations</b> in non-fire-affected populations, with a meta-regression RR of 1. 00 (0. 98 - 1. 01). On extreme fire days PM 2. 5 was positively associated with salbutamol <b>dispensations</b> in both population types, with a global meta-regression RR of 1. 07 (1. 04 - 1. 09). Conclusions: Salbutamol <b>dispensations</b> were clearly associated with fire-related PM 2. 5. Significant associations were observed in smaller populations (range: 8, 000 to 170, 000 persons, median: 26, 000) than those reported previously, suggesting that salbutamol <b>dispensations</b> may be a valuable outcome for public health surveillance during fire events...|$|R

5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the <b>dispensation</b> of human justice.

He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist.
