5|$|On May 30, 2012 Square Enix {{published}} in Japan a second album {{of music from}} the game titled Final Fantasy XIII-2 Original Soundtrack PLUS. Similar to the Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack PLUS album released for the previous game, the album contains early versions of songs used in Final Fantasy XIII-2, alternate takes contained in the downloadable content for the game, arrangements made for promotions of the game, and new remixes. The tracks on the album were arranged by Ryo Yamazaki, Kengo Tokusashi, Yoshitaka Suzuki, Goh Hotoda, Shootie HG, and Hiroyuki Togo. The single-disc soundtrack contains 16 tracks, covering a duration of 1:07:02, and bears the catalog number SQEX-10311. The album's music covers a variety of styles, often <b>different</b> <b>ones</b> {{than those of the}} original pieces, including electronic, instrumental, and piano covers. The album reached #93 on the Oricon charts, and remained on the charts for one week.|$|E
5|$|In a 2003 article, Milner {{noted that}} the teeth of Baryonyx were {{very similar to those}} of the genus Suchosaurus and {{suggested}} that their remains represented the same animal. The type species of the genus, S. cultridens, was named in 1841 based on teeth from Tilgate Forest in Sussex; a second species, S. girardi, was named in 1897 based on jaw fragments and a tooth from Boca do Chapim. In 2007 Buffetaut considered the teeth of S. girardi very similar to those of Baryonyx (and S. cultridens) except for the stronger development of the crown ribs, suggesting that the remains belonged to the same genus. Buffetaut agreed with Milner that the teeth of S. cultridens were almost identical to those of B. walkeri, but with a ribbier surface. The former taxon might be a senior synonym of the latter (since it was published first), depending on whether the differences were within a taxon or between <b>different</b> <b>ones.</b> According to Buffetaut, since the holotype specimen of S. cultridens is one worn tooth and that of B. walkeri is a skeleton it would be more practical to retain the newer name. In 2011 Portuguese palaeontologist Octávio Mateus and colleagues agreed that Suchosaurus was closely related to Baryonyx, but considered both species in the former genus nomina dubia (dubious names) since their holotype specimens were not considered diagnostic (lacking distinguishing features) and could not be definitely equated with other taxa.|$|E
5|$|The Paradigm {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, {{which is the only}} way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; <b>different</b> <b>ones</b> are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.|$|E

5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several <b>different</b> <b>ones.</b> Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.|$|E

25|$|The English {{answer to}} this was Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (later {{abridged}} and renamed Fanny Hill) written in 1748 by John Cleland. While the text satirised the literary conventions and fashionable manners of 18th century England, it was more scandalous for depicting a woman, the narrator, enjoying and even reveling in sexual acts with no dire moral or physical consequences. The text is hardly explicit as Cleland wrote the entire book using euphemisms for sex acts and body parts, employing 50 <b>different</b> <b>ones</b> just for the term penis. Two small earthquakes were credited to the book by the Bishop of London and Cleland was arrested and briefly imprisoned, but Fanny Hill continued to be published {{and is one of}} the most reprinted books in the English language. However, it was not legal to own this book in the United States until 1963 and in the United Kingdom until 1970.|$|E

[...] The Northumbrian scribes [...] "imitate very closely the best Italian manuscripts of about the sixth century", but introduced small elements that gave their script a distinct style, which has always been greatly admired. [...] However, there were several scribes, seven <b>different</b> <b>ones</b> working on the Codex Amiatinus, whose scripts may not all have developed at the same pace.|$|E

500|$|When {{creating}} a character, his process was to draw their {{face and body}} type first, and then the clothes, while thinking if the fighters can move around in them. He said {{that he does not}} draw [...] "bad guys" [...] so unscrupulous that it affects readers psychologically. This is not out of concern for others, but because he does not enjoy drawing such things. Few of his characters have screentone because he found it difficult to use. Toriyama was not concerned about consistency with the color of characters' clothes for the occasional color pages, having sometimes used <b>different</b> <b>ones</b> than he had before. He even specifically asked Torishima to produce as few color pages as possible. Character names are almost always puns sharing a theme with characters related to them, most commonly food.

500|$|Juan Bautista Alberdi {{and later}} historians such as Norberto Galasso, Luis Romero and José Carlos Chiaramonte doubted Mitre's {{interpretation}} and put forward <b>different</b> <b>ones.</b> Alberdi thought that [...] "the Argentine revolution is {{a chapter of}} the Hispanoamerican revolution, as also of the Spanish one, as also of the French and European one". They did not consider it a dispute between independentism and colonialism, but instead a dispute between new libertarian ideas and absolutism. The intention was not to cut ties with Spain, but to reformulate the relationship; similarly, the American Revolution was not separatist at its initial steps either. Thus, it would have {{the characteristics of a}} civil war instead. Some points that would justify the idea would be the inclusion of Larrea, Matheu, and Belgrano in the Junta and the later appearance of José de San Martín: Larrea and Matheu were Spanish, Belgrano studied for many years in Spain, and San Martín had spent most of his adult life waging war in Spain against the French. When San Martín talked about enemies, he called them [...] "royalists" [...] or [...] "Goths", but never [...] "Spanish".|$|E

[...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E

500|$|The idea {{to develop}} Final Fantasy XI as an online game was {{conceived}} by Hironobu Sakaguchi when establishing Square Pictures headquarters in Hawaii. Impressed by western MMORPGs that he discovered there, such as EverQuest, Sakaguchi convinced Square {{to begin the}} development of their own MMORPG and suggested that it be based on the Final Fantasy series. The team responsible for Chrono Cross was assigned to the development of Final Fantasy XI after the English localization of the former title. Development began in November 1999. The game was the first developed under Square's new philosophy to develop for [...] "all platforms and media". Hiromichi Tanaka, the producer of the game, has stated Final Fantasy XI is heavily influenced by Final Fantasy III, especially in its battle and magic systems. According to Tanaka, Square put in Final Fantasy XI what they could not put in the first Final Fantasy titles due to technical limitations, thus making Final Fantasy XI the [...] "most [...] Final Fantasy of all the episodes". The game was developed and ran on the Nvidia GeForce 4 Ti GPU, which the President of Square Yoichi Wada described as the most powerful graphics processor available at the time. The game cost two to three billion yen (~$17–25million) to create along with the PlayOnline Network Service and was assumed to become profitable over a five-year timespan. By creating a unified game world instead of <b>different</b> <b>ones</b> balkanized by language, development costs were cut 66%. Since recurring monsters of the series are known by different names in the Japanese and English versions of the other installments, it was decided for Final Fantasy XI to use both Japanese and English names for different varieties of the same monsters.|$|E
500|$|... "Stronger" [...] is a dance-pop and electropop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Hal Leonard Corporation, it {{is set in a}} common time and has a moderately fast tempo of 116 beats per minute. Written in the key of A minor, it follows the chord progression Am–F–C-G/B. Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to G5. The song begins with a [...] "rumbling guitar" [...] and a [...] "shimmering synth" [...] riff as Clarkson sings the opening line [...] "You know the bed feels warmer / Sleeping here alone." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the guitar riff in the verses is reminiscent of Clarkson's [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which narrates an anthem of personal reinvention, and dancing. The bridges contain pulsating beats with synth and electric guitar that display some elements of electronic sound. During chorus, the song explodes into an upbeat dance-pop number, complete with guitars and electronic drums as Clarkson sings [...] "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger / Stand a little taller / Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant felt nobody else could sell the song's [...] "ginormous chorus" [...] better than Clarkson. Lyrically, [...] "Stronger" [...] explores the theme of moving on from an inimical relationship. In an interview, Clarkson remarked that the song doesn't refer to a specific person, stating [...] "I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, I just think life is about relationships so I always write all about these <b>different</b> <b>ones</b> going on in my life. And I don't have a filter, so it's pretty verbatim." [...] Jason Scott of Blogcritics felt that out of all tracks in Stronger, Clarkson's vocals are best and trendiest in [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)".|$|E
