5|$|A {{creation}} date {{at the beginning}} of the second millennium BCE places the relief into a region and time in which the political situation was unsteady, marked by the waxing and waning <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city states of Isin and Larsa, an invasion by the Elamites, and finally the conquest by Hammurabi in the unification in the Babylonian empire in 1762BCE.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of stone monuments {{were placed in the}} North Acropolis. By the 9th century AD these {{included}} 43 stelae and 30 altars; 18 of these monuments were sculpted with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. A number of these monuments show the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving as}} the most {{influential}} policymaking body of the dynasty {{for more than a}} century, the Deliberative Council was displaced and then made obsolete by the more ethnically mixed Grand Council, which the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) created in the late 1720s to circumvent the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deliberative princes and ministers. The Deliberative Council was formally abolished in 1792.|$|E

He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to, and thus bypassed, the system of al-Azhar.|$|E
5|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{of state}} power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming, the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s. By the late Ming dynasty, there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys, a system which reined in the power and <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military by the civil establishment.|$|E
5|$|As the Confederation, {{from its}} {{foundation}} in 1291, was almost exclusively composed of German-speaking regions, the earliest forms of literature are in German. In the 18th century, French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere, while the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French-speaking allies and subject lands was more marked than before.|$|E

5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This result was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sheffield FA {{started to}} wane.

5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} {{to accept his}} election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College.

5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to acquire characteristics under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment.

Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E
