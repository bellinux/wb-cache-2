This prevents intermediate colorspace conversions to improve performance. MF includes a new video renderer, called Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR), which is the next iteration of VMR 7 and 9. EVR has better support for playback timing and synchronization. It uses the Multimedia Class Scheduler Service (MMCSS), a new service that prioritizes real time multimedia processing, to reserve the resources required for the playback, without any tearing or glitches.|$|E

40|$|By {{attaching}} RFID tags to products, {{supply chain}} participants can identify products and create product data {{to record the}} product particulars in transit. Participants along the supply chain share their product data to enable information exchange and support critical decisions in production operations. Such an information sharing essentially requires a <b>data</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> mechanism when the product data relates to sensitive business issues.

40|$|Abstract—Data {{access control}} is an {{effective}} way to ensure the data security in the cloud. However, due to data outsourcing and untrusted cloud servers, the <b>data</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> becomes a challenging issue in cloud storage systems. Existing access control schemes are no longer applicable to cloud storage systems, because they either produce multiple encrypted copies of the same data or require a fully trusted cloud server. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising technique for access control of encrypted data. It requires a trusted authority manages all the attributes and distributes keys in the system. In cloud storage systems, there are multiple authorities co-exist and each authority is able to issue attributes independently. However, existing CP-ABE schemes cannot be directly applied to the access control for multi-authority cloud storage systems, due to the inefficiency of decryption and revocation. In this paper, we propose DAC-MACS (<b>Data</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> for Multi-Authority Cloud Storage), an effective and secure <b>data</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> scheme with efficient decryption and revocation. Specifically, we construct a new multi-authority CP-ABE scheme with efficient decryption and also design an efficient attribute revocation method that can achieve both forward security and backward security. The analysis and the simulation results show that our DAC-MACS is highly efficient and provably secure under the security model...|$|E
