40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} Chomsky, a <b>content</b> <b>language</b> translation agent. This agent {{provides a}} service, which first translates the content expression {{from its original}} language into an abstract logic language (ALL). Then, the resulting ALL expression is translated to the desired target language. ALL has been designed as a superset of most known <b>content</b> <b>languages</b> to avoid loosing expressiveness during translation. For more than three supported languages, using an intermediate language approach involves fewer translators than a pair wise approach. Currently, Chomsky supports FIPA-SL, KIF, and Prolog <b>Content</b> <b>Language.</b> In one mode of operation, Chomsky returns {{the result of the}} translation request to the client agent. In the other mode, Chomsky receives a message from the intended sender whose content is expressed in language L 1, it translates the content to the <b>content</b> <b>language</b> used by the intended receiver (L 2), and it sends the message with the L 2 content to the intended receiver. ...|$|R

The semiconductor manufacturing domain {{is characterized by}} re-entrant product flows, sequence-dependent setup-times, prescribed due-dates, a diverse product mix, a mix of different process types including batch processes and preventive maintenance issues caused by complex technological processes. Starting from a hierarchical decomposition of the manufacturing system, we use an agent-based architecture for implementing the resulting production control system. In order to coordinate the autonomous entities of the hierarchy, we suggest a <b>content</b> <b>language</b> that is appropriate to the hierarchical control approach.

We {{argue for}} an XML {{encoding}} of FIPA Agent Communica-tion Language (ACL), and give an alpha version of it, called Agent Com-munication Markup Language (ACML), {{which we have}} implemented. The XML approach facilitates: (a) developing/maintaining parsers, in-tegrating with WWW-world software engineering, and (b) the enrich-ing capability to (hyper-) link to ontologies and other extra information. The XML approach applies similarly to KQML as well.

A leading candidate <b>content</b> <b>language</b> for business rules is Knowledge In-terchange Format (KIF), which is currently in the ANSI standards com-mittee process.

The participants of this study wrote a first draft; revised it after getting the feedback on content and further revised it after receiving feedback on language.

At the implementation level, we propose to use object-oriented databases as the support for the agent information.
