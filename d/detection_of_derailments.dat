40|$|A vital {{component}} of a rail safety system is {{an understanding of the}} causes of events that have the potential to cause multiple fatalities. This research analyses the causes and consequences <b>of</b> <b>derailments</b> occurring in Victoria, Australia. Between January 2007 and December 2013, Transport Safety Victoria recorded 122 mainline derailments. Passenger trains accounted for 19 % <b>of</b> mainline <b>derailments</b> whereas freight trains accounted for 52 %. Track maintenance vehicles and locomotives running without wagons or coaches attached accounted for the remaining 29 % <b>of</b> <b>derailments.</b> Summary derailment-cause information from 50 investigation reports is presented in this article. Infrastructure defects were determined to be a causal factor in 56 % <b>of</b> <b>derailments,</b> operations related factors in 40 % <b>of</b> <b>derailments,</b> and rolling stock in 12 % <b>of</b> <b>derailments.</b> No cause could be determined in 10 % <b>of</b> <b>derailments,</b> whereas some derailment incidents identified more than one cause. The effect of train speed and cause <b>of</b> <b>derailment</b> on consequences in terms of number of vehicles derailed and time of line closure is also presented. Comparison derailment rates and causes in other jurisdictions are provided, and the potential for use <b>of</b> <b>derailment</b> cause analysis in risk modelling is discussed...|$|R

Bogie tracking geometry includes tracking position and {{angle of attack}} on a per-axle basis, as well as rotation, shift, inter-axle misalignment, and tracking error on a per-bogie basis. Bogie performance detectors can provide early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> bogie defects, and early warning <b>of</b> <b>derailment</b> risks through flange climb or rail break.Bogie performance detectors most often use optical methods, and are installed adjacent to the track with wheel sensors clamped to the rails.|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{axle-bearing}} {{is one of}} the most common causes <b>of</b> <b>derailments</b> <b>of</b> railway vehicles which are usually accompanied by huge material damage and human casualties. Modern railways are working intensively on the development and implementation of appropriate systems for early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> axlebearing malfunctions, which are typically manifested by increasing of its temperature. The most common approach is based on the use of wayside systems or checkpoints located in certain places along the track. There is also an innovative approach that involves using the system for continuous measuring and online monitoring of axle-boxes temperature. The main aim is to provide early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> malfunctions of the axle-bearing and prevention <b>of</b> the potential <b>derailment.</b> This paper analyses the existing solutions for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> axle-bearings malfunctions with special emphasis on the working principle and the main advantages and disadvantages. The paper presents the basics of the one newly developed wireless measuring system for on-line monitoring of axle-boxes temperature. The measuring system was tested in real conditions and can be successfully applied to the commercial railway vehicles. The main conclusion is that systems for on-line monitoring of axle-bearings temperatures are far more efficient than wayside systems. Obtained results may be important for those who deal with these and similar problems, problems of development, exploitation and maintenance of railway vehicles, strategies, regulations, etc...|$|R

40|$|Summary: We {{conducted}} {{statistical analyses}} and used modeling techniques to develop derailment probabilities for freight trains and freight cars operating on North American railroads. Knowing the expected frequency <b>of</b> <b>derailment</b> and the conditional probabilities <b>of</b> <b>derailment</b> for individual cars enables estimation <b>of</b> the <b>derailment</b> risk {{as it is}} affected by train length, operating speed, and positioning of cars in the consist.

40|$|Abstract—In India rail {{transport}} occupies a prominent position in providing the necessary transport infrastructure to sustain {{needs of a}} rapidly growing economy. Today, India possesses the fourth largest railway network in the world. However, {{in terms of the}} reliability and safety parameters, we have not yet reached truly global standards. The main problem about a railway analysis is <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cracks in the structure. If these deficiencies are not controlled at early stages they might lead to a number <b>of</b> <b>derailments</b> resulting in a heavy loss of life and property. This paper proposes a cost effective {{solution to the problem of}} railway track crack detection utilizing LED-LDR assembly which tracks the exact location of faulty track which then mended immediately so that many lives will be saved...|$|R

David Ingles {{called the}} SDP40Fs the [...] "stars of Amtrak's long-distance trains," [...] but {{operating}} crews {{reported that the}} locomotives rode poorly compared to the E-units they had replaced. Even as Amtrak and EMD investigated the ride quality, the SDP40F {{was involved in a}} series <b>of</b> <b>derailments</b> which would culminate in an abrupt end to its career as a passenger locomotive. Between 1974–1976 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) identified thirteen separate incidents for which the locomotive was responsible. While none of the incidents were serious, their frequency was a major concern. Most <b>of</b> the <b>derailments</b> occurred on trains with two SDP40Fs on the front and at least one trailing baggage car. While the rear truck of the second locomotive and the front truck of the baggage car were pinpointed as the source <b>of</b> the <b>derailment,</b> the actual cause <b>of</b> the <b>derailments</b> was unclear.|$|R
