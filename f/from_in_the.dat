5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently <b>from</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E

50|$|Dublin's {{earliest}} {{roads were}} four long-distance routes that {{converged on the}} Gaelic Ford of the Reed Hurdles (Áth Cliath) over the River Liffey. These were the Slige Chualann (roughly {{the route of the}} present day Harold's Cross Road) <b>from</b> Leinster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south, Slige Dála (Crumlin Road) <b>from</b> Munster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwest, Slige Mór (Inchicore Road) <b>from</b> Connacht <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west, and Slige Midluachra (Dorset Street) <b>from</b> Ulster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north.|$|R
50|$|Altenheim {{is located}} some 10 km east by {{south-east}} of Saverne and 30 km north-west of Strasbourg. It {{can be accessed}} from five directions: <b>from</b> Furchhausen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west by road D230, <b>from</b> Dettwiller <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north by road D112, <b>from</b> Littenheim <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east by road D151, <b>from</b> Saessolsheim <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-east by road D230, and <b>from</b> Wolschheim <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south by road D112. All these roads intersect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village. The commune consists entirely of farmland other than the village. <b>The</b> only waterway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> commune is the Drusenbach crossing the south-western corner and two small tributaries of this stream <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of the commune.|$|R
5|$|Exactly who Ælfgar {{received}} aid <b>from</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Irish Sea {{region is}} uncertain. It is conceivable that, after his flight from England in 1055, Ælfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord). Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of Ælfgar and Magnús in 1058which utilised Islesmen and Dublinerscould well have involved Diarmait's cooperation as well. That being said, {{there are several}} reasons to doubt a part played by Diarmait in Ælfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to Ælfgar's enemiesthe Godwinsonsin the 1050s and 1060s. Diarmait also appears to have previously backed Cynan ab Iago (fl. 1064), a man who was a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of Ælfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
5|$|Giovinazzi quickly caught Marciello and overtook him (with {{the help}} of DRS and drafting) {{at the start of}} lap 18 to take over the lead. Giovinazzi began to pull away from Maricello. The safety car was {{deployed}} for the fourth (and final) time after Nato attempted to pass teammate King around the inside and retired from the race having been squeezed into the turn three barrier by him. The area was cleared of Nato's damaged car over the next five laps which meant the race would finish under a time limit. Giovinazzi accelerated as late as possible to limit the slipstream effect and remained the leader at the lap-25 restart despite locking-up his tyres heading into the first turn. King retired from the race following contact with Eriksson. Giovinazzi remained the leader for the remaining two laps to clinch his first, and his team's maiden, victory in the GP2 Series. Siroktin overtook Rowland for third place and clinched second position from Marciello by drafting behind him on the start/finish straight. Rowland finished in fourth place, ahead of Evans and Matsushita whom he defended <b>from</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final two laps. Gelael, de Jong, Ghiotto, and Malja rounded out the point-scoring positions. Eriksson and King were the last of the classified finishers. The attrition race was high, with ten drivers reaching the end of the race.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come <b>from?</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart <b>from</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to bother with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of memorials produced {{a lot of}} business in all the countries involved in the war. In Britain and Australia, stone masons provided large quantities of mass-produced design, often advertising through catalogues, while professional architects acquired the bulk of the specialised commissions for war memorials, making use of their professional organisations. Professional sculptors argued that their work was superior and more appropriate than that of architects, but they received far fewer commissions. British stone masons provided cheap products through catalogues. In France, funeral directors played a large part in the business of producing designs, producing catalogues of their designs for local communities to choose <b>from.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> US, there was sufficient interest that a specialist magazine, Monumental News, was created to support the trade in war memorials.|$|E
