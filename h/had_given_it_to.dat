5|$|In 1320 King Edward II of England confiscated the lordship of Gower on {{the grounds}} that Braose <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his {{son-in-law}} Mowbray without royal permission. Over the preceding years Braose had promised Gower to a number of persons, including Humphrey de Bohun, the Earl of Hereford, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. Mowbray then in late 1319 took custody of Gower to protect his rights. Despenser persuaded the king in 1320 to take Gower into royal hands in October, and was appointed keeper of the honour in November. The other lords in the Welsh Marches resented this seizure, feeling that the king's excuse for it was not applicable. The seizure was one of the precipitating causes of the baronial rebellion that led to the exile of the Despensers in 1321. In 1322 Gower was given to the younger Despenser again, who then traded it for the honours of Usk and Caerleon. Braose was then induced to sue the new holder of Gower for the return of the barony in April 1324, which action succeeded in June 1324. Braose then promptly gave Gower to the elder Despenser, returning the property to the Despenser family once more. The lordship of Gower eventually ended {{up in the hands of}} the Beauchamp family, but it was not until the 1350s that the issue was decided.|$|E
25|$|Arriving home in Suphanburi, however, Dum {{finds his}} family murdered. With his dying breath, Dum's father blames Kong, and Dum swears vengeance. Dum shoots Kong {{and several of}} his clan with his father's lever-action carbine, but is chased into the forest. With one {{cartridge}} left, Dum turns the gun on himself, but is stopped by Fai, who has ridden up with his horsemen. Fai recognizes the rifle, saying he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Dum's father years before. Fai hands Dum a loaded revolver and tells him to execute the men who murdered his father. Dum is now an outlaw.|$|E
25|$|Herod had {{to lease}} back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{her as a}} gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BC, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod {{absolute}} rule over Jericho, {{as part of the}} new Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (Tell es-Samrat) to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of Tulul Abu el-Alaiq (also written Alayiq). In 2008 the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.|$|E

25|$|Thomson {{also said}} that while she was working at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney during World War II, she had owned {{a copy of the}} Rubaiyat. In 1945, at the Clifton Gardens Hotel in Sydney, she <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> an army {{lieutenant}} named Alf Boxall, who was serving at the time in the Water Transport Section of the Royal Australian Engineers. Thomson told police that, after the war ended, she had moved to Melbourne and married. She said that she had received a letter from Boxall and had replied, telling him that she was now married. (Subsequent research suggests that her future husband, Prosper Thomson, {{was in the process of}} obtaining a divorce from his first wife in 1949, and that he did not marry Jessica Harkness until mid-1950.) There is no evidence that Boxall had any contact with Harkness after 1945.|$|E
25|$|Although the Palace was taken, {{the battle}} was not yet over. A {{detachment}} from the 3rd Bombay Regiment was sent to overcome the Afghan troopers who were bodyguards of Rani Laxmibai and although the Afghans inflicted significant casualties on the Regiment, they were eventually all disposed of and the standard of the Rani was retrieved. An English union flag of silk was also retrieved. Lord William Bentinck <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the grandfather of the husband of the Rani, with the permission to have it carried before him, {{as a reward for}} his fidelity-a privilege granted to no other Indian prince. The soldiers were allowed to hoist the flag on the place. The fighting in the city continued for a further day culminating in Lieutenant Baigrie of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment announcing that he had entered an abandoned fort, and so the fall of Jhansi was claimed. Described as a significant tactical victory, the toll on the Regiment was 7 killed in action and 52 wounded.|$|E
500|$|Stanford put {{the game}} on ice in the fourth period when Pop {{introduced}} the bootlegger play, {{which was to be}} widely copied and still is in use. On the original bootlegger, Warner made use of Biff Hoffman's tremendous hands. Hoffman would take the pass from center and then fake to another back. Keeping the ball, he would hide it behind him and run as though he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a teammate. Sometimes defensive players would step out of Hoffman's path, thinking he was going to block. Hoffman [...] "bootlegged" [...] for the touchdown against California...|$|E

500|$|When Hagen {{reported}} {{back to the}} Stern management, {{an emergency}} meeting was called and Schulte-Hillen demanded the identity of Heidemann's source. The journalist relented, and provided the provenance of the diaries as Kujau <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him. Harris describes how a bunker mentality descended on the Stern management as, instead of accepting {{the truth of the}} 's findings, they searched for alternative explanations as to how post-war whitening agents could have been used in the wartime paper. The paper then released a statement defending their position which Harris judges was [...] "resonant with hollow bravado".|$|E
500|$|American {{ichthyologist}} David Starr Jordan {{described the}} goblin shark in an 1898 issue of Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, recognizing the peculiar fish {{not only as}} a new species, but also a new genus and family. He based his account on an immature male [...] long caught in Sagami Bay near Yokohama, Japan. The specimen had been acquired by shipmaster and naturalist Alan Owston, who <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Professor Kakichi Mitsukuri at the University of Tokyo, who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark Mitsukurina owstoni in honor of these two men. The common name [...] "goblin shark" [...] is a translation of its old Japanese name tenguzame, a tengu being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a long nose and red face. Another name for this species is elfin shark.|$|E
500|$|Graham found {{writing for}} two Doctors easy, as Smith's Doctor had a {{constant}} [...] "internal dialogue" [...] {{and was always}} finishing his own sentences. He wanted each character to be different {{and did not want}} all of them to become evil, and the Doctor would help them discover their humanity. Graham wanted Jennifer to be the antagonist as he liked the idea of the quietest character becoming the most evil. The original script explained that she has a perfect memory, and so her Ganger was able to remember every terrible thing that had happened to the Flesh. Several other sequences were cut from the final version of [...] "The Almost People". In the original script, the Doctor quizzes the Flesh Doctor about the events of The Mind of Evil (1971) and mentions former companions Jo Grant, Sarah Jane Smith, Romana, Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, and Donna Noble. There was also a montage of happy memories of the Doctor's life stored in the Flesh Doctor, which included flashbacks of previous episodes and serials of the show as well as events that had not transpired onscreen. Also cut was the TARDIS providing the Doctor with another sonic screwdriver after he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Flesh Doctor, in a similar fashion to [...] "The Eleventh Hour".|$|E

500|$|After taking {{vacation}} {{from work}} {{to be with his}} wife–and her parents–on her birthday, Peter turns Neal over to Sara in order to retrieve a missing Stradivarius that she believes was stolen by her former fiancé and current boss, Bryan McKenzie (Bailey Chase). [...] Before beginning work on the case, Neal is approached by Agent Kramer (Beau Bridges), who is in New York to look into Neal’s upcoming commutation hearing. [...] Searching McKenzie’s apartment, Neal discovers a hidden security tape. [...] Meanwhile, Sara convinces him to attend the symphony with her. [...] With help from June (Diahann Carroll), Neal and Diana Berrigan (Marsha Thomason) are {{able to go to the}} symphony as well. [...] While they quickly discover that the second-chair violinist is the woman on the security video, McKenzie realizes that Neal is not exactly who he claims to be. [...] While searching backstage, Neal and Diana find a body; they quickly recognize him as the symphony’s instrument expert. [...] Upon questioning the violinist from the security tape, Diana discovers that she had damaged the violin and <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the instrument expert for repairs. [...] Sara approaches McKenzie with the information she has, pretending to want to join him. [...] Diana and Neal soon arrive to arrest McKenzie, and Sara tells Neal to “call [...] sometime.” ...|$|E

A year after his release, Underhill became locally known as the [...] "Lovers Lane Bandit". When his identity became known, after being caught by a police decoy, he was sent to the Missouri State Penitentiary for five years.|$|E

2500|$|The three smaller domes {{on the top}} of the DDO {{administration}} building are used for smaller instruments. Soon after the observatory opened in 1935, a 50cm Cassegrain reflector telescope was installed in the southern dome. The [...] Cooke Refractor had been out of use since the Meteorological Office <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Hart House, but it was little used and was moved into the northern dome in 1951 to be used by undergraduates. Much later, in 1965, a similar 60cm Cassegrain was added to the central dome.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, Barnegat City {{was renamed}} as Barnegat Light. The motivations for this {{renaming}} were both {{to honor the}} legacy of the lighthouse (which was decommissioned four years earlier) and to distinguish itself from nearby Barnegat Township. [...] In 1950, the post office moved from the Applegate general store's location to a new location on 18th Street. [...] The building it replaced had itself been a general store and a gas station, both owned by Jens Jensen in 1920; who <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> John Englesen in 1940 as a trade for a house on 19th Street. [...] The post office remained at this location until its current location on 10th Street was opened. [...] The site of the first post office, at the general store on 4th Street, remains today as the Inlet Deli.|$|E
2500|$|A {{long story}} about Hume {{and his wife}} appears in A.P. Sinnett's book The Occult World, and the {{synopsis}} was published in a local paper of India. [...] The story relates how at a dinner party, Madame Blavatsky asked Mrs Hume {{if there was anything}} she wanted. [...] She replied that there was a brooch, her mother had given her, that had gone out of her possession some time ago. Blavatsky said she would try to recover it through occult means. After some interlude, later that evening, the brooch was found in a garden, where the party was directed by Blavatsky. According to John Murdoch (1894), the brooch had been given by Mrs. Hume to her daughter who <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a man she admired. Blavatsky had happened to meet the man in Bombay and obtained the brooch in return for money. Blavatsky allegedly planted it in the garden before directing people to the location through what she claimed as occult techniques.|$|E

2500|$|... "It's The Things You Do" [...] was {{released}} in late 1998 in the U.S., only to receive a lukewarm reception. The group embarked upon a U.S. tour with the American boy band NSYNC, but soon after pulled out due to exhaustion, flying back to England to rest and start work on a new album. Still from the first album, [...] "Got the Feelin'", [...] "Everybody Get Up", and [...] "Until the Time Is Through" [...] were all released as singles in the UK throughout 1998. Five reached the top 5 in several countries around the world, and the latter two singles each rose to the number two spot in the UK. A significant element in Five's popularity was their resemblance to American boy bands such as New Kids on the Block, the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC in their uptempo musical style and 'street' image, in contrast to Take That, Boyzone, and 98 Degrees, [...] {{who at the time}} were primarily known for their ballads. Five also wrote or co-wrote almost all of their own songs, something boy bands had never done much of until then. According to Cowell, Five almost broke the US. Unfortunately they made some bad decisions. When Cowell heard [...] "...Baby One More Time", he wanted Five to have it, but writer Max Martin <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Britney Spears thus broke up with Martin. Five were later offered [...] "Bye Bye Bye", but upon hearing the song, they turned it down and dissed it. [...] "Then they went out to Sweden a few weeks later to record a song which they famously turned down, called [...] "Bye Bye Bye." [...] And it really was bye bye bye after that. That would have been the record that broke them. I would have broken that band," [...] Cowell said.|$|E
