40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the points change wit R 65, mark 1 / 9 with the 2 BC- 105 dumpcars movement, using the {{standard}} and radial trucks. The {{purpose of the}} work: the analysis of power action of the 2 BC- 105 dumpcars on the trucks with radial installation of the wheel pairs on the wits of the point changes; {{the determination of the}} stress-deformed state of the wits. The design diagram for investigation of the 2 BC- 105 <b>dumpcar</b> inlet on the trucks with radial installation of the wheel pairs in the wits of the different geometrical outline in the plan, has been specified. The corresponding mathematical model has been offered; the loading of the wits of the different construction version has been determined. The obtained results allow to determine the ways of reduction of the stress-deformed condition of the point changes and prolongation of its service life with the action of the cars of the industrial transport with the different construction of the traveling parts. The results of the investigations have been used in the practic operational work of the railways workshopAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
