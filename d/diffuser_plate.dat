5000|$|Over time, {{particles}} accumulate {{between the}} filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms {{along the top}} of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>plate.</b> Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and bioclogging). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time APS1, it may become too slow for the users’ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litre/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance. The [...] "swirl and dump", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate. About 1 gal is poured into the filter before cleaning (assuming the filter is empty). The upper layer of sand is then swirled in a circular motion. Dirty water from the swirling is dumped out and the sand is smoothed out at the top. This process is repeated until flow rate is restored. Cleaning the <b>diffuser</b> <b>plate,</b> outlet tube, lid, and outside surfaces of the filters regularly is also recommended. Long-term sustainability and efficacy of biosand filters depends on education and support from knowledgeable support personnel.|$|E

Consequently, an extensive CFD analysis has been carried out for a range of diffuser configurations by simulating the supersonic flow through the arrangement including the laser cavity driven by a bank of converging – diverging nozzles and the diffuser.

Prior to the absolute radiometric calibration of every pixel the image has to be corrected for relative radiometric disturbances along the scan lines.

To correct for these effects relative calibration tables, derived from the <b>diffuser</b> <b>plate</b> calibration, are applied to the image. The applicability and stability of these tables is only given to an accuracy of about 1 - 2 % in the nominal case.

To correct for these random type of image failures, a digital filter in the spatial domain was developed. It is based on an averaging technique that acts in a large kernel size.

At nozzle to billet area ratios less than 5 %, the nozzle exit velocity is large enough to jet down the centerline, resulting in higher levels of macrosegregation.

We have measured the diffuse transmission and reflection properties over a broad wavelength range (470 - 840 nm) from which we derive the transport mean free path using the theory of light diffusion. With increasing scatterer density, the mean free path becomes shorter. The mean free path increases with wavelength; hence, blue light is scattered more strongly than red light. To interpret the results, we propose an ab initio model without adjustable parameters for the mean free path by using Mie theory. We include inhomogeneous broadening {{as a result of}} the size distribution of the scattering particles as measured by dynamic light scattering. Surprisingly, the calculated mean free path decreases with wavelength, at variance with our experiments, which is caused by particles with radii R in excess of 0. 25 mu m.

40|$|Summary form only given. There is {{a strong}} {{worldwide}} drive to efficient general lighting using white light emitting diodes (LEDs) [1, 2]. White LEDs often consist of a semiconductor diode [3, 4, 5] combined with luminescent phosphors [5] to convert part of the blue light to green yellow, and red. In state-of-the art white-light LEDs one exploits multiple scattering of light [1, 2]. The transport of light then becomes diffusive, which serves to obtain a desirable smooth lighting without hot spots and without angular color distribution. Moreover, photons are recycled so that thin phosphor layers serve to improve cost efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Central challenges {{in the understanding of}} white LEDs arise from limitations in the physical understanding of the combined multiple light scattering and energy conversion in phosphors. LEDs are currently described by raytracing and Monte Carlo techniques [1, 2]. Unfortunately, LED spectra cannot be predicted quantitatively, as optical parameters must be adjusted to be inconsistent with other data. These limitations hamper the design and development of efficient white LEDs. An improved description of multiple light scattering could be obtained by analytical theories originating from nanophotonics, invoking detailed nanostructure of a sample. We have measured diffuse optical transmission and reflectivity through <b>diffuser</b> <b>plates</b> typical of a commercial white LED (Fortimo). Using photonic diffusion theory we derive the transport mean free path [6 - 8]. With increasing scatterer density the mean free path decreases.

Our model predicts mean free paths in dramatically improved agreement with our data, without adjustable parameters [9].

An elbow connects the pipe to arotameter with further pressure tappings. All pressure tappings connected to manometers held on a vertical panel behind the pipe work and show pressure at various points. The effect of the pipe geometry in the flow pattern is presented. Furthermore head losses are estimated, at specific stream-wise cross-sections, for mass flow rate numbered from 0. 056 to 0. 411 l/s. The manometers measure and clearly show pressure distribution against a calibrated scale. The diagrams of mass flow rate and head losses are presented in specific crosssections, where geometry changes. All measurements were calibrated and validated in a maximum standard deviation difference of 5 %. The head losses decrease as the mass flow rate decreases, for all pipe geometries. In the future the experimental results {{can be used to}} verify numerical simulation results...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{simulate}} numerically the flow through perforated plates in Electrostatic precipitator and compare the obtained results with the one obtained experimentally. Better flow distribution in the collection chamber of electrostatic precipitator was obtained with two perforated plates of porosity 50 %, one plate located just upstream of the diffuser exit and other at some distance downstream of the <b>diffuser</b> entrance. Perforated <b>plates</b> of higher porosity do not have the capability to spread out the flow, whereas plates of low porosity lead to excessive pressure drop. Mean velocity of flow at diffuser exit obtained numerically was 4. 5 m sec - 1 while velocity obtained experimentally at diffuser exit was 3. 75 m sec - 1, with about 16 % deviation. Numerical investigation of flow through perforated plates and velocity distribution in the collection chamber of an Electrostatic Precipitator was carried out using a Computational Fluid Dynamics code namely FLUENT. The effect of porosity and perforated plate location on flow uniformity and turbulence were studied and the results were compared with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{luminaries}} {{use different}} systems {{in order to}} diffuse light, avoiding glare. The most frequently used materials are opal glass or translucent plastic as these materials exhibit the maximum degree of light scatter with the minimum amount of absorption. These materials, which are suitable for industrial applications, are not always appreciated for architectural purposes. An interesting alternative is represented by sand-blasted glass, fabrics, drilled plates with different hole shapes and dimensions. The choice of the diffuser involves different performances connected to the following aspects: Luminance of the surface, luminaire efficiency, infrared and ultraviolet transmission. In particular {{in this paper we}} are interested to solutions that guarantee high transparency for light together with a low transmission of ultraviolet radiations and a good diffusive behaviour. That is in order to select solutions for applications in which comfort for people and conservation of materials are important. With regard to discontinuous materials, such as drilled plates, a particular attention has been dedicated to study the effect of hole shapes and dimensions on the diffuser performances. The test apparatus is composed by a dark room, 1 floodlight and numerous samples of close <b>diffusers</b> and drilled <b>plates...</b>|$|R
