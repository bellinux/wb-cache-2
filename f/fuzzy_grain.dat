30|$|One of the {{purposes}} of wood cutting is to obtain satisfactory machined surface. The machined surface of good quality is considered to be formed when the workpiece is cut exactly at the path of the cutting edge, meaning that the workpiece above the path of the edge is completely removed and no machining defects such as torn grain, <b>fuzzy</b> <b>grain,</b> or any other destructions would be found. In addition, as Scholz et al. [1] mentioned, no compressed cells should be found on and beneath the surface, since they may absorb moisture and swell, causing rough surface. Some studies have been done observing both the machined surface and subsurface structure; although the workpiece was cut at a plane normal to the machined surface to be observed with microscope, so the procedure was destructive and might have changed shapes of cells observed [2 – 4].|$|E

40|$|It is {{beneficial}} if the machining of wooden products is done at a moisture content {{equal to the}} climate the product {{is meant to be}} used in. For indoor products in central heated houses such moisture content is about 5 - 10 %. For planing this is often a too low moisture content showing an increased risk of poor surface quality due to severe torn grain. Contrary to this too high moisture content will result in a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>grain</b> surface and problems with swelling and shrinkage of the product. The roughness of a machined wooden surface is affected by a number of different parameters like cutting tool geometry, machine settings and wood structure. The latter is the hardest to control since the surface quality {{is a result of the}} local combination of density, grain direction and moisture content. The larger the variation in wood features the more difficult it is to find a combination of tools and machine settings that will give a high surface quality. This study showed that by wetting the surface before machining, in this case planing, the average surface quality could be increased. No time dependences could be shown, wetting short before planing did show as good improvements as wetting treatment for 30 minutes or more. The study was based on a total of 120 test surfaces of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.). In order to maximize the variation in grain angle and density variations the test surfaces contained both clear wood as well as green knots. Godkänd; 2015; 20150625 (micohm) </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to measure the cutting force and the {{resultant}} machined surface quality for tension wood and normal wood of Rubberwood using a single saw tooth experimental set-up. Three different saw tooth geometries {{were used in the}} experiment, to establish the optimum saw tooth design for the sawing of tension wood. The results showed that the specific principal cutting force was lower for tension wood compared to normal wood, due to the less lignified cell walls of the tension wood. It appears that the lignin component in the cell wall provides the stiffness to the cell wall, which was lacking in the cell walls of tension wood, hence reducing the cutting forces significantly. Nevertheless, the overall power consumption during the machining of tension wood was markedly higher due to the presence of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>grains</b> on the machined surface of tension wood, which increased the frictional force acting on the cutting edges during the machining process. Further, it was found that saw tooth design No. 2 produced the optimal result, both from the economic and quality perspectives for the sawing of tension wood. Therefore, in order to optimize the sawing of tension wood, saw tooth with the highest rake and clearance angles is recommended as it required the least cutting force, while producing the best surface quality. This study has far reaching industrial implications on the sawing and machining of Rubberwood in the South East Asian region...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new model for granular synthesis using Markov Chains and Fuzzy Sets. Whereas Markov Chains are used to control {{the evolution of the}} sound in time, Fuzzy Sets are employed to define the internal structure of the sound grains. It is shown also how the <b>fuzzy</b> structure of <b>grains</b> changes the markov Process. We provide the mathematical foundations of the model and briefly discuss how we have implemented it in a MATLAB program named Fuzzkov 1. 0...|$|R
40|$|Numbers, linear density, {{and surface}} area of {{synaptic}} boutons can be important parameters in studies on synaptic plasticity in cultured neurons. We present a method for automatic identification and morphometry of boutons based on filtering of digital images using granulometric analysis. Cultures of cortical neurons (DIV 8 and DIV 21) were fixed and marked with fluorescently labeled antibodies for synapsin I (a marker for synaptic boutons) and MAP- 2 (a marker for dendrites). Images were acquired on a confocal microscope and automatically processed. Granulometry, a morphological operator sensitive to the geometry and size of objects, was used to construct a filter passing <b>fuzzy</b> fluorescent <b>grains</b> of a certain size. Next, the filter was overlaid with the original image (masking) and the positive pixels were identified by an integral intensity threshold (thresholding). Disjoint grains, representing individual boutons, were reconstructed from the connected pixels above the threshold, numbered and their area was measured. In total, 1498 boutons with a mean diameter of 1. 63 ± 0. 49 μm (S. D.) were measured. Comparisons with manual counts showed that the proposed method was capable of identifying boutons in a systematic manner at the light microscopic level and was {{a viable alternative to}} manual bouton counting. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{machining}} parameters affect {{surface quality}} and usually, wood planing process is {{heavily influenced by}} external parameters. External parameters concern mainly the machining process parameters such as: the feeding speed, the depth of cut, the cutting tool diameter and geometry, the cutting geometry, the cutting technique (up or down milling). This study was carried out to determine the planing properties of naturally grown Melunak (Pentace sp.), Dark Red Meranti (Shorea sp.) and Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis). Some machining defects such as <b>fuzzy</b> <b>grain,</b> torn grain and chip marks often occur in lumbers at the planing process and it decreases the machining yield. To understand and optimize the planing characteristics of this wood species, a series of experiments were carried out using a weinig Unimate 23 E moulder (cutter-head rpm of 6000, cutter diameter 120 mm) to produce machined surface with differing depth of cut ranging from 0. 8 to 2. 4 mm, by altering the feed rate from 8 to 16 m min - 1 according to ASTM D 1666 - 87. Based on the preliminary results of this study, the best results were obtained at 0. 8 mm of depth of cut and feed rate of 8 m min - 1 for Dark Red Meranti. While, the poorest results was on Melunak wood at 2. 4 mm of depth of cut and 16 m min - 1 of feed speed. This research also revealed {{that the combination of}} feed rate, depth of cut and wood species used had no significant effect on the surface quality of samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{field was}} {{investigated}} with precision farming techniques to delineate zones with different yield potential due to previous soil erosion. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield, straw yield, biomass and harvest index were {{measured with a}} combine harvester. <b>Fuzzy</b> clustering of <b>grain</b> and straw yield provided good delineation of zones in the field with different yield potential. Entropy and fuzziness calculations for different number of classes resulted in {{a division of the}} field into five clearly differentiated yield potential zones. Straw yield, biomass and harvest index were significantly different among zones. Grain yield was significantly different for all zones, except for two. Elevation and slope of the field were measured from a global positioning system (GPS) unit on the combine. Both were related to yield variability in the field. Average elevation, slope and soil type were calculated per cluster class. High grain yield, straw yield and biomass could be related to flat, high places in the field with little erosion. Good grain yield, low straw yield and high harvest index were found on relatively steep slopes subjected to erosion. High straw yield and low grain yield were found at low places in the field on relatively steep slopes. Lowest grain yield, straw yield and biomass were located on steepest slopes with high erosion and in depressions where accumulation of eroded soil took place and slumping and crusting of the soil were present. This information suggests that variable management on a site-specific basis would optimize yield and inputs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
