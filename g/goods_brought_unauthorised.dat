50|$|Although some {{companies}} offered ferry passengers {{a ride to}} Rosebud after they disembarked at Dromana, {{the bulk of the}} tourism trade went to Dromana and nearby Arthurs Seat, while Dromana remained the transportation hub for <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> by road and sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{first home}} {{constructed}} in the community was built by John S. Allen. Although built as a residence, it was primarily used to store the first stock of <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> to the community. It was destroyed by fire in 1864.|$|R
50|$|With this integration, Customs {{stations}} at {{the borders}} were abolished and no tax was imposed if the <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> {{from a state}} to another were from the union. To collect export duty on <b>goods</b> that were <b>brought</b> out by trains, tax collecting stations were established in Singapore in 1918, Prai (1919) and Malacca (1922). The stations were also tasked with collecting duties on imported goods.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 1413, a customs {{post in the}} Pass was {{licensed}} by the ruler of Wallachia. This charged a duty on all <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> through the Pass. Southwards the usual trade route ran to Cetățeni, branching out to Popeşti and Hirsova.|$|R
50|$|The bashaku {{lived in}} groups in towns along major {{highways}} and important sites {{of water to}} land traffic including Otsu, Sakamoto, and Yodo, and they carried <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> by boat to areas where consumption {{was at that time}} high such as Kyoto and Nara.|$|R
50|$|The Swahili {{people had}} various {{extensive}} trading ports dotting {{the coast of}} medieval East Africa and Great Zimbabwe had extensive trading contacts with Central Africa, and likely also imported <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> to Africa through the Southeast African shore trade of Kilwa in modern-day Tanzania.|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> from Enderi, Aksai and Kostek were {{produced}} there. These auls served as trade transit locations {{for the population}} of mountainous regions of Dagestan and Transcaucasus in their trade with Kizlyar and Astrakhan. This circumstance worried imperial authorities who were afraid that bought in Kizlyar <b>goods</b> would be <b>brought</b> customs-free through these settlements (residents of which were nationals of Russian Empire) to Dagestan and further to Transcaucasus and Iran.|$|R

50|$|It seems {{increasingly}} {{likely that}} much of Ireland’s Lusitanian fauna is in reality an artefact of this era of human expansion {{in the early part}} of the Postglacial era.

5000|$|Firms {{currently}} pay {{corporate taxes}} on their profits. Border-adjustment would change how those profits are calculated. Accountants {{could no longer}} deduct imports—say, <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> in from China—as costs. And their exports would no longer count as revenues. For tax purposes, “profits” would be domestic sales minus domestic costs. The Economist ...|$|R
50|$|An import is a <b>good</b> <b>brought</b> into a jurisdiction, {{especially}} {{across a}} national border, from an external source. The party {{bringing in the}} good is called an importer. An import in the receiving country is an export from the sending country. Importation and exportation are the defining financial transactions of international trade.|$|R

60|$|Then they {{purchased}} some provisions for the journey. The pack horse {{they had brought}} with them was laden with these, and the <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> up from Amboor. The new pack horses were taken round to the trader's, and the goods sent from Seringapatam packed on them. Then they mounted and rode off at a walk, the pack animals following Ibrahim's horse, tied one behind the other.|$|R
50|$|The Fall River and Troy mills {{had barely}} begun {{operation}} when the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24, 1814, ending the War of 1812.

50|$|The canal was {{constructed}} in the 1820s when a cut, some 3.2 km (2 mi) long on the south shore of Lough Foyle near Ballykelly {{was made in the}} direction of Limavady. As well as serving as a drainage channel, it was used for navigation, carrying <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> from the Londonderry port and shellfish and kelp from the sand banks along the shore of the lough.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} a claim for {{deduction}} of holiday pay could not be <b>brought</b> as an <b>unauthorised</b> deduction from wages under ERA 1996, applying WTR rr 13 and 14.

6000|$|Robert Frog and Tim Lumpy {{were among}} those boys, so {{changed for the better}} in a few months that, as the former remarked, [...] "their own mothers wouldn't know 'em," [...] and not only {{improved}} in appearance, but in spirit, ay, and even to some small extent in language--so great had been the influence for <b>good</b> <b>brought</b> to bear on them by Christian women working out of love to God and souls.|$|R
50|$|A long-standing {{settlement}} {{built at}} the site was chartered as the town of Kingsport in 1822, and became an important regional shipping port on the Holston River {{in the early nineteenth}} century. <b>Goods</b> <b>brought</b> in from the surrounding countryside were loaded onto barges for transport downstream to the Holton's confluence with the Tennessee River (at Knoxville). The young town lost its charter, however, after a downturn in its fortunes precipitated by the Civil War.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{evidence}} to support the rumours that the caves were used to hold slaves during the Bristol slave trade of the 17th and 18th centuries, however they were used to store the <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> in by ships from Africa and the West Indies. There is some evidence that prisoners captured during the French Revolutionary Wars or Napoleonic Wars were imprisoned in the caves, while involved {{in the creation of the}} New Cut.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is called}} [...] "Ver-o-Peso" [...] {{following}} a colonial era tradition, since the tax collector's main post was located there, which was called [...] "Casa do Haver-o-peso" [...] ("Have-the-Weight House"). It {{was in the}} [...] "Haver-o-peso house" [...] that the taxes over <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> from the Amazon forests, rivers and countryside should {{be paid to the}} Portuguese crown, but only after their weight was measured, hence the name, which later suffered a contraction.|$|R
25|$|The {{abolition}} of tax-free sales on ferry boats travelling between destinations within the European Union made Finland demand {{an exception for}} the Åland Islands on the European Union value added tax rules. The exception allows for maintained tax-free sales on the ferries between Sweden and Finland (provided they stop at Mariehamn or Långnäs) and at the airport, but has also made Åland a different tax-zone, meaning that tariffs must be levied on <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> to the islands.|$|R

50|$|But {{while the}} Lantern District is {{easily the most}} famous of the markets, don’t neglect the others. The Grain Market may be mostly {{wholesale}} grain and agricultural <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> in from the nearby countryside, but it has its own fascination for the many boats coming and going from the lakeside port and the constant haggling of both Commoners and the ruling class of Saroese-who call themselves Patrons-over even the smallest of onions, for Efeans have an unseemly love of bargaining. Never take the first price you’re offered.|$|R
50|$|Mapusa is a {{small town}} {{clustered}} around the Mount (Alto). The name Mapusa is thought to be derived from the Konkani word for a 'measure' - 'map' and the phrase fill up - 'sa'. Ancient Goan agrarian community had a well established Gaunkari or Community Farming System, where villages formed associations, worked on community land and shared profits. Market day was a major event, with <b>goods</b> <b>brought</b> in from every district to one central area. Mapusa has thus remained a prominent market center for many centuries.|$|R
