2500|$|One of {{the largest}} factors that might impact the ability to have {{training}} impact the work of practitioners at the bedside {{is the ability to}} empower frontline staff (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015). Another example of an attempt to improve patient safety through the use of simulations training <b>is</b> <b>patient</b> care to deliver just-in-time service or/and just-in-place. This training consists of 20minutes of simulated training just before workers report to shift. One study found that just in time training improved the transition to the bedside. [...] The conclusion as reported in Nishisaki (2008) work, was that the simulation training improved resident participation in real cases; but did not sacrifice the quality of service. It could be therefore hypothesized that by increasing the number of highly trained residents through the use of simulation training, that the simulation training does in fact increase patient safety.|$|E

I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He <b>is</b> <b>patient,</b> remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E

60|$|Shelley here looks forward, not back, to the Golden Age, and is {{the prophet}} of science and evolution. If we compare his Titan with similar {{characters}} in Faust and Cain, we shall find this interesting difference,--that while Goethe's Titan is cultured and self-reliant, and Byron's stoic and hopeless, Shelley's hero <b>is</b> <b>patient</b> under torture, seeing help and hope beyond his suffering. And he marries Love that the earth may be peopled with superior beings who shall substitute brotherly love for the present laws and conventions of society. Such is his philosophy; but the beginner will read this poem, not chiefly for its thought, but for its youthful enthusiasm, for its marvelous imagery, and especially for its ethereal music. Perhaps we should add here that Prometheus is, and probably always will be, a poem for the chosen few who can appreciate its peculiar spiritlike beauty. In its purely pagan conception of the world, it suggests, by contrast, Milton's Christian philosophy in Paradise Regained.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. [Ground.] Another {{reason why}} the carnal unbelieving world do so slight the Scriptures and Word of God, is, because the {{judgment}} spoken of in the Scripture is not presently executed on the transgressors.

Because God doth not presently strike the poor wretch as soon as he sins, but waits, and forbears, and <b>is</b> <b>patient,</b> therefore the world judging God to be unfaithful, go to it again and again, and every time grow harder and harder, till at last God is forced either to stretch out his mighty power to turn them, or else send death, with the devil and hell, to fetch them.
