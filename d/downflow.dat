Air above a clearly delineated section of the work surface is drawn by a second internal fan where it is exhausted through a HEPA filter. The C1 differs from a Type A in that it can use this single pass airflow, and when installed in a ducted operating mode, can protect from hazardous chemistry, like the Type Bs. The C1 also differs from the Type B BSCs in several ways; (1) it does not require a hard connected, dedicated exhaust system and blower to operate, (2) pending a risk assessment, the BSC can run for an extended duration to increase operator protection during a remote exhaust system failure, and (3) Type C1 BSCs can run without being connected to an exhaust system at all.|$|E
2500|$|Type B1 and B2 {{cabinets}} have {{a minimum}} inflow velocity of 100ft/min, and these cabinets must be hard-ducted to an exhaust system rather than exhausted through a thimble connection. Their exhaust systems must also be dedicated (one BSC per duct run, per blower). In contrast to the type A1 and A2 cabinets, Type B BSCs use single pass airflow (air that does not mix and recirculate) in order to also control hazardous chemical vapors. Type B1 cabinets split the airflow so that the air behind the smoke-split is directed to the exhaust system, while air between the operator and the smoke-split mixes with inflow air and is recirculated as <b>downflow.</b> Since exhaust air is drawn from the rear grille, the CDC advises that work with hazardous chemistry be conducted {{in the rear of}} the cabinet.

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{compelling}} evidence {{for the role of}} magnetic reconnection in solar flares comes from the supra-arcade <b>downflows</b> that have been observed above many post-flare loop arcades. These <b>downflows</b> are thought to be related to highly non-potential field lines that have reconnected and are propagating away from the current sheet. We present new observations of supra-arcade <b>downflows</b> taken with the Atmospheric Imagining Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The morphology and dynamics of the <b>downflows</b> observed with AIA provide new evidence for the role of magnetic reconnection in solar flares. With these new observations we are able to measure <b>downflows</b> originating at much larger heights than in previous studies.

40|$|High {{resolution}} spectropolarimetric {{observations of}} 3 sunspots taken with Hinode demonstrate {{the existence of}} supersonic <b>downflows</b> at or close to the umbra-penumbra boundary which have not been reported before. These <b>downflows</b> are confined to large patches, usually encompassing bright penumbral filaments, and have lifetimes of more than 14 hr. The presence of strong <b>downflows</b> in the center-side penumbra near the umbra rules out an association with the Evershed flow.

40|$|We {{report on}} new spectro-polarimetric {{measurements}} with simultaneous filter imaging observation, revealing the frequent appearance of polarization signals indicating high-speed, probably supersonic, <b>downflows</b> {{that are associated}} with at least three different configurations of magnetic fields in the solar photosphere. The observations were carried out with the Solar Optical Telescope onboard the Hinode satellite. High speed <b>downflows</b> are excited when a moving magnetic feature is newly formed near the penumbral boundary of sunspots. Also, a new type of <b>downflows</b> is identified at the edge of sunspot umbra that lack accompanying penumbral structures. These may be triggered by the interaction of magnetic fields sweeped by convection with well-concentrated magnetic flux. Another class of high speed <b>downflows</b> are observed in quiet sun and sunspot moat regions. These are closely related to the formation of small concentrated magnetic flux patches. High speed <b>downflows</b> of all types are transient time-dependent mass motions.

Physical observables, such as Dopplergrams calculated from line bisectors and Stokes V zero-crossing wavelengths, and Stokes V maps in the far red wing, are used to find regions where supersonic Evershed <b>downflows</b> may exist. We retrieve the LOS velocity and the magnetic field vector in these regions using two-component inversions of the observed Stokes profiles {{with the help of}} the SIR code. We follow these regions during their lifetime to study their temporal behavior. Finally, we carry out a statistical analysis of the detected supersonic <b>downflows</b> to characterize their physical properties. Supersonic <b>downflows</b> are contained in compact patches moving outward, which are located in the mid and outer penumbra. They are observed as bright, roundish structures at the outer end of penumbral filaments that resemble penumbral grains. The patches may undergo fragmentations and mergings during their lifetime, even some of them are recurrents. Supersonic <b>downflows</b> are associated with strong and rather vertical magnetic fields with a reversed polarity compared to that of the sunspot. Our results suggest that <b>downflows</b> returning back to the solar surface with supersonic velocities are abruptly stopped in dense deep layers and produce a shock. Consequently, this shock enhances the temperature and is detected as a bright grain in the continuum filtergrams, which could explain the existence of outward moving grains in the mid and outer penumbra.

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of sleeve valves: inline, angle pattern and <b>downflow</b> pattern. Inline sleeve valve can be {{installed}} in the pipeline or {{at the end of}} the pipeline for free discharge. Inline sleeve valve have an inlet section which allows upstream media to flow into an outer annular area. The flow then takes a 90° turn through the sleeve and collides with flow from the opposite side dissipating the energy. The flow then travels downstream through an exit spool on the downstream end. The angle pattern sleeve valve is installed at a 90° bend in place of an elbow. Angle pattern sleeve valves employ a similar design as the inline sleeve valve by creating an outer annular area to contain the media and a sleeve with tapered nozzles to pass the flow. The difference is that the flow direction after passing through the sleeve changes by 90°. <b>Downflow</b> pattern sleeve valves are installed at the end of a pipeline and discharge into sumps, reservoirs, stilling wells or tanks.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{temporal}} evolution of <b>downflows</b> observed at the lateral edges of penumbral filaments in a sunspot located {{very close to}} the disk center. Our analysis is based on a sequence of nearly diffraction-limited scans of the Fe I 617. 3 nm line taken with the CRisp Imaging Spectro-Polarimeter at the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope. We compute Dopplergrams from the observed intensity profiles using line bisectors and filter the resulting velocity maps for subsonic oscillations. Lateral <b>downflows</b> appear everywhere in the center-side penumbra as small, weak patches of redshifts next to or along the edges of blueshifted flow channels. These patches have an intermittent life and undergo mergings and fragmentations quite frequently. The lateral <b>downflows</b> move together with the hosting filaments and react to their shape variations, very much resembling the evolution of granular convection in the quiet Sun. There is a good relation between brightness and velocity of the flow structures in the center-side penumbra, with <b>downflows</b> being darker than upflows on average, which is again reminiscent of quiet Sun convection. These results point to the existence of overturning convection in sunspot penumbrae, with elongated cells forming filaments where the flow is upward but very inclined, and weak lateral downward flows. In general, the circular polarization profiles emerging from the lateral <b>downflows</b> do not show sign reversals, although sometimes we detect three-lobed profiles which are suggestive of opposite magnetic polarities in the pixel.

40|$|Solar {{granules}} {{are bright}} patterns surrounded by dark channels called intergranular lanes {{in the solar}} photosphere and are a manifestation of overshooting convection. Observational studies generally find stronger upflows in granules and weaker <b>downflows</b> in intergranular lanes. This trend is, however, inconsistent {{with the results of}} numerical simulations in which <b>downflows</b> are stronger than upflows through the joint action of gravitational acceleration/deceleration and pressure gradients. One cause of this discrepancy is the image degradation caused by optical distortion and light diffraction and scattering that takes place in an imaging instrument. We apply a deconvolution technique to Hinode/SP data in an attempt to recover the original solar scene. Our results show a significant enhancement in both, the convective upflows and <b>downflows,</b> but particularly for the latter. After deconvolution, the up- and <b>downflows</b> reach maximum amplitudes of - 3. 0 km/s and + 3. 0 km/s at an average geometrical height of roughly 50 km, respectively.
