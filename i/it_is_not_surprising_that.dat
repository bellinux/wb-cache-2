Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E

5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> their players {{dominated}} the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs {{at a much}} higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were {{a large part of the}} success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E

25|$|Pynson became King's Printer to Henry VII (and {{subsequently}} to Henry VIII) in 1506, {{an office}} that carried not only great prestige {{but also an}} annuity of two pounds, later raised to four pounds.

25|$|N-oxides {{are prone}} to undergo the Polonovski {{rearrangement}} when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of oxazepam. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2).

25|$|The {{mention of}} the Dvina river is in good {{agreement}} with the Wielbark Culture. Historically, the Goths followed the Vistula, but during the Viking Age, the Dvina-Dniepr waterway succeeded the Vistula as the main trade route to Greece for the Gutes (or Gotar in standard Old Norse), and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> it also replaced the Vistula in the migration traditions.|$|E

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a half-star out of four, writing: [...] "I praise the production only {{to suggest that}} these people should be better employed in worthier projects. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> to see a violent teenage film exploiting {{the lowest common denominator}} and preaching a message of nihilism and despair. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> to see the latest special-effect technology supplying lingering closeups of burnt flesh and other horrors. What is surprising, I suppose, is that nice people would want to wade in this sewer." ...|$|R

25|$|Jealousy {{refers to}} the thoughts, feelings, and {{behaviors}} that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is threatened by a rival. A jealous person experiences anxiety about maintaining support, intimacy, and other valued qualities of her or his relationship. Given that attachment relates to anxiety regulation, support, and intimacy, as discussed above, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> attachment also relates to jealousy.|$|E
