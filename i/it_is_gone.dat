500|$|Literary scholar Patricia Lee Yongue {{identifies}} Lincoln as {{the falling}} star. Further, she contrasts {{the dialectic of}} the [...] "powerful western falling star" [...] with a [...] "nascent spring" [...] and describes it {{as a metaphor for}} Lincoln's death meant to [...] "evoke powerful, conflicting emotions in the poet which transport him back to that first and continuously remembered rebellion signaling the death of his own innocence." [...] Biographer Betsy Erkkila writes that Whitman's star is [...] "the fallen star of America itself", and characterizes Whitman's association as [...] "politicopoetic myth to counter Booth's cry {{on the night of the}} assassination—Sic Semper Tyrannis—and the increasingly popular image of Lincoln as a dictatorial leader bent on abrogating rather than preserving basic American liberties". The star, seemingly immortal, is associated with Lincoln's vision for America—a vision of reconciliation and a national unity or identity that could only survive the president's death if Americans resolved to continue pursuing it. However, Vendler says that the poem dismisses the idea of a personal immortality through the symbol of the star, saying: [...] "the star sinks, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> forever." ...|$|E
500|$|The final credits {{movie that}} was in the PlayStation 2 version of the game was removed from the Wii version, much to Kamiya's regret as it removed the omoi—"a {{combination}} of thoughts, emotions, and messages" [...] — from the game: [...] " [...] the omoi of everyone who worked on the project, put together in a moment of bliss held out just for those who completed the journey. It was a special staff roll for a special moment. And now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone.</b> All of it. ...It's incredibly disappointing and sad." [...] A Capcom representative stated that the credits, a pre-rendered movie, had the Clover Studio logo within it, and they had [...] "no legal right to use the Clover logo in a game they were not involved with directly". Since they also lacked the source to the credits, they opted to remove them entirely from the game. Ready at Dawn's co-founder Didier Malenfant also claimed that the Wii version of Ōkami took up much more space on the game media than the PlayStation 2 version, and that the movie was cut in order to fit everything on a single game disk, however despite these claims, the credit sequence was restored in the Japanese release of the Wii version and revealed that the port was co-developed by Tose, having provided additional planners, designers, programmers and test players. The images from the credits, although not the credits themselves, are still available as unlockable art.|$|E

Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera. That is the moment the photographer is creative," [...] he said. [...] "Oop! The Moment! Once you miss it, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> forever." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the [...] "Classic 39" [...] {{episodes of}} The Honeymooners, {{there was no}} {{continuing}} story arc. Each episode is self-contained. For example, in the series premiere episode [...] "TV Or Not TV," [...] Ralph and Norton buy a television set {{with the intent to}} share it. By the next week's show, the set is gone although in later episodes a set is shown in the Nortons' apartment.

2500|$|However, visuo-spatial {{short-term}} memory can retain visual and/or spatial information over brief periods of time. [...] When this memory is in use, individuals {{are able to}} momentarily create and revisit a mental image that can be manipulated in complex or difficult tasks of spatial orientation.There are some who have disparities {{in the areas of}} the brain that allow for this to happen from different types of brain damage. There can also be a misunderstanding here in the differences between transient memories such as the visual sensory memory. A transient memory is merely a fleeting type of sensory memory. [...] Therefore, as the visual sensory memory is a type or sensory memory, there is a store for the information, but the store last for only a second or so. [...] A common effect of the visual sensory memory is that individuals may remember seeing things that weren't really there or not remembering particular things that were in their line of sight. [...] The memory is only momentary, and if it isn't attended to within a matter of seconds, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Santorum {{has written}} for Catholic {{publications}} and frequently comments on political issues from a religious standpoint. He has said, [...] "I don't believe in an America where {{the separation of church}} and state is absolute. The First Amendment means the free exercise of religion and that means bringing people and their faith into the public square." [...] In an interview with the National Catholic Reporter, Santorum said that the distinction between private religious conviction and public responsibility, espoused by President John F. Kennedy, had caused [...] "great harm in America". He said: [...] "All of us have heard people say, 'I privately am against abortion, homosexual marriage, stem cell research, cloning. But who am I to decide that it's not right for somebody else?' It sounds good, but it is the corruption of freedom of conscience." [...] Santorum has been criticized for not separating his politics from his personal faith, and has been accused of advancing a [...] "Christian theocracy" [...] through his work. He told a group of college students in 2008 that the United States had been founded on [...] "Judeo-Christian" [...] ethics, and now [...] "it is a shambles, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> from the world of Christianity as I see it." ...|$|E
