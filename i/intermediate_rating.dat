2500|$|Color film {{capable of}} {{directly}} recording high-dynamic-range images {{was developed by}} Charles Wyckoff and EG [...] "in {{the course of a}} contract with the Department of the Air Force". This XR film had three emulsion layers, an upper layer having an ASA speed rating of 400, a middle layer with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>rating,</b> and a lower layer with an ASA rating of 0.004. The film was processed {{in a manner similar to}} color films, and each layer produced a different color. The dynamic range of this extended range film has been estimated as 1:108. It has been used to photograph nuclear explosions, for astronomical photography, for spectrographic research, and for medical imaging. Wyckoff's detailed pictures of nuclear explosions appeared on the cover of Life magazine in the mid-1950s.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{complaints}} about violence and gore in {{films such as}} Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins, both of which received PG ratings, refocused attention on films seen by small children and pre-teens. According to author Filipa Antunes, this revealed the conundrum of a film which [...] "could not be recommended for all children but also could not be repudiated for all children uniformly," [...] leading to speculation that the rating system’s scope, in particular its PG classification, [...] "no longer matched a notion of childhood most parents in America could agree on." [...] Steven Spielberg, director of Temple of Doom and executive producer of Gremlins, suggested a new <b>intermediate</b> <b>rating</b> between [...] "PG" [...] and [...] "R". The [...] "PG-13" [...] rating was introduced in July 1984, with the advisory [...] "Parents Are Strongly Cautioned to Give Special Guidance for Attendance of Children Under 13 - Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Young Children". The first film to be released with this rating was the 1984 John Milius war film Red Dawn. [...] In 1985, the wording was simplified to [...] "Parents Strongly Cautioned - Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Children Under 13". Around the same time, the MPAA won a trademark infringement lawsuit against the producers and distributors of I Spit on Your Grave over a fraudulent application of its R rating to the uncut version of the film, and forced its member studios and several other home video distributors to put MPAA ratings on the packaging of MPAA-rated films via a settlement that would come into effect by fall that year.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{unequal error protection}} {{strategies for}} the efficient progressive transmission of embedded image codes over noisy channels. In progressive transmission, the reconstruction quality is important {{not only at the}} target transmission rate but also at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>rates.</b> An adequate error protection strategy may, thus, consist of optimizing the average performance over the set of <b>intermediate</b> <b>rates.</b> The performance can be the expected number of correctly decoded source bits or the expected distortion.

For a binary symmetric channel, two state-of-the-art source coders (SPIHT and JPEG 2000), we compare the progressive ability of our proposed solutions to that of the strategies that optimize the end-to-end performance of the system.

Education of parents in the perinatal period with stool cards depicting acholic and normal stools has been associated with improved time-to-diagnosis and survival in BA. PoopMD is a mobile application that utilizes a smartphone’s camera and color recognition software to analyze an infant’s stool and determine if additional follow-up is indicated. PoopMD was developed using custom HTML 5 /CSS 3 and wrapped to work on iOS and Android platforms. In order to define the gold standard regarding stool color, seven pediatri-cians were asked to review 45 photographs of infant stool and rate them as acholic, normal, or indeterminate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Asthma {{self-management}} {{education is}} {{a key component of}} international guidelines. No gold standard patient centred outcome measure exists for asthma knowledge. Our aim was to identify high-quality, validated, and reliable outcome measures suitable for use in either the research or clinical setting. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify outcome measures able to assess asthma knowledge in people with asthma. An electronic database search was made of MEDLINE, BNI, CINAHL, CDSR, DARE, Health Technology Assessment, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EMBASE, AMED, PsychInfo and ISI. A review of grey literature was also performed. Articles were included if they described the development and psychometric testing of an asthma knowledge measure. The quality of each outcome measure was assessed according to published guidance. Content validity, construct validity, criterion validity, internal consistency, responsiveness, floor and ceiling effects, reproducibility, and interpretability were evaluated and given a rating of either "positive," "intermediate," or "negative. " RESULTS: Eighteen outcome measures met the inclusion criteria. None of these had a positive rating for all eight psychometric properties. Three outcome measures achieved either a positive or <b>intermediate</b> <b>rating</b> for content validity, construct validity, internal consistency, and reproducibility. As none of the articles had sufficient data regarding floor and ceiling effects, responsiveness, or interpretability, these properties could not be assessed. CONCLUSION: We have been unable to identify any high-quality patient-centered asthma knowledge outcome measures.

Se muestran los resultados de la evaluación docente que hacen un total de 4817 estudiantes, distribuidos en 348 grupos, en el primer ciclo de 2011. Doscientos cuatro docentes (119 varones y 85 mujeres) fueron evaluados {{por medio de}} un cuestionario. Se encontró que existe una correlación positiva lineal entre dos {{variables}} cuantitativas: la nota promedio que obtienen los estudiantes en los cursos y la calificación promedio que reciben los docentes. Esto significa que existe la probabilidad de que conforme se incrementa la nota promedio por grupo, la evaluación docente mejora y viceversa. Para el Departamento de Ciencias Naturales, los estudiantes obtienen las notas promedio más bajas en los cursos (7, 1 ± 1, 69) y de igual forma los docentes reciben en promedio las calificaciones más bajas (8, 5 ± 1, 25). En el otro extremo, se ubican los Departamentos de Educación y Filosofía, Artes y Letras en donde estudiantes y docentes reciben las mejores calificaciones (9, 1 y 9, 2 respectivamente). Una calificación intermedia corresponde a los docentes que laboran en el Departamento de Ciencias Sociales y en el Sistema de Educación General (8, 7 y 8, 8 respectivamente). Los autores recomiendan una forma de evaluación más integral; de estímulo y mejora en el proceso enseñanza-aprendizaje, que considere otros ámbitos del espacio de trabajo y de la labor docente. Abstract: This {{article is}} the result of the student evaluation conducted to the faculty professors who work at the San Ramón branch of the University of Costa Rica. The results of 4817 student evaluations, distributed in 348 groups, are shown during the first cycle of 2011. Two hundred and four faculty professors (119 males and 85 females) were assessed by using a questionnaire. The study found that there is a positive linear correlation between two quantitative variables: the average grade earned by students in the courses and the average score received by teachers. This means that there is a probability that as the average grade per group increases, the faculty evaluation improves, and vice versa. In the Department of Natural Sciences, students earn the lowest average grades in the courses (7. 1 ± 1. 69); similarly, faculty professors obtain averaged lower scores (8. 5 ± 1. 25). At the other end, there are other departments like the Departments of Philosophy, Arts and Letters, and the Department of Education where students and faculty members get the best scores (8. 3 and 9. 2 respectively). In the same way, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>rating</b> corresponds to the professors working in the Department of Social Sciences and the General Education System. The authors recommend a more integrated method of assessment: one which fosters encouragement and improvement in the teaching-learning process, and that takes into account other areas of the workspace as well as the teaching responsibilitie...|$|E

In particular, the nature as an industry of logistics industry since 2002 has been changed fundamentally from an industrial sector with “high added value and weak leading force” to one with “low added value and strong leading force.” Its leading role in national economic development is mainly exemplified at providing complete integration of the supply chain for upstream and downstream enterprises and optimizing the circulation enterprises’ offline channels. This indicates that logistics industry as a fundamental service sector in the national economy becomes increasingly obvious, and its leading force in promoting other sectors of national economy is stronger.|$|R

40|$|During one {{component}} of a multiple schedule, pigeons were trained on a discrete-trial concurrent variable-interval variable-interval schedule in which one alternative had a high scheduled rate of reinforcement {{and the other a}} low scheduled rate of reinforcement. When the choice proportion between the alternatives matched their respective relative reinforcement frequencies, the obtained probabilities of reinforcement (reinforcer per peck) were approximately equal. In alternate components of the multiple schedule, a single response alternative was presented with an <b>intermediate</b> scheduled <b>rate</b> of reinforcement. During probe trials, each alternative of the concurrent schedule was paired with the constant alternative. The stimulus correlated with the high reinforcement rate was preferred over that with the <b>intermediate</b> <b>rate,</b> whereas the stimulus correlated with the <b>intermediate</b> <b>rate</b> of reinforcement was preferred over that correlated with the low rate of reinforcement. Preference on probe tests was thus determined by the scheduled rate of reinforcement. Other subjects were presented all three alternatives individually, but with a distribution of trial frequency and reinforcement probability similar to that produced by the choice patterns of the original subjects. Here, preferences on probe tests were determined by the obtained probabilities of reinforcement. Comparison of the two sets of results indicates that the availability of a choice alternative, even when not responded to, affects the preference for that alternative. The results imply that models of choice that invoke only obtained probability of reinforcement as the controlling variable (e. g., melioration) are inadequate...|$|R

In this study, altimeter measurements from the Geosat Exact Repeat Mission {{are used to}} investigate spreading rate dependence of the ridge axis gravity field. Gravity roughness provides {{an estimate of the}} amplitude of the gravity anomaly and is robust to small errors in the location of the ridge axis. Gravity roughness as a weighted root mean square of the vertical deflection at 438 ridge crossings on the mid-ocean ridge system is computed. Ridge axis gravity anomalies show a decrease in amplitude with increasing spreading rate up to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>rate</b> of about 60 - 80 mm/yr and almost no change at higher rates; overall the roughness decreases by a factor of 10 between the lowest and highest rates. In addition to the amplitude decrease, the range of roughness values observed at a given spreading rate shows a similar order of magnitude decrease with transition between 60 and 80 mm/yr.

By manipulating the schedule of reinforcement to change the rate of responding of the stimulus subject without changing its rate of reinforcement, Exp. 2 showed that the effective behavioral stimulus for the observer was the rate of chain pulling by the stimulus subject. A novel <b>intermediate</b> <b>rate</b> of responding by the stimulus monkey resulted in an <b>intermediate</b> <b>rate</b> (generalization) {{on the part of the}} observer during an extinction test.
