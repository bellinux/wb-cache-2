25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head. It gave me a lot of {{confidence}} to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> went back and scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away.|$|E
500|$|Also in January 2006, Brown {{approved}} a $50,000 budget for JC's Girls for the year. By April, seven strippers had attended Sandals Church because of JC's Girls and strippers {{from across the}} United States had contacted the organization looking for local churches. In an attempt to dispel accusations that the JC's Girls message might be motivated by jealousy, Veitch lost weight and became more physically fit. She said that she wanted strippers [...] "to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to, I could be a stripper again, but I choose {{to live my life}} for the Lord." ...|$|E
500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E

500|$|David Renwick found {{writing the}} fifth series and the 1997 Christmas special [...] "Endgame" [...] difficult, {{and he was}} {{becoming}} increasingly busy with his detective series Jonathan Creek. In early 1998, his concerns appeared in the national press. The Evening Standard quoted him: [...] "I have no new ideas for Victor Meldrew ... I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> tried to write another series it would be even harder than the Christmas one. I don't want the standard to drop [...] {{there would be no}} point in doing something I didn't believe in." [...] A year later, Renwick agreed to write a final series of One Foot, having found the four-year break after writing the fifth series fruitful. Renwick decided that Victor should die in the final episode because {{he did not want to}} be persuaded to write another series. He cites the final episode of the Only Fools and Horses 1996 Christmas specials [...] "where the fantastic closing scenes of the Trilogy saw the Trotters walking up the Yellow Brick Road, only for them to return a couple of years later". He did not want to be constantly asked by journalists and fans when Victor was coming back to their screens.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{maintains}} {{that she has}} never received any formal acting training. Instead, she credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor initially thinks a character would behave during a particular scene, and how the actor themself would behave during that same scene. Vulture.com's Angelica Jade Bastién identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an actress of such depth, breadth, and tenacity, she obliterates the argument that an untrained actor has less capability than her trained counterparts." [...] In 1992, Rolling Stone Gerri Hirshey identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an accomplished character actress" [...] who is comfortable wearing costumes that are unflattering in the traditional Hollywood sense, The Fabulous Baker Boys Susie Diamond – her most critically acclaimed role to-date – being a notable exception at the time. Pfeiffer explained that she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them interesting, opting to play characters that [...] "move" [...] her instead: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can hear the character as I'm reading, it's made some connection [...]" [...] A film critic once summarized the actress as [...] "a character actress in a screen siren's body", a sentiment with which her Scarface co-star and friend Al Pacino agrees. Pfeiffer is often commended for her ability to disguise her true feelings and emotions, a technique she frequently uses to her advantage in period films; playing roles in period costume {{has become something of}} a trademark of hers. Pfeiffer herself has admitted to being skilled in this particular area but at the same time believes that hiding one's true feelings is not uncommon, speculating, [...] "that's how most people behave. We may not be as mannered or as proper as people were in the 19th century, but very rarely are we talking about what we're really thinking." [...] Pfeiffer has called acting a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] profession due to how [...] "brutal" [...] the process can be at times. She is often praised for her acting abilities by various directors with whom she has collaborated over the years. Director Martin Scorsese described Pfeiffer, who he directed in the period drama The Age of Innocence (1993), as [...] "an actress who could portray inner conflict with her eyes and face better than any other film star of her generation." [...] Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, 1988) declared “It’s hard for me to imagine anyone who, on a level of quality, would have an edge on her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allen is {{a strong}} proponent of music education, and since winning Idol, he has become heavily {{involved}} with several charitable organizations that promote music education, including the Music Empowers Foundation and Little Kids Rock. He has stated, [...] "To me, music education is vital to every kid's development, and it can change their lives. [...] I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn't had access to music programs in school that I wouldn't be where I am today." [...] For his support of music education in schools, Allen was honored by Little Kids Rock in October 2010. In November 2011, Allen {{announced that he would}} be growing a mustache for four weeks to give his fans an incentive to support DonorsChoose and Music Empowers in their efforts to promote music education in public schools. This campaign {{played a major role in}} the raising of $80,000 by Music Empowers for music education programs as more than 50% of the donations came from Allen's fans.|$|E

2500|$|However, as Powell explained, Tricia's secret did {{not stay}} hidden for long. [...] "It's truly awful. It comes out because Mark is sorting out Frank's life {{insurance}} {{and the insurance}} company wants {{to see all of}} his medical notes. Tricia is nervous that Mark will find Frank had a paternity test, so she gets all his records and gives them to Mark in a sealed envelope. But Mark says he needs to add a cover letter and opens the envelope anyway. Of course he sees Frank took the test and demands to know what's going on. Mark's furious. Tricia runs away and Mark's left to deal with the hideous realisation that Chrissie's not his daughter and that his dad was a rapist. Then to make matters worse, he has to work with Chrissie, pretending everything's normal. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were in his shoes, I certainly wouldn't tell her. It doesn't take much imagination to realise how devastating that kind of news would be for Chrissie. Mark loves her and, {{at the end of the}} day, that's all that counts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think.
