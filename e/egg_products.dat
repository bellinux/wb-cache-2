2500|$|Blini {{are thin}} pancakes or crepes {{traditionally}} made with yeasted batter, although non-yeasted batter has become wide-spread in recent times. Blini are often served {{in connection with}} a religious rite or festival, but also constitute a common breakfast dish. The word [...] "blin" [...] (singular of blini) comes from Old Slavic [...] "mlin", which means [...] "to mill". Blini had a somewhat ritual significance for early Slavic peoples in pre-Christian times since they were a symbol of the sun, due to their round form. They were traditionally prepared {{at the end of the}} winter to honor the rebirth of the new sun during [...] Maslenitsa (Масленица, Butter Week; also known as Pancake Week). This tradition was adopted by the Orthodox Church and is carried on to the present day, as the last week of dairy and <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> before Lent. Bliny are still often served at wakes, to commemorate the recently deceased. Blini can be made from wheat, buckwheat, or other grains, although wheat blini are most popular in Russia. They may be topped with butter, smetana (sour cream), fruit preserves or caviar.|$|E
2500|$|... {{confirmed}} vegetarian diets {{provide sufficient}} protein intake {{as long as}} a variety of plant sources are available and consumed. Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. [...] Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds spirulina, pistachios, and quinoa. However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.|$|E
40|$|Pigs were weaned at {{approximately}} 18 days {{of age and}} fed diets containing inedible <b>egg</b> <b>product,</b> spray-dried plasma (SDP), or the combination of both for 2 weeks postweaning. They then received a common diet for an additional 2 weeks after the treatment period. The impact of these dietary ingredients on growth performance was evaluated. Inedible <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> did not improve growth or feed efficiency of pigs compared with those fed the control diet during the 2 -week treatment period. However, SDP increased body weight gain and feed efficiency during the treatment period. The improved performance over the control group that resulted from feeding a combination of SDP and <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> was primarily dependent upon the SDP. In the third week, a trend occurred for improved performance of pigs fed the <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> compared with those fed 4 % SDP; however, {{the difference was not}} significant. During this same period, pigs previously fed SDP gained weight slower and consumed less feed than those that had not been fed SDP. Therefore, the response to SDP was partially lost when it was removed from the diet. In summary, the outcome of this study demonstrated that inedible <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> was an adequate source of protein for the weanling pig but did not provide measurable improvements over the control diet. Inedible <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> did not have an additive effect when combined with SDP. The improved feed efficiency associated with SDP resulted in increased weanling pig growth...|$|R

2500|$|Livestock {{and poultry}} are raised on animal feed, {{much of which}} is {{composed}} of the leftovers from processing crops, including GM crops. For example, approximately 43% of a canola seed is oil. What remains after oil extraction is a meal that becomes an ingredient in animal feed and contains canola protein. Likewise, {{the bulk of the}} soybean crop is grown for oil and meal. The high-protein defatted and toasted soy meal becomes livestock feed and dog food. 98% of the US soybean crop goes for livestock feed. In 2011, 49% of the US maize harvest was used for livestock feed (including the percentage of waste from distillers grains). [...] "Despite methods that {{are becoming more and more}} sensitive, tests have not yet been able to establish a difference in the meat, milk, or eggs of animals depending on the type of feed they are fed. It is impossible to tell if an animal was fed GM soy just by looking at the resulting meat, dairy, or <b>egg</b> <b>products.</b> The only way to verify the presence of GMOs in animal feed is to analyze the origin of the feed itself." ...|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine different protein sources for segregated, early weaned (SEW) pigs. Protein sources evaluated included extruded soybeans, extruded-expelled soybeans, solvent-extracted soybean meal and spray-dried <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> {{as a substitute for}} spray-dried plasma protein. Performance differences among the four treatments could not be detected after seven weeks (two week experimental period and five week common corn-soybean meal diet). The cost of gain was reduced during the two-week treatment period by feeding diets with reduced plasma protein levels with or without the partial or complete substitution of spray-dried <b>egg</b> <b>product.</b> In addition, SEW pigs consuming the diet containing 20 percent soybean meal and 6 percent spray-dried plasma performed similarly to pigs receiving a more conventional SEW nursery diet (10 percent soybean meal, 6 percent spray-dried plasma protein). These experiments suggest egg protein and soybean proteins may be used for SEW pigs without significantly decreasing nursery performance over a seven-week period. The role of plant protein sources in diets for SEW pigs needs to be reevaluated...|$|R

50|$|In 1965, {{reorganization}} of the ARS' Consumer and Marketing Service brought federal meat and poultry inspection into one program. In 1967, the Wholesome Meat Act amended the FMIA, and in 1968, the Wholesome Poultry Act amended the PPIA, both requiring states to conduct inspection programs at least as stringent as federal inspections. The <b>Egg</b> <b>Products</b> Inspection Act (EPIA), passed in 1970, ensured the continuous inspection of the processing of <b>egg</b> <b>products.</b> In 1995, this task {{was taken over by}} FSIS, and the FDA took responsibility for shell <b>egg</b> <b>products.</b> In 1977, following several changes in organization, the Food Safety and Quality Service, renamed the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) in 1981, was created to perform meat and poultry grading.|$|E
