5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. The session was held in dry weather conditions but dark clouds meant that there was a risk of further rain showers. With limited <b>dry</b> <b>running</b> in the final practice session grip, levels rose as qualifying progressed.|$|E

50|$|The fort {{was built}} between 1808 and 1812 to prevent invaders gaining access from Maidstone Road to the River Medway. The work was {{composed}} of a long brick revetted <b>dry</b> ditch <b>running</b> between a fortified guardroom on the Rochester-Maidstone Road to a similar tower alongside the Medway. The principal work (still surviving) is a massive red brick keep, {{in the style of}} a medieval castle, which served as gun tower and observation post. In the sides of the tower were embrasures to sweep the ditch with fire. The <b>dry</b> ditch <b>running</b> across St Margaret's Street was crossed by drawbridge through a substantial casemated guardhouse {{in the form of an}} arch (which was demolished in the 1930s). From the tower ran a series of tunnels to the outlying guardhouses. Behind the <b>dry</b> ditch <b>running</b> from the tower down to Maidstone Road was a range of domestic building and barracks.|$|R

50|$|The {{second session}} was {{similarly}} rain-affected, with only limited running taking {{place before the}} rain returned; however, the gaps between drivers were not as extreme as those witnessed during the morning session. Mark Webber set the fastest time of the session, four seconds faster than Schumacher's time in the morning session. Fernando Alonso was second ahead of Button and Lewis Hamilton. The session was free of incidents, though Renault's Vitaly Petrov suffered a steering problem that saw him finish the 90-minute session in 24th and last place having done no <b>dry</b> <b>running</b> in the session.|$|E
50|$|Para Hills {{is built}} on an {{escarpment}} of the Para Fault Block {{at the edge of}} the Adelaide plains, rising 61 m above the plains.

The gullies are usually <b>dry,</b> <b>running</b> only shortly after rain, and have mostly been left as public parks. Outcrops of exposed pre-Cambrian rocks have been quarried for use in roadmaking and construction since the late 19th century.

50|$|The {{competition}} comprises three {{general categories}} of race: children's and junior races, the mass participation ("popular") race, {{and the professional}} international races. The men's international race was a 10 km race until 1999 when it was increased to roughly 11 km. The distance of the women's international race (currently 8 km) has also fluctuated, varying between 5.5 km and 6.6 km in its early years. The course of the race loops through the ancient streets of Itálica, passing alongside ruins throughout. The red clay ground usually makes for a <b>dry</b> <b>running</b> surface, although rain has occasionally made this a particularly difficult, muddy course in previous editions.|$|E

5000|$|This was a {{difficult}} and interesting session as everyone waited for almost {{half an hour before}} leaving the pits. This meant there was not much time to get in the four runs and improve the car. This was complicated by the fact we had no <b>dry</b> <b>running</b> this morning. Then the timing monitors failed and although we knew the lap times, we could not see the sector times which can be useful in analysing where we need to improve. So it was quite an exciting session. We made small changes to the car before each run, to suit the track and the conditions. It's good to be on pole as it is an advantage and although we are in a strong position in the championship, there are still seventy points available this season. As for the race, I don't really mind what conditions we have, but I would prefer a dry race which is more consistent and safer and I hope it is entertaining for the spectators.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} solar driven automatic {{water level}} controller with dry run protection (SDWLC). The {{main purpose of}} SDWLC is to reduce wastage of water, to stop <b>dry</b> <b>running</b> of motor and to use solar energy effectively by using PV system. Generally water is pumped to overheadtank (OHT) from undergroundtank (UGT). People will switch on pump when taps go dry, switch off pump when water over flows and they does not check <b>dry</b> <b>running</b> of motor during this. Also pumping of water to OHT during power cuts {{is a major problem}} in most of villages and in some of cities. However these problems can be solved by SDWLC. By using inverter the DC generated from PV system is converted in to AC and given to the motor. The operation of water level controller works upon the fact that water conducts electricity. So water can be used to open or close a circuit. As the water level rises or falls, different circuits in the controller send different signals. These signals are used to switch ON or switch OFF the motor pump as per our requirements...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 77 As users {{continue}} {{to turn to}} sealless pumps to solve their leakage (emission) problems they are demanding robust designs that are more tolerant of system upsets and {{have the ability to}} survive short periods of <b>dry</b> <b>running.</b> Silicon carbide bearings are known to be the least forgiving during <b>dry</b> <b>running,</b> but are still the best universal choice. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate means to extend the life of silicon carbide bearings in a <b>dry</b> <b>running</b> environment. A test rig was designed to simulate broken prime and drained pump dry run conditions. The test pump was a 1 ? x 1 x 8 ANSI magnetic drive pump driven by a 15 hp 3600 rpm motor. Both sintered silicon carbide and 70 micron controlled porosity silicon carbide with Teflon lubricating strips were tested in conductive and nonconductive containment shells. Damage assessment was made after each test. Results of water tests show the robust pump design and proper bearing alignment is essential. Under broken prime conditions with a nonconductive containment shell, controlled porosity silicon carbide with Teflon lubricating strips ran for 4 ? hours without overheating, failure or damage. The broken prime dry run time for conductive containment shells is partly dependent upon the magnitude of eddy current heat generated and the time required to boil off the product lubricant; for the models tested, this time was approximately 32 to 35 minutes. Drained casing tests with nonconductive containment shells show a doubling of dry run time with controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon strips over that of sintered silicon carbide. A drained casing test with conductive containment shell configured with controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon lubricating strips had a dry run time of 36 minutes and underwent much less bearing damage than a broken prime test with sintered silicon carbide and conductive containment shell. The addition of controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon lubricating strips can add substantially to dry run life and help reduce damage to the product lubricated bearings...|$|E
