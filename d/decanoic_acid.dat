40|$|The role of {{intercellular}} {{communication in the}} regulation of bacterial multicellular behavior has received widespread attention, {{and a variety of}} signal molecules involved in bacterial communication have been discovered. In addition to the N-acyl-homoserine lactones, 4 -hydroxy- 2 -alkylquinolines (HAQs), including the Pseudomonas quinolone signal, have been shown to function as signal molecules in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study we unraveled the biosynthetic pathway of HAQs using feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors and analysis of extracted HAQs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our results show that the biosynthesis of various HAQ metabolites is directed via a common metabolic pathway involving a “head-to-head” condensation of anthranilic acid and β-keto fatty acids. Moreover, we provide evidence that the β-keto-(do) <b>decanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> crucial for the biosynthesis of the heptyl and nonyl derivatives of the 4 -hydroxyquinolines in P. aeruginosa, are at least in part derived from a common pool of β-hydroxy(do) <b>decanoic</b> <b>acids</b> involved in rhamnolipid biosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|Although organic, {{lipophilic}} acids, such as acetic, propionic, sorbic and benzoic, have a {{long history}} as preservatives in the food industry, relatively high concentrations are required and their bioactivities generally pertain to retarding microbial growth rather than eliminating pathogens. Moreover, exclusive use of organic acids such as lactic or citric acid, alone, as broad-spectrum biocides, is generally not sufficient for long term control of mold fungi. However, specific organic acids (i. e., glycolic and L lactic), even at low concentrations, are now known to be potent synergists with certain fatty acids as broad-spectrum, environmentally compatible fungicides. Specifically, low molecular weight, aliphatic fatty acids (mono-carboxyl compounds such as pentanoic to <b>decanoic</b> <b>acids</b> or C 5 to C 10) at various application rates +/- selected adjuvants have been examined as candidate mold and decay fungicides.

40|$|New {{insights}} into the toxicity mechanism of octanoic and <b>decanoic</b> <b>acids</b> on Saccharomyces cerevisiaeOctanoic (C 8) and <b>decanoic</b> (C 10) <b>acids</b> are produced in hypoxic conditions by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as by-products of its metabolism and are considered fermentation inhibitors {{in the presence of}} ethanol at acidic pH. This study aims to broaden our understanding of the physiological limits between toxicity and ester production in yeast cells. To this end, the non-inhibitory concentration (NIC) and maximum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were first established for C 8 and C 10 at physiological pH (5. 8) without ethanol. The results showed that when these acids were added to culture medium at these values, they tended to accumulate in different cellular fractions of the yeast. While C 8 was almost entirely located in the cell wall fraction, C 10 was found in the endocellular fraction. Cell fatty acid detoxification was also different; while the esterification of fatty acids was more efficient in the case of C 10, the peroxisome was activated regardless of which fatty acid was added. Furthermore, the study of the Pdr 12 and Tpo 1 transporters that evolved during the detoxification process revealed that C 8 was mostly expelled by the Pdr 12 carrier, which was related to higher β-oxidative damage in the presence of endocellular C 10. C 10 is more toxic at lower concentrations than C 8. Although they are produced by yeast, the resulting intracellular medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) caused a level of toxicity which promoted cell death. However, MCFAs are involved in the production of beverage flavours. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

Three C 18 fatty acids, oleic acid, 10 (9) -hydroxystearic acid, and ricinoleic acid, completely inhibited water absorption at 5 mM. Sodium, chloride, and potassium absorptions were inhibited {{in parallel with}} absorption of water. Differences between the potencies of C 18 fatty acids were apparent when lesser concentrations were perfused.

40|$|After {{absorption}} {{from the}} intestinal tract, fatty acid molecules with chain lengths of ten or less carbon atoms {{are known to}} be transported un-esterified in the portal blood stream rather than in the lymph in the form of triglycerides (1 - 3). It has been reported that in patients with celiac disease and cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the ef-ficiency of lipid adsorption appears {{to be related to the}} chain length of the dietary fatty acids (4, 5). In these subjects triglycerides of octanoic and <b>decanoic</b> <b>acids</b> (medium chain triglycerides) seem to be more completely absorbed than those containing fatty acids of higher molecular weight. Differences in the behavior of fatty acids dur-ing absorption are probably due partly to their physical properties and partly to variations in their intramucosal metabolism. The transport of absorbed fatty acids of low molecular weight by the portal route is likely related closely to their poor incorporation into mucosal triglycerides (6). This situation may be caused by the low activity of the esterifying enzymes toward these sub-strates (7), the presence of an active lipase, or more likely, a combination of both factors.

The characterization of musts and wines was done in terms of density, total and volatile acidity, alcohol content, pH, total of polyphenol, organic acids composition, sugars concentration and the volatile profile. Also, it was developed and validated an analytical methodology to quantify the volatile fatty acids, namely using SPME-GC-MS.

A 75 % ethanolic extract at 50 mg dried weight (derived from 227 mg aerial parts) per kg body weight increased GM-CFCs by 70 % but at 100 mg/kg was without effect.

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a complex}} disease with a {{multifaceted}} pathophysiology. Impairment of energy metabolism is {{a key component of}} secondary insults. This phenomenon is a consequence of multiple potential mechanisms including diffusion hypoxia, mitochondrial failure, and increased energy needs due to systemic trauma responses, seizures, or spreading depolarization. The degree of disturbance in brain metabolism is affected by treatment interventions and reflected in clinical patient outcome. Hence, monitoring of these secondary events in peripheral blood will provide a window into the pathophysiological course of severe TBI. New methods for assessing perturbation of brain metabolism are needed in order to monitor on-going pathophysiological processes and thus facilitate targeted interventions and predict outcome. Circulating metabolites in peripheral blood may serve as sensitive markers of pathological processes in TBI. The levels of these small molecules in blood are less dependent on the integrity of the blood–brain barrier as compared to protein biomarkers. We have recently characterized a specific metabolic profile in serum that is associated with both initial severity and patient outcome of TBI.

This study analyses how the main compositional parameters and volatile compounds {{are influenced by the}} raw material wine, distillation technology, distillation steps, removal of the lower-quality fractions (heads and tails). The raw material used to make the distillates was a mixture of two wines of Fetească albă and Fetească regală, harvest of 2015, from Iasi vineyard. The proposed experimental protocol consisted of the double distillation of a volume of 1000 L of raw material. For the distillation, a simple copper distillery with a deflector was used. From each 10 L of distillate obtained, samples were taken and analysed via gas-chromatography. In the first and second distillation, the largest amounts of acetic acid are found in the head. The highest concentrations of octanoic acid are recorded in tails, as does hexanoic acid. The product obtained after the first distillation recorded an average alcoholic strength of 33. 5 % vol, which increased after the second distillation, so that the final distillate has an alcoholic strength of 58. 5 % vol.
