The only reason I get red marks on my paper is because of stupid you, and that jerk Andrew at my table who makes me more stupid every day. I won’t do no more for YOU, never, ” he continued. Eric, who has a file documenting violent outbursts for nearly a year, <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but not before heaving a neatly stacked pile of papers and books onto the floor.

Oppositional defiant disorder is a mental health condition that is identified by the American Psychiatric Association as a disruptive behavior disorder that is typically first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, and adolescence (2000).

40|$|Diversity {{training}} {{is a type}} of prejudice reduction and social inclusion intervention in need of “action research”—an integration of research and theory with practice (Lewin, 1946). Hundreds of workplaces and schools use some form of diversity training, but most interventions are not grounded in theory and there is little evidence of program impact. A recent study of a school diversity training program illustrates how action research can address theoretical issues using experimental methods and unobtrusive outcome measures. For future research, the literature on intergroup contact (Pettigrew, 1998) can provide theoretical guidance while testing and refining its principles in the application and investigation of diversity training. Action research will benefit diversity training and the broader theoretical and applied project of prejudice reduction and the promotion of social inclusion. “Diversity Day” A group of office workers shuffle into a fluorescent-lit room where two rows of chairs face a television stand. Standing in front of a “Diversity Day—Take 2 !” banner, their supervisor Michael urges them into their seats: “Let’s have fun, ev-erybody! ” After the group watches a video of a man speaking about the importance of diversity, a South Asian woman rises and <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> She pauses in front of Michael to explain she has a customer meeting. “If you leave, we’ll only have two left—er, yes, enjoy! ” Michael blurts.
