ABSTRACT: Alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells cover {{most of the}} internal surface area of the lungs. Ultrastructural studies demonstrate that alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cell damage is frequently observed in acute and chronic lung diseases. This article discusses the use of cell-selective proteins as markers for the investigation of injury and repair of the alveolar epithelium. The utility of proteins specific to alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells as diagnostic markers of alveolar epithelial injury in acute lung injury is considered, and expression of proteins selective for alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells in lungs following injury and in fibrosis are discussed...|$|E

Snx 5 has also been suggested to interact with Mind bomb- 1, an E 3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the activation of Notch signaling. However, the in vivo functions of Snx 5 are largely unknown. Here, we report that disruption of the Snx 5 gene in mice (Snx 5 (-/-) mice) resulted in partial perinatal lethality; 40 % of Snx 5 (-/-) mice died shortly after birth due to cyanosis, reduced air space in the lungs, and respiratory failure. Histological analysis revealed that Snx 5 (-/-) mice exhibited thickened alveolar walls associated with undifferentiated alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells. In contrast, alveolar epithelial type II cells were intact, exhibiting normal surfactant synthesis and secretion. Although the expression levels of surfactant proteins and saturated phosphatidylcholine in the lungs of Snx 5 (-/-) mice were {{comparable to those of}} Snx 5 (+/+) mice, the expression levels of T 1 α, Aqp 5, and Rage, markers for distal alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells, were significantly decreased in Snx 5 (-/-) mice.

In comparison with controls, the rats with ligated common bile ducts (CBD) developed progressive hepatic and pulmonary changes. The hepatic damage consisted of bile duct proliferation, loss of hepatocytes and generalized cirrhosis. Most pronounced pulmonary histologic differences between the CBD and sham-operated rats were thickening of interalveolar septa and generalized increase in cellularity of alveolar walls.

We found that pleiotrophin and its receptor, protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor β/ζ, were highly expressed in mesenchymal and epithelial {{cells of the}} fetal lungs, respectively. Using isolated fetal alveolar epithelial type II cells, we demonstrated that pleiotrophin promoted fetal type II cell proliferation and arrested type II cell trans-differentiation into alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells. Pleiotrophin also increased wound healing of injured type II cell monolayer. Knockdown of pleiotrophin influenced lung branching morphogenesis in a fetal lung organ culture model. Pleiotrophin increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, promoted β-catenin translocation into the nucleus, and activated T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors. Dlk 1, a membrane ligand that initiates the Notch signaling pathway, {{was identified as a}} downstream target of the pleiotrophin/β-catenin pathway by endogenous dlk 1 expression, promoter assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation.

A significant degree of colocalization was observed between P 2 X 7 and the raft marker protein Caveolin- 1; also, P 2 X 7 protein was associated with caveolae. A marked reduction in P 2 X 7 immunoreactivity was observed in lung sections prepared from Caveolin- 1 -knockout mice, indicating that Caveolin- 1 expression was required for full expression of P 2 X 7 protein. Indeed, suppression of Caveolin- 1 protein expression in E 10 cells using short hairpin RNAs resulted in a large reduction in P 2 X 7 protein expression.

The functions of AEC II, including surfactant release, cell differentiation and ion transport, have been extensively studied. However, relatively little is known regarding the physiological functions of AEC I. Global gene expression profiling of freshly isolated AEC I and II revealed that many genes were differentially expressed in AEC I. These genes have a diversity of functions, including cell defence. Nine out of 10 selected genes were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Two genes, apolipoprotein E (Apo E) and transferrin, were further characterized and functionally studied. Immunohistochemistry indicated that both proteins were specifically localized in AEC I. Up-regulation of Apo E and transferrin was observed in hyperoxic lungs. Functionally, Apo E and transferrin play a protective role against oxidative stress in an animal model.

To further understand the role of glucocorticoids in fetal lung maturation, we have analyzed mice with a targeted null mutation for the glucocorticoid receptor (CR) gene, which severely retards lung development. The lungs of fetal CR-null mice have increased lung weight and DNA content, are condensed and hypercellular, with reduced septal thinning leading to a 6 -fold increase in the airway to capillary diffusion distance. In fetal CR-null mice, mRNA levels of the <b>type</b> II <b>epithelial</b> cell surfactant protein genes A and C were reduced by ∼ 50 %. Analysis of <b>epithelial</b> cell <b>types</b> by electron microscopy revealed that the proportions of type II cells were increased by ∼ 30 %, whereas the proportions of type-I cells were markedly reduced (by ∼ 50 %). Similarly, we found a 50 % reduction in mRNA levels for T 1 α and aquaporin- 5, two <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cell-specific markers, and a 20 % reduction in aquaporin- 1 mRNA levels.

This study reports a first attempt to evaluate the activation of type III IFN genes (IFN lambda 1 - 3), IFN lambda receptor genes (IFN-lambdaR 1 and IL 10 R 2), and IFN-induced genes (MxA, ISG 15, ISG 56) in HPV-positive and HPV-negative cervical cells from 154 women attending the gynecological unit of a university hospital in Rome. Despite an increased individual variability, a coordinated expression of several IFN lambda-related genes was observed. Furthermore, IFN lambda 1 and IFN-lambdaR 1 genes were expressed at higher levels in cervical cells positive to low-risk (LR) HPV compared to HR-HPV and HPV-negative cells. Consistently, ISG 15 expression was significantly higher in LR-HPV-infected women than in the other groups. Moreover, IFN lambda 1 expression decreased significantly with abnormal cytological results. This study is the first to show the activation of a type III IFN response in LR-HPV-positive cervical cells and suggests that the lack of this response in HR-HPV infection may be related to lesion progression...|$|E

Cre has previously been efficiently expressed in AT 2 cells in mouse lung with the surfactant protein (SP) -C promoter; however, no transgenic mouse expressing Cre in AT 1 cells has so far been available. To develop an AT 1 cell–specific transgenic Cre mouse, we generated a knockin of a Cre-IRES-DsRed cassette into exon 1 of the endogenous aquaporin 5 (Aqp 5) gene, a gene expressed specifically in AT 1 cells in the distal lung epithelium, resulting in the mouse line, Aqp 5 -Cre-IRES-DsRed (ACID). Endogenous Aqp 5 and transgenic Cre in ACID mice showed a very similar pattern of tissue distribution by RT-PCR. To analyze Cre activity, ACID was crossed to two Cre reporter strains, R 26 LacZ and mT/mG. Double-transgenic offspring demonstrated reporter gene expression in a very high fraction of AT 1 cells in the distal lung, whereas AT 2 cells were negative. As expected, variable reporter expression was detected in several other tissues where endogenous Aqp 5 is expressed (e. g., submandibular salivary gland and stomach).

A heterogeneous population of non-ciliated lung lineage-specific cells was derived by a novel method of embryoid body (EB) differentiation. This differentiated human cell population was used to modulate the profibrotic phenotype in transplanted animals. Methodology and Principal Findings: Omission or inclusion of one or more components in the differentiation medium skewed differentiation of H 7 hES cells into varying proportions of AEI, AEII, and Clara cells. ICG- 001, a small molecule inhibitor of Wnt/b-catenin/Creb-binding protein (CBP) transcription, changed marker expression of the differentiated ES cells from an AEII-like phenotype to a predominantly AEI-like phenotype. The differentiated cells were used in xenograft transplantation studies in bleomycin-treated Rag 2 cC 2 / 2 mice.

In primary culture ATII cells grown on a plastic substratum acquire with time an ATI-“like” phenotype. We demonstrate that freshly isolated rat ATII cells lack caveolae and expression of caveolin- 1 (a critical caveolae structural protein). As the ATII cells acquire an ATI-like phenotype in primary culture caveolin- 1 expression increases, with caveolin- 1 signal at 192 h postseeding up to 50 -fold greater than at 60 h; caveolae were morphologically evident only after 132 h. When maintaining the differentiated ATII phenotype with time, i. e., culture upon collagen with an apical interface of air, a temporal increase in caveolin- 1 expression was not observed, with only very faint signals evident even at 192 h postseeding; at no time did these cultures display caveolae. In late primary ATII cultures caveolin- 1 expression and caveolae biogenesis occur as a function of in vitro transformation from the ATII to the ATI-like phenotype.

However, mechanisms behind the physiological and pathological roles of alveolar epithelia in human lungs remain largely unknown, partially owing to the difficulty of isolation and culture of primary human AECII cells. In the present study, we aimed to characterize alveolar epithelia generated from A 549 lung adenocarcinoma cells that were cultured in an air-liquid interface (ALI) state. Morphological analysis demonstrated that A 549 cells could reconstitute epithelial layers in ALI cultures as evaluated by histochemistry staining and electronic microscopy. Immunofluorescent staining further revealed an expression of alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cell (AECI) markers aquaporin- 5 protein (AQP- 5), and AECII cell marker surfactant protein C (SPC) in subpopulations of ALI cultured cells. Importantly, molecular analysis further revealed the expression of AQP- 5, SPC, thyroid transcription factor- 1, zonula occludens- 1 and Mucin 5 B in A 549 ALI cultures as determined by both immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR assay.

Because SOD 2 is not directly inducible by <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferons, it served as a marker to probe the impact of NS 1 on signaling of other cytokines known to induce SOD 2 expression and/or indirect effects of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon signaling.

An ideal approach would be to purify a population of lung epithelial cells from a heterogeneous culture to ensure a high proportion of desirable cell types for investigation. Importantly, we must demonstrate that these ES-derived cells are similar to alveolar epithelial cells both in appearance and function. ^ Here, I will argue the benefit of using embryonic stem-derived cells as a source of functional alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> II-like cells. <b>I</b> begin by explaining the potential use and benefits of cell-based therapy to treat lung disease, considering clinically useful cell sources and experimental models of pulmonary hypoplasia. Next, I describe the differentiation of mouse ES cells to definitive endoderm and lung epithelial cells using defined medium composition. I refine the procedure by incorporating synthetic small molecules in place of recombinant growth factors, and demonstrate their ability to prime mouse ES cells for lung epithelial differentiation. I show that heterogeneous cells can be enriched for markers of lung epithelial differentiation. Finally, I report on the progress in modifying a renal capsule allograft assay for the validation of ES-derived cells as functional lung epithelial cells. ...|$|R
40|$|Adenoviral {{evolution}} has generated mechanisms to resist host cell defense systems, but the biochemical basis for evasion of multiple antiviral pathways in the airway by adenoviruses is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that adenoviruses modulate airway <b>epithelial</b> responses to <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferons by altering the levels and activation of specific Janus family kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling components. In this study, specific effects of adenovirus type 5 (AdV) on selected JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways {{were identified in}} human tracheobronchial epithelial cells, with focus on <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon–dependent signaling and gene expression. We found that wild-type AdV infection inhibited IFN-α–induced expression of antiviral proteins in epithelial cells by blocking phosphorylation of the Stat 1 and Stat 2 transcription factors that are required for activation of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon–dependent genes. These effects correlated with AdV-induced down-regulation of expression of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase Jak 1 through a decrease in Jak 1 mRNA levels. Phosphorylation of Stat 3 in response to IL- 6 and oncostatin M was also lost in AdV-infected cells, indicating loss of epithelial cell responses to other cytokines that depend on Jak 1. In contrast, IL- 4 – and IL- 13 –dependent phosphorylation of Stat 6 was not affected during AdV infection, indicating that the virus modulates specific signaling pathways, as these Stat 6 -activating pathways can function independent of Jak 1. Taken together, {{the results indicate that}} AdV down-regulates host epithelial cell Jak 1 to assure inhibition of the antiviral effects of multiple mediators to subvert airway defense responses and establish a productive infection...|$|R
40|$|The rat {{cell line}} R 3 / 1 {{displays}} several phenotypical features of alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells. In order to characterise the cell line as an in vitro model for drug disposition studies, R 3 / 1 cells were cultured on Transwell filters and the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured as a parameter for {{the integrity of}} cell layers. Presence of cell junctional proteins (i. e., E-cadherin, occludin, ZO- 1 and ZO- 2) was studied on mRNA (by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) and antigen level (by immunofluorescence microscopy, IFM). Moreover, the expression pattern of catabolic peptidases (carboxypeptidase M, aminopeptidases A, B, N and P, γ-glutamyltransferase, dipeptidylpeptidase IV, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and endopeptidases 24. 11 and 24. 15) was analysed in R 3 / 1 cells and compared to rat alveolar epithelial I-like cells in primary culture. TEER values were peaking at ~ 99 ± 17 Ω cm 2 after 5 days in culture. Addition of 0. 1 µM dexamethasone together with foetal bovine serum at 20 % increased TEER by 65 %. However, none of culture conditions used in our study yielded monolayers with TEER values {{comparable to those of}} primary cultures of rat pneumocytes. RT-PCR revealed the absence of transcripts encoding for E- cadherin and occludin. However, ZO- 1 and - 2 mRNA transcripts [...] ...|$|E
40|$|P 2 X 7 receptors, ATP-gated cation channels, are {{specifically}} expressed in alveolar epithelial cells. The pathophysiological function of this lung cell type, except a recently reported putative involvement in surfactant secretion, is unknown. In addition, P 2 X 7 receptor-deficient mice show reduced inflammation and lung fibrosis after exposure with bleomycin. To elucidate {{the role of}} the P 2 X 7 receptor in alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> cells we characterized the pulmonary phenotype of P 2 X 7 receptor knockout mice by using immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and real-time RT PCR. No pathomorphological signs of fibrosis were found. Results revealed, however, a remarkable loss of aquaporin- 5 protein and mRNA in young knockout animals. Additional in vitro experiments with bleomycin treated precision cut lung slices showed a greater sensitivity of the P 2 X 7 receptor knockout mice in terms of aquaporin- 5 reduction as wild type animals. Finally, P 2 X 7 receptor function was examined by using the alveolar epithelial cell lines E 10 and MLE- 12 for stimulation experiments with bleomycin. The in vitro activation of P 2 X 7 receptor was connected with an increase of aquaporin- 5, whereas the inhibition of the receptor with oxidized ATP resulted in down regulation of aquaporin- 5. The early loss of aquaporin- 5 which can be found in different pulmonary fibrosis models does not implicate a specific pathogenetic role during fibrogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary gas {{exchange}} {{relies on a}} rich capillary network, which, together with alveolar <b>epithelial</b> <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and II cells, form alveolar septa, the functional units in the lung. Alveolar capillary endothelial cells are critical in maintaining alveolar structure, because disruption of endothelial cell integrity underlies several lung diseases. Here we show that targeted ablation of lung capillary endothelial cells recapitulates the cellular events involved in cigarette smoke-induced emphysema, {{one of the most}} prevalent nonneoplastic lung diseases. Based on phage library screening on an immortalized lung endothelial cell line, we identified a lung endothelial cell-binding peptide, which preferentially homes to lung blood vessels. This peptide fused to a proapoptotic motif specifically induced programmed cell death of lung endothelial cells in vitro as well as targeted apoptosis of the lung microcirculation in vivo. As early as 4 days following peptide administration, mice developed air space enlargement associated with enhanced oxidative stress, influx of macrophages, and up-regulation of ceramide. Given that these are all critical elements of the corresponding human emphysema caused by cigarette smoke, these data provide evidence for a central role for the alveolar endothelial cells in the maintenance of lung structure and of endothelial cell apoptosis in the pathogenesis of emphysema-like changes. Thus, our data enable the generation of a convenient mouse model of human emphysema. Finally, combinatorial screenings on immortalized cells followed by in vivo targeting establishes an experimental framework for discovery and validation of additional ligand-directed pharmacodelivery systems...|$|E

40|$|Type IV {{collagen}} is a {{major component}} of basement membranes and it provides structural and functional support to various cell types. Type IV collagen exists in a highly complex suprastructure form and recent studies implicate that protomer (the trimeric building unit of type IV collagen) assembly is mediated by the NC 1 domain present in the C-terminus of each collagen α-chain polypeptide. Here we show that type IV collagen contributes to the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype of proximal tubular <b>epithelial</b> cells, whereas <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). In addition, the recombinant human α 1 NC 1 domain inhibits assembly of type IV collagen NC 1 hexamers and potentially disrupts the deposition of type IV collagen, facilitating EMT in vitro. Inhibition of type IV collagen assembly by the α 1 NC 1 domain up-regulates the production of transforming growth factor-β 1 in proximal tubular epithelial cells, an inducer of EMT. These results strongly suggest that basement membrane architecture is pivotal for the maintenance of epithelial phenotype and that changes in basement membrane architecture potentially lead to up-regulation of transforming growth factor-β 1, which contributes to EMT during renal fibrosis...|$|R
