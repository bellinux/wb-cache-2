60|$|Miss Tox {{was often}} {{in the habit of}} assuring Mrs Chick, that nothing could exceed her {{interest}} in all connected with the development of that sweet child;' and an observer of Miss Tox's proceedings might have inferred so much without declaratory confirmation. She would preside over the innocent repasts of the young heir, with ineffable satisfaction, almost with an air of <b>joint</b> <b>proprietorship</b> with Richards in the entertainment. At the little ceremonies of the bath and toilette, she assisted with enthusiasm. The administration of infantine doses of physic awakened all the active sympathy of her character; and being on one occasion secreted in a cupboard (whither she had fled in modesty), when Mr Dombey was introduced into the nursery by his sister, to behold his son, in the course of preparation for bed, taking a short walk uphill over Richards's gown, in a short and airy linen jacket, Miss Tox was so transported beyond the ignorant present as to be unable to refrain from crying out, 'Is he not beautiful Mr Dombey! Is he not a Cupid, Sir!' and then almost sinking behind the closet door with confusion and blushes.|$|E

6000|$|Hearing this, Felix propounded an old longing of his--namely, to {{make the}} Pursuivant a daily paper, and use means for promptitude of intelligence, such as might neutralise the unpopularity it was {{incurring}} on behalf of Mr. Smith. Rumours of a rival paper were afloat; but if Ferdinand would throw in his capital, and undertake the <b>joint</b> editorship and <b>proprietorship,</b> the hold that the Pursuivant already had warranted quite success enough to permit an immediate marriage. There would be {{no need to be}} concerned with the shop; they might take a cottage in the country, and he need not ride in so often as every day. In fact, it was his capital rather than his personal assistance that was wanted. He caught at the notion. He was too Transatlantic to have any dignities to stand upon, and he said almost with tears in his eyes that he could never be so happy as in working with Felix; and he went off to the Fortinbras Arms, only lamenting that {{it was too late to}} tell Alda; while Felix, on his side, could not help knocking at Geraldine's door. Within he found another auditor, Wilmet, who still always helped Cherry to bed. 'It will be the making of the Pursuivant,' he said. How often I have sighed, [...] "If I had but capital, or Mr. Froggatt enterprise!"' ...|$|R
5000|$|However, by 1980 MLAS was {{in serious}} {{financial}} trouble. Levinson then asked Sanford Berlin, a retired {{executive in the}} audio industry, to invest in MLAS and {{to aid in the}} management of the company, which Berlin did, personally investing $480,000 in the company and persuading several others to invest an additional $300,000. At Berlin's request, Levinson entered into an employment agreement with MLAS in December 1980, under which Levinson agreed to work exclusively for MLAS as an advisor to management and as a developer of audio equipment for an annual salary of $15,000. He also agreed that, should he leave MLAS, he would not engage in the audio business [...] "anywhere in the world" [...] until December 31, 1988. Finally, the agreement stated that if Levinson [...] "ceased to be employed by MLAS" [...] he would [...] "not thereafter use or permit the use of the name 'Mark Levinson,' 'Mark Levinson Audio,' or any other name including 'Mark Levinson' in the name or trademark of any corporation" [...] engaged in a business similar to that of MLAS. Less than two years later, in March 1982, Levinson entered into a second agreement with MLAS. In it MLAS agreed to increase his salary to $25,600 per year [...] "effective as of July 1, 1982" [...] and $38,600 per year [...] "effective as of January 1, 1984." [...] In return, Levinson agreed to continue to work exclusively for MLAS, to convey [...] "to MLAS the permanent and exclusive right, title and interest to the trade name 'Mark Levinson', and all variations thereof, in connection with the sale and distribution" [...] of audio equipment and not to use or permit the use of the Levinson trade name, other than by MLAS, in connection with the audio business. The parties defined use of the Levinson trade name as [...] "use of such trade name, or variation thereof, (a) as part of the name of a corporation, partnership, <b>joint</b> venture, <b>proprietorship,</b> firm or business or (b) as the name, symbol or identification of any product." [...] Under Berlin's management, MLAS produced a series of audio products under the [...] "Mark Levinson" [...] label. Despite the 1982 agreement, Levinson's relationship with MLAS' new management deteriorated. In early 1983 Berlin placed Levinson's salary in escrow. In the summer of 1984 Levinson left MLAS and founded another company to produce audio equipment, Cello Ltd. Levinson became president and one of the three directors of Cello.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} development of a creative entrepreneurship program for three youth, ages 14 - 24, residents of Camden New Jersey's disinvested neighborhoods. This program is designed to curve recidivism among youth in the city of Camden as part of a three-pronged approach: (1) training and motivation, (2) entrepreneurial opportunity and incentive, and (3) career job placement. Youth went through training at the Genesis Youth Employment Training and Entrepreneurship Program and the ED-Tech Program to gain entrepreneurial skills, business skills, and technical knowledge. Upon completion, Project TRUTH will help participants in the implementation of new entrepreneur ventures, <b>joint</b> ventures, sole <b>proprietorships,</b> marketing, advertisement, sales, operations, strategy, and financing. The proposed initial project launch will be the Camden County Cleaning Service, a for-profit, C- Corporation. Working with a business in the community, the project will engage the youth in all aspects of developing the business [...] from creating a business plan, incorporation, marketing, purchasing, packaging and distribution. They will be taught basic principles of generating more income than expenses to create a profit, and the importance of reinvesting monies back into the business and community for sustainability. Additional funding will be sought for the Cleaning Company start-up capital and 3 -months salaries for those participants who complete the program. This business venture will be flagship project which will launch other future entrepreneurial ventures. (Author abstract) Garnett, C. (2006). T. R. U. T.
