The initial results from a sampling of known clean and dirty steel billets show that the amplitude distribution function for the ultrasonic indications from clean material is nearly a normal distribution while the same distribution function for material with high nonmetallic <b>inclusion</b> <b>content</b> is highly skewed.

In addition, IF proteins were processed by the secreted chlamydial protease CPAF to form filamentous structures at the inclusion surface with altered structural properties.

40|$|The {{competitive}} {{aspect of}} surface and subsurface fatigue cracks propagation in hardened components subjected to rolling contact fatigue is highlighted, the former being greatly {{affected by the}} working conditions (in particular the presence of tangential stresses and lubricant), the latter depending mainly on the <b>inclusions</b> <b>content</b> and on the hardness profile. In order to determine which one {{of these kinds of}} damage is favoured, initial data consisting in contact load, rolling and sliding speed, rheological properties of the lubricant, material hardness and <b>inclusions</b> <b>content</b> are necessary. The concurrent role of asperities and Hertzian stress field in determining surface crack propagation is explained with the approach of the “quiescent zone”, calculating the stress intensity factors range in a contact cycle and considering the pumping effect of the fluid possibly present on the contact surface. Inherent defects (especially oxides) are thought to be responsible for subsurface cracks origin and the Murakami formula for short cracks is extrapolated to describe their growth threshold, which also depends on the hardness and therefore on the depth in surface hardened components. A crack propagation index is then defined as a ratio of applied to threshold stress intensity factor, both for surface and subsurface cracks. Evaluating this index for a general operating condition, it is possible to determine which damage mechanism is favoured, taking into account the decisive effect of the hardness profile...|$|R

Rolling contact fatigue limitation is treated in terms of non-propagation condition of inherent defects, following the El-Haddad model for the short-cracks growth threshold.

In this way, the approach gives an overview of the possible damage mechanisms, automatically indicating which is expected for a specific case.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for removal of {{impurities}} in pure molten aluminum {{has been presented}} in this paper. The basic principle of this method is that the molten fluxes are forced to inject into the molten aluminum under counter-gravity, creating strong vortex to mix fully with the molten aluminum. In this way, the impurities in the aluminum will transfer into the flux because of the absorption of the flux to the inclusions. As the result, the molten aluminum is purified. The experiments were carried out for pure aluminum combined with the flux (40 wt. % NaCl， 30 wt. % KCl， 10 wt. % NaF and 20 wt. %Na 3 AlF 6).
