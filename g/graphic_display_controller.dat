50|$|The High-Performance <b>Graphics</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Controller</b> 7220 (commonly µPD7220 or NEC 7220) is a video {{interface}} controller {{capable of}} drawing lines, circles, arcs, and character graphics to a bit-mapped display.

50|$|VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) {{integrated}} circuits finally {{allowed for a}} high level of hardware functionality to be included in a single chip. The <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> <b>controller</b> was the first board designed, published in 1980. A Motorola 68000 CPU, along with memory, a parallel port controller and a serial port controller, were included on the main CPU board designed by Bechtolsheim. The third board was an interface to the 2.93 Mbits/second experimental Ethernet (before the speed was standardized at 10 Mbits/second).|$|R

5000|$|Originally, {{it was an}} {{extension}} to the VGA standard first released by IBM in 1987. Unlike VGA—a purely IBM-defined standard—Super VGA was never formally defined. The closest to an [...] "official" [...] definition was in the VBE extensions defined by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA), an open consortium set up to promote interoperability and define standards. In this document, there was simply a footnote stating that [...] "The term 'Super VGA' is used in this document for a <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> <b>controller</b> implementing any superset of the standard IBM VGA display adapter." [...] When used as a resolution specification, in contrast to VGA or XGA for example, the term SVGA normally refers to a resolution of 800x600 pixels.|$|R
50|$|A random-access memory digital-to-analog {{converter}} (RAMDAC) {{is a combination}} of three fast {{digital-to-analog converter}}s (DACs) with a small static random-access memory (SRAM) used in computer <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> <b>controllers</b> to store the color palette and to generate the analog signals (usually a voltage amplitude) to drive a color monitor. The logical color number from the display memory is fed into the address inputs of the SRAM to select a palette entry to appear on the data output of the SRAM. This entry is composed of three separate values corresponding to the three components (red, green, and blue) of the desired physical color. Each component value is fed to a separate DAC, whose analog output goes to the monitor, and ultimately to one of its three electron guns (or equivalent in non-CRT displays).|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} aim {{of virtual}} reality is to present the user with an illusion of reality within a virtual environment. Visual artefacts that appear in a virtual reality system’s computer generated graphics can easily destroy this artificial sense of reality. Therefore {{in order to maintain}} an illusion of reality, it is essential to eliminate or hide such visual artefacts from the user. This paper investigates the implementation of region warping, a methodology devised for the purpose of masking scene tearing artefacts. These scene tearing artefacts are a side effect from implementing large object segmentation together with a prioritized rendering technique, which was developed for use in conjunction with a specialized virtual reality <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> <b>controller,</b> known as the Address Recalculation Pipeline. Region warping introduces slight distortions in a scene as a result of compensating for such tearing artefacts. This paper describes the basis for region warping and discusses the results of experiments that were conducted using this warping technique...|$|R
40|$|The NEC 7220 / GDC {{is a high}} {{resolution}} colour <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> <b>controller.</b> It is programmable, and can generate lines, arcs and rectangles at high speeds with little intervention from the host computer. The GDC has interesting capabilities such as scrolling, DMA transfers and read and write of its display memory through the FIFO buffer. This thesis describes the GDC {{and its relation to}} the other components of a graphics terminal. Software programs are developed and implemented to show how the GDC's capabilities can be used to generate a dynamic graphics picture on the CRT screen. The programs are written in both Pascal and 8086 assembler. Two methods are presented for the transfer of a graphical display from one NEC/APC to another one. The first technique sends the display memory's pixels and the second one transfers the picture codes for the reconstruction of the image. For each of them software programs are developed and tested thoroughly and found to perform as stipulated...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{is available to}} the public through the National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161 This {{document is}} disseminated under the sponsorship of the Department of Transportation in the interest of information exchange. The United The Weather Systems Processor (WSP) modification to existing Airport Surveillance Radars (ASR- 9) significantly enhances the functionality of the radar with respect to hazardous weather detection and tracking. Dedicated alphanumeric and color <b>graphic</b> <b>displays</b> alert <b>controllers</b> to hazardous wind shear conditions on the runways or final approach/initial departure flight corridors, show current location and anticipated movement of thunderstorm cells, and provide short-term forecasts of operationally significant wind shifts. Operational tests of a prototype WSP and related terminal area hazardous weather detection systems (the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) and the Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS » have shown that, in addition to reducing the risk of aircraft accidents associated with wind shear encounters on landing or takeoff, the information provided by these systems is a significant aid in terminal air traffic management during adverse weather. The resulting efficiency enhancements reduce delay and associated costs. This report assesses the magnitude of the delay aversion benefits that will be realized through national deployment of the WSP. These are quantified both in terms of aircraft delay-hour reductions and corresponding dollar benefits. The analysis indicates that these benefits will total approximately $ 18 M per year given year 2000 expected traffic counts at the 34 planned WSP airports. This exceeds, in equivalent dollar value, the safety benefits realized through WSP deployment by a factor of approximately five. iii TABLE OF CONTENTS Section ~ Abstract 11...|$|R
