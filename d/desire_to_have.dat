5|$|The {{legend of}} the union of Mohini-Vishnu and Shiva may also be written {{as part of the}} <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a common child of the two cosmic patriarchs of Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|Artists who possessed strong {{showmanship}} {{skills have}} largely influenced Scogin; {{some of these}} artists include James Brown, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley. He is also fond of Arcade Fire, The Beatles, Björk, Interpol, and The Killers. In an interview, Scogin expressed a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen At The Drive-In and Nirvana before they disbanded.|$|E
5|$|ISC and NASCAR {{have both}} made public their <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{presence}} in areas it sees as having the potential for growth, most notably the Pacific Northwest and New York City. ISC {{has said that the}} earliest either of these tracks would be operating is 2011.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Micawber coughed, {{and drank}} his punch {{with an air}} of {{exceeding}} satisfaction--still glancing at Traddles, as if he <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his opinion.|$|R
5|$|In Reformed churches, only believing Christians are {{expected}} to partake of the Lord's Supper. Further, partakers {{are expected}} to examine and prepare themselves for the sacrament. This involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in Christ to forgive them. Christians may have some degree of doubt regarding their salvation, but they are at least {{to be aware of}} their sin and have a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> faith.|$|E
5|$|Jackson, {{leading the}} new Democratic Party, won the 1828 presidential election, and in March 1829 Eaton {{resigned}} his Senate seat to accept appointment as Jackson's Secretary of War. The appointment was seemingly made because of Jackson's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a personal friend}} in the Cabinet in whom he could confide.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} fitting out, the ship's {{flagship}} facilities, {{including those}} on the bridge and in the admiral's cabins, were modified to satisfy Combined Fleet's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the ship equipped as the primary flagship of the commander-in-chief, as her sister Yamato was too far along for such changes. These alterations, along with improvements in the secondary battery armour, pushed back completion and pre-handover testing of Musashi by two months, to August 1942.|$|E
5000|$|After the 1848 Revolution, many Germans <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a united}} {{national}} state. An attempt {{in this direction}} was the failed Erfurt Union of German states in 1850.|$|R

5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools {{is a game}} engine {{created and}} used {{internally}} by the Japanese company Square Enix. It combines standard libraries for elements such as graphics, sound and artificial intelligence while providing game developers with various authoring tools. The target systems of Crystal Tools are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. This was decided {{with the intention of}} making cross-platform production more feasible. The idea for the engine sprang from Square Enix's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a unified game development environment in order to effectively share the technology and know-how of the company's individual teams.|$|E
5|$|Garga Samhita (a work on {{the life}} of Krishna) and Brahma Vaivarta Purana further tell of the {{previous}} birth of Putana as Ratnamala, the daughter of demon king Bali. When she saw Vamana, the previous incarnation of Krishna as a dwarf, she felt a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him as her son and suckle him. She soon changed her mind and decided to kill Vamana, after he acquired all possessions of Bali. Krishna knew her desires and allowed her to fulfil both of them - to suckle him and to attempt to take his life.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{had spoken}} out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When {{it reached the}} Senate floor in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E
5|$|In 1784, {{he founded}} the Bank of New York which {{became one of the}} longest {{operating}} banks in American history, it stayed in business for over 220 years before it merged with another bank in 2007. Hamilton was {{one of the men who}} restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality.|$|E
5|$|Offa was a Christian {{king who}} came into {{conflict}} with the Church, particularly with Jaenberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Offa persuaded Pope Adrian I to divide the archdiocese of Canterbury in two, creating a new archdiocese of Lichfield. This reduction {{in the power of}} Canterbury may have been motivated by Offa's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an archbishop consecrate his son Ecgfrith as king, since it is possible Jaenberht refused to perform the ceremony, which took place in 787. Offa had a dispute with the Bishop of Worcester, which was settled at the Council of Brentford in 781.|$|E

50|$|Court of law or equity that <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any {{question}} of fact decided by a jury had it presented {{in the form of}} feigned issues, by stating that a wager was laid between two parties interested in respectively maintaining the affirmative and the negative of certain propositions. It was enacted that in every case where any court of law or equity <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{any question}} of fact decided by a jury it should the directly state the {{question of fact}} in dispute, with such persons being plaintiffs and defendants as the court may direct, rather than as a feigned issue of a wager.|$|R

5|$|Ophelia {{has also}} been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Hamlet kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not sure {{she would be able to}} effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E
5|$|The Rockers redebuted at a WWF live {{event on}} July 7, 1988. Due to WWF {{chairman}} Vince McMahon's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his performers carry WWF-exclusive ring names, Michaels and Jannetty were renamed, as simply The Rockers. The team proved popular with {{both children and}} women and was a mid-card stalwart of television and pay-per-view shows {{for the next two}} years. During this time, Michaels headlined his first pay-per-view for the WWF when The Rockers were involved in the 4-on-4 Survivor Series match main event of the 1989 Survivor Series.|$|E
60|$|At Inverkeithing {{the storm}} became more violent, {{and again the}} royal {{followers}} remonstrated; but the King laughed at them, and only <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two runners <b>to</b> show him the way, when they might all remain in shelter.|$|R

5|$|While Miller was a {{reluctant}} bowler, Bradman used him heavily {{because of his}} <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> every possible spin option. Miller thus played as a middle-order batsman batting at No. 5 ahead of the wicket-keeper and the other bowlers, and an opening fast bowler, partnering Lindwall. For Victoria, Miller often batted higher at No. 3 or No. 4 and bowled less. For his state, Miller averaged more with the bat, which he felt {{was because he was}} able to concentrate more on his batting, as Hassett gave him a smaller workload with the ball.|$|E
5|$|White {{missed the}} opening of NBA camp on Monday October 1, due to a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{contractual}} plan put in place with the Rockets and the NBA that addressed the league wide mental health policy or lack thereof. After sessions with his own long-time doctor, White requested permission to travel by bus when {{necessary in order to}} limit his flight schedule. The Rockets and White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White travel by personal bus rather than flying (which has been an anxiety trigger in the past for white). White missed the first week of training camp before this agreement was put in place.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 {{the team}} regressed further, losing even more players to free agency and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 5–11 record, their worst since Bill Parcells' first season in 1983. Quarterback Dave Brown was particularly disappointing, as he finished with just 2,814yards and 11 touchdowns on the season. Reeves went public with his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more of a say in personnel matters. He controlled the team's free agency decisions, but feuded with General manager (GM) George Young who chose the team's draft picks.* Pervin. pg. 124 Lowlights were a 35–0 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in the Monday Night season opener, and the fans pelting the Charger sideline with snowballs in the season's final game. Though the defense still played well at times, the Giants sent no players to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year.|$|E
6000|$|I {{answered}} with warmth, [...] "That I had no prudential measures <b>to</b> observe, and <b>desired</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> nothing smoothed over;--on the contrary, I was come to inquire into a rascally calumny, which I {{was determined to}} probe to the bottom." ...|$|R
