25|$|Jove was the {{original}} namesake of Latin forms of the weekday now known in English as Thursday (originally called Iovis Dies in Latin). These became <b>jeudi</b> in French, jueves in Spanish, joi in Romanian, giovedì in Italian, dijous in Catalan, Xoves in Galician, Joibe in Friulian, Dijóu in Provençal.|$|E
2500|$|Jupiter is {{associated}} with Thursday, and in Romance languages, the name for Thursday often comes from Jupiter (e.g., joi in Romanian, <b>jeudi</b> in French, jueves in Spanish, and giovedì in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Jupiter with the liberal art of geometry. In Chinese astrology, Jupiter is ruled by the element wood, which is patient, hard-working, and reliable. In Indian astrology, Jupiter is known as Guru or Brihaspati and {{is known as the}} 'great teacher'.|$|E

Exceptions of remaining genitive forms are some pronouns, many fossilized combinations like sayings, some proper names, and certain terms related to the church.

2500|$|Prior to its {{colonization}} by Europeans, Ivory Coast {{was home}} to several states, including Gyaaman, the Kong Empire, and Baoulé. Two Anyi kingdoms, Indénié and Sanwi, attempted to retain their separate identity through the French colonial period and after independence. Ivory Coast became a protectorate of France in 1843–1844 and was later formed into a French colony in 1893 amid the European scramble for Africa. Ivory Coast achieved independence in 1960, led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who ruled the country until 1993. The country maintained close {{political and economic association}} with its West African neighbors {{while at the same time}} maintaining close ties to the West, especially France. Since the end of Houphouët-Boigny's rule in 1993, Ivory Coast has experienced one coup d'état, in 1999, and two religion-grounded civil wars. [...] The first took place between 2002 and 2007 and the second during 2010–2011. In 2000, the country adopted a new Constitution. 2000-513 du 1er août 2000 portant constitution de la République de Côte d’Ivoire, Journal officiel de la République de Côte d’Ivoire, no 30, Abidjan, <b>jeudi</b> 3 août 2000, p. 529–538 ...|$|E

6000|$|When Sir Walter left us, it {{was settled}} that I was to breakfast {{with him the}} {{following}} day but one. I was punctual, of course, and found him in a new silk douillette {{that he had just}} purchased, trying [...] "as hard as he could," [...] as he pleasantly observed, to make a Frenchman of himself--an undertaking as little likely to be successful, I should think, in the case of his Scottish exterior, and Scottish interior too, as any experiment well could be. There were two or three visitors, besides Miss Ann Scott, his daughter, who was his companion in the journey. He was just answering an invitation from the Princesse ----, to an evening party, as I entered. [...] "Here," [...] said he, [...] "you are a friend of the lady, and parlez-vous so much better than I; can you tell me whether this is for <b>Jeudi,</b> or Lundi, or Mardi, or whether it means no day at all?" [...] I told him the day of the week intended. [...] "You get notes occasionally from the lady, or you could not read her scrawl so readily?" [...] "She is very kind to us, and we often have occasion to read her writing." [...] "Well, it is worth a very good dinner to get through a page of it." [...] "I take my revenge in kind, and I fancy she has the worst of it." [...] "I don't know, after all that she will get much the better of me with this plume d'auberge." [...] He was quite right, for, although Sir Walter writes a smooth even hand, and one that appears rather well than otherwise on a page, {{it is one of the}} most difficult to decipher I have ever met with; the i's, u's, m's, n's, a's, e's, t's, etc., etc., for want of dots, crossings, and being fully rounded, looking all alike, and rendering the reading slow and difficult, without great familiarity with his mode of handling the pen: at least, I have found it so.|$|E
