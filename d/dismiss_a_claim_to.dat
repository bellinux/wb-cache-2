40|$|Provisions of our Civil Procedure Code (CPC) {{relating}} to facts being {{subject matter of}} declaratory action deviate from comparative law. The model is unique. It deviates not only from solutions adopted in comparative law but also from traditional provisions of our previous civil procedure codes. Truth be told, the new CPC speaks of a possibility to determine facts by declaratory action when it is so provided for by the CPC itself of other regulations. The possibility to request the court to determine the authenticity of a certain document is present in all the legislation analyzed in this paper. By filing an action with such subject matter, the plaintiff, in essence, seeks final and binding assurance of the probative power of documentary evidence. A real life significance of this exception is minimal, since the court must take a position regarding {{the authenticity of the}} document if the opposing party questions it. The paper tries to identify substantive and procedural rules of law that provide for facts to be subject matter of declaratory actions. Case law analyzed in this paper does not indicate the courts being to favorable in determining facts based on a declaratory action. In fact, there have been cases, after the new CPC came into force, where the Supreme Court of Cassation <b>dismissed</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> determine the existence of certain facts by stating that in the case at hand the <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> determine the facts goes beyond legally permissible instances when facts may be determined by a declaratory action. We also dealt with an issue of determining the facts presented in the declaratory action. The facts are the basis for the declaratory action. Determining the facts without relying on any legal issue based on which the determination of facts is sought {{does not seem to be}} an acceptable solution...|$|R

40|$|Both {{state and}} federal courts have {{procedural}} rules that allow a plaintiff <b>to</b> voluntarily <b>dismiss</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> without prejudice and then to refile it within the applicable statute-of-limitations period. However, a plaintiff’ s right to this procedural avenue is not absolute, and courts maintain broad discretion in deciding whether <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> with or without prejudice. If a court allows a plaintiff <b>to</b> voluntarily <b>dismiss</b> <b>a</b> time-barred <b>claim</b> without prejudice, the plaintiff may be able <b>to</b> refile the <b>claim</b> in <b>a</b> jurisdiction with a longer statute of limitations. As a result, the defendant loses the ability to assert a statute-of-limitations defense in subsequent litigation. Courts disagree about whether the defendant’s loss of a statute- of-limitations defense constitutes “clear legal prejudice” sufficient to bar voluntary dismissal without prejudice. This Note explores this disagreement. First, it examines the two ways courts currently decide motions for voluntary dismissal of time-barred claims. Next, it argues that both approaches overlook a fundamental factor: res judicata (claim preclusion). Specifically, courts do not consider that statute-of-limitations dismissals are not claim preclusive in every jurisdiction. To account for the differences in preclusion law, this Note proposes that, as a threshold inquiry, courts should determine what the claim-preclusive effect of a statute-of-limitations dismissal would be. Based on this determination, a court can decide whether {{the loss of a}} statute-of-limitations defense results in “clear legal prejudice” to the defendant and whether a dismissal without prejudice is warranted...|$|R
