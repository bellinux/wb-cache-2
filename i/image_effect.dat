5000|$|The OFX Programming Guide for <b>Image</b> <b>Effects</b> by Bruno Nicoletti.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we exploit {{the power of}} contractive {{mappings}} to create special <b>image</b> <b>effects.</b> Under this framework, images are represented as the attractor of an Iterated Function System (IFS) and can be reconstructed using Fractal Interpolation. By controlling parameters of the process, we obtain {{a wide range of}} <b>image</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In graphics, {{superimposition}} is {{the placement}} of an image or video {{on top of an}} already-existing image or video, usually to add to the overall <b>image</b> <b>effect,</b> but also sometimes to conceal something (such as when a different face is superimposed over the original face in a photograph).|$|E
50|$|OpenFX (OFX), a.k.a. The OFX <b>Image</b> <b>Effect</b> Plug-in API, {{is an open}} {{standard}} for 2D visual effects or compositing plug-ins. It allows plug-ins written to the standard to work on any application that supports the standard. The OpenFX standard is owned by The Open Effects Association, and it is released under a 'BSD' open source license. OpenFX was originally designed by Bruno Nicoletti at The Foundry Visionmongers.|$|E
50|$|The OpenFX host exposes sets {{of entry}} {{points to the}} plugin, called suites. The Property Suite is used to manage attribute-value pairs {{attached}} to objects defined by all other suites of the API, the <b>Image</b> <b>Effect</b> Suite is used to fetch film frames from the inputs or {{the output of the}} effect, and there are other suites to display informative messages or ask questions to the user, handle multithreading, use OpenGL for processing, etc.|$|E
50|$|There {{are more}} than fifty Text Effects and around 25 <b>Image</b> <b>Effects</b> available.|$|R
30|$|Realistic and {{real-time}} simulation of physically based fluid {{is a hot}} research topic in virtual reality. Fluid simulation is used in many areas such as art visualization, video game, <b>image</b> <b>effects,</b> industry simulation, and entertainment media. Physically based method has been applied in fluid simulation for achieving vivid and high-quality visual image. In interactive fluid simulation, as one common physical simulation method, the particle-based method, such as Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), has been extensively used for creating realistic <b>image</b> <b>effects</b> of fluids in image and video game due to superiority of Lagrangian representations [1, 2].|$|R
50|$|One of {{the criticisms}} for this method is that it suffers from twin images. D. Gabor. Barton {{proposed}} that reconstructed phased images of holograms will suppress twin <b>images</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was released {{at the same}} time as the single, and was co-directed by OK Go and Tim Nackashi. The entire video was made using a delayed <b>image</b> <b>effect,</b> and contains many psychedelic themes. All of the props in the video, such as Wiffle ball bats, gaffer tape, and beach balls, were bought from a 99 cent store. As is typical for OK Go videos, it was shot in one continuous take.|$|E
5000|$|It {{remains unclear}} what Childe himself invented, and when, but {{according}} to some sources his technique became established in British theatres in the 1820s and 1830s: the lantern {{was used as a}} heightened dramatic effect and supported [...] "transformation scenes". In 1827, a production of The Flying Dutchman opera by Edward Fitzball projected an image of the ship from backstage onto gauze. Childe has been credited with this moving <b>image</b> <b>effect.</b> Fitzball himself, however, took the credit at the time, for the use of a lantern on a track.|$|E
50|$|The {{release of}} Windows 10 brought {{important}} updates and new features to Direct2D {{such as the}} performance improvement of rendering scalable text without font rasterization, the ability to download the needed font from the cloud on demand without requiring the font installation step, an optimization for faster image loading and <b>image</b> <b>effect</b> rendering, and a more sophisticated way to apply gradient brush {{through the use of}} 2D mesh made of gradient patches. This release also introduced a brand-new API extension to support digital ink, which is highly leveraged by the brand-new Microsoft Edge browser as well as the new ink canvas XAML control.|$|E
50|$|Contrast masking can be {{considered}} to be the opposite of gamma correction, which adjusts the midtones of an <b>image.</b> <b>Effects</b> similar to contrast masking can be achieved by adjusting the response curves of an image.|$|R

After a tachyon has passed nearby, {{we would be able to}} see two images of it, appearing and departing in opposite directions. The black line is the shock wave of Cherenkov radiation, shown only in one moment of time. This double <b>image</b> <b>effect</b> is most prominent for an observer located directly in the path of a superluminal object (in this example a sphere, shown in grey). The right hand bluish shape is the image formed by the blue-doppler shifted light arriving at the observer—who is located at the apex of the black Cherenkov lines—from the sphere as it approaches. The left-hand reddish image is formed from red-shifted light that leaves the sphere after it passes the observer. Because the object arrives before the light, the observer sees nothing until the sphere starts to pass the observer, after which the image-as-seen-by-the-observer splits into two—one of the arriving sphere (to the right) and one of the departing sphere (to the left).|$|E

It was also the camera of choice at Limehouse Television. As well as ITV company Television South (TVS) used the model in its Maidstone studios, which were still in use by those studios when they were sold off as an independent studio facility following the loss of TVS's franchise at the end of 1992.The 125 was a well thought out and well-built studio and OB camera developed from the Link 120 portable camera system. It also contained a comprehensive communications system and used a camera control unit (CCU) based around the 110's but updated with auto black, white, iris and centering functions.The BBC preferred to use a mid range Schneider-Kreuznach lens as it gave good zoom angles. Some believed it produced one of the best images for a pickup tube camera, others believed it could never match the quality of the EMI 2001. Many BBC users felt that the image was soft and not easy to focus, it also produced an unusual <b>image</b> <b>effect</b> that formed the shape of a 'teardrop'The Link 125 was the most successful of all of Links cameras and the last studio to use them was BBC Pebble Mill which decommissioned the last four in 1994 from the news studio having upgraded to Sony BVP-375's and Ikegami HL-55's a few years before. These cameras have become collectable vintage items.|$|E
