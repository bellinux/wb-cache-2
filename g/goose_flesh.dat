60|$|Seating herself {{where she}} could lean against the saddle she {{prepared}} to maintain a sleepless vigil throughout the night. For an hour the silence was {{broken only by the}} distant booming of the guns and the low noises of the feeding horse and then, from possibly a mile away, came the rumbling thunder of a lion's roar. The girl started and laid her hand upon the rifle at her side. A little shudder ran through her slight frame and she could feel the <b>goose</b> <b>flesh</b> rise upon her body.|$|E

Cry until you are hoarse; {{no one in this}} {{neighborhood}} will stop to ask what is the matter with you. I tell you I am determined to possess myself of that ivory ball, and have it I shall, even though I am obliged to cut out your heart to get it!" [...] As he spoke he grinned with so extraordinary and devilish a distortion of his countenance, and with such an appearance of every intention of carrying out his threat as to send the <b>goose</b> <b>flesh</b> creeping like icy fingers up and down our hero's spine with the most incredible rapidity and acuteness.|$|E
50|$|After {{making the}} movie, Maurice Murphy and Brian Rosen {{decided to make}} a follow up project, {{shooting}} two films back to back, Horror Movie and <b>Goose</b> <b>Flesh,</b> budgeted at $500,000 each.

5000|$|Based {{on these}} legends—indeed, the legends {{may have been}} invented for this purpose—some Irish clerics {{considered}} barnacle <b>goose</b> <b>flesh</b> to be acceptable fast day food, a practice that was criticized by Giraldus Cambrensis, a Welsh author: ...|$|E
50|$|Goose bumps, goose pimples or <b>goose</b> <b>flesh</b> are {{the bumps}} on a persons skin {{at the base}} of body hairs which may involuntarily develop when a person is cold or {{experiences}} strong emotions such as fear, euphoria or sexual arousal.

This muscle is responsible for causing the follicle lissis to become more perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the skin, and causing the follicle to protrude slightly above the surrounding skin (piloerection) and a pore encased with skin oil. This process results in goose bumps (or <b>goose</b> <b>flesh).</b>|$|E

In response to Souvenir D’un Lieu Cher, Robert Maxham from [...] "Fanfare Magazine" [...] wrote that [...] "This is superb recital, guaranteed to raise <b>goose</b> <b>flesh</b> on {{anything but a}} corpse - and I am {{not so sure about}} the corpse.

5000|$|Averill {{notes the}} hints of rapture, [...] "quasi-religion" [...] and erotic passion in the {{language}} used by barbershoppers to describe the emotional effect. He quotes Jim Ewin as reporting [...] "a tingling of the spine, the raising of the hairs {{on the back of}} the neck, the spontaneous arrival of <b>goose</b> <b>flesh</b> on the forearm ... the fifth note has almost mysterious propensities. It's the consummation devoutly wished by those of us who love Barbershop harmony. If you ask us to explain why we love it so, we are hard put to answer; that's where our faith takes over." [...] Averill notes too the use of the language of addiction, [...] "there's this great big chord that gets people hooked." [...] An early manual was entitled [...] "A Handbook for Adeline Addicts".|$|E
5000|$|The film {{garnered}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. National Award winning crtic Baradwaj Rangan summarised {{it in his}} review: [...] "The story of a police investigation is detailed in a smart, grown-up movie that gets most things right." [...] He praised the film for [...] "giving {{us a sense of}} {{a day in the life}} of a cop, as if an invisible crew followed him around as he went about his job." [...] He lavished heavy praise on Gautham Menon for mature handling of the relationship between the lead pair, saying, [...] "Gautham continues to dream up for Jyotika parts that no one's imagined her in before, and she contributes to the kind of mature romantic angle we’ve rarely seen before. It’s not just about boy meeting girl and falling in love; it's about boy with baggage meeting girl with bigger baggage and tentatively exploring the practicality of a new relationship after their respective old ones have faded away." [...] Behindwoods said, [...] "It is definitely a triumph of sorts for Gautham and Manickam Narayanan, who have gone through innumerable hitches in getting the movie released. Enjoy!!" [...] Rediff gave it 3.5/5, saying [...] "In his best performance in recent times, Kamal portrays the character with believable honesty and charm." [...] Sify stated that [...] "what gives you <b>goose</b> <b>flesh</b> is the finely calibrated performance of Kamal as DCP Raghavan. You just can’t take your eyes off him as he laces his portrayal with dignity, grace and dry wit." ...|$|E
