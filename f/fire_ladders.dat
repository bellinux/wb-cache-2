This latter trait creates a <b>fire</b> <b>ladder</b> that allows flames to reach up to the canopy, thinning out giant sequoia stands that would escape smaller forest fires with minimal damage.|$|R

5000|$|The first Zeppelin to be {{constructed}} {{for the company}} was LZ 7, which was named Deutschland. First flown on 19 June 1910, it had a useful lift of 11000 lbs kg and had accommodation for 24 passengers. Cruising speed was 32 mph. Given this performance it was realised that scheduled inter-city services would not be feasible, and that the company {{would be limited to}} offering pleasure cruises in the vicinity of their bases. [...] However, the Deutschland was destroyed on 28 June 1910 while taking a consignment of journalists on a trip intended to generate publicity. The airship was first prevented from returning to its base in Düsseldorf and then, caught by a thunderstorm, was first carried up to a height of 3500 ft and then, heavy from loss of hydrogen caused by the rapid ascent and from rainwater on the envelope, forced down into the Teutoburger forest. Fortunately there was only one injury. [...] This left DELAG with only a single airship, LZ 6, which had been built the previous year with the hope of its being bought by the army and subsequently enlarged and modified for passenger-carrying purpose. Operating from Baden-Baden, successful flights were made almost daily between late August and mid-September, but on 14 September it was destroyed in a fire while in its hangar. Fortunately it was insured, and DELAG could complete its next ship, LZ 8 Deutschland II.For the new season flights lasting between 90 minutes and two hours were offered for a price of 200 Dm. Deutschland II was completed on 30 March 1910, and arrived at Düsseldorf on 11 April, but after little more than a month of service was caught by a gust while being walked out of its hangar on 16 May: it was driven onto a 15 m (50 ft) high windbreak and broke its back. The passengers had to be rescued using <b>fire</b> <b>ladders.</b> Hugo Eckener, the captain, blamed the accident on his [...] "weak-kneed" [...] decision to let the eagerness of the passengers to fly overcome his reluctance to take the ship out in the existing conditions. [...] The company's luck changed with the next ship, the LZ 10 Schwaben. Completed on 26 June and delivered to DELAG on 15 July, it carried 1553 paying passengers during its career. Initially based at Baden Baden, in addition to the pleasure cruises a number of long-distance flights were made, carrying passengers to Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and eventually to Berlin. [...] LZ 11 Viktora Luise, named after the Kaiser's daughter, entered service on 4 March 1912. On 28 June 1912 Schwaben was destroyed in a hangar fire attributed to static electricity produced by its rubberised cotton gasbags, but was soon replaced by LZ 13 Hansa, which was completed on 30 July. These airships were also used by the Imperial German Navy for crew training, with the Navy crews operating passenger flights. [...] In 1913 LZ 17 Sachsen was added to the fleet.|$|E
