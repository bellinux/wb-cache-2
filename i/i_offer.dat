25|$|Systems of {{government}} are dynamic {{and they are}} bound to change {{in accordance with the}} wishes of and aspirations of the people...During my term of office, I selflessly dedicated myself to the good cause of Mother Malawi in the fight against Poverty, Ignorance and Disease among many other issues; but if within the process, those who worked in my government or through false pretence in my name or indeed unknowingly by me, pain and suffering was caused to anybody in this country in the name of nationhood, <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> my sincere apologies. I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa' and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for us to look at our past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile if we have to move forward at all.|$|E

500|$|Discussing May's {{sickness}} in {{the episode}} after being [...] "infected" [...] by the ghost Lucy {{in the season}} premiere, Wen explained that [...] "It starts to affect May’s perception of things. It’s almost like being on LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t {{want her to be}} paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her. I understand that she’s going in the same direction I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." ...|$|E
500|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} some people perform the Prajapati ritual when they renounce, but {{this should not be}} done. A person should instead make an {{offering}} to Agni (fire) that is one's own vital breath. He should make the [...] "three-element offering", namely, to [...] "Sattva , Rajas [...] and Tamas [...] " [...] within. He should revere Prana (internal life force) because it is the yoni (womb, birthplace) of all fires. If he cannot obtain this fire, he should offer the oblation [...] "Om! <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> to all godheads, svaha" [...] with water as he begins the renunciation stage of life. As he offers this oblation, he should learn that the liberating mantra of Om is the three Vedas and the Brahman to be revered.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 2 out of 4 stars, saying that [...] "After scrutinizing the film, <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> you my {{summary of the}} story: Guy dies, finds himself resurrected, meets others, fights. That lasts for almost two hours." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film isn't the same without Arnold Schwarzenegger and that it misses its {{dramatic}} element. Likewise, Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a 2/4 and called it [...] "predictable" [...] with the [...] "dramatic elements flat-lin". She considered Christian Bale's performance [...] "one-dimensional", but found his co-stars to [...] "come off better", saying Sam Worthington had [...] "a quiet intensity marred only by yelling [...] "Nooooo!" [...] three times in about 10 minutes" [...] and that Anton Yelchin had [...] "some of the best lines".|$|E

500|$|Actor Gabriel Luna {{said that}} Robbie Reyes chose {{to work with}} Daisy Johnson after the last episode because [...] "I respect her power and I respect her. I {{understand}} that she’s going {{in the same direction}} I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." [...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E
500|$|No. 71, Ulla! min Ulla! säj får jag dig bjuda (Ulla! My Ulla! Say, may <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> thee) {{is another}} of the best-loved {{pastoral}} Epistles, and the melody may well be by Bellman himself. It imagines how Fredman, sitting on horseback outside Ulla's window at Fiskartorpet on a summer's day, invites her to come and dine with him on [...] "reddest strawberries in milk and wine". The following Epistle, No. 72, Glimmande nymf (Gleaming nymph), is a night-piece, set to an Andante melody from a French opéra comique. It describes in erotic detail the [...] "nymph" [...] asleep in her bed. To create the desired mood of rising excitement, Bellman creates a rainbow — after sunset. Britten Austin comments that the audience [...] "does not even notice". Meanwhile, No. 80, Liksom en Herdinna, högtids klädd (Like a shepherdess in her best dress), is a pastorale, almost paraphrasing Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux's French guide {{to the construction of}} pastoral verse, starting with [...] "As a Shepherdess splendidly dressed / By the spring one day in June / gathers from the grass's rosy bed / adornments and accents for her dress". The effect is of an [...] "almost religious invocation".|$|E
500|$|The Florida recount {{was stopped}} {{a few weeks}} later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be {{completed}} by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but in his concession speech stated that, [...] "for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> my concession." ...|$|E

500|$|In Outlook issue dated 20 October 2008, Ganesan's line, [...] "Vari, vatti, kisthi...Yaarai ketkirai vari...Etharkku ketkirai vari. Vaanam polikirathu, bhumi vilaigirathu, unakken katta vendum vari....", (Roughly {{translated}} in English as [...] "Tributes, Tax, Loan, Interest. The rains pour {{from the}} sky, the land blossoms, why should <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> you money?") which {{he speaks in}} a scene with C. R. Parthiban, was ranked at number 8 in the magazine's list of the 13 Cheesiest, Chalkiest Lines in Indian Cinema. In April 2012, Rediff.com included the film in its list The A to Z of Tamil Cinema. In a January 2015 interview with The Times of India, playwright Y. G. Mahendra said, [...] "most character artists today lack variety [...] Show me one actor in India currently who can do a Kattabomman, a VOC, a Vietnam Veedu, a Galatta Kalyanam and a Thiruvilayadal." [...] Actor Rana Daggubati, {{in an interview with}} Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu, said that Ganesan's performances as Kattabomman and Karna (in the 1964 film Karnan) served as inspirations for his role in [...] (2015). The scene between Ganesan and Parthiban was later featured in the 2016 film Jackson Durai, which was titled after Parthiban's character. M. Sasikumar's Balle Vellaiyathevaa, released in the same year, was named after a dialogue uttered by Ganesan's character.|$|E
