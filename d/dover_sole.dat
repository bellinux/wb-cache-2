40|$|We compare {{results of}} bottom trawl surveys off Washington, Oregon, and California in 1977, 1980, 1983, and 1986 to discern trends in {{population}} abundance, distribution, and biology. Catch {{per unit of}} effort, area-swept biomass estimates, and age and length compositions for 12 commercially important west coast groundfishes are presented to illustrate trends over the lO-year period. We discuss the precision, accuracy, and statistical significance of observed trends in abundance estimates. The influence of water temperature {{on the distribution of}} groundfishes is also briefly examined. Abundance estimates of canary rockfish, Sebastes pinniger, and yellowtail rockfish, S. Jlavidus, declined during the study period; greater declines were observed in Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus, lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus, and arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias. Biomass estimates of Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and English, rex, and <b>Dover</b> <b>soles</b> (Pleuronectes vetulus, Errex zachirus, and Microstomus pacificus) increased, while bocaccio, S. paucispinis, and chilipepper, S. goodei, were stable. Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, biomass estimates increased markedly from 1977 to 1980 and declined moderately thereafter. Precision was lowest for rockfishes, lingcod, and sablefish; it was highest for flatfishes because they were uniformly distributed. The accuracy of survey estimates could be gauged only for yellowtail and canary rockfish and sablefish. All fishery-based analyses produced much larger estimates of abundance than bottom trawl surveys-indicative of the true catchability of survey trawls. Population trends from all analyses compared well except in canary rockfish, the species that presents the greatest challenge to obtaining reasonable precision and one that casts doubts on the usefulness of bottom trawl surveys for estimating its abundance.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the best irrigation frequency and main cultivar {{associated with the}} production of strawberry according to the irrigation management used. The experiment was carried out at the FEMO, linked to the URENM of the EPAMIG. The experiment was installed in split plots, with cultivars Camarosa, Dover, Oso Grande and Tudla on subplot and frequencies FR 1, FR 2 and FR 3 in the plots in ran-domized block with four replications, totaling 48 experimental units. The fruits were harvested, quantified and classified as fruits commercial and non-commercial. Higher commercial fruit yield was observed in cultivar Oso Grande, mainly associated with characteristic fruit that fruit weight is equal or superior to 10 g. The culti-var <b>Dover</b> was <b>sole</b> with a higher yield of commercial fruit when subjected to FR 2. Regarding the number of commercial fruits, the cultivar Oso Grande showed yield higher than the 'Tudla'. The FR 2 showed a better per-formance for all variables compared to FR 3.

50|$|Sole is a fish {{belonging}} to several families. Generally speaking, they {{are members of}} the family Soleidae, but, outside Europe, the name sole is also applied to various other similar flatfish, especially other members of the sole suborder Soleoidei as well as members of the flounder family. In European cookery, there are several species which may be considered true soles, but the common or <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> Solea solea, often simply called the sole, is the most esteemed and most widely available.|$|E
5000|$|The common sole, <b>Dover</b> <b>sole,</b> {{or black}} sole (Solea solea) is {{a species of}} {{flatfish}} in the Soleidae family. It is a flatfish living on the sandy or muddy seabed of the northern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea where it often semi-immerses itself in the substrate. The upper side is greyish-brown while the underside is white. It grows to a maximum length of about 70 cm. This fish is used for human consumption and is prized as a food fish. It is caught mostly by trawling on the seabed.|$|E
50|$|For human consumption, {{the fish}} species caught are cod, plaice and herring and also {{species such as}} hake, <b>dover</b> <b>sole,</b> and turbot. In deep waters, fish species caught are Norway lobster, deep water prawn, and common mussels. In terms of {{financial}} value, the fish species of interest, {{in the order of}} precedence, are cod, sand eel, plaice, herring and Norway lobster. Stocks of eel has declined since 1970. Method of fishing in this type of fishing practice involves use of stationary or dredging gear, gillnets and pound nets, traps and hooks while for catching mussels special dredgers are adopted.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to present data upon which {{the management of the}} Oregon otter-trawl fishery can be based. In addition, a history of the Oregon trawl fishery is presented. A summary of gear development by many of the vessels in the Oregon fleet is presented in table form. The principal species studied are the English sole (Paraphrys vetulus), petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani), and <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus pacificus). For these three species the time of spawning, length at maturity, and relation of length to weight are determined. In addition, the number of eggs produced by English and <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> at various sizes is calculated. In 1948 and 1949 a total of 5, 643 bottom fish were tagged from otter trawlers operating from Astoria. Almost all of these fish were English, petrale, and <b>Dover</b> <b>sole,</b> and all but a few were released in the area between Willapa bay and 2 Tillamook Head. Returns from the tagging give no indication of significant migrations north and south along the coast, but a small amount of exploratory winter fishing resulted in recovery of tagged :Dover sole in waters deeper than 200 fathoms. These <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> had been tagged during the summer in much shallower water. The growth of sole of the three species studied is computed from the tag returns. General comparisons of rates of tag return are made with other tagging experiments of a similar nature along the Pacific Coast. Otoliths of English, petrale, and <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> are used to calculate growth rates and compute age-frequency curves. It is concluded that otoliths are not completely satisfactory for determining the age of these species. An analysis of the condition of the stocks of English sole, petrale sole, <b>Dover</b> <b>sole,</b> and rockfish is made using the landing records for the period 1942 - 47, inclusive. The English sole were not completely exploited in 1947. During this period, the petrale sole declined in abundance at least 50 per cent. The <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> declined some in abundance, and the condition of the rockfish stocks is obscured because of the several species that enter this category. English, petrale, and <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> were measured at the time commercial landings were made and these data are analyzed for the years 1948 - 51, inclusive. In 1950 the catches of Ore,:,on otter trawlers at sea were sampled to get a measure of the amount of discard of both scrap fish and undersized English, petrale, and <b>Dover</b> <b>sole.</b> Approximately 17 per cent of the <b>Dover</b> <b>sole,</b> 33 per cent of the petrale sole, and 27 per cent of the English sole were discarded at sea because they were too small. Approximately one-half of the total catch at sea by weight was discarded. An analysis is made of the relationship of the mink-raising industry to the otter-trawl fishery. The species composition of the milk food is determined from market samples. An estimate is made of the total amount of fish fed to mink in Oregon in 1949 based on information obtained from questionnaires. The effect of the fishery for mink food on the stocks of fish of the various species is discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea solea) {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} in quality restaurants {{and has a}} high market value, making it a very promising candidate for European aquaculture. Furthermore, due to the increasing importance of the aquaculture sector, diversification {{in the number of}} cultured species imposes itself and developing a reliable sole production would reduce fishing pressure on wild populations. However, as for many other fish species, <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> production is hampered by amongst others high susceptibility to diseases and larval mortality, justifying the need for more research in this area. Infectious diseases (e. g. vibriosis) are a major cause of larval mortality and various environmentally-friendly prophylactic treatments are currently being identified for marine larvae including pro- and prebiotics, with very limited data available for <b>Dover</b> <b>sole.</b> To remediate this and elucidate the interactions between bacterial pathogens and their host, the availability of experimental infection models is imperative. Nevertheless, only a handful of studies focused on the development of such models for fish larvae and for <b>Dover</b> <b>sole,</b> no such model is available. In this respect, in a first stage, an experimental housing system for <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> larvae was pinpointed by keeping the animals individually in 24 -well plates for 26 days with good survival rates and initiating metamorphosis. Housing the larvae individually has the advantage that the possible death of one larva has no effect on the other larvae, rendering these experiments more reproducible and ensuring a standardised and reliable experimental set-up. Secondly, the first standardised biotic challenge model for <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> was developed, using the bacterial pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. In addition, the protective potential of probiotic candidates (administrated via the water or Artemia nauplii) was evaluated in vitro and subsequently in vivo against V. anguillarum challenge by means of the pinpointed models. In conclusion, the models as described above are to be regarded as powerful tools for investigating the pathogenesis of V. anguillarum infections in <b>Dover</b> <b>sole</b> larvae and evaluating the protective characteristics of probiotics. In addition, the exploration of the impact of other components (e. g. prebiotics, microplastics, PCBs or algal toxins) on larval health is rendered possible...|$|E
