On the basis of these results, a generic system for corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> is laid down and discussed in the report.

In addition to this report, a guideline document for using corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> especially in SME's as well as a documentation about the standardisation activities in the field of <b>environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> have been developed within the project.

40|$|Abstract. This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the construction of <b>environmental</b> <b>indicators,</b> serving investors for the assessment of com-plex performance of companies in accordance with social and corporate governance indicators, the so-called ESG performance indicators. The research project “Construction of Methods for Multifactor Assessment of Company Complex Performance in Selected Sectors”, solved by the team of authors has been introduced. In recent years, investment managers have preferred the importance of ESG indicators showing long-term sustainable performance of those companies in which they have invested their financial resources. The objective of presented contribution is the proposal of <b>environmental</b> <b>indicators,</b> i. e. key ESG performance <b>indicators.</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> are used not only for decision-making, but also for determination of sustainable value. A number of successive steps have been taken to construct <b>environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> and a combination of various statistical methods has been employed.

In general these methods can be categorized as numerical aggregation (e.g. indices), short selections of indicators (e.g. core set or headline indicators), short visual assessments (e.g. arrows, traffic signals), and compelling presentations (e.g. maps or the dashboard of sustainability).

Edgewater Steel Company clean closed an EAF dust waste pile in 1991 and closed in place a construction/demolition waste landfill in 1995. The facility shut down operations in 2001.

5000|$|The Connley Caves are six wave-cut notches in the Connley Hills {{that have}} been {{intermittently}} occupied from at least 11,200 BP to 3,140 BP. Volcanic ash from the Mazama eruption created a notable layer dating to 6,850 BP that was found in all the caves. The pre-Mazama archaeological deposits were rich in the bones of marshland animals, including birds such as ducks, sage-grouse, and grebes, small mammals like rabbits, gophers, and ground squirrels, and large animals such as pronghorn antelope, elk, and bison. These animals provide evidence for the previous wetland environment at the Connley Caves.

40|$|Salt cedar (genus Tamarix, Family Tamaricaceae) is an exotic, {{invasive}} {{plant in}} southwestern North America; {{it has a}} poor reputation as a heavy-consumer of water and {{a threat to the}} landscape and ecology of the region. This study focuses upon salt-separation mechanisms in the salt cedar species Tamarix ramossissima (Ledeb.) which were investigated with a variety of microscopic techniques. The results indicate that this species can produce different salt crystal aggregates morphologies from its vesiculated trichomes, and may use variable mechanisms for separating anions and cations of various salts. It was additionally found that salt crystals aggregates in this species seem to track elemental characteristics of the soil with respect to salts and metals. The latter finding suggests that while the plant may be an invasive nuisance, it may also be eventually useful as a soil-quality <b>environmental</b> <b>indicator</b> or possibly and <b>environmental</b> <b>indicator.</b> ...|$|E
