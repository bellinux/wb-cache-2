5|$|Determined {{to avoid}} battle, Lacrosse turned southeast, hoping {{to use his}} wider spread of sail to outrun <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> in the strong winds. Pellew, however, manoeuvred to cut the Droits de l'Homme off from the French coast, at this stage still unsure {{of the nature of}} <b>his</b> <b>opponent.</b> As the chase developed, the weather, which had been violent for the entire {{preceding}} month, worsened. An Atlantic gale swept the Ushant headland, driving a blizzard eastwards and whipping the sea into a turbulent state, making steering and aiming more difficult. At 16:15, two of Droits de l'Hommes topmasts broke in the strong winds. This dramatically slowed the French ship, and allowed Pellew, who had recognised <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> as a French ship of the line, to close with Droits de l'Homme.|$|E
5|$|After {{his third}} {{successive}} victory, with his win over Henning Svendsen in March 2006, Wallhead {{made his first}} title defense of his House of Pain Welterweight title just two weeks later. <b>His</b> <b>opponent</b> was John Phillips who was making his second professional appearance. Wallhead defeated Phillips to retain the title, after a TKO victory due to elbows.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Sharp began a {{campaign}} for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky Senate. <b>His</b> <b>opponent,</b> attorney John U. Waring, was a notably violent and contentious man, frequently in court because of altercations. (In 1835, he shot and killed the attorney Samuel Q. Richardson).|$|E
50|$|During this {{fundraising}} Gala, Nenshi {{issued a}} challenge to <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> to confront him directly and not to engage him in a proxy campaign of lobbying as he warns his supporters that <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> will likely engage in.|$|R
50|$|Hayateumi was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, who {{preferred}} {{fighting on the}} mawashi to pushing <b>his</b> <b>opponents,</b> and <b>his</b> most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri, a simple force out. His favourite grip was migi-yotsu, {{with his right hand}} inside and left hand outside <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms.|$|R
5000|$|Capturing the {{opposing}} King or Landowner - {{this is usually}} a crippling blow to a player in any case, as {{he can no longer}} win by capturing all <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces; he can only do so by trapping <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> remaining forces as above.|$|R
5|$|In 1844, Dixon {{was chosen}} as the Whig nominee for {{lieutenant}} governor on a ticket with William Owsley. Dixon defeated <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> William S. Pilcher, by more than 11,000 votes. At the expiration of his term, the Whig party considered nominating Dixon for governor, but instead chose the more experienced John J. Crittenden, who defeated Dixon's former law partner, Lazarus Powell.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Karl Rove ran for {{chair of}} the College Republicans. He {{challenged}} the front-runner's delegates, throwing the national convention into disarray, after which both he and <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> Robert Edgeworth, claimed victory. The dispute was resolved when Rove was selected through the direct order of {{the chairman of the}} Republican National Committee, who at the time was George H W Bush.|$|E
5|$|In February 1843, Macdonald {{announced}} his candidacy {{for the post}} of alderman in Kingston's Fourth Ward. On 29 March 1843, Macdonald celebrated his first election victory, with 156 votes against 43 for <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> a Colonel Jackson. He also suffered what he termed his first downfall, as his supporters, carrying the victorious candidate, accidentally dropped him onto a slushy street.|$|E
50|$|Shimotori was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring {{grappling}} {{techniques and}} grabbing <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> mawashi or belt. His favourite grip was migi-yotsu, which is left hand outside, right hand inside <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms. <b>His</b> most common winning technique was yori-kiri, a straightforward force-out, {{which accounted for}} roughly half his wins.|$|R
50|$|He always studied <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> before {{playing against}} them.|$|R
50|$|Tochinoshin favours yotsu-sumo techniques, {{preferring to}} grapple with rather than push <b>his</b> <b>opponents.</b> <b>His</b> {{favourite}} grip on the mawashi is migi-yotsu, meaning he likes his right hand inside and his left hand outside <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms. <b>His</b> most common winning technique or kimarite is yori kiri or force out, but he also uses his left hand grip to good effect by regularly employing uwatenage, or overarm throw.|$|R
5|$|In the {{preliminary}} card's final match, Melvin Guillard faced Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt Fabrício Camões. Despite being {{mounted in the}} first round by Camoes, Guillard picked apart <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> {{in the rest of the}} fight by exercising good takedown defense and outstriking Camoes. The judges awarded the Imperial Athletics representative the unanimous decision (30–27, 30–27, 30–27).|$|E

50|$|Given the Barisan's large support base, {{political}} onlookers {{speculated that}} the Barisan could potentially win the 1963 General Election. The British colonial records revealed that Lee Kuan Yew felt threatened by the powerful left-wing movements and had on several occasions tried to remove <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> by invoking the PSSO to detain <b>his</b> <b>opponents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kitazakura was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, his {{favourite}} grip on <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> mawashi while grappling being migi-yotsu, or {{left hand}} outside, right hand inside <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms. <b>His</b> most common winning kimarite by far was a straightforward yori-kiri or force out, which determined {{the outcome of}} over half his victories at sekitori level.|$|R

5|$|After Batista won the WWE Championship from John Cena at Elimination Chamber, Cena {{requested}} a rematch. Mr. McMahon agreed, {{on the condition}} that Cena must defeat Batista in a non-title match that night on Raw. Batista intentionally low-blowed Cena during the match to get disqualified and set up their match at WrestleMania. To build up their match, Batista interfered in several of Cena's matches in the weeks prior to WrestleMania, both attacking Cena or distracting him so that <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> could gain the advantage.|$|E
5|$|After {{being forced}} from Goldman Sachs in January 1999, Corzine campaigned for a New Jersey Senate seat after Frank Lautenberg {{announced}} his retirement.

5|$|After {{targeting}} another {{character and}} initiating combat, the player and <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> will damage each other automatically with their weapons. This continues until the player stops or {{the target is}} dead. Each profession's unique nano programs, perks and research also provide combat abilities used by the player during the fight. These can heal the owner, cause additional damage, lower {{the skills of the}} enemy, blind them or otherwise hinder the enemy's ability to fight. Once the target is dead, the player is able to loot money and items from the enemy's body.|$|E
5000|$|McCarty, solidly {{built and}} agile, stood about 6'4", {{and used his}} 80" [...] reach to throw his strong left jab to both <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> head and body with equal accuracy. Though {{he was at his}} best {{controlling}} the action from a distance, he also possessed a powerful right hand, a devastating left hook to the body, and a punishing uppercut that he would use when <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> tried to fight him in close. In addition to his physical strengths, McCarty also had a cool fighting style, never appearing in the ring too nervous or affected by <b>his</b> <b>opponents.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tyson intimidated fighters {{with his}} strength, {{combined}} with outstanding hand speed, accuracy, coordination and timing. [...] Tyson also possessed notable defensive abilities, holding his hands {{high in the}} Peek-a-Boo style taught by his mentor Cus D'Amato to slip under and weave around <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> punches while timing his own. [...] One of Tyson's trademark moves was a right hook to <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> body followed by a right uppercut to <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> chin; very few boxers could remain standing if caught by this combination. Lorenzo Boyd, Jesse Ferguson and Jose Ribalta were each knocked down by this combination.|$|R

5|$|Against All Odds {{official}} {{began with}} a standard match between Elix Skipper and Petey Williams, who was accompanied by Coach D'Amore. The match ended when Skipper performed a move in which he holds <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> upside-down and around his back. He grabs their head and falls to a seated position to caused their head and neck to be forced into the mat, a move he dubbed the Sudden Death. Skipper followed by covering Williams for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Furieuse disappeared ahead, Mounsey pursuing in {{the hope}} of rediscovering <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> during the night. At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened. At 09:10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense heat generated by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.|$|E
