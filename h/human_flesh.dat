5|$|The salvage {{party were}} {{suspicious}} of Keseberg's story, {{and found a}} pot full of <b>human</b> <b>flesh</b> in the cabin along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. They threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed that he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, {{so that it could}} one day benefit her children. On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.|$|E

The other Embryon are the kind Argilla the hot-tempered Heat the light-hearted Cielo and the highly logical Gale. The main {{antagonist}} is Angel, who is Sera's intersexual biological parent. In Digital Devil Saga 2, two new main characters are introduced Roland, the alcoholic leader of the Lokapala resistance group and Madame Margot Cuvier, head of the Karma Society. All the main characters barring Cuvier become infected with the demon virus, a condition that causes them to turn into demonic beings and lust after <b>human</b> <b>flesh.</b>|$|E
5|$|Keseberg {{brought a}} {{defamation}} suit against {{several members of}} the relief party who accused him of murdering Tamsen Donner. The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the California Star described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party, reporting that he preferred eating <b>human</b> <b>flesh</b> over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw. Historian Charles McGlashan amassed enough material to indict Keseberg for the murder of Tamsen Donner, but after interviewing Keseberg he concluded that no murder occurred. Eliza Donner Houghton also believed Keseberg to be innocent.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully grows {{suspicious}} of Mulder when she thinks he may be helping a terrorist organization. Scully begins to wonder if {{he is now a}} traitor to the FBI. It is eventually revealed that Mulder is working as a mole in the group, and he is trying to stop them before they are able to use a biological weapon—that may have been created by members of the US government—which causes rapid degeneration of <b>human</b> <b>flesh.</b>|$|E
5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate <b>human</b> <b>flesh,</b> but that was soon gone. They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E
5|$|Eliza Farnham's 1856 {{account of}} the Donner Party was based largely on an {{interview}} with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves, Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted {{that she and her}} family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph Kingwhose account is sympathetic to the Breen familydo not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, {{would have been able to}} survive without eating <b>human</b> <b>flesh.</b> King suggests Farnham included this into her account independently of Margaret Breen.|$|E

5|$|Greco-Roman mythology {{described}} the Empusae, the Lamia, and the striges. Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the gelloudes or Gello. Like the Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on <b>human</b> <b>flesh</b> and blood.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like <b>human</b> <b>flesh,</b> but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability {{to move out of}} reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.|$|E
5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing <b>human</b> <b>flesh</b> and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood.

5|$|Shakti on {{a narrow}} path. As a kshatriya (member of the ruler class), Kalmashapada does not make way for Shakti, a brahmin (priestly class). Nevertheless, Shakti refuses to budge. Finally, an enraged Kalmashapada hits Shakti with his whip. In turn, the sage curses the king to wander the forest for 16 years. The sage Vishwamitra, the arch-enemy of Vashishtha who desires to have Kalmashapada as his disciple, sends a rakshasa to possess the king's body. Vishwamitra plots to destroy his enemy's family {{with the help of}} the king. Under the {{influence}} of the rakshasa, the king serves <b>human</b> <b>flesh</b> to a Brahmin, who sets Shakti's curse into effect. The king turns into a cannibalistic rakshasa.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on <b>human</b> <b>flesh.</b> Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|The right panel (220 × 97.5cm, 87 × 38.4in) {{illustrates}} Hell, {{the setting}} {{of a number of}} Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityrendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysand presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on <b>human</b> <b>flesh</b> in the foreground.

5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on <b>human</b> <b>flesh</b> and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate <b>human</b> <b>flesh.</b> It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E

50|$|The {{spotted ratfish}} (Hydrolagus colliei) is a {{chimaera}} {{found in the}} north-eastern Pacific Ocean. Often seen by divers {{at night in the}} Pacific Northwest, this cartilaginous fish gets its characteristic name from a pointed rat-like tail. The ratfish lays leathery egg cases on the bottom of muddy or sandy areas which are often mistaken by divers as something inanimate. While mainly a deep-water species, it occurs at shallower depths {{in the northern part of}} its range. The generic name, Hydrolagus, comes from the Greek words ὕδωρ, meaning water, and λαγώς/λαγῶς, meaning hare, and the specific name honors Alexander Collie, who was a ship surgeon and early naturalist. The spotted ratfish is common in much of its range, not typically eaten by <b>humans</b> (the <b>flesh</b> is bland with an unpleasant aftertaste) and is not commercially caught.|$|R
50|$|Xenocrates (Ξενοκράτης; fl. 1st century) a Greek {{physician}} of Aphrodisias in Cilicia, {{who must}} have lived about {{the middle of the}} 1st century, as he was probably a contemporary of Andromachus the Younger. Galen says that he lived in the second generation before himself. He wrote some pharmaceutical works, and is blamed by Galen for making use of disgusting remedies, for instance, <b>human</b> brains, <b>flesh,</b> liver, urine, excrement, etc. One of his works was entitled On Useful Things from Living Beings (Περὶ τῆς ἀπὸ τῶν Ζώων Ὠφελείας). He is several times quoted by Galen, and also by Clement of Alexandria; Artemidorus; Pliny; Oribasius; Aëtius; and Alexander of Tralles.
