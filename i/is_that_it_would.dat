25|$|If approved, the {{proposed}} time frame {{would be for}} completion of design by 2015. Construction would be undertaken from 2016-2018 for a planned 2019 opening. Part of the basis for this further extension by the BMA <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> provide proximate access to the Southern Bus Terminal. This proposal is currently under preliminary study by the BMA.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{striking}} conclusions {{to emerge from}} ecological footprint accounting <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be necessary to have 4 or 5 back-up planets engaged in nothing but agriculture for all those alive today to live a western lifestyle. The Footprint analysis {{is closely related to}} the I=PAT equation that, itself, can be considered a metric.|$|E
25|$|Crosby {{wanted to}} change to {{recorded}} production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> give him more time for his golf game. And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the Jasper National Park Invitational Golf Tournament in September, just when the new radio season was to start. But golf was {{not the most important}} reason.|$|E

25|$|The Railway Gazette, {{cited in}} Ahrons, {{suggests}} {{that there was an}} even earlier design for Cornwall, as a 2-2-2 with single 4' wheels both forward and back. It's uncertain if Cornwall was ever built in this form. The drawing does show a considerable front overhang, with a high load placed on the front axle. If constructed like this, the likelihood <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> suffer the same problems as its contemporary, Gooch's first 2-2-2 Great Western class of 1846, where a broken front axle led to re-design as a 4-2-2.|$|E
25|$|As a {{tactical}} weapon for military use, {{a significant problem}} with a BW attack <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents (smallpox, pneumonic plague) have the capability of person-to-person transmission via aerosolized respiratory droplets. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW {{is less of a}} concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Congressional {{delegation}} of the State of Hawaiʻi introduced the Native Hawaiian Federal Recognition Bill, beginning {{the process of}} recognizing and forming a Native Hawaiian government entity to negotiate with state and federal governments. The significance of the bill <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> establish, {{for the first time}} in the history of the islands, a new political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the federal government. This Native Hawaiian entity would be a newly created one without any historical precedent in the islands, or direct institutional continuity with previous political entities (unlike many Native American Indian groups, for example).|$|E

50|$|In 1989, a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) order (as part of Docket 86-10) {{found that}} a {{national}} database system for Toll-Free access would offer both advantages and disadvantages {{as compared with the}} NXX Plan access solution. The major advantage of the national database system <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> enable Toll-Free number portability and thus facilitate competition since a customer could change carriers without changing numbers. <b>Its</b> drawback <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> increase access time for Toll-Free calls until Signaling System 7 (SS7) deployment became more extensive.|$|R

25|$|All {{cervical}} ripening and induction agents {{can cause}} uterine hyperstimulation, which can negatively affect {{the blood supply}} to the fetus and {{increases the risk of}} complications such as uterine rupture. Concern has been raised that uterine hyperstimulation that occurs during a misoprostol-induced labor is more difficult to treat than hyperstimulation during labors induced by other drugs. Because the complications are rare, {{it is difficult to determine}} if misoprostol causes a higher risk than do other cervical ripening agents. One estimate <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> require around 61,000 people enrolled in randomized controlled trials to detect a difference in serious fetal complications and about 155,000 people to detect a difference in serious maternal complications.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The Daily Telegraph, British doctor and science writer James Le Fanu was critical, and commented that Taylor did not {{acknowledge}} [...] "the explanatory gap" [...] between current understanding of the brain's structure and [...] "what it does, how we think, feel and emote". Le Fanu concluded, [...] "The paradox of Brainwashing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been a much more interesting book if Dr Taylor had pursued the contrarian view of seeking to explain why that 'explanatory gap' is not merely unbridged but, with the advance of the neurosciences, now seems to be unbridgeable. A brain that was simple enough to be fully known would be too simple to contain conscious observers who might know it." [...] Nigel Hawkes of The Times criticized what he saw as Taylor's conclusion that [...] "we are all a little bit brainwashed by our culture and experience" [...] and noted that this assessment places Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple group in the same classification as the tabloid press. [...] A review in Financial Times by Jerome Burne was also critical, and he commented that Taylor does not convey [...] "a clear enough message" [...] in the work.|$|E
500|$|... "Sisters at Heart" [...] {{received}} the Governors Award at the 23rd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in 1971. Montgomery's biographer Herbie Pilato {{wrote that the}} theme of overcoming prejudice is central to Bewitched because of the prominence of the marriage between a witch and a mortal, and that [...] "no episode of the series more clearly represented this cry against prejudice than the holiday story, 'Sisters at Heart.'" [...] A reviewer from the Australian newspaper the Daily Liberal wrote that [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] is [...] "very thoughtful" [...] and argued {{that it is the}} sole episode of the series that is not simply a [...] "lightweight offering" [...] reflective of [...] "the United States' post-war society of new consumerism and advertising." [...] When the seventh season of Bewitched was released on DVD in 2009, DVD Talk reviewer Paul Mavis wrote that [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] has a more overt message than any other episode of the season. He praised the actors' performances in the episode and wrote that, because of the episode's obvious-yet-effective critique of racism, [...] "what's highly ironic about Sisters at Heart today <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> most likely be dubbed politically incorrect and 'insensitive' by some because the cast wear blackface at one point." ...|$|E
50|$|An {{attraction}} of STAR METRICS project <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> scrape data from existing reports, databases, {{and the internet}} for the information it needed, much like the Lattes Platform in Brazil.|$|R

500|$|Territorial {{disputes}} between Chile, Peru and Bolivia triggered the War of the Pacific in 1879 with Chile invading and occupying Peruvian and Bolivian land. [...] In {{the course of}} the war, North suffered damage to his waterworks, and one of his ships was sunk. [...] However he also befriended the Chilean Admiral Patricio Lynch who later supported him in his business ventures. [...] During the war, North was assisted by two British men: Robert Harvey, who had worked for the Peruvian government in the nitrates (saltpetre) industry, and John Dawson, a banker. [...] North was able to use Harvey's knowledge of the nitrates business and credit provided by Dawson to purchase nitrates bond certificates at low prices from investors who were panicked by Peru's poor military performance during the war. [...] After the war, the Chilean government annexed Tarapacá and allowed the bond holders to take possession of the title deeds to the nitrate fields, perhaps influenced by appeals from North's friends. [...] North thus managed to secure a large share of the Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment in almost worthless bonds. [...] The reason that the Chilean government allowed this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have cost them GBP£4 million to buy the bonds from the mainly British nitrate speculators. [...] By allowing the speculators to start mining the Chilean government could take a share of profits via export duties without having to provide the initial capital costs to begin production of nitrates.|$|E
500|$|Gore's use of long ice core {{records of}} CO2 and {{temperature}} (from oxygen isotope measurements) in Antarctic ice cores {{to illustrate the}} correlation between the two drew some scrutiny; Schmidt, Steig and Michael E. Mann back up Gore's data. [...] "Gore stated that the greenhouse gas levels and temperature changes over ice age signals had a complex relationship but that they 'fit'. Both of these statements are true," [...] said Schmidt and Mann. [...] "The complexity though is actually quite fascinating...a full understanding of why CO2 changes in precisely the pattern that it does during ice ages is elusive, but among the most plausible explanations is that increased received solar radiation in the southern hemisphere due to changes in Earth’s orbital geometry warms the southern ocean, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, which then leads to further warming through an enhanced greenhouse effect. Gore’s terse explanation of course does not mention such complexities, but the crux of his point–that the observed long-term relationship between CO2 and temperature in Antarctica supports our understanding of the warming impact of increased CO2 concentrations–is correct. Moreover, our knowledge of why CO2 is changing now (fossil fuel burning) is solid. We also know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and that the carbon cycle feedback is positive (increasing temperatures lead to increasing CO2 and CH4), implying that future changes in CO2 will be larger than we might anticipate." [...] "Gore is careful not to state what the temperature/CO2 scaling is," [...] said Steig. [...] "He is making a qualitative point, which is entirely accurate. The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be difficult or impossible to explain past changes in temperature during the ice age cycles without CO2 changes. In that sense, the ice core CO2-temperature correlation remains an appropriate demonstration of the influence of CO2 on climate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} for domestic {{construction of the}} ferries <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> employ numerous British Columbia workers, revitalize the sagging B.C. shipbuilding industry, and entitle the provincial government to {{a large portion of}} the cost in the form of taxes. BC Ferries CEO David Hahn claimed that building the ferries in Germany would [...] "save almost $80 million and could lead to lower fares." ...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the plans}} for the {{original}} Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> sound like a rock album. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> the intention <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> feature lots of music and various sound-processing techniques during the course of telling the story.

2500|$|Skeptical theism is {{the view}} that we should remain skeptical of claims that our {{perceptions}} about God's purposes can reasonably be considered good evidence {{of what they are}} [...] The central thesis of skeptical theism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be surprising for an infinitely intelligent and knowledgeable being's reasons for permitting a perception of evil or alleged hiddenness to be beyond human comprehension. That is, what is perceived as hiddeness may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils.|$|E

2500|$|A textual {{argument}} against {{the authenticity of the}} James passage is that {{the use of the term}} [...] "Christos" [...] there seems unusual for Josephus. An argument based on the flow of the text in the document is that, given that the mention of Jesus appears in the Antiquities before that of the John the Baptist, a Christian interpolator may have inserted it to place Jesus in the text before John. A further {{argument against}} the authenticity of the James passage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have read well even without a reference to Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2016, Nissan {{announced}} plans to develop fuel cell vehicles powered by ethanol rather than hydrogen, the fuel of choice by the other car manufacturers that have developed and commercialized fuel cell vehicles, such as the Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, and Honda FCX Clarity.

2500|$|Others {{argue that}} a moral theory that is so {{contrary}} to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified. There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly over-demanding requirements. One approach is to drop the demand that utility be maximized. In Satisficing Consequentialism, [...] Michael Slote argues for a form of utilitarianism where [...] "an act might qualify as morally right through having good enough consequences, even though better consequences could have been produced."
