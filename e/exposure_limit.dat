50|$|The TLV is an {{estimate}} {{based on the}} known toxicity in humans or animals of a given chemical substance, and the reliability and accuracy of the latest sampling and analytical methods. It is not a static definition since new research can often modify the risk assessment of substances and new laboratory or instrumental analysis methods can improve analytical detection limits. The TLV is a recommendation by ACGIH, with only a guideline status. As such, {{it should not be}} confused with <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> having a regulatory status, like those published and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The OSHA regulatory <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> permissible <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (PELs) published in 29CFR 1910.1000 Table Z1 are based on recommendations made by the ACGIH in 1968, although other <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> were adopted more recently. Many OSHA <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> are not considered by the industrial hygiene community to be sufficiently protective levels since the toxicological basis for most limits have not been updated since the 1960s. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) publishes recommended <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (RELs) which OSHA takes into consideration when promulgating new regulatory <b>exposure</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|R

40|$|In Sweden, as {{in other}} industrialised nations, {{occupational}} <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> {{are considered to be}} an important tool for chemical risk management, although many other factors also play a role in occupational safety and health management. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> in relation to information about, and the risk perception of, chemicals. An interview study was performed at four Swedish process industry workplaces in order to investigate these issues. For each workplace, the range of informants covered at least one person who spent most of their working time in the production process; one person in a managerial position; one person in the site health, safety and environment department; the main safety ombudsman; and the site manager. The results show that informants' understanding of occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> and their use is quite poor, although they do understand that there is epistemic uncertainty in determining the toxicological effects of hazardous substances. The risk perception and safety behaviour of the informants were not affected by the occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits,</b> nor did occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> have any role as sources of information. Nevertheless, almost all the informants expressed the view that occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> are trusted and needed; safety engineers and main safety ombudsmen, generally, also added that occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> are useful. What was found to be most important factor for the informants' perception of risk and safety was trust in specific people, often established through long-term relationships...|$|R

5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3.

5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
