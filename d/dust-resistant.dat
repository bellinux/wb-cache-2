5000|$|Sony {{releases}} the Sony Xperia Tablet Z {{as well as}} having Ingress Protection Ratings of IP55 and IP57, making it <b>dust-resistant,</b> water-jet resistant, and waterproof.|$|E
50|$|The Element is Pantech's first tablet. It is {{marketed to}} be water- and <b>dust-resistant,</b> and also {{contains}} an 8 inch touchscreen, dual 2 MP front/5 MP back cameras with 720p camcorder, and a dual-core 1.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 processor to power it.|$|E
50|$|All Toughbook {{models have}} a {{magnesium}} alloy case, which provides durability without significant weight. Many current models have liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels {{designed specifically for}} visibility during daylight use. Other design elements include a shock-mounted hard drive and, on many models, a moisture and <b>dust-resistant</b> LCD, keyboard and touchpad.|$|E
50|$|The Motorola Defy, {{also known}} as Motorola Defy A8210 & MB525, is an Android-based {{smartphone}} from Motorola. It fills a unique market segment, by {{being one of the}} few small, IP67 rated smartphones available. It is water-resistant, <b>dust-resistant,</b> and has an impact-resistant screen. The phone has been launched unlocked in Germany, France, Italy, Hungary, India, Thailand, Spain, the UK, Turkey, Romania and Greece under various networks and is distributed exclusively by a number of carriers, including T-Mobile in the United States, Telus in Canada, and Telstra and Optus in Australia. An updated version of the original MB525, Defy+ (MB526) is also available.|$|E
40|$|Faults in wiring {{systems are}} a serious {{concern for the}} {{aerospace}} and aeronautic (commercial, military, and civilian) industries. Circuit failures and vehicle accidents have occurred and {{have been attributed to}} faulty wiring created by open and/or short circuits. Often, such circuit failures occur due to vibration during vehicle launch or operation. Therefore, developing non-intrusive fault-tolerant techniques is necessary to detect circuit faults and automatically route signals through alternate recovery paths while the vehicle or lunar surface systems equipment is in operation. Electrical connector concepts combining dust mitigation strategies and cable diagnostic technologies have significant application for lunar and Martian surface systems, as well as for dusty terrestrial applications. The dust-tolerant intelligent electrical connection system has several novel concepts and unique features. It combines intelligent cable diagnostics (health monitoring) and automatic circuit routing capabilities into a dust-tolerant electrical umbilical. It retrofits a clamshell protective dust cover to an existing connector for reduced gravity operation, and features a universal connector housing with three styles of dust protection: inverted cap, rotating cap, and clamshell. It uses a self-healing membrane as a dust barrier for electrical connectors where required, while also combining lotus leaf technology for applications where a <b>dust-resistant</b> coating providing low surface tension is needed to mitigate Van der Waals forces, thereby disallowing dust particle adhesion to connector surfaces. It also permits using a ruggedized iris mechanism with an embedded electrodynamic dust shield as a dust barrier for electrical connectors where required...|$|E
