40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} (1) that a petroleum <b>ether-soluble</b> <b>material</b> can be extracted from virulent tubercle bacilli. Since it was obtained only from "cordforming" organisms (2) it was called "cord factor. " Mter being subjected to extraction with petroleum ether, the bacteria were still able to grow normally in suitable culture media. This fact suggested that the cord factor was located at {{the surface of the}} bacterial cell and that its removal did not disturb any essential structures of the cell. On the other hand, the importance of the bacterial surface in the establishment of an infection was emphasized {{by the fact that the}} isolated cord factor exerts some of the effects of intact virulent organisms, while the behavior of virulent bacteria after removal of the cord factor was in some respects more characteristic of avirulent than of virulent organisms. It is noteworthy that young cultures yielded considerably more cord factor than older ones. These findings were consistent with the previous work of Middlebrook, Dubos, and Pierce (2) calling attention to the cord formation by virulen...|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} whole human platelets, granulocytes, and {{mononuclear}} leukocytes to possess high {{affinity for the}} toxic lipopolysaccharide from all gram-negative bacteria tested. We have extracted these cells and platelets with n-butanol-water; all endotoxin-binding activity resided in the organic phase. These endotoxin-binding extracts did not block serologically active groupings on endotoxins or receptors on the erythrocytes. The specificity of these still crude materials was less that that of the highly purified erythrocyte lipopolysaccharide receptor previously described by us, since they bound some bacterial antigens not related to endotoxins. Depending on source, the n-butanol extracts contained 40 to 52 % glycerophosphatides (most active), 15 to 22 % sphingomyelin, 17 % cholesterol, less than 2 to 5 % triglycerides, and 7 to 13 % inactive peptide. The most active substances in the n-butanol extract were soluble in petroleum ether, whereas the peptide and sphingomyelin were not. Thus, no constituent protein, carbohydrate, or nucleic acid was present in the most highly active material. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the petroleum <b>ether-soluble</b> <b>material</b> showed for each extract one lipid band only, which was well defined and migrated similarly to phosphatidyllipids. Because of the lipidic nature of the inhibitory substances from leukocytes and platelets we also tested the lipid A component of bacterial endotoxins {{and some of its}} derivatives. Lipid A inhibited endotoxin coating of erythrocytes. De-O-acylation of lipid A left amide-linked 3 -D-hydroxymyristic acid intact and increased the inhibitory activity of lipid A 20 -fold. Complete de-O- and de-N-acylation destroyed its inhibitory effect...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of earlier {{observations}} dealing with the relation of a petroleum <b>ether-soluble</b> <b>material</b> (cord factor) obtained from young cultures of virulent tubercle bacilli to the pathogenicity of these organisms, {{it was expected that}} young cultures yielding more cord factor than older ones of the same strain would also be more virulent for susceptible animals. By infecting mice with equal numbers of bacteria from 3 day and 3 week old cultures, significant differences in the character of disease produced were observed. The mice infected with the younger cultures died of a rapid, septicemic infection with tuberculous lesions in many organs including the heart. A tuberculous myocarditis was probably the immediate cause of death. Mice infected with the older bacteria died of a chronic disease corresponding to the well known mouse tuberculosis. In these cases, the heart was completely free of lesions. No histologic tissue reactions typical of tuberculosis were seen in the animals dying from the acute type of the disease. A similar rapidly progressing infection was observed in rabbits infected with bacteria from young cultures. The symptoms corresponded to the ones seen in the disease known as the Yersin type of tuberculosis. It seems that the pathology of this latter can be produced with every type of pathogenic mycobacteria, human as well as bovine and avian, provided the cultures used are young. Thus it may be inferred that the acute type of tuberculosis is more frequent than commonly accepted both in experimental infection and in the naturally occurring disease. It is proposed to explain the mechanism of this acute infection {{within the framework of the}} cord factor hypothesis...|$|E
