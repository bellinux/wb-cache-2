500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E

They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it,</b> then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E

[...] In mid August 2006, Machine Head announced that the title of their sixth studio effort would be The Blackening. Flynn and drummer Dave McClain spent August 18 and 19 jamming together, fine tuning songs chosen for the album and performing pre-production.

500|$|After [...] "Slanderous" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Mourning" [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] was {{the third}} song that was written for Machine Heads album The Blackening. Flynn {{originally}} presented it to the band as [...] "The Thrashterpiece" [...] which became the songs working title, because according to Flynn [...] "it owes a huge debt to the band Exodus, (there's) a lot of Bay Area thrash worship {{going on in this}} song." [...] In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a [...] "totally fucking lame 'Angel of Death' rip off. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> every time we played it so I was glad to see that part go!" [...] The band entered Sharkbite Studios, in Oakland, California on August 21, 2006 to begin recording. Production duties were handled by Flynn with assistance from Mark Keaton, and mixing by Colin Richardson.|$|E
500|$|Pileggi had {{to endure}} long bouts of make-up application. To create the {{principal}} illusion of monstrous veins, long black faux-veins were glued onto his face, arms, and torso. Pileggi, who had {{had to endure}} little to no make-up during the early seasons, noted that, [...] "They did a beautiful job and [...] looked awesome, but man, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it!</b> I really don't know how those guys on Star Trek or Babylon 5 can stand having that done to them every day. I just wouldn't work if that's what it took". To show the nanobot infection progressing, special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich used two different make-up sets. The two sets were then mixed together electronically in post-production to give the effect of disease progression. The nanobots in the blood sample were designed on a computer and then cloned with an animation program. Composer Mark Snow's score for the episode was inspired by Daniel Sackheim's [...] "big-time feature-like action".|$|E

Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it.</b> I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E

500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{met with}} a divided {{reaction}} from fans and music critics, who {{were not used to}} the album's production and lyrical content. Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn expressed a mixed response towards the band's stylistic change from [...] "soulflavored" [...] songs such as [...] "Everyday People" [...] and [...] "Hot Fun in the Summertime", stating [...] "there is little on the album that is worth your attention". Other major music publications praised this new direction: in his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Vince Aletti wrote that [...] "At first <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> for its weakness and its lack of energy and I still dislike these qualities. But then I began to respect the album's honesty". Aletti cited it as [...] "one of the most important fucking albums this year" [...] and [...] "the new urban music... not about dancing to the music, in the streets. It's about disintegration, getting fucked up, nodding, maybe dying. There are flashes of euphoria, ironic laughter, even some bright stretches but mostly it's just junkie death, oddly unoppressive and almost attractive in its effortlessness". [...] A columnist for Hit Parader magazine gave Riot a favorable review, and stated that the album has [...] "a lot that makes Sly the in-person rave that he is." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "what's expressed is the bitterest ghetto pessimism", backed by [...] "subtle production techniques and jarring song compositions". He declared Riot [...] "one of those rare albums whose whole actually does exceed the sum of its parts". Greil Marcus called the record [...] "Muzak with its finger on the trigger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Why I Never Became a Dancer (1995) is a single-screen {{projection}} with sound, shot on Super 8. Duration: 6 minutes, 40 seconds. It {{was made}} in an edition of 10 and an edited transcript has been published by Tate. The film portrays the artist's early adolescence in Margate, where she grew up. The film begins with the title written across a wall, and then features a montage of views which are significant to Emin's past, including her school, the seaside and shops. The artist's voice narrates her story, opening with, [...] "I never liked school / I was always late / In fact <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> / So at thirteen I left." [...] The video's final scenes show Emin's involvement in a local disco-dancing competition, {{in an attempt to}} escape to London {{to take part in the}} British Disco Dance Championship 1978. The last two minutes of the film consist of Emin dancing exuberantly around a studio.|$|E
2500|$|While Jiang Wei was aggressively leading Shu {{forces to}} attack Wei year after year, the campaigns {{had taken a}} toll on Shu's {{resources}} but failed to yield any significant gains. In the years {{after the death of}} the Shu chancellor Dong Yun in 246, the eunuch Huang Hao came to power and indirectly controlled the Shu government. Huang Hao wanted to remove Jiang Wei from his position of power and replace him with Yan Yu (閻宇), whom he favoured. When Jiang Wei heard about it, he wrote to the Shu emperor Liu Shan to accuse Huang Hao of corruption and treachery, and urge Liu Shan to execute Huang Hao. However, Liu Shan replied, [...] "Huang Hao is merely a minor official. In the past, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> when he got into conflict with Dong Yun. Why should you mind him?" [...] Jiang Wei saw that Huang Hao had many supporters in the imperial court and realised that he had gotten himself into trouble when he openly denounced Huang Hao. Hence, he decided to retreat to Tazhong and garrison there instead of returning to the capital, Chengdu.|$|E
