50|$|During her career, Gurr {{had many}} health {{problems}} and injuries. After the very successful summer of 1969, she began to experience pain in her left knee. X-rays showed a problem, Osteochondritis dissecans of the left femoral condyle, in which {{a part of the}} bone, was becoming detached from the femur. It was determined by her orthopedic surgeon Dr. Hector Gillespie, and her GP, sports medicine expert Dr. Doug Clement that surgery was needed to pin the loosened piece of bone in place. In December 1969 she entered the hospital for the surgery. Much to her surprise, when wheeled into the operating room, she was told of a change of plans. Due to her young age, it was hoped that with crutches and a specialized cast, from hip to ankle, the knee would heal on its own. The cast was made from heated and molded foam rubber, and secured by fiberglass dipped in acetone, and wrapped around the <b>inner</b> <b>foam</b> layer. When it dried, it weighed almost nothing, and she could continue her training. This was the prototype for the lightweight fiberglass casts used by many people today.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{designing}} {{process of}} combat helmets requires both numerical modeling and experimental validation {{in order to}} achieve exigent requirements combining impact resistance and reasonable weight. In this work a finite element model of a combat helmet is presented. Mechanical behaviour of the shell aramid composite under impact conditions was analyzed from experimental Fragment Simulating Projectile (FSP) and Full-Metal Jacketed (FMJ) impact tests on aramid flat plates. Numerical modeling based on finite elements method was used to simulate both impacts in simple plates of the composite and also the simulation of ballistic impact involving real ammunition and the complex geometry of the helmet including <b>inner</b> <b>foam.</b> Experimental work involving impact tests on composite plates and also ballistic test on the helmet with a dummy provided real data for comparison with models predictions and proved the accuracy of the numerical models developed.

The evolution of the biofilm was observed during 22 days by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. Three distinct immobilization patterns could be observed in the polyurethane foam: cell aggregates entrapped in matrix pores, thin biofilms attached to <b>inner</b> polyurethane <b>foam</b> surfaces and individual cells that have adhered to the support. Rods, cocci and vibrios were observed as the predominant morphologies of bacterial cells. Methane was produced mainly by hydrogenothrophic reactions during the operation of the reactors...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the {{behavior}} of conventional and modified sandwich plate designs subjected to blast loads is examined with the finite element method. The conventional sandwich design consists of thin outer (loaded side) and inner facesheets made of fibrous laminates, separated by a layer of structural foam core. In the modified designs, a thin ductile interlayer is inserted between the outer facesheet and the foam core. Two materials are selected for the interlayers; one is rate-independent, hyperelastic (polyurethane, PUR), {{and the other is}} rate and pressure-dependent, elastic–plastic (polyurea). A comparison is made between the two enhanced designs and the conventional design during an extended time period of 5. 0 ms under an exponential pressure impulse lasting for 0. 05 ms, and has a peak pressure of 100 MPa. Results show that utilizing PUR or polyurea to separate the outer facesheet and the foam core leads to a much reduced core compression, facesheet vibration, and overall deflection compared to the conventional design. Similar reductions are found in the kinetic energy and the stored and dissipated strain energy. This is attributed to the ability of the interlayers to store energy and shield the <b>inner</b> <b>foam</b> by exhibiting great stiffness under pressure. Although strain rates as high as 104 s 1 are produced by the blast pressure impulse in the sandwich plates, the strains in both the PUR and the polyurea interlayers are relatively small. This leads to generally similar responses for the two interlayer types, with the initially stiffer PUR providing a slightly better protection for the foam core...|$|E
40|$|The use of filled {{composite}} materials in passive safety structure has significantly increased recently {{because of their}} low specific mass, stiffness and energy absorption capacities. However those new light weight materials are supposed to exhibit equal or higher performances than classical ones. Therefore interesting applications by using those materials can be thought about like in the manufacturing of aeronautical helmets. Constituted of an outer shell and an <b>inner</b> <b>foam</b> structure, helmet must protect pilots from an impact by absorbing energy {{as much as possible}} and avoid contact between head and impactor. Nowadays different standards describe the minimum required performance for shock attenuation and penetration resistance of helmets [1]. These standards are based on acceleration time history measurements recorded from an accelerometer located at the headform center of mass. For aeronautical standard, acceleration peak value is the only one parameter concerning shock attenuation. Its value must not exceed 300 g, where g = 9. 81 m. s- 2. Concerning penetration resistance, no contact can be accepted between the penetrating striker and the headform. The outer shell of the helmet has to resist penetration in order to absorb and to extend the input energy over the foam. The most important part of energy is dissipated by polymeric foam through collapse processes under impact [2]. Nevertheless a significant part of energy (one third [3, 4]) can be dissipated by the plastic deformation of the shell and the occurrence of damage mechanisms. To obtain different dissipative phenomena, various materials were studied: a) Three different kinds of polycarbonate were used. This type of material is well known for its large viscoplastic deformations without any significant hardening. In other words it is a very good candidate for helmet application because of high specific energy dissipation and a stress cut-off effect. Moreover a larger affected zone is expected for filled polycarbonate because of an extension due to the addition of silicon. b) Damage like fiber failure, decohesion, delamination and matrix failure are expected for composite material to dissipate energy [5]. Carbon fiber was chosen with thermoplastic matrix (Polyamide and Polyurethane) to dissipate energy by plasticity and damage. This means that a higher tensile strain is expected. c) Aramid fibers were chosen because of their high tensile strain (εr = 4. 5 %). Consequently a larger affected zone is expected to dissipate as much as possible energy. An epoxy matrix was loaded with carbon nanotubes in order to increase branching and micro-cracking and also increase dissipated energy...|$|E
40|$|The argon {{excluder}} {{is designed}} to reduce the media density of the dead space between the internal modules of the end calorimeters and the concave convex head to {{less than that of}} argon. The design of the excluder includes a thin circular stainless steel plate welded to the inner side of the convex pressure vessel head at a radius of 26 and 15 / 16 inches. It is estimated that this plate will experience a pressure differential of approximately 40 pounds per square inch. A <b>inner</b> <b>foam</b> core is incorporated into the design of the excluder as structural support. This engineering note outlines the compression data for the foam used in the north end calorimeter argon excluder. Four test samples of approximately the same dimensions were cut and machined from large blocks of the poured foam. Two of these test samples were then subjected to varying compression magnitudes until failure. For this test failure was taken to mean plastic yielding or the point at which deformation increases without a corresponding increase in loading. The third sample was subjected to a constant compressive stress {{for an extended period of}} time, to identify any 'creeping' effects. Finally, the fourth sample was cooled to cryogenic temperatures in order to determine the coefficient of thermal expansion. The compression test apparatus consisted of a state of the art INSTROM coupled with a PC workstation. The tests were run at a constant strain rate with discrete data taken at 500 millisecond intervals. The sample data is plotted as a stress strain diagram in the results. The first test was run on sample number one at a compression rate of 0. 833 mills or equivalently a strain rate of 3. 245 x 10 {sup - 4 } mil/mills. The corresponding stress was then calculated from the force measured divided by the given initial area. The test was run for thirty minutes until the mode of failure, plastic yielding, was reached. The second test was run as a check of the first using sample number two, and likewise was conducted in the same manner. However, the strain rate for the second test was increased to 6. 66 x 10 {sup - 4 } mil/mills which reduced the test time to fifteen minutes. The third sample was subjected to a compressive stress of forty pounds per sqaure inch, the estimated MAWP, for a period of thirty minutes. Data was taken manually by the operator and an estimate is provided in the results. The thermal test conducted on sample number four consisted of cooling the sample to 77 K using an open mouth dewar filled with liquid nitrogen. The sample was then measured (all dimensions) warm, 298 K, and cold, 77 k, and the measurements compared. The sample was then allowed to warm and the test was repeated. The calculation of the coefficient of thermal expansion is provided in the results...|$|E

40|$|The first- and second-impact {{absorption}} {{properties of}} different commercial polymeric foams were analysed {{in order to}} identify possible alternatives to currently used polystyrene foams (EPS) for protective helmets. An appropriate “falling dart” apparatus was built complying with standard regulations to study and compare an expanded polystyrene (EPS) actually used in motorcycle helmets productions, with commercial polypropylene (EPP), polyvinyl-chloride (EPVC) and polyethylene (EPE) foams. Both dynamic cushioning tests in a “free sample” configuration and impact tests using guided hemispherical indenters were performed for each class of material at three different temperatures (- 20 °C, ambient, 50 °C) and at two different bulk densities. Also the residual deformation was measured for each sample. In order to characterise dynamic absorption properties of materials, deceleration peak values obtained from the tests with hemispherical impactors have been plotted versus different static loads in a cushion curve fashion. Expanded polypropylene showed better second-impact absorption properties and lower residual deformation than EPS, suggesting it as a possible alternative material for <b>inner</b> polymeric <b>foam</b> protective shells, particularly in view of matching the two-shock criteria required for official approval of car driving helmets...|$|R
50|$|A bouldering mat or {{crash pad}} is a foam pad used for {{protection}} when bouldering. There are various sizes and makes, {{but the most}} common type is a folded mattress, 8 - 10 cm thick, that when unfolded measures about 1 by 1.3 m. Most of bouldering mats often have shoulder straps so as to easily move it between boulders. Bouldering mats often come in either dual or triple density <b>foam</b> <b>inners</b> to provide differing levels of support with the bottom or middle being the softer. With the higher density foam at the top this will prevent the climber's foot from sinking through the foam and either gaining impact on the ground or getting a foot stuck in the mat which would increase the chance of injury. Mats are often used to cover dangerous sections of the ground below a chosen climb such as protruding rocks or grass tufts.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to improve the helmet fit of {{military}} helicopter aircrew members and evaluate its effect on the experienced helmet stability (helmet gliding), neck load, neck pain, hot spots (pressure points), irritation/distraction, and overall helmet comfort during night flights. A within-subject design was used over a three-month period that consisted of two consecutive interventions of optimising the fit of the aircrew's helmets: 1) a new helmet fit using a renewed protocol and 2) replacement of a thermoplastic inner liner with a viscoelastic <b>foam</b> <b>inner</b> liner. A total of 18 pilots and loadmasters rated the outcome measures using the Visual Analogue Scales immediately after their night flights, for three night flights in total per measurement period. The optimised helmet fit resulted in a significant decrease in the experienced helmet gliding, neck load and pressure points, a decrease trend in the experienced neck pain and irritation/distraction, and a significant increase in the experienced overall helmet comfort during flight. These results demonstrate the importance of achieving an optimised helmet fit for military helicopter aircrew and that an optimised helmet fit might have implications for both health and safety concerns.
