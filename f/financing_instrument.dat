These financial resources {{come in the}} form of various financial instruments, having their foundation based on both the conventional and Islamic principles. While the conventional <b>financing</b> <b>instruments</b> are based on the current market interest rate, the Islamic <b>financing</b> <b>instruments</b> are interest-free. There are two modes of Islamic <b>financing</b> <b>instruments,</b> namely; (i) debt-creating such as Salam, Istisna’, Murabahah and Kafalah, and (ii) non-debt creating such as Mudarabah and Musyarakah.

Assessment is achieved with national and foreign external peers that evaluate proposals. The evaluation and selection process is based on clear and transparent eligibility and selection criteria that assure equal opportunities and technical rigor.

50|$|This {{unprecedented}} {{growth in}} membership {{was due to}} the Welfare Association’s involvement with the movement for the emancipation of parents of children with special needs, with student the women’s rights as also various self-help groups of a more medical nature, initiatives of the unemployed and recipients of social benefits. As {{a member of the national}} executive he represented the viewpoint at the various strategy conferences that the greatest force binding together social life arises precisely through the faith in the individual human being; that an association, which has the courage to fully entertain the competing views of its members on a conceptual and spiritual basis is not weakened but grows stronger than any ties of a common world view can provide. Through Barkhoff, the Parity Welfare Association opened itself to the transforming societal energy of the 1968 movement, which gave it a sphere of activity and new challenges. He also established a new <b>financing</b> <b>instrument</b> for the Parity Welfare Association, the Parity Financial Counseling Paritätische Geldberatung.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} act in the {{interest}} of social protection and support, i.e. to provide social services or introduce social products, in many cases it is necessary to set up and operate infrastructure. PSPP projects therefore aim at financing infrastructure that is used to realize social services and products. In this respect PSPPs do the same thing as PPP projects, which are also usually set up to finance infrastructure.To provide social services it may not always be necessary to set up infrastructure on a large scale, but it is always necessary to carry out a phase of developing, planning and organizing the prerequisites for providing the social services. PSPP as a <b>financing</b> <b>instrument</b> can thus also be used to finance the development and preparation of social products and services that do not require any large infrastructure investments. Different financing instruments are used depending on whether infrastructure needs to be financed or not.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 the Housing Bank BNH was {{dissolved}} {{and management}} of the FGTS, the key <b>financing</b> <b>instrument</b> for the sector, was passed on to the Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF), under the supervision and control of the Supervisory Council of the FGTS (CCFGTS). However, the sector policy functions of BNH were not passed on to CEF and national policy for sanitation became the responsibility of various bodies in charge of urban management. PLANASA was formally abolished in 1992, making it more difficult for state governments to finance state water companies. The 1988 Federal Constitution does not clearly assign the responsibility for water supply and sanitation to either municipalities or states. Both can implement programs, provided the basic guidelines issued by the Federal Government are followed. A complicated web of un-enforced or weakly enforced statutory requirements (e.g. permit requirements) persisted. An effect of the new constitution was to render the responsibility for water provision “less clearly defined”. Article 30 of the 1988 constitution allows municipal government to legislate in matters of “local interest” and to “organize and provide, directly or by concession or permit, the public services of local interest,” but does not resolve a variety of “unclear property rights” questions relating to the concession authority of municipalities. Nevertheless, state water companies continue to be regulated almost exclusively by state governments.|$|E
