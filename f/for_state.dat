40|$|In {{the present}} paper the cross norm {{criterion}} for separability of density matrices is studied. In {{the first part of}} the paper we determine the value of the greatest cross norm <b>for</b> Werner <b>states,</b> <b>for</b> isotropic <b>states</b> and <b>for</b> Bell diagonal <b>states.</b> In the second part we show that the greatest cross norm criterion induces a novel computable separability criterion for bipartite systems. This new criterion is a necessary but in general not a sufficient criterion for separability. It is shown, however, that <b>for</b> all pure <b>states,</b> <b>for</b> Bell diagonal <b>states,</b> <b>for</b> Werner <b>states</b> in dimension d= 2 and <b>for</b> isotropic <b>states</b> in arbitrary dimensions the new criterion is necessary and sufficient. Moreover, it is shown that <b>for</b> Werner <b>states</b> in higher dimensions (d greater than 2), the new criterion is only necessary. Comment: REVTeX, 19 page...|$|R

5|$|After President Nixon {{was elected}} in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an {{advocate}} for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program <b>for</b> <b>state</b> and local governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E

5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential <b>for</b> <b>state</b> financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E

The incident with Litvinenko has also attracted comparisons to the poisoning by radioactive (unconfirmed) thallium of KGB defector Nikolay Khokhlov and journalist Shchekochikhin of Novaya Gazeta (the Novaya Gazeta interview with the former, coincidentally, prepared by Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was later found shot to death in her apartment building).
