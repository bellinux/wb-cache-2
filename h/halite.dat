These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of <b>halite,</b> a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands.

5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are very abundant in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal.

Examples are copper atoms, chromate ions, and ferric oxide molecules. (2) Colour is sometimes attributed to structural causes. The blue tints of certain <b>halites</b> have been explained in this way; but a fresh suggestion is made in this communication. (3) A pigmentary impurity may cause the observed colour. The colour of the ruby is believed to be caused by the presence of a red chromic oxide. 1 The blue tint of a Yorkshire aragonite is shown later to be due to a copper salt. (4) Some minerals how plays of colours due to interference and/or grating effects. Labradorite and opal are cases in point. Into this group also fall minerals like bomite which become iridescent from tarnish. (5) Finally, some minerals owe their colour to the presence of foreign substances in colloid form. This differs from ordinary pigmentation i that the colour of the impurity itself bears no relation whatever to that of the mineral, because the colour is due to scattered light, not reflected light. The impurity may, when by itself, be actually colourless. Particles of colloid dimensions are too small to reflect incident light; they can only scatter it; hence for any one particular colloidal substance its own degree of dispersion will determine the wave-length or colour of the scattered light, whilst its concentration will fix the actual depth or intensity of that colour...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Yorkshire & Humber area {{contains}} {{some of the}} biggest CO 2 emitters in the UK. The UK Southern North Sea (SNS) contains a number of gas fields and saline aquifers which could provide storage for some of that CO 2. National Grid Carbon (NGC) has plans to connect these sources and sinks via a shared 24 â pipeline in a hub & spoke arrangement called âThe Humber Cluster Projectâ. After several years of high level study using multi-client seismic surveys and a database of released well data, an anticlinal structure of around 25 km length and 8 km width with a 275 m thick Bunter sandstone formation (saline aquifer) was selected for detailed analysis. Two crestal wells in the structure called 5 / 42 were drilled in 1970 and 1990 looking for hydrocarbons but only brine was found. Basic formation evaluation logs were acquired in both wells. Limited core and pressure data were acquired in the 1990 well. No record of any water analysis is available and the core and log coverage was limited. As of mid- 2012 some uncertainties remained with respect to the suitability of 5 / 42 for CO 2 disposal. Little was known about the strength & permeability of the cap rock which consists of 10 - 12 m of shale overlain by about 80 m of <b>halites</b> and mudstones. Although the structure seems well defined and no major faulting was seen in the Bunter sandstone there was little reservoir permeability data, especially vertical permeability.

40|$|Terrestrial {{weathering}} {{processes in}} cold-desert climates {{such as the}} Dry Valleys of Antarctica may provide an excellent analog to chemical weathering and diagenesis of soils on Mars. Detailed studies of soil development and the chemical and mineralogical alterations occurring within soil columns in Wright Valley, Antarctica show incredible complexity in the upper meter of soil. Previous workers noted the ice-free Dry Valleys are the best terrestrial approximations to contemporary Mars. Images returned from the Pathfinder and Spirit landers show similarities to surfaces observed within the Dry Valleys. Similarities to Mars that exist in these valleys are: mean temperatures always below freezing (- 20 C), no rainfall, sparse snowfall-rapidly removed by sublimation, desiccating winds, diurnal freeze-thaw cycles (even during daylight hours), low humidity, oxidative environment, relatively high solar radiation and low magnetic fields. The Dry Valley soils contain irregular distributions and low abundances of soil microorganisms that are somewhat unusual on Earth. Physical processes-such as sand abrasion-are dominant mechanisms of rock weathering in Antarctica. However, chemical weathering {{is also an important}} process even in such extreme climates. For example, ionic migration occurs even in frozen soils along liquid films on individual soil particles. It has also been shown that water with liquid-like properties is present in soils at temperatures on the order of approx. - 80 C and it has been observed that the percentage of oxidized iron increases with increasing soil age and enrichments in oxidized iron occurs toward the surface. The presence of evaporates is evident and appear similar to "evaporite sites" within the Pathfinder and Spirit sites. Evaporites indicate ionic migration and chemical activity even in the permanently frozen zone. The presence of evaporates indicates that chemical weathering of rocks and possibly soils has been active. Authogenic zeolites have been identified within the soil columns because they are fragile; i. e. they are euhedral, unabraded, and unfractured, strongly suggesting in situ formation. Their presence in Antarctic samples is another indication that diagenic processes are active in cold-desert environments. The presence of zeolites, and other clays along with <b>halites,</b> sulfates, carbonates, and hydrates are to be expected within the soil columns on Mars at the Gusev and Isidis Planitia regions. The presence of such water-bearing minerals beneath the surface supplies one of the requirements to support biological activity on Mars...|$|R

40|$|The Peruvian/Bolivian Altiplano is an {{important}} hydrologic system for paleoclimate reconstruction because it is unique {{in its ability to}} record climate variability associated with the near-continental scale South American summer monsoon (SASM), which is responsible for much of the precipitation over the Amazon basin and the southern subtropics. Over long timescales moisture on the Altiplano fluctuates in intensity due to changes in precessional insolation forcing as well as teleconnections to decadal-to-millennial scale abrupt temperature shifts in the Northern hemisphere Atlantic. These long-term changes in moisture transport to the Altiplano have been observed in multiple paleoclimate records, including drill core records and paleo-lake level records, as apparent advances and retreats of large lakes in the terminal basin occupied by the Salar de Uyuni and the Salar de Coipasa. Presented here are the results from three studies that utilize different methods to create a refined reconstruction of paleohydrology, as well as paleoclimate, on the Altiplano. A major goal of this research is a more detailed understanding of millennial scale climate variability as it relates to insolation changes and abrupt warming and cooling in the north Atlantic. The first study discusses the creation of a paleohydrologic profile to reconstruct north-south hydrological history using previously reported lake core sediment records the northern and southern basins of the Altiplano, and a new 14 m core from the Salar de Coipasa representing the last ~ 45 ka. The second study uses a terrestrial hydrology model to simulate lake level changes through time given changes in precipitation and temperature. The third study uses strontium isotopic measurements of carbonates and <b>halites</b> in a 220 -m core from the Salar de Uyuni to determine how source waters to the southern basin have changed through time. The paleohydrologic profile in the first study is constructed using records from three major basins within the Altiplano: Lake Titicaca in the north, and Salar de Coipasa and Salar de Uyuni in the south. The new continuous sediment core from Salar de Coipasa indicates a lake that has fluctuated between deep and shallow phases for the last 45 ka. Lacking sufficient calcium carbonate, we instead take advantage of the general correlation between d 18 O and d 13 C in closed basin lakes to approximate water balance using d 13 C from organic carbon. This reconstruction is validated with diatom paleoecological records. The isotope measurements and diatom records indicate that from 45 - 36 ka Coipasa was moderately deep, consistent with paleoshoreline evidence of paleolake Minchin (46 - 36 ka). From 36 - 26 ka a shallow lake The hydrologic model in the second study was run through many scenarios including increases in precipitation, decreases in temperature, and combinations of the two. During the LGM southern Altiplano lakes fluctuated between 3, 660 - 3, 700 masl. Model results suggest that during this period basin wide precipitation increased up to 250 mm/yr compared to modern values dependent on a temperature decrease of 5 Â°C relative to modern values. To create a lake at elevation 3, 760 masl consistent with the highest paleolake phase (Tauca, ~ 16 ka) the model requires an increase of 350 mm/yr compared to modern values dependent on a 5 Â°C decrease in temperature (relative to modern values). An increase in temperature alone of 2 Â°C above modern values causes Lake Titicaca water level to decrease ~ 30 m, creating a closed basin lake. Results indicate that Lake Titicaca outflow is necessary to sustain large lakes in the southern basin, providing ~ 40 - 60 % of total input via the Rio Desaguadero. Analysis of a 220 m core from the Salar de Uyuni suggests periods of alternating wet and dry phases (indicated by alternating mud and salt units respectively) at the salar. Evident in the record is a transition at ~ 60 ka from sediments consistent with dry conditions ("playa lakes") to sediments consistent with deep lakes ("great lakes"). It has been shown that rivers and lakes in the Bolivian and Peruvian Altiplano display a range of Sr isotopic ratios that can be connected to the lithologies of specific drainage basins. Measurements of Sr ratios of the alternating <b>halites</b> and carbonate sediments are used to determine when paleolakes in the Salar were supplied by flow from the northern and central basins of the Altiplano, and when they were more a product of increased precipitation in the Uyuni basin. The results from Sr isotope analysis suggest that prior to ~ 60 ka the primary source of Sr to the Uyuni was local runoff and direct precipitation. Following the state change from the "play lakes" phase to the "great lakes" phase Sr isotope measurements suggest a significant influence from more radiogenic waters originating in the central and northern Altiplano basins. The reason for this state change is attributed to a combination of a general increase in precipitation following the onset of the MIS- 4 (~ 70 ka) glacial period and downcutting of the Laka Jahuira hydrologic divide, which connects Lago PoopÃ³ in the central basin to the Salar de Coipasa. This approach of reconstructing hydrology using the combination of multiple paleolake records, hydrological modeling, and isotopic tracers allows for {{a better understanding of how}} precipitation and temperature changes affect the advance and retreat of large lakes on the Altiplano, and ultimately a more accurate understanding of how decadal-to-millennial forcings influence the climate of the subtropical Andes.

Minerals such as galena or <b>halite</b> have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90Â°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90Â°, such as in calcite or rhodochrosite, it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond, and sphalerite has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Several sediment-preserved plant remains {{dating to}} the Miocene were {{successfully}} investigated (Golenberg et al. 1990; Golenberg 1991). Then, in 1994 and to international acclaim, Woodward et al. reported the most exciting results to date â mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences that had apparently been extracted from dinosaur bones dating to more than 80 million years ago. When in 1995 two further studies reported dinosaur DNA sequences extracted from a Cretaceous egg (An et al. 1995; Li et al. 1995), {{it seemed that the}} field would revolutionize knowledge of the Earth's evolutionary past. Even these extraordinary ages were topped by the claimed retrieval of 250-million-year-old halobacterial sequences from <b>halite.</b>|$|E
