50|$|<b>Kepone</b> Is an American indie {{rock band}} based out of Richmond, Virginia. Formed in 1991, the band's name {{was derived from}} the <b>Kepone</b> crisis that {{occurred}} in the Richmond area in the 1970s. Originally formed as a sideproject of Michael Bishop of Gwar, the original lineup of the band also included guitarist Tim Harriss of Burma Jam and Hoi-Polloi as well as drummer Seth Harris of Honor Role. <b>Kepone</b> released their full-length debut album, Ugly Dance, through Quarterstick Records in 1994. Harris left soon after to focus on environmental activism, and Ed Trask of the Holy Rollers replaced him. The band released two more albums, Skin and <b>Kepone,</b> before their eventual break up. The three would play separately in other bands before reuniting to form American Grizzly with vocalist Bunny Wells. American Grizzly broke up in 2005.|$|E
50|$|In the US, <b>kepone</b> was {{produced}} by Allied Signal Company and LifeSciences Product Company in Hopewell, Virginia.

The product is similar to DDT and is a degradation product of Mirex. The history of <b>Kepone</b> incidents are reviewed in Who's Poisoning America?: Corporate Polluters and Their Victims in the Chemical Age (1982).

50|$|The French {{island of}} Martinique is heavily {{contaminated}} with <b>kepone,</b> following {{years of its}} unrestricted use on banana plantations. Despite a 1990 ban of the substance by France, the economically powerful planter community lobbied intensively to gain the power to continue using <b>kepone</b> until 1993. They had argued that no alternative pesticide was available, which has since been disputed. Similarly, the nearby island of Guadeloupe is also contaminated, but to a lesser extent. Since 2003, local authorities have restricted cultivation of crops because the soil has been seriously contaminated by <b>kepone.</b> Martinique and Guadeloupe {{have some of the}} highest prostate cancer diagnosis rates in the world.|$|E

5000|$|He {{attended}} Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia. Most notably, he was {{the bass}} guitarist and, after a 20-year hiatus, is currently the lead vocalist for the American heavy metal band Gwar. Bishop's first band was the Hopewell, VA-based hardcore outfit The Guilty. As a member of Gwar, {{he was the}} first to play the role of [...] "Beefcake the Mighty". The name of Beefcake was taken from Bishop's nickname during his punk years. Bishop was the bassist and lead vocalist for <b>Kepone</b> from 1991 through the band's breakup in 1997. All three members of <b>Kepone</b> later performed together again as American Grizzly until that band's breakup in 2005. He played with the Misery Brothers, a country/soul band local to Charlottesville, Virginia from 2007 to 2009.|$|E
50|$|Bishop {{remains an}} active musician, {{performing}} with Sarah White and the Pearls.

Additionally, Finklea called on Congress to adopt toxic substances legislation related to carcinogenic pesticides, and <b>Kepone</b> in particular.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the bridge in 1966, an automobile-carrying passenger ferry service had operated at this location, but the docks had rotted and silt had filled in the areas where the large ferryboats, if their service was to be restored, would need to dock. Due to a dredging restriction in place because of <b>Kepone</b> contamination, it was not feasible to restore the automobile-carrying ferry service, although a similar operation was still serving about 35 mi downstream at the Jamestown Ferry.|$|E
5000|$|Flattus Maximus {{does not}} perform on this album. Dewey Rowell left the band before {{recording}} began, {{and all of}} the lead guitars (save for two songs â [...] "Crack in the Egg" [...] and the title track) were recorded by Balsac the Jaws of Death. To this day, Balsac will usually play lead when performing songs from this album live. Tim Harriss (of <b>Kepone,</b> the band Michael Bishop left Gwar for) played lead on the albumâs title track; Lee Harris (from Jizmak Da Gushaâs old band Rosebud) played lead on [...] "Crack in the Egg". Because of the absence of Flattus, the tour cycle surrounding this album was quite short.|$|E
50|$|DiNunzio joined Denali in 2000 {{after being}} asked by singer Maura Davis to help {{fill out the}} band along with drummer Jonathan Fuller and bassist Keeley Davis.

5000|$|In God We Trust, Inc. is a {{hardcore}} punk EP by the Dead Kennedys; {{it is now}} reissued with Plastic Surgery Disasters. The album, {{which was}} the band's first recording with drummer D.H. Peligro, spends the first two tracks attacking organized religion before going on to attack such diverse topics as Neo Nazis, President Ronald Reagan, the pesticide <b>Kepone,</b> {{and the kind of}} governmental indifference that vastly worsened the effects of catastrophes like the Minamata disease. [...] "We've Got a Bigger Problem Now" [...] is a lounge jazz remake of [...] "California Ãber Alles" [...] from the previous album with Ronald Reagan instated in place of Jerry Brown. The EP also includes a cover of the theme song from the 1960s show, Rawhide. The album cover depicts a golden Jesus crucified on a cross of dollar bills, with a background of a shiny metal material. On the original vinyl version, Side A was tracks 1-5 and Side B was tracks 6-8. On the original cassette version, Side A contained all 8 songs, with Side B being left intentionally blank.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>Kepone</b> to mixed populations of estuarine microorganisms {{was determined by}} standard plate assays on Zobell marine medium containing 0. 02, 0. 20, and 2. 0 mg of <b>Kepone</b> per liter. Under aerobic conditions, <b>Kepone</b> {{reduced the number of}} colony-forming units at all concentrations tested, but had no effect on the number of anaerobic microorganisms. Gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to <b>Kepone</b> than were gram-negative organisms. Growth of gram-negative isolates was not inhibited in nutrient broth, but was significantly inhibited in a minimal salts broth. Oxygen uptake by most isolates was reduced 25 to 100 % by 20 ppm (20 mg/ml) of <b>Kepone.</b> Oxygen evolution was observed when several gram-positive isolates were exposed to <b>Kepone</b> concentrations of 20 ppm. Pentachlorophenol at concentrations above 28 ppm produced effects similar to those produced by <b>Kepone.</b> Inhibition of electron transport by <b>Kepone</b> was demonstrated by a significant reduction in the specific activities of NADH oxidases and succinooxidase...|$|E
40|$|Effects of the {{chlorinated}} insecticide <b>Kepone</b> on {{the ecology}} of Chesapeake Bay and James River bacteria were studied. Kepone-resistant bacteria present in a given environment were found to reflect the degree of fecal and/or high organic pollution of the sampling sites, based on total numbers and generic composition of the populations of Kepone-resistant bacteria. The presence of Kepone-resistant bacteria {{was found to be}} correlated (Î± = 0. 01) with total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and total aerobic viable heterotrophic bacteria, but not with <b>Kepone</b> concentration, since Kepone-resistant bacteria were present in locations where <b>Kepone</b> could not be detected by the analytical methods used in this study. Only gram-negative bacteria, predominantly Pseudomonas, Vibrio, and Aeromonas spp., were found to be resistant to â¥ 10 Î¼g of <b>Kepone</b> per ml. Gram-positive bacteria, i. e., Bacillus and Corynebacterium spp., were generally sensitive to â¥ 0. 1 Î¼g of <b>Kepone</b> per ml. From results of cluster analysis of taxonomic data, we determined that characteristics of Kepone-resistant bacteria included: resistance to pesticides and heavy metals; degradation of oil; positive oxidase and catalase reactions; and nitrate reduction. From results of the ecological and taxonomic analyses, we conclude that <b>Kepone</b> resistance in estuarine bacteria is due to the physicochemical composition of the gram-negative cell wall and not prior exposure to <b>Kepone.</b> Therefore, the presence of Kepone-resistant bacteria cannot serve as an indicator of <b>Kepone</b> contamination in the aquatic environment where gram-negative bacteria are predominant...|$|E
