50|$|Impact strength, is the {{capability}} of the material to withstand a suddenly applied load and is {{expressed in terms of}} energy. Often measured with the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> or Charpy impact test, both of which measure the impact energy required to fracture a sample. Volume, modulus of elasticity, distribution of forces, and yield strength affect the impact strength of a material. In order for a material or object to have a high impact strength the stresses must be distributed evenly throughout the object. It also must have a large volume with a low modulus of elasticity and a high material yield strength.|$|E
50|$|A Notch in {{mechanical}} and materials engineering {{refers to a}} deliberately introduced v-shaped, u-shaped or circular defect in a planar material whereby stress is concentrated. Notch geometries {{play an important role}} in fracture mechanics and materials characterisation. Notches are most often found in impact testing of materials where the presence of a crack origin of controlled morphology in necessary in order to achieve standardised characterisation of fracture toughness. This is most commonly realized using the Charpy impact test , in which the impact of a pendulum hammer (striker) with a horizontal notched specimen and the height of its subsequent swing-through is used to infer the energy absorbed in fracture of the specimen. Impact testing of notched bars is also applied in the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test,</b> typically applied to a cantilever configuration with a vertically positioned specimen. Charpy testing is conducting with U- or V-notches whereby the striker contacts the specimen directly behind the notch, whereas the now largely obsolete Izod method involves a circular notch facing the striker. Notched specimens find use in other characterization protocols, including tensile testing and fatigue.|$|E

Textile cotton fibers were also considered. The fibers were characterized {{in terms of their}} chemical composition and analyzed using TGA, SEM, and X-ray. The thermoset (non-reinforced) and composites (phenolic matrices reinforced with randomly dispersed fibers) were characterized using TG, DSC, SEM, DMTA, the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test,</b> and water absorption capacity analysis. The composites that were reinforced with lyocell fibers exhibited impact strengths of nearly 240 Jm- 1, whereas those reinforced with cotton fibers exhibited impact strengths of up to 773 Jm- 1. In addition to the aspect ratio, the higher crystallinity of cotton fibers compared to lyocell likely plays a role in the impact strength of the composite reinforced by the fibers. The SEM images showed that the porosity of the textile fibers allowed good bulk diffusion of the phenolic resin, which, in turn, led to both good adhesion of fiber to matrix and fewer microvoids at the interface...|$|E

50|$|Cavitation {{is common}} in epoxy resins and other craze {{resistant}} toughened polymers, and is prerequisite to shearing in <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> <b>testing.</b> During the deformation and fracture of a toughened polymer, cavitation of the strained rubber particles occurs in crazing-prone and non-crazing-prone plastics, including, ABS, PVC, nylon, high impact polystyrene, and CTBN toughened epoxies. Engineers use an energy-balance approach to model how particle size and rubber modulus factors influence material toughness. Both particle size and modulus show positive correlation with brittle-tough transition temperatures. They are both shown to affect the cavitation process occurring at the crack tip process zone early in deformation, preceding large-scale crazing and shear yielding.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} reports the formulation and characterization of polymer/date pits composites. Polymers {{used in this}} study were high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polystyrene (PS), while date pits used were locally called khlaas (K) and sekari (S), wastes of two types of date palm fruit grown in Saudi Arabia. Tensile <b>strength</b> (TS) and <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> (IIS) <b>tests</b> were conducted to assess the mechanical properties of the prepared composites. Thermal properties of the composites were measured and discussed in view of glass transition and melting temperatures, Tg and Tm, respectively, as well as the heat of fusion, which reflects the degree of crystallinity of the polymer/date pits composites. Generally, mechanical properties, i. e., TS and IIS, were reduced upon date pits incorporation in the composites. Results showed that IIS of HDPE/date pits composites drastically suffered from the addition of as low as 5 wt % of date pits. Addition of date pits regardless of the type, either S or K, tended to reduce Tg of the PS 100 /date pits composites and the heat of fusion of the HDPE/date pits composites at relatively higher date pits content, 410 wt%. The reduction in both degree of crystallinty represented by heat of fusion of the HDPE and mechanical properties of all composite systems {{used in this study}} at the high loading presence of date pits {{may be related to the}} anticipated coarse morphology of the composites evolved during the mixing of polymers, with date pits in the absence of an appropriate coupling agent system.

The first was based upon an organic quinacridone, whereas the second was based upon the inorganic calcium pimelate. Formulations containing various concentrations of nucleant were prepared using single screw extrusion and then characterized by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength,</b> and tensile <b>testing.</b> The quinacridone nucleating agent produced higher levels of β crystallinity and better improvement in strain to failure, whereas the calcium pimelate imparted greater improvement in <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> {{regardless of whether the}} PP was filled or unfilled.

40|$|Mechanical {{recycling}} of polymeric materials is a favorable technique resulting in {{economic and environmental}} benefits, {{especially in the case}} of polymers with a high production volume as the polypropylene copolymer (PP). However, recycling by reprocessing techniques can lead to thermal, mechanical or thermo-oxidative degradation that can affect the structure of the polymer and subsequently the material properties. PP filled with montmorillonite (MMT) or talc are widely produced and studied, however, its degradation reactions by reprocessing cycles are poorly studied so far. In this study, the effects of reprocessing cycles in the structure and in the properties of the PP/MMT and PP/Talc were evaluated. The samples were mixed with 5 % talc or MMT Cloisite C 15 A in a twin-screw extrusion. After extrusion, this filled material was submitted to five reprocessing cycles through an injection molding process. In order to evaluate the changes induced by reprocessing techniques, the samples were characterized by DSC, FT-IR, <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> and tensile <b>strength</b> <b>tests.</b> The study showed that Young modulus, elongation at brake and <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> were not affected by reprocessing cycles, except when using talc. In this case, the elongation at brake reduced until the fourth cycle, showing rigidity increase. The DSC results showed that melting and crystallization temperature were not affected. A comparison of FT-IR spectra of the reprocessed indicated that in both samples, between the first and the fifth cycle, no noticeable change has occurred. Thus, there is no evidence of thermo oxidative degradation.

40|$|Several design methodologies for {{automatically}} designing {{injection molds}} {{were developed to}} reduce warpage of injection molded parts. The part warpage was defined from warpage simulation, so as to represent various deformation behavior of the molded part. A concept for deliberately varying part wall thicknesses, within feasible dimensional tolerances to reduce the warpage, was introduced. The wall thicknesses, that minimized the effect of process fluctuation inherent to molding process, were obtained using the Taguchi method. The results of the example indicated that one can considerably reduce the warpage, and may also reduce material costs, by varying the wall thicknesses. A modified complex method was developed to optimize various domains in injection mold design. The modified complex method significantly reduced the part warpage with a moderate number of independent analysis evaluations for the proposed optimization of: part wall thicknesses; location and sizes of cooling channels; and process conditions. The runner system of multiple cavity molds was successfully balanced by adjusting the sizes of runners and gates using the iterative redesign method integrated with packing simulation in two case studies. A design technique for automatically determining the 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 gate location(s) of injection molds was presented {{in association with the}} three important parameters in gating design [...] the part warpage, the weld and meld line location at the critical areas, and the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> at a specific region of the part.

The samples werecured in an oven at 100 °C for 2 hours followed by post-curing at 160 °C for another 2 hours. Theeffects of epoxidised palm oil loadings in unsaturated polyester resin on the thermo-physicalproperties and <b>izod</b> <b>impact</b> <b>strength</b> were studied. The findings reveal that the storage modulusof unsaturated polyester resin/epoxidised palm oil bioresin decreased slightly by the addition ofepoxidised palm oil. At 20 wt-% of epoxidised palm oil loadings, the glass transition temperature(Tg) decreased by± 5 °C and the storage modulus decreased by about 20 % from the original unsaturated polyester resin...|$|R
