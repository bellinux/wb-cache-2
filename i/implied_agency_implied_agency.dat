This is more general approach than that of agency problem since we move our focus from informational asymmetry to institutional one. Traditional <b>agency</b> problem <b>implies</b> <b>agency</b> costs and, hence, contributes to lowering of company value. In our setting both positive and negative effects are possible. We use a new interpretation of the Mayers’ model, which is an extension of CAPM where nonmarketable assets are taken into account. We treat company’s assets, both created and destroyed by its insiders in their activity as nonmarketable assets. There are few empirical studies along similar lines because of obvious diffi culties in data identifi cation. Nevertheless it is possible to show the usefulness of the model at the theoretical level. A number of new settings, which need their further development, have been formulated. Some conclusions concerning strategic investment decisions, including diversifi cation, have been derived.

40|$|Agency theory {{argues that}} {{companies}} need to structure their top management pay {{so as to}} attract, retain, motivate, and reward senior executives. It is implicit in this literature that managers should be rewarded for performance and that company size {{should not be a}} significant determinant of compensation. Empirical evidence in many countries has concluded, however, that size is a major determinant of management remuneration and the pay-for-performance link is very weak. This study examines the determinants of senior executives 2 ̆ 7 remuneration and bonus payments in Hong Kong companies using recently available data. We examine both the level of pay and changes in pay. Corporate size is found to be a major explanator of remuneration levels and of changes in the pay of the CEO and executive directors. Accounting profitability is also a significant explanator of compensation. Performance, as measured by stock returns, has little or no statistically significant relationship with pay; in fact, some of the results show negative relationships. Some share ownership characteristics have influences on the levels of remuneration. In particular, share ownership by directors and share ownership by institutional investors moderate the compensation levels. In contrast, corporate governance variables have little association with change in pay. Overall, the results <b>imply</b> <b>agency</b> arguments that advocate pay-for-performance compensation schemes are not major factors in setting top management remuneration in Hong Kong...|$|R

40|$|How is {{the agency}} of women best conceptualised in highly coercive settings? We explore this {{in the context of}} {{international}} efforts to reduce intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in heterosexual relationships. Articles critique the tendency to think of women’s agency and programme endpoints in terms of individual actions, such as reporting violent men or leaving violent relationships, whilst neglecting the interlocking social, economic and cultural contexts that make such actions unlikely or impossible. Three themes cut across the articles. (1) Unhelpful understandings of gender and power implicit in commonly used ‘men-women’ and ‘victim-agent’ binaries obscure multi-faceted and hidden forms of women’s agency, and the complexity of agency-violence intersections. (2) This neglect of complexity results in a poor fit between policy and interventions to reduce IPV, and women’s lives. (3) Such neglect also obscures the multiplicities of women’s agency, including the competing challenges they juggle alongside IPV, differing levels of response, and the temporality of agency. We outline a notion of ‘distributed agency’ as a multi-level, incremental and non-linear process distributed across time, space and social networks, and across a continuum of action ranging from survival to resistance.

40|$|Objective: The {{service type}} {{offered by a}} home care agency {{contracted}} by the Queensland government {{is not based on}} the qualifications of the worker providing the service, but the service itself. This allows agencies to substitute certain levels and categories of labour in order to provide a service to meet their contract obligations. This study investigated evidence of labour substitution between nursing and allied health services. Method: Correlation and regression analysis was performed on the data collected from 218 clients of a branch of a community-based service agency operating nationally in Brisbane, Australia, during April, May and June 2005. Results: The results of the regression analysis revealed that when either allied health or nursing time rose by 10 %, all else held constant, it was predicted that the other would fall by 4 %. The subcategories, registered/enrolled nursing and physiotherapy, appeared to drive the inverse relationship between nursing and allied health service time. Registered/enrolled nursing service time was more sensitive to changes in physiotherapy {{rather than the other way}} around. Conclusions: The higher labour turnover among allied health staff compared with the nursing staff reported by the <b>agency</b> <b>implies</b> a substitution of labour between the two professions to ensure that the needs of clients are met.
