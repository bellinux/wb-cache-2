5|$|T2 Group {{lasted until}} June 2004 when Tierney {{announced}} it was being bought by credit card company Advanta and that Tierney and most of T2's management would be hired by Advanta. Tierney became vice chairman of Advanta, but in February 2005, Advanta announced Tierney was no longer serving as vice-chairman. The company gave no <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why Tierney lost the position and Tierney's employment with the company ended the next month.|$|E
5|$|The operas listed {{cover all}} {{important}} genres, and include all operas regularly performed today, from seventeenth-century works by Monteverdi, Cavalli, and Purcell to late twentieth-century operas by Messiaen, Berio, Glass, Adams, Birtwistle, and Weir. The brief accompanying notes offer an <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why each opera {{has been considered}} important. For an introduction to operatic history, see Opera. The organisation of the list is by year of first performance, or, if this was long after the composer's death, approximate date of composition.|$|E

5|$|The reserve covers four woods: Park Wood, Mad Bess Wood and Copse Wood in Ruislip, with Bayhurst Wood in Harefield. Poor's Field and Tartleton's Lake in Ruislip {{are also}} part of the reserve. There is no {{definitive}} <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why Mad Bess Wood received its name, although one theory is that it was named after a female landowner who patrolled the wood looking for poachers.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{then took}} a {{petition}} to the General Assembly, asking for a recount. The assembly took up the matter on April 20, 1873 and voted 63 to 9 not to allow Brooks to contest the election. This did not deter Brooks, and he applied to the Arkansas Supreme Court for a writ of quo warranto, and was again denied. They also ruled that state courts had no jurisdiction in the matter, and dismissed the case. They gave a lengthy <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why the General Assembly should decide contested gubernatorial elections in Joint Session, since they are the directly elected representatives of the people.|$|E
5|$|Father McCue (Arnie Walters) {{contacts}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and asks}} for her help in the case. Scully visits the Kernofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. Due to her severe spinal deformities, there is no <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how Dara {{walked out of the}} house. Lance is convinced that it was the Devil that stood over her in the street. Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers. Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down by God, as if she was a mistake.|$|E

5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
5|$|Other images, such as Thalaba {{reclaiming}} his father's magic sword, are {{symbols that}} effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, these events represent the {{minority of the}} plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how it works {{and there is no}} moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, the poem is able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing this takes away from their meaning and effect. In terms of religious imagery, Islam within the poem is more similar to Zoroastrian thought and morality. Other religious images lose their power as Southey removes any mystical aspects of them, including Simorgh being stripped of it being a symbol of harmony with life. In terms of the divine, there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinction}} must be {{made between}} penal substitution (Christ punished instead of us) and substitutionary atonement (Christ suffers for us). Both affirm the substitutionary and vicarious nature of the atonement, but penal substitution offers a specific <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> what the suffering is for: punishment.|$|E

25|$|The next work he {{produced}} was in 1764 on the libration of the Moon, and an <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why the same face was always {{turned to the}} earth, a problem which he treated by the aid of virtual work.

25|$|Mark Pieth, {{director}} of anti-fraud section at the OECD, {{on behalf of}} the United States, Japan, France, Sweden, Switzerland and Greece, addressed a formal complaint letter before Christmas 2006 to the Foreign Office, seeking <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why the investigation had been discontinued. Transparency International and Labour MP Roger Berry, chairman of the Commons Quadripartite Committee, urged the government to reopen the corruption investigation.|$|E
50|$|Professor Wurzle {{provides}} somewhat misguided {{explanations and}} histories for events as they arise. The youngest character, Dooly, {{is given to}} wild fantasies and stories. This frequently leaves the inexperienced adventurer, cheesemaker Jonathan Bing, with competing and implausible <b>explanations</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> what is actually going on.|$|R
50|$|There are differing <b>explanations</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> {{why this}} act was instituted, {{one of which}} is that the average Independent Americans {{regarded}} Indians’ control of land and other natural resources in parts around the country as a serious potential threat towards their expansionary and economic goals.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are various}} <b>explanations</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> {{the origin of}} the name Caplan, including: a {{corruption}} of capelin or Cape Land; from the surname of a certain John Kaplan, an Indian who long camped at this location; or from the Mi'kmaq word gaplanjetig (meaning [...] "capelin").|$|R
25|$|Excavations by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago in 1960 {{uncovered}} the Byzantine church (to {{the north of}} the compound). Questions were repeatedly raised about the identification of the structure to the south as a synagogue within a Roman era fort with attached bathhouse. Ronny Reich, a prominent Israeli archaeologist, disproved that thesis in 1993, without offering an alternate <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> its identity.|$|E
25|$|When {{the scope}} of the physics is widened to include gravity, the {{interpretation}} of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently no compelling <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why it should not result in a cosmological constant that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed. However, since we do not yet have any fully coherent quantum theory of gravity, there is likewise no compelling reason as to why it should.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, {{excavations}} of Neferefre's pyramid {{have yielded}} his mummy, {{which showed that}} he was 18 to 20 {{years old at the}} death of Neferirkare. Consequently, as the previous king's eldest son, in his late teens to early twenties, Neferefre was in optimal position to ascend the throne. Positing that Shepseskare reigned between Neferefre and his father would thus require an <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why and how Shepseskare's claim to the throne could have been stronger than Neferefre's.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{baseline}} assumptions when determining {{if an individual}} has Mobitz I heart block is that the atrial rhythm has to be regular. If the atrial rhythm is not regular, there could be alternative <b>explanations</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why certain P waves do not conduct to the ventricles.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>explanations</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how the belting voice quality is produced. Under a scope, the vocal folds visibly shorten and thicken, and they {{undulate}} along {{more of their}} vertical surface area than in head register when a smaller segment of their edge must undulate to produce sound.|$|R
50|$|There {{appears to}} be some {{collusion}} between Nina and Nani. They clearly know each other quite well but down-play this to Jack.

25|$|Bittaker had {{a similar}} <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the double murder of Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam: he claimed Gilliam {{accepted}} an offer of money for sex and posing for pictures, {{and that he had}} last seen the girls alone with Norris in his GMC van. With regards to the murder of Shirley Ledford, he claimed she had agreed to theatrically scream for the tape recorder, and that she was not tortured in his presence, but had been left alone with Norris.|$|E
25|$|However, one {{possible}} <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why Recto {{was never able}} to capture full national acceptance was because he dared to strongly oppose the national security interests of the United States in the Philippines, as when he campaigned against the US military bases in his country. During the 1957 presidential campaign, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) conducted black propaganda operations to ensure his defeat, including the distribution of condoms with holes in them and marked with `Courtesy of Claro M. Recto' on the labels.|$|E
25|$|In 743 Domnall {{defeated}} {{and killed}} Áed Allán {{and a number}} of kings of the Airgíalla, perhaps at Mag Sered near Kells, although some annals place the battle in modern County Longford, either location suggesting that Áed was the aggressor. The annals offer no <b>explanation</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why the two were at war, but {{it has been suggested that}} Áed's expansion into the lands of the Conailli Muirthemne (in modern County Louth) or the killing of Conaing mac Amalgado, king of Brega, supposedly strangled by Áed in 742, may have been connected to Domnall's return.|$|E
