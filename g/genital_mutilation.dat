5|$|Female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> (FGM), {{also known}} as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the {{external}} female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E

The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health. Female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> (FGM), while not widespread, is practiced among some populations; according to a 2013 UNICEF report, 1% of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM.

40|$|A case of <b>genital</b> self <b>mutilation</b> in {{schizophrenia}} {{is described}} and its psychopathology discussed. The act of deliberate self <b>mutilation</b> of the <b>genitals</b> in men {{is the most}} bizarre presentation encountered in surgical practice. Self mutilating injuries hold a rather morbid attraction for the lay public and medical men alike. To the psychiatrists they offer a fascinating glimpse into unconscious mechanisms. The vast volume of published literature on this subject bears ample testimony to the keen interest aroused by these cases (D'Netto & Goel, 1976). The various modes of self mutilation viz., wrist cutting, self applied constricting band, repetitive hangings, "bondage " (being bound and rendered helpless), trichotillomania and dermatitis artefacta are well known. <b>Genital</b> self <b>mutilation</b> is a more severe and rarer phenomenon.

5|$|Until the 1980s FGM {{was widely}} known in English as female circumcision, {{implying}} an equivalence in severity with male circumcision. From 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council {{referred to it}} as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary. References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> in the title of a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E
5|$|In his absence, {{the issue}} of female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilation</b> (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, {{supported}} the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would {{be a threat to}} the structure and customs of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, with several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of the American nun, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta soon attended a meeting with church representatives. There, he expressed the view that although he personally opposed FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through education of its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later complained about what he described as Kenyatta's dishonesty during the debate, expelling him from the church. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.|$|E
40|$|Many {{women in}} the world are still {{undergoing}} female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilations</b> (FGMs) even if in almost all the countries, the practice of FGM is illegal. The increase of immigration, particularly from African Countries, to Europe, and Italy too, led to consider this phenomenon with particular attention and skill. All the operators in health services need to know the different types of FGMs and the related complications and the psychological and sexual sequels. Urological complications, in particular, are not rare and the changing anatomy of the external genital apparatus can also make the catheter insertion sometimes difficult. This review analyzes the epidemiology of FGMs, the reasons why the practice is still made, the complications, the ethical, and the principal legal aspects of this practise that must be hopefully early banned...|$|R

5000|$|Femicide in Africa {{occurs in}} many {{different}} forms, including intimate partner femicide, mass femicide due to AIDS, honor killings and mass femicide due to female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilations.</b> The continent varies in cultural practices greatly and the manifestations of femicide differ greatly depending on the country. Northern African countries are predominantly Islamic in belief, such as Algeria. In Algeria, {{as well as other}} African Islamist countries, women are regulated to wearing head covering or hijabs, and to behave in specific ways that are considered appropriate for women, such as not working, not divorcing, not travelling without a male companion and more [...] Women are experiencing a mass femicide triggered by the way they are dressed [...] One faction of fundamentalist men kill women who do not wear the traditional hijab, while other men who are against the Islamist government kill women who do wear the hijab [...] In this sense, author Rod Kilbeck explains that women become a commodity in the fight between these two factions.|$|R

40|$|Feminist postcolonial authors criticised the {{tendency}} of mainstream western feminism to represent 'third world' women as necessarily less emancipated than western women and to describe their cultural practices in an othering way, without holding their own culture up to the same scrutiny. From this idea stems a paternalistic and patronising attitude that locates western women in a “position to liberate their less fortunate sisters, {{especially those in the}} 'Third World'”. (hooks, 2000 : 45). In light of these reflections, this article investigates to what extent selected women’s intercultural associations in Italy have been able to counter dominant discourses that see migrant women as necessarily needy and deprived or as a sign of cultural difference. The research confronts the associations' mission statements with the practices and relationships that emerged from the interviews. It focuses first on power sharing within the associations and the relevance of patronizing attitudes on the part of Italian-born women. Secondly the article explores how associations addressed the notion of cultural difference by focusing on the specific issues of Islamic veiling practices and female <b>genital</b> <b>mutilations.</b> Finally it investigates the possible value of cross-cultural comparisons on practices detrimental to women in the promotion of intercultural feminist practice...|$|R

Four hundred nine (409) females aged from 1 to 12 years and their mothers entered the study after their consent. The results were that 60 / 409 patients (15 %) were cut. The majority of the young females came from Muslim families (97 %); the earlier age at FGM procedure in patients is less than 5 years: 87 %. Amongst 409 mothers, 250 women underwent FGM which had other daughters cut. Women were mainly involved in the FGM and their motivations were virginity, chastity, body cleanliness, and fear of clitoris similar to penis. Only WHO types I and II were met. If there were no incidental events occurred at the time of the procedure, the obstetrical future of these young females would be compromised.
