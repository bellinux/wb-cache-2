However, the available data have been limited to small family groups which do not allow {{the definition of the}} degree of penetrance of the disease. The present study describes a large family with a high frequency of supravalvular {{aortic stenosis}} including five generations and 80 subjects, the largest family group with this disease studied so far. The study was carried out prospectively in 66 subjects (clinical examination, <b>ECG,</b> <b>M</b> mode and two dimensional echocardiography). In 14 subjects available data were examined retrospectively. In 10 patients cardiac catheterisation was performed (prospective study in eight). The disease was present in 36 (45 %) of the 80 subjects investigated, on the basis of clinical, echocardiographic, and haemodynamic (when available) criteria. The disease was found to be severe in eight cases (22 %), moderate in six cases (17 %), mild in 13 (36 %), and undefined in eight (22 %) patients. In one case (3 %), multiple pulmonary stenoses were noted in the absence of supravalvular aortic stenosis. Genetic analysis of these data shows, for the first time, the degree of penetrance of the supravalvular aortic stenosis trait (K = 0. 86) and confirms that it is transmitted with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity...|$|E

40|$|Right {{ventricular}} {{myocardial infarction}} (RVMI) predominantly a complication of inferior wall myocardial infarction {{is a distinct}} clinical entity in which major hemodynamic disturbance may occur. Bedside hemodynamic measurement, electrocardiography, gated blood pool radionuclide angiography and echocardiography are used to identify right ventricular involvement in setting of inferior wall infarction. RVMI as assessed by various diagnostic methods accompanies 30 to 50 % of inferior wall infarction. We studied 37 consecutive patients of acute inferior wall infarction (by non invasive method) to determine echocardiographic evidence of RVMI and compared its sensitivity to electrocardiography and clinical criteria. On echocardiography 12 out of 37 patients (32 %) had right ventricular involvement. Kussmaul’s signs was present in 27 % of the patients and it had sensitivity of 50 %, specificity of 88 % and predictive accuracy of 70 %. Right sided precordial leads (V 3 R – V 4 R) on electrocardiography showed evidence of RVMI in 30 % of patients with sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of 67 %, 88 % and 73 % respectively.

40|$|This years {{challenge}} {{addresses the}} question {{if it is}} possible to measure the QT interval by fully automated methods. For this task we implemented an algorithm which (1) performs beat detection, measures wave boundaries on a beat-to-beat basis and (2) selects a representative beat whose QT interval is used. To get the positions of the wave boundaries, the algorithm searches for peaks in the 1 st derivative of bandpass filtered ECG signals using thresholds which are adapted to the amplitudes in the segments of interest. When the peaks associated with the QRS complex and the T wave are found, the beginning of the QRS complex {{and the end of the}} T wave are assessed using the ”Philips Diagnostic ECG Interval Measurement ” method [1]. For the selection of the representative beat, a noise level for each single beat was calculated by determining the standard deviation of the <b>ECG</b> 30 <b>ms</b> before the onset of the QRS complex and 30 ms after the end to the T wave.

One hundred (n= 100) SH does were treated with 30 mg fluorogestone acetate (FGA) sponge for 14 days. At the end progestagen treatment, does that retained the intravaginal pessary were allocated into two groups; A: FGA & eCG (n= 42) and B: FGA (n= 41).

The difference in temporal pattern of bradycardia, in the dives and in the breath holds by the divers, may have been due to face immersion in cold water, chest compression, and/or redistribution of blood into the chest with concomitant stimulation of cardiac and other mechanoreceptors. Arrhythmias, mostly supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes, were observed coincidently with the lowest heart rates, presumably reflecting a high vagal tone.

40|$|In {{temperate}} zones most breeds {{of goats}} are anestrous and anovulatory during spring and summer, but start cycling as day length decreases during the fall. In tropical zones, indigenous goats, {{such as the}} Pygmy and the Nigerian Dwarf, tend to cycle throughout the year.

In this study, Pygmy and Nigerian Dwarf goats became more seasonal in Quebec. The majority of the animals were cycling during December and February, but a significant proportion exhibited anestrus during October, May, and June. Several hormones, including prostaglandins (PG), progestagens, and gonadotropins (eCG, FSH, GnRH, hCG), have been used for the control and synchronization of estrus and ovulation in goats, but limited research has been conducted with dwarf breeds. In this study, dwarf goats were synchronized in November, March, and July with a 10 -day MAP sponge coupled with 125 mug cloprostenol i. m. 48 h before sponge removal and 300 IU <b>eCG</b> i. <b>m.</b> at sponge removal.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} {{clinical}} {{value of the}} signal averaged P wave (SAPW) and to compare it with the standard electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and clinical assessment for the prediction of atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass grafting (CABG). DESIGN: Prospective validation cohort study. SETTING: Regional cardiothoracic centre. PATIENTS: 201 unselected patients undergoing first elective CABG were recruited over six months. Patients requiring concomitant valve surgery were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age, sex, cardiothoracic ratio, and cardioactive drugs were noted. P wave specific SAPW recordings, <b>ECG,</b> and <b>M</b> mode echocardiograms from which left atrial diameter was measured were performed within 24 hours of surgery. Filtered P wave duration (SAPWD), spatial velocity, and energy were calculated from the SAPW. From the ECG, lead II P wave duration, P terminal force in lead V 1, total P wave duration, and isoelectric interval were measured. Patients had Holter monitoring for 48 hours postoperatively and daily ECGs until discharge. RESULTS: Two patients died (1 %) and 10 were unsuitable for analysis (5 %). Of the remaining 189, 51 (27 %) had atrial fibrillation (AF) lasting > 1 hour at a mean of 2 (0. 5 to 7) days after CABG. Of the variables examined, only SAPWD (AF group 148 (SD 12), v 142 (14) ms, P = 0. 008) and male sex (AF group 96 %, v 78 %, P 141 ms predicted atrial fibrillation with positive and negative predictive accuracies of 34 % and 83 %. Logistic regression analysis identified both male sex and SAPWD as significant independent predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Signal averaged P wave duration was a better predictor of atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass grafting than standard electrocardiographic or echocardiographic criteria. The predictive value of this test is such that {{it is likely to}} be useful in the design of prospective trials of prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment but is of limited use using current techniques in the clinical management of individual patients...|$|R

The cardiac mortality at 4 months was 5. 7 % (15 patients). Late ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation occurred in 2. 3 % (6 patients). The relative risk (RR) for cardiac death or late events was 5. 14 with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 1. 2 to 22. 0 when no thrombolytic therapy was used.

40|$|Background: Stroke {{is often}} unexplained in younger adults, {{although}} it {{is often associated with}} a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The reason for the association is not fully explained, and mechanisms other than paradoxical embolism may be involved. Young stroke patients with PFO have more atrial vulnerability than those without PFO. It is plausible that stretching of the interatrial septum may disrupt the interatrial conduction pathways causing interatrial block (IAB). IAB is associated with atrial fibrillation, dysfunctional left atria and stroke. Methods: Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics of prospectively recruited young patients (≤ 55 years of age) with unexplained stroke (TOAST and A-S-C-O) were compared with control data. All stroke cases underwent bubble contrast transthoracic and transoesophageal echography. IAB was defined as a P-wave duration of ≧ 110 <b>ms.</b> <b>ECG</b> data were converted to electronic format and analysed in a blind manner. Results: Fifty-five patients and 23 datasets were analysed. Patients with unexplained stroke had longer P-wave duration (p = 0. 013) and a greater prevalence of IAB (p = 0. 02) than healthy controls. Case status was an independent predictor of P-wave duration in a significant multivariate model. There was {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of cases with a PFO with IAB compared with cases without PFO and with controls (p = 0. 005). Conclusions: Young patients with unexplained stroke, particularly those with PFO, exhibit abnormal atrial electrical characteristics suggesting atrial arrhythmia or atrial dysfunction as a possible mechanism of stroke...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} a once-used progesterone (P 4) intravaginal device (PRID) associated with four different shortened P 4 -based estrus synchronization (ES) protocols on estrous response (ER) and pregnancy per AI (P/AI) in cyclic and acyclic lactating dairy cows. Cows (n= 465) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the following protocols: 1) 2 PGG, cows were given a PRID-Delta and 100 μg GnRH i. m. at PRID insertion (day 0). The PRID was left for 5 d, and 25 mg of dinoprost (PGF 2 α) i. m. given twice at PRID removal and 24 h later; 2) 2 PGGe, same treatments as 2 PGG plus 500 IU of <b>eCG</b> i. <b>m.</b> at PRID removal; 3) 2 PGe, same treatments as 2 PGGe, except GnRH was not given at PRID insertion; 4) PGe, same treatments as 2 PGe, except PGF was only given at PRID removal. A total of 258 cows received a new PRID-Delta containing 1. 55 g of P 4, whereas 207 cows received a once-used PRID. Estrus was determined from P 4 device removal until 96 h after using an automated heat detection system. Cows in estrus were given a second GnRH at AI and those without signs of estrus by 96 h after PRID removal were given GnRH and timed-AI (TA I). All inseminations were performed by one technician with commercially available frozen-thawed semen. Ultrasonography was performed at initiation of protocol and 28 - 34 days post AI to determine cyclicity and pregnancy status, respectively. Cows receiving once-used P 4 devices had greater ER than cows receiving a new device (59. 9 vs. 50. 0; P= 0. 029), but P/AI did not differ between P 4 devices, respectively (P> 0. 1; 40. 6 vs 40. 7 %). Cyclic cows were less likely to display estrus than acyclic cows by a factor of 0. 66 (P= 0. 036). Cows subjected to the 2 PGe (2. 41; P< 0. 01) protocol were more likely to display estrus than cows subjected to the 2 PGG, whereas cows subjected to the PGe protocol did not differ (0. 94; P= 0. 8) from those in the 2 PGG group. Despite differences in ER, neither cyclicity nor estrus synchronization protocol affected P/AI (overall 40. 6 %). In summary, cyclic cows, those given a new P 4 device and those subjected to either 2 PGG or PGe protocol had reduced ER. However, all the factors examined had no significant effect on P/AI. All the estrus synchronization protocols resulted in acceptable fertility...|$|R
40|$|Previous ECG {{studies have}} shown {{gender-related}} differences of normal ventricular repolarization (VR) parameters. Aim {{of this study was}} to evaluate VR of healthy volunteers (HV) with unshielded magnetocardiographic mapping (MCG), in comparison with 12 -lead ECG. Methods: 58 HV, 32 males (M), age 37. 3 ± 12. 9 and 26 females (F), age 33 ± 9. 9, with normal ECG, were investigated at rest. A 36 -channel system (sensitivity: 20 fT/Hz½) was used to record the MCG from the anterior chest wall. To assess VR, heart rate corrected (HRc) QTend, JTpeak, JTend and Tpeak-Tend intervals, were measured from both ECG and MCG. Moreover ST-integral and Tpeak magnetic field (MF) orientation (α), ST-dynamics and ST-stability were also calculated with MCG. To evaluate age-dependence of all parameters, pts were also divided in two age groups (> and < 35 years). Results: In F, both ECG and MCG HRc QTend, JTpeak, JTend were significantly longer than in M (p< 0. 002), with average <b>ECG</b> values 25 <b>ms</b> longer than MCG ones. Tpeak-Tend did not differ significantly. MCG ST angle was normal in all but 3 subjects and T angle in all, without significant differences between M and F. MCG ST-dynamics and ST-stability parameters were longer in F than in M (p< 0. 05). All parameters did not vary significantly between the two age groups. Conclusion: This study confirms that ECG parameters of VR are normally longer in healthy F as compared to M. Moreover it provides the first demonstration that similar differences can be measured with MCG, although absolute values are shorter in MCG. Other MCG parameters, such as MF-orientation, ST-dynamics and ST-stability, provide additional discrimination between M and F...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the efficacy of the synchronization of oestrus using short- and long-term progestagen treatments in Hair goats at the onset of the breeding season, and to evaluate the effect of the exogenous GnRH administration immediately prior to short-term progestagen treatment on the reproductive performance. A total of 75 Hair goats, aged 2. 5 - 5 years-old were used in this experiment. Goats were divided equally into three groups (n= 25 per group). Animals in LT-FGA (long-term progestagen treatment), ST-FGA (short-term progestagen treatment) and Gn-ST-FGA (GnRH-short-term progestagen treatment) groups received an intravaginal sponge (day 0) containing 30 mg fluorogestone acetate (FGA) for 14, 8 and 8 days, respectively, plus 75 μg cloprostenol i. m. 24 h before sponge removal and 400 I. U. equine chorionic gonadotrophin (<b>eCG)</b> i. <b>m.</b> at the time of sponge removal. In addition, the goats in the Gn-ST-FGA group received 10. 5 μg busereline acetate i. m. at the time of sponge insertion (day 0). Oestrus response for all treatment groups was 100 %. The mean interval from sponge removal and the onset of oestrus for the LT-FGA, ST-FGA and Gn-ST-FGA groups was 28. 0 ± 1. 0 h, 28. 83 ± 1. 1 h and 33. 1 ± 2. 0 h, respectively. No significant difference in onset of oestrus among groups was recorded. The pregnancy rate, kidding rate, multiple kidding rates and litter size were 72. 0, 61. 1, 45. 5 % and 1. 6 in the LT-FGA, 70. 8, 76. 5, 69. 2 % and 1. 8 in the ST-FGA and 58. 3, 78. 6, 63. 6 % and 1. 6 in the Gn-ST-FGA groups, respectively. The pregnancy rates were similar in the LT-FGA (72. 0 %) and ST-FGA (70. 8 %). However, the kidding rate, multiple kidding rates and litter size were numerically higher in the ST-FGA (76. 5 %, 69. 2 % and 1. 8, respectively) group than in the LT-FGA (61. 1 %, 45. 5 % and 1. 6, respectively) group. Although not statistically different, pregnancy rate and litter size was lower in the Gn-ST-FGA group (58. 3 % and 1. 6, respectively) compared with the ST-FGA (70. 8 % and 1. 8, respectively). In conclusion, it can be said that oestrus synhcronization with long-term progestagen treatment (14 d-FGA- PGF 2 α- eCG) could be replaced with short-term progestagen treatment (8 d-FGA-PGF 2 α- eCG) without a reduction in oestrus rate and fertility parameters in lactating goats at the beginning of breeding season. However, the use of GnRH prior to short-term progestagen treatment (8 d-FGAPGF 2 α- eCG) do not have a positive effect on fertility parameters in goats...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of currently used stress tests {{for the detection of}} coronary artery disease (CAD) in a series of female hypertensive patients. We performed exercise electrocardiography (<b>ECG),</b> technetium- 99 <b>m</b> sestamibi (MIBI) single photon emission computed tomography, dobutamine and dipyridamole echocardiography, and coronary angiography in 76 hypertensive women. Of the 76 study patients, 31 (41 %) had significant CAD. The sensitivity of exercise ECG (81 %), MIBI scanning (90 %), and dobutamine echocardiography (87 %) was greater than that of dipyridamole echocardiography (61 %). This finding resulted from the lower sensitivity of dipyridamole echocardiography in the detection of single-vessel CAD (47 % vs 76 %, 88 %, and 82 % for the other 3 methods). In contrast, the sensitivity of the 4 tests was similar in the detection of multivessel CAD. The specificity of exercise ECG (56 %) and MIBI scanning (53 %) was less than that of dobutamine (82 %, both p < 0. 01) and dipyridamole (91 %, both p < 0. 001) echocardiography. This finding related to the lower specificity of exercise ECG in patients with either left ventricular hypertrophy or ST-T abnormalities at rest compared to the specificity in patients without these disorders (33 % vs 89 %, p < 0. 01). A lower MIBI scan specificity was found only in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (31 % vs 66 %, p < 0. 05). The overall accuracy of dobutamine echocardiography reached 84 % compared to exercise ECG (66 %, p < 0. 01), MIBI scan (68 %, p < 0. 05), and dipyridamole echocardiography (79 %, p < 0. 05). In conclusion, dobutamine echocardiography yielded satisfactory diagnostic accuracy for identifying CAD in hypertensive women. Although dipyridamole echocardiography had the greatest specificity, it might be limited in detecting mild CAD. Both exercise ECG and MIBI scanning had fare sensitivity; however, our findings limit the usefulness of these 2 tests in unselected patients. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Electrocardiographic (ECG) {{changes have}} never been {{reported}} in canine babesiosis. Based on the metabolic, electrolyte, and myocardial alterations described for the disease, such changes are to be expected. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe ECG changes in canine babesiosis, and to correlate those changes to clinical severity, outcome and cardiac histopathological changes. Four groups of dogs with babesiosis were studied: mild to moderate anaemia (n= 40), severe anaemia (n= 35), concurrent immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (n= 18) and complicated (n= 28). Lead II ECG was recorded at admission for 1 minute in all dogs, and repeated after 24 hours in admitted dogs (groups II – IV). Six lead ECG was recorded in 88 dogs. Full necropsy was performed between 30 - 60 minutes after death on 16 dogs (5 died on arrival, 11 had ECG recording). Gross cardiac pathology was recorded and histopathology of myocardial sections from ventricles, atria, apex and interventricular septa was evaluated, using a scoring system for haemorrhages, necrosis, inflammatory infiltrate and fibrin microthrombi. The following ECG changes were recorded: sinoatrial (7 %) and atrioventricular blocks (4 %), ventricular premature complexes (7 %), low R-amplitude (23 %), prominent Q (33 %), axis deviations (40 %), prolonged QRS (32 %), ST depression and coving (28 %), large T (42 %), and notched R (28 %). Differences between groups were minor and inconsistent. Gross pathological changes were pericardial effusion (25 %) and subepicardial (56 %) and subendocardial haemorrhages (63 %). Histological changes were haemorrhages (69 %), necrosis (50 %), inflammation (63 %) and fibrin microthrombi (75 %). The only correlation between pathology and ECG was low R-amplitude and pericardial effusion. There was a significantly higher prevalence of sinus bradycardia and irregular sinus rhythm in the non-survivors. Both ECG and pathological changes were non-specific, but there were similarities to the pattern of changes that have been described for myocarditis and myocardial ischaemia. Antiarrhythmic treatment was only required in 1 dog. Thus, the clinical application of the ECG changes found in this study was limited. It was concluded that the heart suffers from the same pathological processes described in other organs in canine babesiosis, namely inflammation and hypoxia. Cardiovascular management, if necessary, should be based on functional monitoring rather than <b>ECG.</b> Dissertation (MMedVet (<b>Med))</b> [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.
