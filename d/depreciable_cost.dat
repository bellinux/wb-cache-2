50|$|Sum-of-years-digits is a {{depreciation}} method {{that results in}} a more accelerated write-off than the straight line method, and typically also more accelerated than the declining balance method. Under this method the annual depreciation is determined by multiplying the <b>depreciable</b> <b>cost</b> by a schedule of fractions.|$|E
50|$|The {{composite}} {{method is}} applied to a collection of assets that are not similar, and have different service lives. For example, computers and printers are not similar, but both {{are part of the}} office equipment. Depreciation on all assets is determined by using the straight-line-depreciation method.Composite life equals the total <b>depreciable</b> <b>cost</b> divided by the total depreciation per year.$5,900 / $1,300 = 4.5 years.|$|E
50|$|Depreciation: The <b>depreciable</b> amount (<b>cost</b> less {{residual}} value) {{should be}} allocated on a systematic basis over the asset's useful life. That is, the mark-down in {{value of the}} asset should be recognised as an expense in the income statement every accounting period throughout the asset's useful life. The useful life of the asset is determined by taking into account expected usage, physical wear and tear, technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes in production or market demand and legal limits on its use. In addition, the depreciation in each accounting period of the asset's useful life should reflect the pattern which the asset's economic benefits {{are expected to be}} consumed by the entity.|$|R
40|$|The cost of bond {{covenants}} {{restricting the}} dispositions of assets are {{examined in this}} study. Using an option pricing framework, it is shown {{that the cost of}} compliance could be high if restrictions are placed on the sale of common stock holdings. Similar results can be obtained by using a simple cash flow approach when calculating the effect on restrictions on the sale of <b>depreciable</b> assets. These <b>costs</b> somewhat offset the tax advantages of debt. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1997. ...|$|R

Cellular Manufacturing includes cell foramtion, machine layout and cellular layout. Most researchers are foucing on the three contents respectively in their previous research. But these three contents are co-relation and the change in one content will affect the others and the result. So the integration mathmatical model of the cell formation, machine layout and cellular layout is put forward in this paper to abtain the minmum of material movement handling <b>cost</b> and machine <b>depreciable</b> and repair <b>cost.</b> At last this paper applies the model to machining workshop of XXX Company and gains a good effection...|$|R
