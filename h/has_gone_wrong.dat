Sonya wonders if it will be weird using stand-ins on such an important day, but Toadie assures her {{that it will be}} fine.

Toadie asks Paul how they can have the reception there and Paul tells them that he has arranged a marquee for them in the hotel's grounds. He will also give them the use of a suite for the day, as a gesture of good will. After Paul leaves, Sonya tries to calm Toadie down.|$|E
