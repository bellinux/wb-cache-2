5|$|Non-SI units {{associated}} with the CGS and the CGS-Gaussian system of units (Table 9). This table catalogues a number of units of measure based on the CGS system and dating from the nineteenth century. They appear frequently in the literature, but their continued use is <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> the CGPM.|$|E
5|$|Robert was not <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> this naval defeat, {{and began}} his siege of Dyrrhachium. In {{command of the}} {{garrison}} at Dyrrhachium was the experienced general George Palaiologos, sent by Alexios with orders to hold out at all costs while Alexios himself mustered an army to relieve the city.|$|E
5|$|She also {{begins a}} brief power {{struggle}} with freshman Jenny Humphrey. After she unites with Chuck and Nate {{in order to}} save Serena from the scheming Georgina Sparks, Chuck realizes that his feelings for Blair are real and suggests that they spend the summer together in Tuscany. However, he is <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> his father at the last minute, and stands Blair up.|$|E

50|$|Other early members {{included}} the psychologists James Mark Baldwin, Joseph Jastrow, and Christine Ladd-Franklin. Initial research findings were <b>discouraging.</b> <b>By</b> 1890, members such as Baldwin, Hall, Jastrow and Ladd-Franklin had {{resigned from the}} society. Hall and Jastrow became outspoken critics of parapsychology. Morton Prince and James Jackson Putnam left the ASPR in 1892 to form the American Psychological Association.|$|R
50|$|Offspring {{paternity}} {{is unknown}} {{and this can}} be beneficial in encouraging parental care and <b>discouraging</b> infanticide <b>by</b> males.|$|R
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Lamiaceae can spread {{unchecked}} and become invasive plants. Planting of P.atriplicifolia near wild lands has been <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> some gardening guides {{out of concern for}} its potential to spread, but it is not considered invasive, and has been suggested as a substitute for purple loosestrife for this reason.|$|E
5|$|The {{third of}} Woodrow and Eunice Delaney's eight children, Delaney {{was born in}} Henderson, on October 30, 1958, and {{attended}} Haughton High School in Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana. <b>Discouraged</b> <b>by</b> his father from pursuing his dreams of playing football, Delaney became the starting wide receiver by his junior year at Haughton. Major Division I schools that scouted him included Grambling State, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana State.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to raise}} {{sufficient}} funds locally, the seminary's founders borrowed money {{to construct a}} building in 1854. They were <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> the school's finances and sold it to Wood and Gregory, who borrowed money for the purchase. In 1857 Wood married Henry Shimer, a mason who was a creditor of the seminary. In 1864, the overcrowded school began accepting female students only.|$|E

5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Sarumpaet, who was {{suffering}} domestic violence {{at home and}} <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> the market, left theatre and entered the film industry. After her divorce, which took several years and required records of her broken ribs to satisfy the religious courts, she returned to theatre in 1989 with a performance of Shakespeare's Othello. Sarumpaet began working as a director in 1991, with the television serial Rumah Untuk Mama (House for Mother), which was broadcast on the state-owned television station TVRI. That same year, she adapted Antigone, a tragedy by French writer Jean Anouilh, in a Batak setting.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he {{made no effort to}} integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.|$|E
50|$|The United Arab Emirates <b>discourage</b> blasphemy <b>by</b> {{controlling}} what {{is published}} and distributed, by using Sharia punishments against Muslims, and by using judge-made penalties against non-Muslims.|$|R
50|$|OmPuff {{was born}} in Namibe City, Angola. He moved to Namibia {{at an early age}} in the late 1990s. He has lived most of his {{childhood}} in Katutura, Windhoek. As a teenager, he would mimic rap songs by famous American rappers. In the early 2000s he founded and joined an underground hip hop group known as Zero Degrees. OmPuff left the group in 2003 after feeling <b>discourage</b> <b>by</b> the lack of support within the local hip hop industry to pursue a solo career in kwaito.|$|R
50|$|You cannot {{bring about}} {{prosperity}} <b>by</b> <b>discouraging</b> thrift.|$|R
5|$|Pound {{was also}} {{introduced}} to sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, painter Wyndham Lewis {{and to the}} cream of London's literary circle, including the poet T. E. Hulme. The American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens (1881–1912) became a patron; after knowing him a short time she offered a large annual sum {{to allow him to}} focus on his work. Cravens killed herself in 1912, after the pianist Walter Rummel, long the object of her affection, married someone else. She may also have been <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> Pound's engagement to Dorothy.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} {{football}} program with several students forming a loose-knit troop of footballers called the Blacksmiths. On November 5, 1892, Tech played its first football game against Mercer University. The team lost to Mercer 12–6 in Macon, Georgia. Tech played two other games {{during their first}} season and lost both of them for a season record of 0–3. <b>Discouraged</b> <b>by</b> these results, the Blacksmiths sought a coach to improve their record. Leonard Wood, an Army officer and Atlantan, heard of Tech's football struggles and volunteered to player-coach the team.|$|E
5|$|The coins {{are issued}} in €2, €1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c, and 1c denominations. To avoid {{the use of}} the two {{smallest}} coins, some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands and Ireland (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland (by law). This practice is <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> the Commission, as is the practice of certain shops to refuse to accept high value euro notes.|$|E
25|$|Difficulty {{of access}} and hot climate have <b>discouraged</b> study <b>by</b> archeologists. Zapotec fortresses can be {{also found in}} Nexapa, Maxaltepec, Quievicuasa, Quiechapa and Quiecolani, which likely were {{controlled}} by Tehuantepec.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} {{provided}} by larks, some of which <b>discourage</b> merlins <b>by</b> sending a similar message: they sing while being chased, telling their predator {{that they will be}} difficult to capture.|$|R
5000|$|The People's Republic of Bangladesh {{went from}} being a secular state in 1971 to having Islam as the state {{religion}} in 1988. Despite its state religion, Bangladesh uses a secular penal code which dates from 1860—the time of the British occupation. The penal code <b>discourages</b> blasphemy <b>by</b> a section that forbids [...] "hurting religious sentiments." [...] Other laws permit the government to confiscate and to ban the publication of blasphemous material. Government officials, police, soldiers, and security forces may have <b>discouraged</b> blasphemy <b>by</b> extrajudicial actions including torture.Schools run by the government have Religious Studies in the curriculum.|$|R
5|$|The {{liberty of}} being {{employed}} in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves tzu-shu nii (never to marry) {{and live in}} communes with other women. Other Chinese called them sou-hei (self-combers) for adopting hairstyles of married women. These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> the communist government for being a relic of feudal China. In contemporary Chinese society, tongzhi (same goal or spirit) is the term {{used to refer to}} homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} {{in a number}} of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not wish}} to <b>discourage</b> him <b>by</b> saying that I did not think we had yet reached Crocker's, but I {{believed}} I had a much better appreciation of our horse's slowness than he had.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of Auckland Transport, the CCO for transport functions (with {{more than half}} the city's future rate spend), was <b>discouraged</b> even <b>by</b> the government's own Treasury and Department of Internal Affairs, as well as other departments.|$|R
50|$|If declarer plays {{yet another}} round of trump, {{you may be able}} to play yet another diamond. This will make it {{unambiguous}} to partner whether you are encouraging diamonds (by playing high-low) or <b>discouraging</b> diamonds (<b>by</b> playing low-high).|$|R
5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in Vojvodina {{noted that there}} was a dispute between them and the {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its resolution was <b>discouraged</b> <b>by</b> the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E
5|$|Calvert took an {{interest}} in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for persecuted English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). <b>Discouraged</b> <b>by</b> its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606–1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.|$|E
50|$|A few species, such as B. brownii, are {{exceptional}} {{in having}} low outcrossing rates. In all cases these are rare species {{that occur in}} very small populations, which increases the probability of self-fertilisation, and may <b>discourage</b> visits <b>by</b> pollinators.|$|R
50|$|A foreign army never seriously {{tested the}} {{military}} {{utility of the}} Linienwall, but it did <b>discourage</b> raids <b>by</b> the aforementioned Kuruc. It did, however, help to protect the revolting citizens of Vienna during the Revolutions of 1848 from imperial forces.|$|R
50|$|Ladies' {{nights in}} Illinois have been upheld under the {{anti-discrimination}} {{provision of the}} Dram Shop Act. The court determined that the discount was intended to encourage women to attend the bar in greater numbers, rather than to <b>discourage</b> attendance <b>by</b> males.|$|R
