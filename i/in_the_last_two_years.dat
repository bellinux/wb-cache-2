5|$|McCabe married Edna May Linton on 5 February 1935 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and {{the couple}} had two {{children}}, {{a son and a}} daughter, born in 1939 and 1950 respectively. The devout McCabe sent both of his children to Catholic boarding schools even though the family home was nearby. Plagued by ill-health in his middle age, McCabe’s fitness was further hindered by his feet, which prevented him from exercising. He thus gained a lot of weight, and heavy smoking wore down his body, as did the large amount of people who wanted to meet him. McCabe weakened significantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of his life and was hospitalised for a period for liver problems. He was released from hospital soon before his death, but still aged 58, was a very frail man who moved very tentatively.|$|E

Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.|$|E
