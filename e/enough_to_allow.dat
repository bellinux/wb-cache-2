5|$|The double bottoms {{are also}} subject to design constraints. The primary {{concern is that}} they be high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the passage of pipes and cables. These areas must also be roomy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance. On the other hand, {{concerns}} of excess weight and wasted volume keep the double bottoms very tight spaces.|$|E
5|$|In Texas, the Weather Bureau {{notified}} people early <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> mass evacuations: most coastal {{residents and}} camping visitors evacuated the vulnerable islands {{as the storm}} neared. Between 60–70% of Port Isabel's 500residents left before the storm, with the remainder sheltering in a sturdy brick store on the highest land available.|$|E
5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection is strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> them to locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the LFEE's {{floating}} fire engine to {{arrive on the}} scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker's House.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine-18 {{is often}} found in {{radioactive}} tracers for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers. The most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which, after intravenous injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors; computer-assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging.|$|E

5|$|I-380 crosses two of Iowa's major rivers, the Iowa and the Cedar. Both rivers have {{affected}} the interstate during major floods, as the case was in 1993 and in 2008. During the Great Flood of 1993, I-380 and Iowa965 were both closed at the Iowa River's Coralville Lake reservoir between July 13 and July 28.

5|$|In 2003 it was {{hypothesized}} that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{kicked the}} game off, and also {{fashioned}} {{the first chance}} of the game; Ronaldo beat Lauren on the left wing to put over a cross, only for Scholes to head the ball over the crossbar after losing his marker. Two minutes later, a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard, forcing Reyes wide <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the United defence time to get back.|$|E

30|$|In {{this case}} report, we {{describe}} the successful treatment of a giant PNET that occupied most of the pancreas and had extended via the portal vein {{to the level of}} the hepatic hilus at the time of diagnosis. Although the tumor size was not reduced significantly by everolimus, the extent of portal vein invasion was reduced <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allowing</b> a conversion <b>to</b> surgical resection. This case suggests the potential role of everolimus as a neoadjuvant agent for locally advanced PNETs.|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the neptunium that currently exists on Earth was produced in artificial nuclear reactions. Neptunium-237 is the most commonly synthesized isotope due to it being the only one that both can be created via neutron capture and also has a half-lifelong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> weighable quantities to be easily isolated.

5|$|This formula was {{powerful}} enough to stand {{as the basis for}} all subsequent descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century. During that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis were invented to calculate the deviations of orbits due to the influence of multiple bodies on a planet, moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was observed.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the bacteria to grow.|$|E
