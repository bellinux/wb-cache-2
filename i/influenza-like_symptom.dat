40|$|Although legionnaires ’ disease {{frequently}} is {{acquired in}} health care institutions, {{little is known about}} the occupational risk of Legionella infection among health care workers. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to analyse antibody levels among exposed hospital workers and to determine the correlation between antibodies to Legionella and self-reported symptoms. The study included 258 hospital employees and a reference group of 708 healthy blood donors. Hospital workers had a higher prevalence of Legionella antibody titres (≥ 1 : 128) than blood donors (odds ratio 3. 4; 95 % CI 2. 4 – 4. 8). Antibody levels were not higher among staff members at risk of frequent aerosol exposure than among less exposed employees. There was no consistent association between a history of <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptom</b> complex and the presence of antibodies. The results indicate that hospital workers have a higher risk of Legionella infections than the general population. However, since no excess morbidity was associated with seropositivity, most Legionella infections may be asymptomatic. Copyright © 2009 M. Rudbeck et al.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundA novel {{influenza}} H 1 N 1 {{began in}} March 2009, rapidly spread, {{and then became}} a pandemic outbreak. Diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction result was not always available because of a surge in workload and therefore clinical diagnosis became important. However, clinical differences between the patients infected by the novel H 1 N 1 virus and those infected by the influenza-like non-novel H 1 N 1 have not been reported. This {{study was conducted to}} compare the demographic background, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings between novel H 1 N 1 influenza infections and other non-novel H 1 N 1 infections. MethodsAt an early stage of H 1 N 1 spread, cases presenting with <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptom</b> and travel or contact history were quarantined into infection disease-designated hospitals in Taiwan. Data on consecutive patients under investigation for infection with novel influenza A (H 1 N 1) were collected between April 29 and June 19, 2009. The data set consisted of clinical manifestations, plain chest radiography, hematological results, and biochemical findings. Testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect H 1 N 1. ResultsOverall, 166 cases were collected. Among these individuals, there were 14 confirmed H 1 N 1 cases. The clinical manifestations of the H 1 N 1 cases included fever in 13 patients (92. 9 %), followed by cough, rhinorrhea, a sore throat, myalgia, headache, malaise, abdominal tenderness, and diarrhea. Leukopenia was present in nine patients (64. 2 %) and lymphocytopenia was present in five (35. 7 %). The duration of virus shedding was 7. 0  ±  1. 8 days. When compared with the non-H 1 N 1 cases by multiple logistic regression analysis, cases infected by the novel H 1 N 1 virus {{were more likely to be}} younger than 20 years [Odds ratio (OR)  =  27. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI)  =  1. 3 – 597. 8, p =  0. 034), have traveled from the US (OR =  14. 5, 95 % CI =  2. 1 – 101. 4, p =  0. 007) or Thailand (OR =  56. 7, 95 % CI =  4. 6 – 700. 6, p =  0. 002) and to have presented with myalgia (OR =  8. 5, 95 % CI =  1. 4 – 52. 0, p =  0. 021) or leukopenia (OR =  17. 4, 95 % CI =  3. 4 – 90. 5, p =  0. 001). ConclusionWhen a patient presents with influenza-like acute febrile respiratory illness symptoms and is young in age, has a travel history involving an affected area, and is suffering from myalgia or leukopenia, physicians should be alerted to the possibility of novel H 1 N 1 virus infection...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTPoint-of-care (POC) {{tests for}} {{influenza}} facilitate clinical case management, and {{might also be}} helpful {{in the care of}} travellers who are at special risk for influenza infection. To evaluate influenza POC testing in travellers, a new assay, the ImmunoCard STAT! Flu A and B, was used to investigate travellers presenting with <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Influenza virus infection was diagnosed in 27 (13 %) of 203 patients by influenza virus-specific PCR and viral culture. The POC test had sensitivity and specificity values of 64 % and 99 % for influenza A, and 67 % and 100 % for influenza B, respectively. Combined sensitivity and specificity were 67 % and 99 %, respectively, yielding positive and negative predictive values of 95 %, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 117 and 0. 34, respectively. The convenient application, excellent specificity and high positive likelihood ratio of the POC test allowed rapid identification of influenza cases. However, negative test results might require confirmation by other methods because of limitations in sensitivity. Overall, influenza POC testing appeared to be a useful tool for the management of travellers with <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary: Patients {{treated with}} {{intravenous}} zoledronic acid 5 mg for osteoporosis may experience post-dose <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Oral acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen administered 4 h post-infusion reduced {{the proportion of}} patients with increased oral temperature and worsening post-infusion symptom scores vs. placebo, thus providing an effective strategy {{for the treatment of}} such symptoms. Introduction: Once-yearly intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg is a safe and effective treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. This study assessed whether transient <b>influenza-like</b> post-dose <b>symptoms</b> associated with intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid can be reduced by post-dose administration of acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen. Methods: In an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy parallel-group study, bisphosphonate-naïve postmenopausal women with osteopenia (n = 481) were randomized to receive zoledronic acid 5 mg + acetaminophen/paracetamol (n = 135), ibuprofen (n = 137) or placebo (n = 137), or placebo + placebo (n = 72). Acetaminophen/paracetamol and ibuprofen were administered every 6 h for 3 days beginning 4 h post-infusion. Results: The proportion of patients with increased oral temperature (≥ 1 °C above 37. 5 °C) and with worsening post-infusion symptom scores over 3 days was significantly lower in patients receiving ibuprofen (36. 8 % and 48. 5 %) or acetaminophen/paracetamol (37. 3 % and 46. 3 %) vs. those receiving placebo (63. 5 % and 75. 9 %, respectively; all p < 0. 0001) compared with background rates of 11. 1 % and 16. 7 %, respectively, {{in the absence of any}} active treatment.

40|$|Influenza {{results in}} {{substantial}} human suffering {{and health care}} costs. Evidence from psychoneuroimmunology suggests that emotions influence {{the immune system and}} may alter susceptibility to infectious diseases, like influenza. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of psychological factors, health behaviors, circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the development of influenza-like illness in older adults. Medically stable participants, 55 years of age and over, were enrolled from the general community and an elderly community. Psychological factors (emotions and perceived stress), health behaviors (sleep and physical activity) and plasma cytokine levels (IL- 6 and IL- 1 B) were evaluated with respect to the development of influenza-like illness {{over the course of the}} influenza season (October to March 31, 2011). Findings revealed that individuals reporting <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms</b> were significantly younger than those who did not report symptoms (60 versus 72 years). These individuals reported lower positive trait emotion scores on the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), with significantly lower scores for the calm subscale for trait emotions. Those with <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms</b> reported significantly higher levels of perceived stress, greater amounts of physical activity and less sleep disturbance. For cytokine measurements, significantly lower circulating IL- 6 levels were observed at initial assessment for those with <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms.</b> No differences were observed between groups for IL- 1 B. Lower calm trait subscales approached significance for predicting increased IL- 1 B in plasma, suggesting a role for lower positive emotions and stress perception as risk factors for influenza-like illness in older adults. These results suggest a role for lower positive emotions and stress perception as risk factors for influenza-like illness in older adults. Further, these results support the need for additional study to evaluate potential mechanisms that may underlie these risks. Significant increases in positive trait emotions scores were associated with increasing age, higher Ego Resiliency scores, fewer reported sleep problems, and lower Percieived Stress scores. An ad hoc mediator analysis was significant for positive trait emotion scores mediating the relationship between scores for ego resiliency and percieved stress. This finding supported a direct and indirect role for positive emotions to reduce perceived stress...|$|R
30|$|Theories {{regarding}} {{the mechanism of}} bisphosphonate-induced uveitis include immunologic or toxic reactions caused by the release of inflammatory cytokines [31, 48]. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are known to cause a systemic acute phase reaction, including the development of transient <b>influenza-like</b> <b>symptoms,</b> in approximately 30 % of patients following the first intravenous infusion [49]. It should be noted, however, that inflammatory reactions, including anterior uveitis, can occur following administration of non-nitrogen, halogen-containing bisphosphonates, such as clodronate [50]. Patients receiving bisphosphonates may also develop leukopenia as well as elevation of C-reactive protein, interleukin- 1, and interleukin- 6, all of which {{may contribute to the}} development of uveitis.|$|R
