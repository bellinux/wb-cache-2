It presents a new approach for the production of ZrN thin films. The ion source was operated in its target/gas mode. Zirconium metal is used as target and argon as the sputtering gas. Nitrogen is used as the reactive gas. Optimum conditions for the synthesis of ZrN for a number of process parameters like volume ratio of gases, discharge conditions, substrate heating, bias, and deposition time were determined. Experimental runs using between 20 % and 30 % of nitrogen (with argon constituting the other 70 - 80 %) in a total gas filling pressure of 7. 0 x 10 - 3 Torr and an hour of deposition showed the synthesis of good samples by visual inspection in view of the typical gold color of the film produced.

First, two single-layer coatings were obtained as reference coatings, using the micro- and the nanostructured feedstock, respectively. Four different composite coatings were then obtained by combining these two feedstocks. Two double-layer (multilayer) YSZ coatings were prepared by depositing the microstructured feedstock on the nanostructured layer and vice versa, while two coatings with different particle size gradients (<b>graded</b> <b>coatings)</b> were prepared by depositing various mixtures of the micro- and the nanostructured feedstock in alternate layers. The microstructure and hardness of the resulting coatings were determined.

Cross-sectional nanoindentation {{was used to determine}} the mechanical properties of uniform and <b>graded</b> organosilicone <b>coatings.</b> Both hardness and modulus across the coatings were directly measured. Additionally, “modulus mapping” on cross-sections was used to map the complex modulus. For the graded coating, it was found that variations in the complex modulus was predominantly due to varying storage modulus. It was observed that at the interface with the substrate there was a low storage modulus, which linearly increased to a relatively high storage modulus at the surface. It is proposed that the increase in stiffness, from the substrate interface to the outer surface, is due to the increasing content of a cross-linked O–Si–O network. This mechanical gradient has been linked to a change in the Si:O ratio via direct compositional mapping using ToF-SIMS.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{fretting}} contact {{problem for}} two elastic solids with <b>graded</b> <b>coatings</b> is investigated. We assume a conventional axisymmetric Hertzian contact takes place between two elastic solids under {{the action of}} the normal pressure. The application of the torque produces an annulus of slip. It is assumed that the surface shear traction within the contact area is limited by Coulomb’s friction law and the torsion angel was produced within the central adhesion zone as a rigid body. The linear multi-layer model is used to model the functionally graded coating with arbitrarily varying shear modulus. This model divides the coating into a series of sub-layers with the elastic modulus varying linearly in each sub-layer and continuous on the sub-interfaces. By using the transfer matrix method and Hankel integral transform technique, this problem is formulated as the solution of the Cauchy singular integral equations. The contact tractions are calculated by solving the equations numerically. The results show that the appropriate gradual variation of the shear modulus can significantly alter the contact tractions. Therefore, <b>graded</b> <b>coatings</b> may have potential applications in improving the resistance to fretting contact damage at the contact surfaces...|$|R

However, limitations of these hard coatings, such as brittleness and high internal stresses, {{have led to the}} need to improve tool coatings. The aim of this thesis was to investigate coatings that {{could be used as a}} component in “functionally graded coatings” in which the coating grades smoothly from tool steel substrate to a hard top layer thereby overcoming the property mismatch between the two materials. The development of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>coatings</b> may lead to the development of thicker coatings that can be better integrated into the tool design, leading to an overall increase in tool performance. A variety of thin film materials suitable for use in functionally <b>graded</b> <b>coatings</b> were energetically deposited using a filtered cathodic arc deposition system. The first thin film material explored was vapour deposited high speed steel with the aim of producing metallic thin films which may form a suitable grading layer from bulk high speed steel tools to other coatings. This work was then extended to the reactive deposition of high speed steel. A range of microstructures were obtained under different deposition conditions including fine columnar grain growth at low deposition energy, coarser grains at high temperature and a dominant amorphous phase at high deposition energy. The films with the columnar grain microstructure exhibited the highest hardness values, however the amorphous structure may also be useful as an interlayer material in functionally <b>graded</b> <b>coatings.</b> The ductile phase toughening of TiN was also explored. TiN-Ni thin films were characterised to determine structure-property relationships using a combination of in-depth microstructural characterisation using transmission electron microscopy and mechanical property analysis using nanoindentation. It was found that films deposited at low energy had a fine microstructure comprised of small crystallites of TiN and a disordered Ni phase. When the deposition energy or temperature of the substrate was increased, the Ni phase formed crystals with the size increasing with an increase in deposition energy or temperature. A decrease in internal stress, decrease in hardness and increase in ductility was observed for films with larger Ni crystals. These films may be useful in forming functionally <b>graded</b> <b>coatings</b> from a single cathode. This investigation provided a detailed analysis of the types of microstructures and properties that are produced under various deposition conditions. A novel method of producing multi-element cathodes using cold-spray technology was investigated.

The films produced displayed a range of microstructures and properties depending on the deposition conditions, with a nanocrystalline film forming at low energy and films becoming increasingly crystalline with an increase in either deposition energy or substrate temperature. The more crystalline films exhibited higher hardness values than the nanocrystalline film.

Tungsten is a promising candidate material for future fusion reactors due to a high sputtering threshold and melting temperature.

Finite element models have been developed to understand the residual stresses that develop in W/steel systems and made use of experimental measurements of coating thermal history during manufacture and elastic moduli measured by nano-indentation. For both the graded and surfi-sculpt coating, the models have been used to understand the mechanism of residual stress redistribution and relief in comparison with simple W on steel coatings, particularly by consideration of stored strain energy.

The texture analyses on the <b>graded</b> TiN/TiC <b>coatings</b> showed that the TiC top layers were oriented in a direction perpendicular to the sample surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{behaviour}} of titania–hydroxyapatite <b>graded</b> <b>coatings</b> obtained by plasma sprayingwas investigated by a microstructural and mechanical point of view. To verify the bioactivity of thegraded coatings, as sprayed and after thermal treatment, in vitro tests were performed insimulated body fluid. Furthermore, since the mechanical {{properties of the}} coatings may bealtered by the immersion in simulated body fluid, the local elastic properties were measured onthe cross-section {{by means of a}} depth sensing Vickers microindentation technique beforeimmersion (reference materials) and after soaking for 1 week (short term response) and 4 weeks(long term response), separately investigating the titania and the hydroxyapatite rich zones toaccount for the compositional gradient. The results proved that the presence of titania in thecoating did not suppress the bioactivity, which, on the contrary, was inhibited by the heattreatment. However, the heat treated samples showed higher mechanical properties and reduceddissolution rates...|$|R
