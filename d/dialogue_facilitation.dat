50|$|Dialogue Education is {{a popular}} {{education}} approach to adult education first described by educator Jane Vella in the 1980s. This approach to education draws on various adult learning theories, including those of Paulo Freire, Kurt Lewin, Malcolm Knowles and Benjamin Bloom (Global Learning Partners, 2006b; Vella, 2004). It is a synthesis of these theories into principles and practices {{that can be applied}} in a concrete way to learning design and <b>facilitation.</b> <b>Dialogue</b> Education is a form of Constructivism and can be a means for Transformative learning, (Vella, 2004).|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increasingly}} global and mass produced marketplace {{has led to a}} change in consumer values. In an attempt to mediate the current marketplace where consumers are beginning to experience exhaustion as their choices continue to increase, the consumer is employing new means of determining value. Value is increasingly being sough by the new consumer beyond the product itself, and includes the consideration of product customisation and honest production practice and promotion. Despite the development of techniques to mediate {{the current state of the}} consumption environment, there is a lack of research into how this could be explored through architecture. This thesis argues that architecture can be used to support the changing nature of the consumption environment, through a physical interpretation of the social needs of the new consumer. A reassessment of the environment designed for consumption is necessary, in order to physically facilitate the increase of consumer awareness of consumption habits and the effects of their given choices. The layout of this research is broken into two main bodies of work. Part one focuses on the architectural proposition through an analysis of literature, whilst part two explores the fundamental facets of the design solution. The new consumer addressed within the literature and alongside the case study and site analysis is translated spatially, throughout this design led research. The architectural application of new consumer ideals within a consumption program has resulted in the design - The Urban Brewery. The brewery program showcases the potentials for social values to be transformed into a spatial <b>dialogue.</b> Successful <b>facilitation</b> of the new consumer is sought through increased engagement between people, product and program. This thesis concludes that architectural integration of social values and spatial organisation is important to the construction of the future consumption environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{library service}} needs of {{residents}} in the Camarillo Library community were thoroughly assessed {{over a two-year period}} from late 1999 to early 2002. This assessment involved the participation {{of a wide range of}} individuals, groups, organizations and agencies. It also involved a detailed analysis of demographic data, school evaluations, and library service and facility information. Through a variety of methods and input opportunities, special efforts were made to obtain a true and accurate understanding of the local community’s character, conditions, needs and desires with respect to its public library. The process involved countless public meetings and <b>dialogue</b> networks, consultant <b>facilitation</b> and technical analysis, citizen participation forums, interagency planning and collaboration, and thoughtful evaluation and decision-making. This section on Needs Assessment Methodology describes how residents, library patrons, students, parents, senior citizens, businesspersons, library personnel, educators, consultants, organizations and governmental bodies were involved in evaluating the library needs of the community. It also describes the creation of a joint venture partnership between the public library, a local school district and city hall for developing a community library that serves both public library patrons and public school students...|$|R

40|$|From the {{semantic}} viewpoint, spatial expressions have {{the virtue of}} relating {{in some way to}} visual scenes being described. Therefore, their semantic descriptions can be grounded in perceptual representations. The Mental Image Directed Semantic Theory (Yokota, et al, 1991) has proposed an omnisensory mental image model and its description language Lmd. This language is employed for many-sorted predicate logic and can provide spatial expressions with computable semantic descriptions as their perceptual representations.

40|$|This thesis uncovers a {{personal}} journey of reflective practice in Aotearoa / New Zealand. The focus for reflection {{is on my}} emerging role as a nurse facilitating transitions using a dialectical approach {{in the context of}} a private nursing practice. Transitions encompass: life changes, loss, and adjustment to changes in function. Dialectical nurse facilitation of transition (DNFT) is a way of exploring self in the transitional space between "the no longer and the not yet". In this facilitated process people potentially discover paradoxes, tensions, and creative energy, as they search for a way forward. The research design details a dialectical heuristic quest through journaling and reflecting on practice supervision and peer review, over a two year period. Exemplars written after reflecting on case notes reveal the lived experiences of participants Sophie, Grace, Rose, Faith, Lilo, and Charles (pseudonyms). These case reviews show the complexity of patterns for people undergoing transitions and nurse facilitation. A relational pattern for DNFT encompasses compassionate engagement, catalytic mirroring, and interconnectedness. A transitional pathway from impasse to transformation shows itself as the people I work with search for clarity about the nature and meaning of self. The transitional pathway is mirrored in practice supervision and peer review in my search for professional clarity and grounded-ness. This reveals a mutual transformational process going beyond the boundaries of feelings and reason, into the regions of the human energy field and spiritual essence of self. This integral approach finds resonance with nursing, Buddhist, and psycho-social philosophies and theories that posit human beings as the embodiment of spiritual energy. An exploration of literature encompasses nursing theories, <b>facilitation,</b> <b>dialogue,</b> loss, grief, spirituality and transition. These show how the patterns that I find, both resonate, and are divergent from extant knowledge. This thesis sheds light on the often hidden aspects of reflection and nursing practice and may support professional and personal growth. It also provides a basis for evaluative research on the effectiveness of DNFT in health care settings in the future. Discussions regarding the expansion of these reflective and praxis genres are included which may be of interest to nursing education and practice contexts...|$|R
40|$|Is there a {{link between}} the Black ethnically Minoritised (BEM) student {{experience}} in higher education in the UK and degree attainment, retention and progression?” Aims of this study: •	to investigate the experiences of BEM students on the youth and community development (YCD) course at Riverside University(RU) •	to provide a conduit that would enable BEM students to tell their stories •	to analyse the BEM students’ narratives and discuss implications for key stake-holders. Methodology: The overall aim {{of this study was to}} explore and gain insights into the experience of BEM students in higher education in the UK, using qualitative research methodology. It sought to provide descriptive and interpretive accounts from BEM students at De Montfort University, in Leicester. Student <b>dialogue</b> groups and <b>facilitation</b> were the primary methods used. The process was underpinned by a commitment to group processes as well as working towards a tangible outcome that could be presented to the three stake-holders: BEM students, BEM communities and the university. The research methodology was based on a process of attempting to research with, rather than into, or about. The overall concern in this study was with processes, rather than content or outcome. The research approach adopted to capture BEM students’ experiences was a post-positivist (subjectivist) methodology. Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Participatory Action Research (PAR) were also used. Outcomes: Overall, the BEM students regarded their experience in HE as “a struggle that exposed vulnerabilities and presented opportunities for change. ” This study demonstrated the necessity to create space to facilitate the articulation of the BEM “student voice”. Their experience in HE was mirrored by their experiences in wider society and underscored by “discrimination”. The BEM students’ experiences heightened their appreciation of “positionality”. This is reflected in terms of how they were situated, or how they situated themselves, based on perception and experiences. Their encounters with “discrimination” and “positionality” in HE and the opportunity to dialogue and reflect led to an emerging “consciousisation”, where BEM students were “more determined to succeed and to challenge for positive change”. BEM participants wanted HE institutions to be “accountable” and to “acknowledge their role and responsibility in addressing the negative impact of policy and practice”. BEM students “desired safe spaces” and they were prepared to use various methods (“self-determination”) to achieve their objectives. The BEM students identified strategies they believed would contribute to making a significant difference to their HE experiences, specifically “learning contracts”, “Peer Support & Mentoring System (PSMS) ” and “radical curriculum...|$|R
40|$|While many {{non-governmental}} organizations provide leadership training in inter-ethnic conflict management to Kenyan youth, relatively {{little is known}} about what goes into such training. This dissertation is a case study illustrating how the training structure operates. The purpose of this dissertation is to address the challenges associated with youth leadership training in inter-ethnic conflict management, how these challenges are managed, what differences the training makes, and how it is transferred back into the real-life of the youth. To better understand these issues, a two-month qualitative study was conducted divided in two phases involving trainers, youth participants, program designers, and community leaders. Twenty two interviews and 2 focus groups were completed. Results demonstrated four communicative challenges involved in the design of youth leadership training were: (1) audience analysis, (2) material resources, (3) participant challenges, and (4) diversity. Results showed that trainers addressed the communicative challenges by using the following management strategies: needs assessment, financial management, stakeholder education, and <b>dialogue</b> <b>facilitation.</b> The analysis suggested that the conditions that facilitate transfer of training were: participatory models, training organization, and trainee motivation. Similarly, conditions that inhibit training transfer included: resource constraints, youth motivation, environmental conditions, and diversity. Finally, results also suggested that the differences that leadership training made {{in the lives of the}} youth were: behavioral transformation, participant input, improved peaceful relationships, and skill development. Successfully managing the communicative challenges in the design and implementation of the training were the main goals of trainers, and the more they took ownership of these goals the more likely the training would be successful. This dissertation suggests that managing the communicative challenges associated with the design and conduct of youth leadership training is the first step to ensuring the training transfer for youth participants and achieving a workable leadership training in inter-ethnic conflict management...|$|E
40|$|Humour and {{seriousness}} {{are frequently}} posed as opposites both in academia and everyday language. However, some nonviolent actions are both humorous and serious and {{living proof that}} the dichotomy misses an important type of humour. These humorous political stunts publicly challenge dominant discourses and powerful institutions and people in five distinct ways. 1. Supportive stunts are framed as ostensible attempts to help, celebrate and protect from harm. 2. Corrective stunts present an alternative version of dominant discourses by hijacking the identity or message of people, companies and institutions. 3. Naive stunts disguise their critique behind a pretended innocence, and 4. absurd stunts defy all claims to truth and rationality. In 5. provocative stunts the pranksters transcend power by appearing not {{to care about the}} consequences of infuriating the powerful. The particular dynamics of these five strategies are explored through 15 short examples covering everything from struggles against neo-liberalism and controversial bank investments to dictatorships. A theatre metaphor further illustrates how humorous political stunts can be analysed. The nuances about relations of power and humour uncovered by this typology illustrate why it is inadequate to discuss whether humour should be considered subversive or a vent for frustration as has been debated within humour studies for decades. Instead the interesting question is what role humour can play in facilitating resistance, since political humour is so diverse and takes place in such different contexts that it is misleading to evaluate its impact as if it is all the same. Two in-depth case studies are the basis for the further exploration of humour and nonviolent action. Inspired by participatory action research methodology, the study has utilised archival material, media reports, interviews, workshops, and participant observation to document and analyse the use of humour by the groups Ofog and KMV. Ofog is a Swedish anti-militarist network working on issues related to the arms industry, military recruitment and military test sites. Ofog activists have found the use of humour to be a positive way to reach out to media, passers-by and potential new activists. Even more important is humorous political stunts’ contribution to the discursive guerrilla war waged by activists. Power does not just manifest itself in brutal repression and exploitation, but also in dominant discourses about what is true, right and just. In this struggle, humorous incongruity can deconstruct patterns of domination through the use of exposure, exaggeration, parody and irony among many other techniques. Kampanjen Mot Verneplikt, KMV, was a Scandinavian campaign against conscription active in the 1980 s. Here the focus is the work for improving the conditions for Norwegian total resisters who refused both military and alternative service. KMV pursued different strategies in its work, one of which was to create a spectacle around court hearings and imprisonments, including several humorous political stunts. Together with the legal work of filing charges against the state for violation of their human rights, KMV’s spectacular actions were crucial in changing the law on conscientious objection. The phenomenon of humorous political stunts is discussed in relation to Vinthagen’s theory of nonviolent action and its four dimensions. Just like other nonviolent actions, some stunts are strong in one dimension while others mainly work in another. Almost all the stunts temporarily contribute to breaking power and many also include a <b>dialogue</b> <b>facilitation</b> element. The absurd and naïve stunts have demonstrated a particular ability to be part of utopian enactment and normative regulation, since Santas, clowns and similar figures speak to people’s imagination and hopes for a more just and peaceful world. Analysing humorous political stunts can give both academics and activists insights into what type of stunt is most likely to emphasise a certain aspect of a humorous nonviolent action in relation to various audiences. It will also bring {{a deeper understanding of the}} nature and dynamics of power, resistance and humour...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} part {{reflection}} on the curriculum building experience and part analysis of the experience {{with regards to the}} academic literature on adult education. Reflection on the experience and discussion of some theories in AE are followed by a collection of suggested resources for the curriculum, many of which speak to the issues I highlight in the paper. Adding a gender perspective to the curriculum will not only touch on issues that are commonly overlooked, but it will provide a more complete picture of issues discussed. Because the curriculum will undergo a process of constant evolution, I do not consider this project a comprehensive, finished product. I consider my contribution as just one part of many in an ongoing process. I hope that my suggestions for additions to the curriculum will be a starting point for further exploration to engage the learners and instructors at TLP, and to foster the ongoing curriculum building process. After a brief overview of TLP and underlying ideas behind my research in section on, section two explains the curriculum 2 ̆ 7 s stated purposes and provides an overview of the units and their content [...] materials, resources, and lesson plans. I discuss the process by which the team made decisions that shaped its practical implications, and the possible assumptions about AE and about TLP learners that affected the curriculum building process. This leads to a discussion on the instructors 2 ̆ 7 request for <b>dialogue</b> <b>facilitation</b> training, and the resulting training workshop. Section two introduces the curriculum builders 2 ̆ 7 varying perceptions on what the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s role should be in a participatory adult education setting. Finally, I discuss a few observations {{from the beginning of the}} implementation stage that further illustrate theoretical and practical issues of interest. In section three, I expand on some of the ways that common assumptions in traditional education, as well as adult education theory, have informed the instructors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their role. I introduce historical methods and theories of adult education that shape TLP 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy and practice, specifically those that led TLP to engage in the BBB coalition. I deconstruct some ways that the field of adult education has evolved into a different kind of pedagogy than traditional education, and how this is apparent in the TLP classrooms. Instructors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the purpose and ideals of adult education, as well as their roles as curriculum makers and dialogue facilitators in a participatory learning environment shape what they feel is acceptable practice in the AE classroom. This leads to section four an overview of critical pedagogy/critical literacy, and how it can be applied to this situation for implementing the BBB/TLP. The fifth section looks at gender issues implicated in the AE/TLP environment, and as one of several perspectives that is not yet represented in the curriculum. My approach for discussing gender issues is that it is a two-sided coin [...] gender is not just a code word for 2 ̆ 2 women. 2 ̆ 2 Gender issues affect both men and women, so introduction theses issues in the classroom can have an affect outside of the classroom for both men and women. I discuss the possibility of using feminist pedagogy as another means of enhancing the BBB/TLP curriculum. Through discussing the curriculum with learners and considering at the population of women learners in Western Massachusetts, I found some aspects of their learning experience that make their interests, problems, and roles unique. I attempt to respond to those interests, problems and roles by connecting the existing curriculum to gender themes that are or could be included in the curriculum...|$|E
