2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{three-way}} negotiation failure, political pundits noted how a PP–PSOE grand coalition was the only option left, despite the high improbability of such a formula. Mariano Rajoy insisted on his proposal of a grand coalition led by himself while rejecting the PSOE–C's accord. Regarding C's involvement in such a prospective coalition, Rajoy noted on the party's arithmetic irrelevance, with contacts between PP and C's having remained cold-tempered following Rivera's alliance with the PSOE and the harsh Rajoy–Rivera parliamentary duel during Sánchez's <b>investiture</b> <b>debate.</b> Sánchez opened himself open to entering talks with the PP after breaking up negotiations with Podemos, but rejected repealing his pact with C's and stated that the PSOE would [...] "never" [...] support a PP-led government. The PP expected the PSOE to [...] "make a move" [...] before talks could start, meaning that they would wait until Sánchez explicitly accepted meeting with them to negotiate a government before making any offer. PP leaders even suggested that Sánchez was not the best PSOE [...] "interlocutor" [...] and called for him to step aside so that another person could negotiate with Rajoy and stop [...] "the recreation, theaters and games". Some sources pointed, however, that Rajoy was willing to have Sánchez as his deputy in a grand coalition scenario. The PSOE answered negatively, stating that [...] "Mr. Rajoy can save for himself any offer, if he had planned in making one".|$|E
50|$|The office {{came again}} under dispute in 2016, {{days after a}} {{caretaker}} committee under Javier Fernández had taken control over PSOE {{as a result of}} a leadership crisis in October. Podemos' Pablo Iglesias subsequently self-proclaimed himself as new opposition leader on the basis of his party's strength in Congress being close to PSOE's—67 seats to 84. During Mariano Rajoy's second <b>investiture</b> <b>debate</b> on 27 October, Spanish media and parliamentarians acknowledged Iglesias the role of Opposition Leader by virtue of Rajoy addressing him as his main rival during a heated dialectical exchange, coupled with PSOE's perceived inability to exercise as opposition after choosing to allow Rajoy's election. Nonetheless, the office has remained disputed since Pedro Sánchez's resignation and no official officeholder is currently recognized. The chaos ensuing from the vacancy in the PSOE leadership has led to other opposition parties not recognizing a formal opposition leader.|$|E

2500|$|Pedro Sánchez {{maintained}} {{he would}} vote against Rajoy's <b>investiture</b> in a <b>debate</b> which, nonetheless, revolved on the rift opened within the Socialist Party {{as to whether}} its stance should remain so after Rajoy's failed investiture attempt. Several PSOE deputies had already asked the previous day for a debate to take place within the party after 2 September to discuss their position and possible alternatives. In a reversal of roles from Sánchez's failed investiture in March, the PSOE leader wanted to convey a harsh stance to Rajoy by reassuring he would never allow {{the formation of a}} Rajoy-led cabinet without clarifying whether he would try to explore an alternative himself. Rajoy mockingly undervalued Sánchez's reasons to vote against him by stating that he had [...] "already understood all parts of the 'no' and therefore [...] did not need to try to argue [...] case", before asking Sánchez to just [...] "let him govern" [...] after having gathered 170 votes for his investiture and dismissing as unworkable any possible alternative government to his.|$|R

The {{importance}} of social networks {{in recent years in}} politics is making different analysts investigate more specifically on Twitter, how this tool is used to convey the message that each political group wants to introduce in each of the citizens. In this study we will discern the use of individual accounts of social network twitter of the five major candidates for president of the Government, and five journalists from different media following today gubernatorial by that social network. One of the objetives is to know whether the selected users when they want to name others in twitter, what made directly to discuss with them or do so indirectly. One of the findings reveals the fact that relations in political twitter and journalists prefer not too directly appointed by the uncertainty that would create a possible and right or wrong answer...|$|E
