5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War <b>I</b> <b>added</b> further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E
25|$|This project {{required}} all new manuals and incremented (i.e. -85 to -86) block numbers. All later production models, {{especially the}} F models, included earlier High Wire modifications. New manuals included colored illustrations {{and had the}} Roman numeral (<b>I)</b> <b>added</b> after the aircraft number (i.e. T.O. 1F-100D(I)-1S-120, 12 January 1970).|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by the ascendancy of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. The Bactrian king Demetrius <b>I</b> <b>added</b> the Punjab to his Kingdom in the early 2nd century BCE. Some of these early Indo-Greeks were Buddhists. The best known of the Indo-Greek kings was Menander I, known in India as Milinda, who established an independent kingdom centred at ancient Taxila around 160 BCE. He later moved his capital to Sagala (modern Sialkot).|$|E

These covariates are (g) a variable indicating the level of completed education of an individual and (h) a dummy variable for marital status.|$|R
25|$|The {{chronology}} of early Dyn. 22 depends on dead reckoning. The {{sum of the}} highest attested regnal dates for Osorkon II, Takelot I, Osorkon I, and Shoshenq <b>I,</b> <b>added</b> to 841 BC as year 1 of Shoshenq III, yields 938 BC at the latest for year 1 of Shoshenq I... The large Dakhla stela provides a lunar date {{in the form of}} a wrš feast in year 5 of Shoshenq , yielding 943 BC as his year 1.|$|E
25|$|James I had poor {{relations}} with the English Parliament, which had been less submissive than the Scottish Estates {{that he had been}} accustomed to. To raise funds without taxation, James began to sell titles. For instance, individuals paying £1095 could obtain the non-peerage hereditary dignity of baronet. Even peerage dignities were sold. Thus, James <b>I</b> <b>added</b> sixty-two peers to a body that had included just fifty-nine members at the commencement of his reign. His Stuart successors were no less profuse.|$|E
25|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>added</b> to the chaos. Conscription {{swept up}} the unwilling across Russia. The vast demand for factory {{production}} of war supplies and workers caused many more labor riots and strikes. Conscription stripped skilled {{workers from the}} cities, {{who had to be}} replaced with unskilled peasants, and then, when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system, workers abandoned the cities in droves seeking food. Finally, the soldiers themselves, who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements, began to turn against the Tsar. This was mainly because, as the war progressed, many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, and were replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities, who had little loyalty to the Tsar.|$|E

25|$|I didn't {{have much}} time. July was half through, and I {{needed to get}} a new forty-odd-person team assembled, trained, and {{deployed}} prior to Butler's arrival in Iraq on August 2. We would use the same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much longer. I would make use of some twenty-five inspectors resident in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and <b>I</b> <b>added</b> twelve experts, {{selected on the basis of}} what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. Somehow it all came together. The inspections would begin on the morning of the 6th.|$|E
25|$|In 1640 Sultan Ibrahim <b>I</b> <b>added</b> the Circumcision Room (Sünnet Odası), {{a summer}} kiosk (Yazlik Oda) {{dedicated}} to the circumcision of young princes, which is a religious tradition in Islam for cleanliness and purity. Its interior and exterior are decorated with a mixed collection of rare recycled tiles such as the blue tiles with flower motifs at the exterior. The {{most important of these}} are the blue and white tile panels influenced by far-eastern ceramics on the chamber facade, dated 1529. These once embellished ceremonial buildings of Sultan Suleiman I, such as the building of the Council Hall and the Inner Treasury (both in the Second Courtyard) and the Throne Room (in the Third Courtyard). They were moved here out of nostalgia and reverence for the golden age of his reign. These tiles then served as prototypes for the decoration of the Yerevan and Baghdad kiosks. The room itself is symmetrically proportioned and relatively spacious for the palace, with windows, each with a small fountain. The windows above contain some stained-glass panels. On {{the right side of the}} entrance stands a fireplace with a gilded hood. Sultan Ibrahim also built the arcaded roof around the Chamber of the Holy Mantle and the upper terrace between this room and the Baghdad kiosk.|$|E

500|$|In {{an early}} {{recollection}} of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): [...] "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal." [...] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was [...] "almost nil", he and Ditko had [...] "worked on storyboards together and <b>I</b> <b>added</b> a few ideas. But {{the whole thing was}} created by Steve on his own... I think <b>I</b> <b>added</b> the business about the webs coming out of his hands." ...|$|E
500|$|The reason <b>I</b> <b>added</b> the piccolo trumpet and {{classical}} {{section in the}} middle of Let's All Chant' was mainly because I was embarrassed!

I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, so I was really feeling embarrassed ...|$|E
500|$|Dryden's {{salary for}} the laureateship was £200 per year. In 1630 Charles <b>I</b> <b>added</b> an annual [...] "butt of Canary wine", {{although}} this was later discontinued {{in place of}} the monetary equivalent. When John Betjeman was appointed, he rekindled the tradition, and received 720 bottles of sherry; as at 2015 this practice continues. Since Motion's appointment the DCMS provided an annual honorarium of £5,750; Motion also received an additional £19,000 for his work in education. With Duffy's appointment, the salary returned to £5,750 and the barrel of sherry.|$|E

500|$|Another {{scene in}} which Ottman meshed his editing and {{composing}} duties was when Dussander wakes {{up in the hospital}} with the television show The Jeffersons playing in the background. Ottman explained his intent for the scene, [...] "I used The Jeffersons as this innocuous thing—going between him and the television—so that when he does open his eyes, it scares the hell out of you... <b>I</b> <b>added</b> this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound." [...] Ottman recorded the film's score with the Seattle Symphony.|$|E

"So I {{head out}} there and he plays me the track and it sounds exactly like how {{you want it to}} sound: forward moving, interesting, light-hearted, heavy-hearted, fucking {{incredible}} sounding jam.

That whole first week I was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'. We were just eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like, 'Fuck, {{this is going to be}} the festival closer.' I was like, 'Yeah, cool.' It kind of freaked me out." ...|$|E
500|$|Steinitz {{strove to}} be {{objective}} in his writings about chess competitions and games, for example he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at {{some of his own}} rhetoric, for example [...] "I remarked that I would rather die in America than live in England. ... <b>I</b> <b>added</b> that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia around the time of the 1895–96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E

500|$|Ferraro told Sound On Sound {{that she}} did add a bass drum sample, as she felt that the kick was missing something. [...] "Rather than equalise it, <b>I</b> <b>added</b> {{a little bit of}} my sample to make the BD track sound bigger". However she did alter the two piano {{elements}} of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, strings and guitar samples. She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which [...] "were extensively processed", including equalization and de-essing. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio. Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format, 24-bit/44.1kHz. He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song, particularly the bass drums and low synths.|$|E
500|$|In 1385, in {{the wake}} of the Battle of Aljubarrota, a second dynasty was founded when John, Master of the Order of Aviz and illegitimate son of King Peter I, acceded to the throne as John I. To his {{personal}} banner, John <b>I</b> <b>added</b> his Order's fleur-de-lys cross, displayed as green flowery points on the red bordure; this inclusion reduced the number of castles to twelve (three around each corner). The number of bezants in each escutcheon was reduced from eleven to seven. This banner lasted a hundred years until John I's great-grandson John II restyled it, in 1485, introducing important changes: the removal of the Aviz cross, a downward arrangement and edge-smoothing of the shields, and the definitive fixing of five saltire-arranged bezants in each shield (summing up six quinas, i.e., six “groups of five”: one quina of shields and five quinas of bezants) and seven castles on the bordure (as it is currently). John II's banner was the last armorial square banner used as the [...] "national" [...] flag or standard. Following his death, in 1495, radical changes were made by his successor.|$|E
500|$|... "Today" [...] was {{the first}} song Corgan wrote for Siamese Dream. Corgan said, [...] "The day after I wrote 'Today,' my manager heard it and said, 'It's a hit,' and I guess in a way, it was." [...] Corgan played the self-recorded demo to {{producer}} Butch Vig and {{to the rest of}} his band, all of whom responded positively. [...] "Today" [...] already had a chord progression and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song. One day, [...] "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head", Corgan said. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>added</b> the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. Suddenly, I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud." [...] Soon afterwards, Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of [...] "Today".|$|E
