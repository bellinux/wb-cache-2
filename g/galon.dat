25|$|Typically {{new words}} were {{initially}} being written {{in their original}} form, especially when {{they were used to}} describe English or American contexts. Such was the case of the word budget, first recorded as such in 1792 in relation to English economy, but soon also used in Polish context. With time the word was assimilated and remains in modern Polish dictionaries, written as budżet. Early 19th century Dictionary of the Polish Language by Samuel Linde includes the following Anglicisms: foksal (after London's suburb of Vauxhall; meaning an evening garden party in contemporary Polish), <b>galon,</b> klub, kwakier, piknik, poncz, rum and porter.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920 {{the first}} {{university}} students strike in history {{broke out in}} protest against the new University Act which the students believed would only benefit the elite and perpetuate colonial rule. 'National Schools' sprang up {{across the country in}} protest against the colonial education system, and the strike came to be commemorated as 'National Day'. There were further strikes and anti-tax protests in the later 1920s led by the Wunthanu athins. Prominent among the political activists were Buddhist monks (pongyi), such as U Ottama and U Seinda in the Arakan who subsequently led an armed rebellion against the British and later the nationalist government after independence, and U Wisara, the first martyr of the movement to die after [...] a protracted hunger strike in prison. (One of the main thoroughfares in Yangon is named after U Wisara.) In December 1930, a local tax protest by Saya San in Tharrawaddy quickly grew into first a regional and then a national insurrection against the government. Lasting for two years, the <b>Galon</b> rebellion, named after the mythical garuda — the enemy of the nāgas (i.e., the British) – emblazoned on the pennants the rebels carried, required thousands of British troops to suppress along with promises of further political reform. The eventual trial of Saya San, who was executed, allowed several future national leaders, including Ba Maw and U Saw, who participated in his defence, to rise to prominence.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Galon</b> has a third vital {{symbolic}} role: in most depictions, the <b>Galon</b> is {{a vehicle}} for Vishnu, one of three great deities of the Brahmanic universe. Therefore, the <b>Galon</b> is also regarded a super-potent, triple-threat protector.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Galons</b> dancienneté ("Veterans Braid") {{were long}} service awards {{in the form}} of cloth braid chevrons (nicknamed Brisques, or [...] "Breaks") worn on the upper left sleeve to {{indicate}} seniority.

5000|$|In 1777, the French ancien régime {{army had}} used <b>Galons</b> d'ancienneté, or [...] "Seniority Braid" [...] (cloth braid chevrons nicknamed brisures > [...] "breaks") worn {{on the upper}} sleeves awarded for each seven years of enlistment. Soldiers who wore such emblems were called briscards ("breakers"). The {{practice}} was continued in Napoleon Bonaparte's army {{in which they were}} awarded for 10, 15, and 20 years of service. The French Army later moved them to the lower sleeves and the rank stripes to the upper sleeves. Service chevrons were worn on the lower left sleeve and Wound Stripes were worn on the lower right sleeve (influencing the American Wound Chevron device).|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, the anticancer drug imatinib (Glivec®) {{appeared}} on the market, exhibiting a new mode of action by selective kinase inhibition. Consequently, kinases became a validated therapeutic target, {{paving the way for}} further developments. Although these kinases have been thoroughly studied, none of the compounds commercialized since then target cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Following a recent and detailed review on the subject by <b>Galons</b> et al., we concentrate our attention on an updated list of compounds under clinical evaluation (phase I/II/III) and discuss their mode of action as ATP-competitive inhibitors. CDK inhibition profiles and clinical development stages are reported for the 14 compounds under clinical evaluation. Also, tentative progress for forthcoming potential ATP non-competitive inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors are briefly described, along with their limitations...|$|R
50|$|First, after British {{rule has}} arrived, the Nāga was {{generally}} {{recognized as the}} symbol for the British, while the <b>Galon</b> stood for Burma. Thus in one sense, the <b>Galon</b> was a triumphant symbol of resistance or anti-British sentiment, as the <b>Galon</b> is the vanquisher of the Nāga.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Galon,</b> is a well-recognized {{figure in}} the {{literature}} of Hindu-Buddhist Southeast Asia. <b>Galon</b> was a fabulous bird of Hindu mythology. It is often depicted in combat with the Nāga. This cosmic battle between <b>galon</b> and nāga would come to represent ideas about the power of nature, the dualities of the world, and the challenges of the human conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{weeks after}} the battle the French heard rumours that Rivière's body had been savagely {{mutilated}} and buried near the Black Flag stronghold of Phu Hoai. On 18 September 1883, acting on information received from Vietnamese informants, the French scouted the area with two battalions of marine infantry. Rivière's severed head and hands, buried in a lacquered box, were discovered {{in the village of}} Kien Mai, and three weeks later the mutilated body of a European, dressed in naval uniform, was found close to Paper Bridge, near the spot where Rivière had fallen on 19 May. The body had been gashed with sword slashes, the head and the hands were missing, and the sleeves of the naval tunic had been cut away to remove the marks of rank. Several French naval officers who knew Rivière well were able to confirm that the body was indeed his. These circumstances strongly suggested that Rivière had been killed in the heat of battle, on the battlefield of Paper Bridge. Liu Yongfu had offered a substantial bounty for the heads of French officers, graded according to their rank, and it seems likely that a Black Flag soldier had killed the wounded French commander and then decapitated him in order to claim the bounty, cutting off his hands so that his rank could be verified by the number of bands (<b>galons)</b> on his tunic cuffs.|$|R

50|$|Secondly, The Galon-Nāga {{symbolism}} {{also had}} other meanings. In Eastern mythology, the <b>Galon</b> represents the sun-force or solar energy, in natural {{opposition to the}} liquid quality of earthly waters. The Nāga is an earth symbol that, in its embodiment in serpentine form, partakes of the magical symbolic properties of liquids. The liquid of the serpent is especially fascinating {{because it is a}} poison. The <b>Galon</b> is the killer of serpents, and thus the possessor of supernatural power against all forms of lethal poison. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} most Burmans regarded certain tattoos as effective protection against snakebite. Perhaps at some time in history the tattoo dyes or needles had some genuine medicinal property. On this count we can only speculate, but, in any case, it was a well-entrenched article of Burmese belief. Thus the <b>Galon</b> itself was a symbol or effecter of invulnerability.|$|E
