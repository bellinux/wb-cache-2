25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The <b>included</b> <b>angle</b> of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E

50|$|The {{smaller the}} angle between the blade and stone, the sharper the knife will be, but the less side force {{is needed to}} bend the edge over or chip it off. The angle between the blade and the stone is the edge angle - the angle from the {{vertical}} {{to one of the}} knife edges, and equals the angle at which the blade is held. The total angle {{from one side to the}} other is called the <b>included</b> <b>angle</b> - on a symmetric double-ground edge (a wedge shape), the angle from one edge to the other is thus twice the edge angle. Typical edge angles are about 20° (making the <b>included</b> <b>angle</b> 40° on a double-ground edge). The edge angle for very sharp knives can be as little as 10 degrees (for a 20° <b>included</b> <b>angle).</b> Knives that require a tough edge (such as those that chop) may sharpen at 25° or more.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFinite element {{analyses}} of 3 D quadrilateral meshes for automotive body-in-white panels have stringent mesh quality requirements. Several mesh quality metrics, namely element <b>included</b> <b>angles,</b> minimum Jacobian determinant, skew, taper, warp, aspect ratio, minimum element length etc. {{need to be}} within acceptable limits. No constitutive relations exist that can tie all these parameters to a single metric that mesh post-processing can target. In the paper presented, a 3 D optimization smoothing algorithm is proposed based on element <b>included</b> <b>angles</b> with the constraints of a minimum edge length and geometry fidelity envelope. A complex cost-function is set up for each element based on <b>included</b> element <b>angle</b> at the element corners. Element angle perturbation methods are devised to exercise local control on <b>included</b> <b>angles</b> of quadrilateral and mixed meshes. A minimization principle is worked out {{to reduce the cost}} function to an acceptable limit. Goal proximity is defined by acceptable error norms and ranges. Mesh nodes are repositioned iteratively but bound by a geometry fidelity envelope apart from the minimum element edge length constraint. Striking improvement in mesh quality statistics is reported with reasonably monotonic solution convergence patterns...|$|R
