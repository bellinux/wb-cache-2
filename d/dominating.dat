5|$|After Cao's {{defeat at}} the naval Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD, China was divided into three spheres of influence, with Cao Cao <b>dominating</b> the north, Sun Quan (182–252 AD) <b>dominating</b> the south, and Liu Bei (161–223 AD) <b>dominating</b> the west. Cao Cao died in March 220 AD. By December his son Cao Pi (187–226 AD) had Emperor Xian {{relinquish}} the throne to him and is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Wei. This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between three states: Cao Wei, Eastern Wu, and Shu Han.|$|E

30|$|The paper {{uses the}} <b>dominate</b> tree of depth-first search tree {{calculation}} program to CFG [15]. The {{complexity of the}} method is similar to linear time. The <b>dominate</b> tree of CFG describes the control dependency of the program, as shown in Fig.  2 b. Judgment <b>dominate</b> B 2 is an immediate <b>dominate</b> of assignment <b>dominates</b> B 3 and B 4 and judgment <b>dominate</b> B 4 is an immediate <b>dominate</b> of B 5 at the same time. That is {B 3, B 4 } control and rely on B 2 and {B 5 } controls and relies on B 4.|$|R
40|$|While a <b>dominated</b> choice {{involves}} {{a situation in}} which one option clearly <b>dominates</b> another on all relevant dimensions, an asymmetrically <b>dominated</b> choice typically arises where at least two options do not <b>dominate</b> each other and one (but not both) of those options does <b>dominate</b> a third option. We demonstrate that the introduction of such an asymmetrically <b>dominated</b> option can have a significant impact upon choices between non-dominated options within the same choice set for non-market goods. Furthermore, we show that this effect can then translate into significant impacts upon subsequent valuations for those non-dominated options. ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} a block M {{immediately}} <b>dominates</b> block N if M <b>dominates</b> N, {{and there is no}} intervening block P such that M <b>dominates</b> P and P <b>dominates</b> N. In other words, M is the last dominator on all paths from entry to N. Each block has a unique immediate dominator.|$|R
5|$|The Penguins {{registered}} 25 {{shots on}} goal, and the Sabres had 37, <b>dominating</b> {{the second and}} overtime periods, leading those 14–2 and 7–0, respectively. Each goalie allowed one goal in playing time not including the shootout, giving Conklin 36 saves for the Penguins, and Miller 24 for the Sabres.|$|E

5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised <b>dominating</b> influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5000|$|A 4-cycle C4 has {{domination}} number two: {{any single}} vertex only <b>dominates</b> {{itself and its}} two neighbors, but any pair of vertices <b>dominates</b> the whole graph. The product [...] is a four-dimensional hypercube graph; it has 16 vertices, and any single vertex can only <b>dominate</b> itself and four neighbors, so three vertices could only <b>dominate</b> 15 of the 16 vertices. Therefore, at least four vertices are required to <b>dominate</b> the entire graph, the bound given by Vizing's conjecture.|$|R

Tottenham created their best chance to score in the first half, but struggled to find a breakthrough in the second half, hardly troubling the Arsenal defence. With neither team able to score after 90 minutes, the match ended in a draw, meaning each team held the trophy for six months each.|$|E
5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev soon would maximize his grip on power and would be the <b>dominating</b> authority in the collective leadership.|$|E
