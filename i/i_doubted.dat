25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E
500|$|During the shooting, {{the crew}} had some {{problems}} in filming some scenes. Leto told MTV News, [...] "It's been an incredible adventure, but it's also been really difficult, {{because there are so}} many people, and we're shutting down streets of Los Angeles." [...] He further said that they were really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three takes that we had time to do. The first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal." [...] The music video premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.|$|E

60|$|CRAMPTON (subsiding unwillingly). <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> whether <b>I</b> {{ought to}} sit here and countenance all this. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> it.|$|R

60|$|I {{heard the}} woman plainly--and yet, I declare, <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> the {{evidence}} of my senses.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked on}} rapidly without answering. The {{circumstances}} under which the Count had left the theatre suggested to me that his extraordinary anxiety to escape Pesca might carry him to further extremities still. He might escape me, too, by leaving London. <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> the future if I allowed him {{so much as a}} day's freedom to act as he pleased. And <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> that foreign stranger, who had got the start of us, and whom I suspected of intentionally following him out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven be praised! You {{are back}} sooner than I expected, {{by a long}} way. I heard voices talking, so <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> whether it was you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said. [...] "This {{world is}} out of joint. It's broken up, and <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> if it will heal. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> very much if it'll heal. We're in the {{beginning}} of the Sickness of the World." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'My dearest--forgive me; I confess <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> you--but I {{was beside}} myself,' {{came to her}} ears from over her shoulder. But Ethelberta walked on as before.|$|E
60|$|At first, <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> {{whether she}} was in jest or in earnest. The next instant, I remembered that the {{secretary}} had expressly cautioned me against that man.|$|E
60|$|The {{examination}} was over, though <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> if the Coroner {{was entirely}} satisfied with it. I think {{he suspected that}} Mary Cavendish could tell more if she chose.|$|E
60|$|Object. 5. But, says another, I fear I {{come too}} late; <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> have staid too long; I am afraid {{the door is}} shut.|$|R

6000|$|... "But I {{know him}} to be unworthy. Even if he had come here to offer you his hand <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> whether <b>I</b> could have {{permitted}} an engagement. Do you know that within {{the last two months}} he has twice offered to marry another young woman, and <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> whether he is not at this moment engaged to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Afraid, eh? Of whom? Mr. Brown? Ah, that tickles you up! There {{is such a}} person, then? <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> it. And {{the mere}} mention of him scares you stiff!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{worse than}} that," [...] replied Noel Vanstone penitently. [...] "I {{committed}} an outrage {{on my own}} feelings. I disgraced myself by saying that <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> Miss Bygrave!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{snatched}} the slates {{from the table}} and studied the lines, which were made up of minute dots. It was all perfectly legible: [...] "Son. <b>I</b> <b>doubted.</b> Now I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you {{may soon}} have an {{opportunity}} of showing Hotspur what you are made of. And now, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> not that you are hungry. I will send down to the buttery, {{for a couple of}} tankards and a pasty. I had my supper two hours ago, but <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> not that <b>I</b> can keep you company in another." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. Do {{you think}} {{my way of}} life would suit you? <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|Tom {{shook his}} head doubtfully. [...] "I hope so, but <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> whether <b>I</b> shall be suited again till I get home, and Master John the bowyer makes one {{specially}} suitable for me, and six inches longer than ordinary. Still, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> not that, if it be needed, I shall {{be able to make}} shift with one of those at Villeroy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{to thank}} you," [...] I said, [...] "for your bravery and loyalty--you were magnificent. I am sorry that you had reason before to think that <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> you." ...|$|E

6000|$|What it {{was that}} <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> I knew not. It was not her love, or her honour, or her truth, or her kindness, or her zeal. What then was it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> {{whether we}} should have ever taken her {{if she had not}} been so deep in the water with the guns and stores she had on board. The French {{certainly}} know how to build ships; {{there is no question about}} that. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> whether we have such a good-looking gun-boat in the service. Anyhow I have not seen one." ...|$|R
6000|$|Object. Alas, but {{how shall}} <b>I</b> come? <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> {{do not come}} as I should do? My heart is naught and dead; and, alas! then how should I come? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; I was firm. Deering {{wanted to}} go down to you; but <b>I</b> <b>doubted</b> if he could get down and the {{important}} thing was to fetch help. You must be moved as soon as possible." ...|$|E
