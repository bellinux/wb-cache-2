US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds {{are not subject to}} both entity-level and personal-level taxation. A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a <b>general</b> <b>partner.</b> The <b>general</b> <b>partner</b> may be an individual or a corporation. The <b>general</b> <b>partner</b> serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability. The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions. Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|R
50|$|In {{a limited}} partnership, {{it is the}} <b>general</b> <b>partner</b> who remains liable for the debts and {{obligations}} of the entity. For larger risk exposure, a company (corporation) may be formed {{to serve as the}} <b>general</b> <b>partner.</b> A corporate <b>general</b> <b>partner</b> is protected from direct attack by a judgment creditor because the ultimate liability for the debts and obligations rests with the shareholders. By spreading share ownership, individual exposure is considerably reduced. Even without a corporate <b>general</b> <b>partner,</b> risk can be spread by distribution of limited partnership shares. If a judgment creditor obtains a charging order against one partner, the order goes to that partners share in distributions from the partnership, and not to the entire business.|$|R

50|$|Family Limited Partnerships (commonly called FLPs) are {{frequently}} used to move wealth {{from one generation}} to another. <b>Partners</b> are either <b>General</b> <b>Partners</b> (GP) or Limited <b>Partners</b> (LP). One or more <b>General</b> <b>Partners</b> are responsible for managing the FLP and its assets. Limited Partners have an economic interest in the FLP, but typically lack two noteworthy rights: control and marketability. Limited Partners have no ability to control, direct, or otherwise influence the operations of the FLP. They can neither buy additional assets, nor sell existing assets, and they cannot act on the Partnership's behalf. They also substantially lack the ability to sell their interest, with one typical exception: transfers to immediate family members (spouse, siblings, and direct lineal descendants and ascendants). FLPs are partnerships limited to family members, hence the name.|$|R
