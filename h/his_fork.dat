25|$|Christophe {{was still}} in Grenoble {{at the start of}} stage eleven, when tour {{organiser}} Henri Desgrange gave him a yellow jersey, so that he could easily be recognized. The colour was inspired by the colour of the organizing newspaper l'Auto, although another explanation is that other colours were not available in the post-war shortage. Christophe was not happy with his yellow jersey, and other cyclists called him a canary. At that point in the race, it was likely that Christophe would stay the leader {{until the end of the}} Tour de France, because he remained in that yellow jersey after the Pyrénées and the Alps. In the penultimate stage, Firmin Lambot, who was in second position, more than 28 minutes behind, attacked. Christophe, still leading the race, chased him, but broke <b>his</b> <b>fork</b> close to Valenciennes. The rules were such that cyclists could get no help at all, so Christophe repaired his bicycle himself. This same thing had already cost him the victory in 1913, and would happen to him for a third time in 1922. It took him over two and a half hours, and he had lost the lead to Lambot. In the last stage, Christophe had a record number of punctures, and also lost his second place to Jean Alavoine.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1970 the Monty Python team {{stayed at}} the Gleneagles Hotel (which is {{referred}} to in [...] "The Builders" [...] episode) in Torquay while filming on location. John Cleese was fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, later describing him as [...] "the rudest man I've ever come across in my life." [...] This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Python member Eric Idle's briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb. Sinclair justified his actions by claiming the hotel had [...] "staff problems". He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam's table manners for not being [...] "British" [...] (that is, he switched hands with <b>his</b> <b>fork</b> whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of its owner. (Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.) ...|$|E
60|$|James started {{so violently}} that he struck {{himself in the}} left eye with <b>his</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
50|$|Representations of Cocijo combine {{elements}} earth-jaguar and sky-serpent, {{which are}} associated with fertility. His eyebrows depict the heavens, his lower lids represent clouds, and <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> serpent's tongue represents a bolt of lightning.|$|R
5000|$|... "Then Raudalo {{turned him}} about, [...] [...] [...] and put forth <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> tongue, and touched {{with the tip}} of it the angry waters which were about to cover him. And on a sudden the sea rose no more, but began to flow {{down the side of the}} {{mountain}}. Still was Raudalo not content, and he pursued the flood down the hill, ever and anon putting forth <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> tongue that there might be no tarrying on the way. Thus went they down the mountain and over the plain country until the sea shore was reached. And the waters lay in their bed once more and the flood was stayed." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{professor}} {{set down}} <b>his</b> knife and <b>fork.</b> <b>His</b> appearance {{was one of}} ponderous theatricality.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lander beckoned {{and called}} to the man, who had stopped {{pitching}} hay and now stood leaning on the handle of <b>his</b> <b>fork.</b> At the signs and sounds she made, he came actively forward to the road, bringing <b>his</b> <b>fork</b> with him. When he arrived within easy conversational distance, he planted the tines {{in the ground and}} braced himself at an opposite incline from the long smooth handle, and waited for Mrs. Lander to begin.|$|E
60|$|An {{answering}} glare {{came into}} Will's eyes. He grasped and slightly shook <b>his</b> <b>fork,</b> {{which he had}} brought with him unconsciously.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{as the man}} did not answer, Weston solemnly {{laid down}} <b>his</b> <b>fork,</b> with the manner of one making a painful sacrifice.|$|E
60|$|Johnny at once rode off. The {{suspicious}} David {{looked after}} him and showed a tendency to retire {{in the direction of}} his nest, but Hobson raised <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> stick over the hedge and made a demonstration therewith. This was more than enough.|$|R
50|$|One man sees a riselka: <b>his</b> life <b>forks</b> there.|$|R
60|$|Athalbrand, who was watching, {{tugged at}} <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> beard and muttered {{something}} {{that sounded like}} an oath. Then he rode off, kicking his horse savagely and not noting my outstretched hand, or so it seemed. Of this, however, I took little heed, for I was engaged in kissing Iduna in farewell.|$|R
60|$|The mate, {{who had a}} {{piece of}} {{dumpling}} on <b>his</b> <b>fork,</b> half-way to his mouth, put it down again and regarded him open-mouthed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Try a bit o' plum-duff, Mrs Mitford," [...] {{suggested}} Massey, with well-intentioned sincerity, {{holding up}} a lump of the viand on <b>his</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suppose,' said Sir Mulberry, pausing with a morsel on {{the point}} of <b>his</b> <b>fork,</b> 'suppose {{we go back to the}} subject of little Nickleby, eh?' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} John {{returned}} to the room, {{to see how we}} were getting on, and to count <b>his</b> <b>forks</b> and spoons, for I saw the fellow actually doing it. My uncle, somewhat indiscreetly, I fancied, but by merely following the chain of thought then uppermost in his mind, detained him in conversation.|$|R
60|$|Lawson {{put down}} <b>his</b> knife and <b>fork.</b> <b>His</b> green eyes flashed fire, he gasped with rage; {{but he could}} be seen {{imposing}} calm upon himself.|$|R
5000|$|The forks {{which cost}} Christophe the race {{were taken away}} by Peugeot. He didn't see them again until a dying man bequeathed them to him more than 30 years later. Some reports say that Christophe broke <b>his</b> <b>forks</b> because he ran into a car on the descent. The {{historian}} and author, Bill McGann, says: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{projected}} {{a foot in}} {{his direction}} under the table, regretting I had discarded my working boots, and Haldane, dropping <b>his</b> <b>fork,</b> looked up sharply.|$|E
60|$|Kipps jabbed his lip with <b>his</b> <b>fork</b> rather painfully, and was {{recalled}} from a fascinated {{glare at}} Mrs. Botting {{to the immediate}} facts of dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{identified}} the big block to the left," [...] he observed, and pointed with <b>his</b> <b>fork</b> at a square formed by several rows of lights.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hakon!" [...] {{broke in}} Athalbrand. [...] "Why, I knew him well, for {{in my youth}} we were comrades in war. He was the wealthiest man in Jutland in cattle, lands, thralls and stored gold. Young friend, your luck is great," [...] and he stared first at Steinar, then at Iduna, pulling <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> beard and muttering words to himself that I could not catch.|$|R
60|$|Sakr-el-Bahr {{entered the}} {{courtyard}} on foot, having dismounted at the gate. Tall and imposing, {{with his head}} high and <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> beard thrusting forward, he stalked with great dignity {{to the foot of}} the divan followed by Ali and a mahogany-faced fellow, turbaned and red-bearded, in whom it needed more than a glance to recognize the rascally Jasper Leigh, now in all the panoply of your complete renegado.|$|R
6000|$|King. The event, {{the event}} will shew us what we were; For, like a blazing meteor hence he shot, And drew a {{sweeping}} fiery train along.-- O Paris, Paris, once my seat of triumph, But now the scene of all thy king's misfortunes; Ungrateful, perjured, and disloyal town, Which by my royal presence I have warmed So long, that now the serpent hisses out, And shakes <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> tongue at majesty, While I-- ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{dinner that}} day Captain Bream {{paused in the}} act of {{conveying}} a whole potato to his mouth on the end of <b>his</b> <b>fork,</b> and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|Jack {{glowered at}} her with the one unbandaged eye, and growled {{something}} under his breath, {{and then began to}} stab meat and potatoes with <b>his</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He stood {{perfectly}} still {{until they had}} gone out of sight behind the banks down by the brooks, then he stuck <b>his</b> <b>fork</b> in the ground, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|And when he {{saw them}} coming he lifted up his head, and watched them with his small bright eyes, and flashed <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> tongue, and roared like the fire among the woodlands, till the forest tossed and groaned. For his cries shook the trees from leaf to root, and swept over the long reaches of the river, and over Aietes’ hall, and woke the {{sleepers}} in the city, till mothers clasped their children in their fear.|$|R
2500|$|Apart from Jesus and the Virgin Mary, the {{characters}} depicted wear the clothes worn in the 16th century by Breton peasants and the bourgeoisie. The guards wear helmets, breastplates and leggings. [...] Pontius Pilate wears ermine {{and has a}} mortar on his head looking much like a bailiff of the time. The depiction of the devil wears the attire of a pilgrim which he raises slightly to display <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> feet. Mary Magdalene wears the dress of a châtelaine of Henry II's time, with heavily pleated robe, slashed sleeves and a lace guimpe ...|$|R
60|$|The warning, however, {{was quite}} unnecessary. Sardanapalus, instead of springing, seemed to {{recognise}} a friend. He darted out <b>his</b> <b>forked</b> tongue in rapid vibration, and licked her neat grey glove respectfully. Then, lifting his flattened head with serpentine deliberation, he coiled his great folds slowly, slowly, with sinuous curves, round the girl's soft arm till he reached her neck in long, winding convolutions. There {{he held up}} his face, and trilled his swift, sibilant tongue once more with evident pleasure. He knew his place. He was perfectly at home at once with the pretty, olive-skinned lady. His master looked on in profound surprise.|$|R
6000|$|Not so his {{volatile}} retainer, who stuck <b>his</b> <b>fork</b> into {{a lump of}} meat vindictively, as if it {{had been}} the body of a McLeod, and exclaimed:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{politics}} do not {{interest me}} in the least," [...] Clive sighs out, drawing pictures with <b>his</b> <b>fork</b> on his napkin, and not heeding the other's interruption.|$|E
60|$|Waterville {{gave his}} {{companion}} a serious glance; he thought him strangely superficial. The alternatives looked all formidable, however, and he sighed as he laid down <b>his</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
60|$|Captain Bligh {{put down}} <b>his</b> knife and <b>fork</b> and eyed her uneasily.|$|R
60|$|He dropped <b>his</b> {{knife and}} <b>fork</b> {{and looked at}} me with indignation.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Waddington {{laid down}} <b>his</b> knife and <b>fork.</b> He was {{intensely}} interested.|$|R
