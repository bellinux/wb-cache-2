In 2003, {{it was reported that}} of the 54farms on the moss, occupying , almost half the area of the bog, only three were growing vegetables. Others <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> arable farming, turf growing or horse livery instead of salad and vegetable crops. Chat Moss also contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Grandaddy {{was formed}} in 1992 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Jason Lytle, bassist Kevin Garcia and drummer Aaron Burtch. The group was {{initially}} influenced by US punk bands such as Suicidal Tendencies and Bad Brains. Lytle was a former professional skateboarder, who <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> music after a knee injury forced him to stop skating, working at a sewage treatment works to fund the purchase of equipment, {{and several of the}} band's early live performances were at skateboarding competitions.|$|E
5|$|The demon Tarakasura {{had created}} havoc in the universe, {{and only the}} son of god Shiva could slay him, but Shiva <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> ascetic ways {{after the death of his}} first wife, Sati. Kama was thus {{instructed}} by the gods to make Shiva fall in love again. Kama went to Mount Kailash with Rati and Madhu or Vasanta ("Spring"), and shot his love-arrows at Shiva (in another version of the legend, Kama entered Shiva's mind) and invoked desire. Wounded by Kama's arrows, Shiva becomes attracted to Parvati, the reincarnation of Sati, but agitated, burns Kama by a glance of his third eye.|$|E

5|$|Around 05:00UTC on November9, the cyclone made {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} in eastern India, near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, {{and close to}} the city of Ichchapuram. Although the IMD officially estimated peak winds of 120km/h (75mph), winds could have been as high as 150km/h (95mph), based on the damage and estimates from the Dvorak technique. After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00UTC on November9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November10. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low, by which time the system <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast and spread into Nepal. The circulation dissipated, although moisture and convection from the storm spread through Nepal.|$|E
5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on}} the protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Following the First Siege of Constantinople by the Avars and Persians, {{the beleaguered}} Byzantine Emperor Heraclius found himself {{politically}} isolated. He could {{not rely on}} the Christian Armenian potentates of Transcaucasia, since they were branded as heretics by the Orthodox Church, and even the king of Iberia preferred to befriend the religiously tolerant Persians. Against this dismal background, he found a natural ally in Tong Yabghu. Earlier in 568, the Turks under Istämi <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Byzantium when their relations with Persia soured over commerce issues. Istämi sent an embassy led by the Sogdian diplomat Maniah directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk {{as a gift to}} Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct Chinese silk trade desired by the Sogdians.|$|E

5|$|The confessional {{conflicts}} {{that dominated the}} relations between the ruling city authorities were only secondary to the peasants of the Huttwil league. The peasant alliance bridged the confessional divide, uniting Catholic people from the Entlebuch and from Solothurn with Protestant peasants from the Emmental and from Basel. The treaty of Huttwil explicitly recognized this biconfessionalism. The cities remained in all their manoeuvring and negotiations for military support within their respective confessional spheres: Catholic Lucerne had requested mediation and then military help from the Catholic central Swiss cantons, while Protestant Bern <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Protestant Zürich for help. The distrust between the authorities of the Catholic and Protestant cantons was so deep that none would allow troops of the other confession to operate on their territories.|$|E
5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> him for help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA {{was ready to}} step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking {{to get out of the}} film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E
5|$|By 19 March Fay's track <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the west-southwest, {{and over}} the next day it {{continued}} to strengthen in due to favourable upper level outflow and weak vertical sheer. On 21 March, Fay became a Category5 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. A mid-latitude trough caused the steering ridge to weaken, and subsequently, Fay to turn to the south. Over the next two days, the environmental shear around the cyclone decreased, which would normally have led to intensification; however, as the shear decreased, the cyclone also moved over an area of dry air, weakening the system. By 23 March, Fay had moved in a loop, and the system weakened to a Category 2. Over the next day, favourable outflow counteracted the dry air that had weakened the system, and a banding eye feature was observed on satellite imagery. Fay then encountered moister air as it moved southward, leading it to re-intensify on 25 March. A weak eye of 10 nm was observed on 26 March which grew to 15nm as the day went on. Strengthening into a Category 4 system early on 27 March, Fay made landfall on the Pilbara coast between 8am and 9am AWST (0000 and 0100UTC) with winds of , weakening below cyclone strength somewhere between the towns of Nullagine and Telfer.|$|E

5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team. The season got {{underway}} two months late due to cancellation of Austrian and Venezuelan rounds. Barry Sheene {{had been replaced by}} Randy Mamola as the top Suzuki rider as, Sheene had been dissatisfied with the Suzuki's efforts and <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> a privateer Yamaha team. Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were making things more difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and a faulty rear shock absorber in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead to hold on and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E
5|$|It {{had taken}} {{a decade and a}} half, from 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.|$|E
5|$|King Haco sailed {{afterwards}} {{south to}} Guðey before Kintyre where he anchored. There King John met him; {{he came in}} the ship with Bishop Thorgil. King Haco desired him to follow his banner as he should do. But King John excused himself. He said he had sworn an oath to the Scottish King, and held of him more lands than of the Norwegian Monarch; he therefore entreated King Haco to dispose of all those estates which he had conferred upon him. King Haco kept him with him some time, and endeavoured to incline his mind to fidelity. Many laid imputations to his charge. King Haco indeed had before received bad accounts of him from the Hebrides; for John Langlife-son came to the King, while he was sailing west from Shetland, and told him the news that John King of the Hebrides, breaking his faith, <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the Scottish Monarch. King Haco, however, would not believe this till he had found it so.|$|E

5|$|Late on July17, Ma-on {{underwent}} another eyewall replacement {{cycle and}} weakened, despite developing improved outflow and convection {{in the northern}} quadrant. The typhoon's large size prevented re-intensification– gale force winds extended 370km (200mi) east of the center. In addition, the intrusion of dry air diminished thunderstorms in the western periphery. By July18, Ma-on reached the western extent of the ridge and began a motion to the north toward Japan. The next day, it turned to the northeast as it paralleled the Japan coastline just offshore. At around 1400UTC on July19, Ma-on made landfall on Shikoku as a minimal typhoon. Turning to the east, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before moving over {{the southern tip of}} the Kii Peninsula early on July20. After emerging from the country, Ma-on turned to the southeast. Increased wind shear displaced the convection to the east, although slight re-intensification was expected. However, the JTWC downgraded Ma-on to a tropical depression on July21 after the storm lost much of its convection. The circulation became ill-defined, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July22, noting the system {{was in the process of}} dissipation. However, the JMA maintained Ma-on as a severe tropical storm until July23, by which time the storm <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast. The storm became extratropical on July24 near the Kuril Islands, lasting another seven days before dissipating east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the tour}} {{represented}} a {{changing of the guard}} in Australian cricket. In their late 30s, Johnson and Miller retired from first-class cricket. In the 1956–57 season, Lindwall took 27 wickets at 23.74 and made 243 runs at 27.00. Having had a successful series in the most recent international fixtures, Lindwall had no reason to expect anything but a continuation of his senior role in the team. Furthermore, having captained the team in the absence of Johnson and Miller, Lindwall was the now the player with the most seniority in terms of leadership. However, when the team for the 1957–58 South African tour was announced, Lindwall's name was omitted altogether. Lindwall heard the news on the radio while he was working, having not being given prior notice. After three consecutive Ashes defeats during Australia's decline in the mid-1950s, the selectors <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> a radical youth policy in an attempt to reverse the slide. Ian Craig was made youngest Australia's captain at the age of 22, having played only six Tests without securing a regular place in the team. The pacemen selected were Davidson, Ian Meckiff, Ron Gaunt and John Drennan. Davidson had managed only 16 wickets at 34.06 in 12 Tests, while the remaining three had yet to play a Test. While Craig's men defeated South Africa 3–0, Lindwall continued his consistent performances for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield, with 26 wickets at 25.77 and 274 runs at 34.25. During the seasons, Lindwall broke Ernie Jones' record of 209 wickets in Shield competitions in his 54th match in the competition.|$|E
