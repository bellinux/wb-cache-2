5|$|Because of {{that and}} four other reasons given by Coke, the college was to stop trying to {{supervise}} medical practice, arbitrating and acting as a court.

He preached, and God, according to his blessing or cursing, did either spare and forgive, or execute <b>his</b> <b>judgments.</b>|$|R
5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} <b>his</b> <b>judgment</b> as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while others argue he meant that the common law courts {{have the power to}} completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E
5|$|The President {{appoints}} as Prime Minister an MP who, in <b>his</b> <b>judgment,</b> {{is likely}} to command {{the confidence of the}} majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|When President Kennedy first {{chartered}} the Moon landing program, {{a preliminary}} cost estimate of $7 billion was generated, but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess {{of what could}} not possibly be determined precisely, and James Webb used <b>his</b> <b>judgment</b> as administrator to change the estimate to $20 billion before giving it to Vice President Johnson.|$|E

5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes <b>his</b> <b>judgment</b> {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E
5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception {{is that most of}} his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with <b>his</b> <b>judgment</b> in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Each {{parliament}} {{lasts for}} {{a maximum of}} five years from the date of its first sitting, and once a parliament has been dissolved a general election must be held within three months.

In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament. The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>judgment</b> of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet {{to release}} its subscribers' {{information}} {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were parties to the case. He explicitly denied Odex access to this information. He upheld District Judge Lau's decision that Odex was not the correct party to have asked for release of subscriber data. As a result, he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$20,000. Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies. The ruling may have set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by {{making it more difficult}} for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Prime Minister is the Head of the Government of Singapore. The President {{appoints}} as Prime Minister an MP who, in <b>his</b> <b>judgment,</b> {{is likely}} to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. This is a power that the President exercises in his personal discretion. The President then acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister to appoint other Ministers from among the Members of Parliament. These Ministers, together with the Prime Minister, form the Cabinet. The Cabinet has the general direction and control of the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The most {{critical}} {{period of the}} fighting in the east occurred when the NK 15th Division broke through the ROK 8th Division to Yongch'on. The North Korean division attempted to turn east and southeast and take Task Force Jackson in the rear or on its left flank. But Walker's quick dispatch of the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments from two widely separated sectors of the front {{to the area of}} penetration resulted in destroying the force before it could exploit its breakthrough. Walker was commended for <b>his</b> <b>judgment</b> of the reinforcements needed to stem the North Korean attacks in the Kyongju and Yongch'on areas.|$|E
5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of <b>his</b> <b>judgment,</b> and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Tonelli won the 100m {{backstroke}}, 200m backstroke and 200m butterfly {{events at}} the Australian Championships. Although he won more individual titles {{than in the previous}} year, his times were slower; he completed the distances in 59.70s, 2m 10.50s and 2m 10.00s respectively. Tonelli was also part of the Queensland team that successfully defended their medley relay title. Tonelli was thus selected for the 1975 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. He qualified fastest for the 200m backstroke final and had planned to pursue an aggressive strategy to attack from the start. However, he was advised to swim conservatively {{in the first half of}} the race by Australian coach Terry Gathercole so that his main rivals Matthes and John Naber would not be able to draft behind him in the early stages. The tactic backfired and Tonelli ended with the silver medal. He had swum faster in the second half of the racesomething exceedingly rare in top-level swimming and an indication of strategic errorand felt that he had too much unused energy left at the end of the race. Tonelli vowed that from then on, he would always back <b>his</b> <b>judgment</b> and race strategy.|$|E
6000|$|Sixth. Wouldest thou grow in this {{grace of}} fear? then take heed of A FORGETFUL HEART. Such a heart {{is not a}} heart where the grace of fear will flourish, [...] "when I {{remember}}, I am afraid," [...] &c. Therefore take heed of forgetfulness; do not forget but remember God, and his kindness, patience, and mercy, to those that yet neither have grace, nor special favour from him, and that will beget and nourish his fear in thy heart, but forgetfulness of this, or of any other of <b>his</b> <b>judgments,</b> is a great wound and weakening to this fear (Job 21:6). When a man well remembers that God's judgments are so great a deep and mystery, as indeed they are, that remembrance puts a man upon such considerations of God and of <b>his</b> <b>judgments</b> as to make him fear--"Therefore," [...] said Job, [...] "I am afraid of him." [...] See the place, Job 23:15. [...] "Therefore am I troubled at his presence; when I consider, I am afraid of him"--when I remember and consider of the wonderful depths of <b>his</b> <b>judgments</b> towards man.|$|R
60|$|Some of his thrusts left embittered feelings, but {{in general}} the tone was so good-natured that only the thin-skinned could object, {{and it must be}} confessed many of <b>his</b> <b>judgments</b> have been {{confirmed}} by Time.|$|R

5|$|Mansfield is {{best known}} for <b>his</b> <b>judgment</b> in Somersett's Case on the {{legality}} of keeping slaves in England. The English had been involved in the slave trade since 1553, and by 1768, ships registered in Liverpool, Bristol and London carried more than half the slaves shipped in the world. James Somersett was a slave owned by Charles Stewart, an American customs officer who sailed to Britain for business, landing on 10 November 1769. A few days later Somersett attempted to escape. He was recaptured in November and imprisoned on the ship Ann and Mary, owned by Captain John Knowles and bound for the British colony of Jamaica. Stewart intended to sell him there. However, three people claiming to be Somersett's godparents, John Marlow, Thomas Walkin and Elizabeth Cade, made an application before the Court of King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus, and Captain Knowles was ordered to produce Somersett before the Court of King's Bench, which would determine whether his imprisonment was legal.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2002, {{while at}} Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan {{attacked}} the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to public schools. Contrary to police advice, {{he chose not}} to apply for a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not need one. Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans. In July, Chee was convicted and fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In <b>his</b> <b>judgment,</b> District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest. Under the Constitution of Singapore, a person who has been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years. As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting <b>his</b> <b>judgment,</b> attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E
