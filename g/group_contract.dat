40|$|The {{strategic}} and welfare implications of <b>group</b> <b>contracts</b> {{for health insurance}} are not well understood. We estimate a model to determine which factors explain the price of <b>group</b> <b>contracts.</b> In countries like the US and the Netherlands health insurance is provided by private firms, which can offer both individual and <b>group</b> <b>contracts.</b> Using a Dutch data set of about 700 <b>group</b> health insurance <b>contracts</b> over the period 2007 - 2008, we find that groups that are located close to an insurers’ home turf pay a higher premium than other groups. This finding is {{not consistent with the}} bargaining argument in the literature, as it implies that concentrated groups close to an insurer’s home turf should get a larger discount (if any) than other groups. A simple Hotelling model, however, does explain our empirical results. ...|$|R

50|$|STEP was {{the name}} for a {{double-blind}} randomized controlled trial managed by the HVTN. It was thoroughly reviewed when {{a greater number of}} participants in the experimental <b>group</b> <b>contracted</b> HIV than the participants in the control group. The vaccine contained no HIV and no one could have contracted HIV from the vaccine, but there was intense discussion as to whether the vaccine could have increased anyone's risk of contracting HIV. Because the study was stopped early, it probably will never be possible to determine why more participants in the experimental <b>group</b> <b>contracted</b> HIV, but various theories have been proposed.|$|R
50|$|With pilot {{production}} decreasing, the ATC commander suggested closing Malden, in early 1959. However, it wasn't until late December 1959 that Headquarters USAF approved the ATC request.

50|$|Group life {{insurance}} (also known as wholesale {{life insurance}} or institutional life insurance) is term insurance covering {{a group of}} people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or superannuation fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the <b>group.</b> <b>Contract</b> provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of adverse selection. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage.The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.|$|E
50|$|The <b>group</b> <b>contract</b> {{provides}} an objective, unchanging structure that all group members can observe {{in relation to}} all other group members' behavior and feelings. All group members agree to follow the contract that Dr. Ormont has developed. They understand its purpose is to guide the group forward in their work together. They discover that they all deviate from the guide from time to time. The group members' resistance to following the agreed upon contract provides a solid basis on which both the leader and group members can explore and study the kinds of stumbling blocks that impede group members {{not only in the}} group process, but in their daily lives.|$|E
50|$|The 3300th Pilot Training <b>Group</b> (<b>Contract</b> Primary) and the 3300th Pilot Training Squadron was reassigned from Greenville AFB to Graham AB {{to support}} the mission, with {{predominantly}} civilian instructors providing training in USAF PA-18 Super Cub and AT-6 Texan, and subsequently T-34 Mentor and T-28 Trojan aircraft, graduating a group of USAF student pilots from primary training every six weeks. Because its short runways could not readily accommodate the USAF jet trainers of the period, student pilots completing primary training were then assigned to other air force bases with longer runways for more advanced training in aircraft such as the T-33 Shooting Star. Although its instructor cadre was primarily civilian, Graham AB was still an Air Force installation with an overall military cadre in command and operated under constant military supervision.|$|E

Weighing up whether {{to take up a}} wider training <b>group</b> <b>contract</b> with the Hurricanes or look at other offers, including one from the Blues. Barrett decided to opt with the Hurricanes to become a Hurricanes wider squad member in 2011 after turning down the offer from the Blues. He was called up by the Hurricanes before the side's 2011 tour to South Africa where he saw time off the bench, earning his first four Hurricanes caps. He made his debut in a 50-47 win over the Central Cheetahs in Bloemfontein, a match that saw the Hurricanes prevail on full-time with a try to lock Jeremy Thrush that Barrett converted.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the Korean War which began in 1950 and the {{expansion}} of the United States Air Force, Bainbridge Air Base* was reopened. The base had deteriorated badly over its six idle years and a major renovation project was required to return it to acceptable standards. In January 1951, rehabilitation of the base began. It was activated on 11 July 1951 by the USAF Air Training Command, as a contract flying training school. The 3306th Pilot Training <b>Group</b> (<b>Contract</b> Flying) was the Operational Training Unit, with ground and flight training being conducted by Southern Airways Company using World War II-era T-6 Texans that had been upgraded and designated as T-6G's. Beginning with Class 54-ABC in the spring of 1953, the first 25 hours of flight instruction was given in Piper Super Cubs (PA-18) with [...] engines. This was examined as a means of reducing the cost of discovering which students would wash out of the program due to lack of flying ability. After this initial 25 hours, flight training was then continued in the T-6G. At this time, in addition to U.S. Air Force personnel (which consisted of aspiring officers as well as Aviation Cadets), personnel from the NATO countries of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were also entered into the USAF flight-training program, and trained alongside their USAF counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{breakthrough}} took place when the West End Lefevre Gallery {{agreed to give}} Cooper’s students a first exhibition, now as the East London Group, in November 1929. Sickert's inclusion, his only showing with the group, was an important draw. Because of wide, complimentary press coverage, the show had to be extended into December. [...] "One {{of the most interesting}} and significant things in the London art season," [...] said the Manchester Guardian about the first Lefevre exhibition. It covered just this one exhibition three times. The show was an enormous commercial success, too, with interest shown by Mayfair art dealers and high society (including Ramsay MacDonald, Lady Cunard, Viscount D’Abernon, and Edward Marsh, a perceptive collector). The noted critic, T W Earp, particularly praised the work of some artists and so the careers were launched of, for example, William Coldstream, Murroe FitzGerald, Archibald Hattemore, Elwin Hawthorne, Cecil Osborne, Henry Silk, Harold Steggles, Walter Steggles and Albert Turpin. By this time Cooper was an established painter, especially of music and musicians, which feature in some of the group shows. Eventually he negotiated a five-year <b>group</b> <b>contract,</b> resulting in eight annual Reid & Lefevre exhibitions through to 1936. Throughout the 1930s, a number of solo exhibitions were additionally held at Lefevre and elsewhere. Group exhibitions were also held outside London and members participated in numerous mixed shows, often alongside prominent artists. [...] 1935 saw a touring exhibition of Canada and the USA, organised through the Courtauld Institute whose founder, Samuel Courtauld, had remained an enthusiastic patron of the Group. [...] In 1936, works by Elwin Hawthorne and Walter Steggles were included in Britain’s contribution to the 1936 Venice Biennale, alongside well known and established artists.|$|E
