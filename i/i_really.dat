5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, I {{believed in the}} record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job and because I wrote the whole thing <b>I</b> <b>really</b> believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted to do something which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|I had the chills. I had a {{great feeling}} about it when we {{finished}} writing the song, and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning... But we were listening to it on the plane ride on the way home, and even from the demo version, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> felt something very special.|$|E

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>really</b> {{wanted to}} sit down with Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|When I {{would look}} at the films as a whole, I would search for story reasons to use 3-D in {{different}} ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were alone in their world, I wanted it to feel consistent to a safer world. And when they went out to the human world, that's when <b>I</b> <b>really</b> blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.|$|E
5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> thought it was over to me.|$|E

5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

25|$|The {{part that}} I never really {{developed}} {{is the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When I got to Jedi, I wanted {{one of the kids}} {{to have some kind of}} memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> debated whether or not Leia should remember her.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>really</b> do {{not think}} that we should have homosexuals guiding our children. I think that it’s a {{lifestyle}} that I don’t agree with. I realize a lot of people do. It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people who do this should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E

25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E
25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. And <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted to write {{something}} which did speed up, and took the emotion and the adrenaline with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that was the idea of it. That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E

25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
25|$|The final {{identity}} perspective Gee identifies is the “affinity perspective (or A-identities)” (p.105). A-identities {{are built}} by shared experiences {{as part of}} an affinity group, which according to Gee’s definition is a group that share “allegiance to, access to, and participation in specific practices” (p.105). Joining these groups must be something the person has chosen to do and feels a part of in order for the A-identity to be built. Gee explains this further by stating, “While I could force someone to engage in specific practices, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> cannot coerce anyone into seeing the particular experiences connected to those practices as constitutive (in part) of the ‘kind of person’ they are” (p.106).|$|E
25|$|In November 2002, {{the book}} “Victoria, Victoria!” came out, {{speaking}} further about her eating disorder. Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E
5000|$|Jude's debut album, 430 N. Harper Ave, was {{released}} independently by the Fish of Death label in 1997.
