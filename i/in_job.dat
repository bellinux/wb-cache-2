5|$|Ohio is {{commonly}} noted as the Nation's Industrial Capital, dating to {{its roots in}} the Rust Belt and Ohio's present-day intelligence and scientific dominance. Ohio was one of four states in the U.S. to have areas make the Intelligent Community Forum's list of global Smart 21 Communities for 2014, with Columbus, Ohio receiving the honors. The state has 5 of the top 115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 2010 rankings, while the Ohio State University was ranked #10 by the same magazine for awarding degrees to Fortune 500 CEOs. The state was ranked #8 by the same magazine in 2008 for best high schools, while overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked #5 in the country by Education Week. However, by 2016 the state's high school rankings had slipped to #11 according to U.S. News and World Report, and #22 overall in quality by Education Week in 2017. It was second only to Texas in having the most U.S. cities in the top 30 best places for new college graduates, according to BusinessWeek in 2010. The year ending July 2011 saw the state ranked fourth in the nation <b>in</b> <b>job</b> creation behind Texas, California, and New York. By 2016 the state wasn't in the top 10 for job growth, and between 2015-2016, the state saw a decrease <b>in</b> <b>job</b> creation of 38,800.

All three Northern regions have public sector employment above the national average, and North East has the highest level in England with 20.2% of the workforce in the public sector as of 2016 – down from 23.4% a decade earlier. The austerity programme under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted <b>in</b> <b>job</b> losses for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{using an}} {{alternative}} longitudinal data set from Social Security records, we analyze immigrants' wage assimilation (relative to similar natives) by skill-level. And we find that, upon arrival, the wage differential is larger {{the higher the}} skill-level required for a job. For example, we observe that, at arrival, low-skilled immigrants earn 24 percentage points lower wages than their native counterparts. In contrast, medium- and high-skilled immigrants earn 36 and 41 percentage points lower wages than their native counterparts, respectively. Moreover, we find that although wage assimilation (compared to similar natives) is largest for immigrants <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> requiring a college degree, there is practically no difference in wage assimilation between immigrants <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> requiring a high-school degree {{and those that do}} not. Finally, we find that 10 years upon entry the formal labor market, full assimilation of wages does not take place as a 12 percentage points wage differential remains for workers <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> requiring no degree, 22 percentage points remains for workers <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> requiring a high-school degree and 14 percentage points remain for workers <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> requiring a college degree.|$|R

5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included <b>in</b> <b>job</b> training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E
