In 2005, Ortiz {{was shot to death}} in front of his children, and Blancornelas began his no-byline policy. In the days after Ortiz's death, he stated, [...] "I feel remorse for having created Zeta. After losing three colleagues, I believe the price has been too high. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> retire a long time ago ...

He later noted that Manners [...] "was there {{to guide us}} along; I {{can think of no}} worst [...] {{nightmare}} for a parent than to lose their child." [...] The episode was written to create closure to Doggett's story. Patrick later said that, if the series had continued for a tenth season, {{he would have liked to}} see his character develop a relationship with Reyes, because [...] "I think Doggett was very attracted to Reyes [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> see the relationship with Reyes explored more." [...] Gish agreed, noting that the show's ending never allowed the idea to be fleshed out, but that Reyes [...] "would have definitely gone further with their relationship." ...|$|E

500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only {{going to be in a}} certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
500|$|Emma's {{relationship}} with glee club coach Will Schuester {{is an integral}} part of her character. They have had an on and off relationship since the show's first season. Television critics have responded extremely well to the pairing between the two. Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly said of the episode [...] "Vitamin D": [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There’s a softness and a longing in them that I’m always surprised Emma (Jayma Mays) matches." [...] Critics also commented positively on the development of Will and Emma's relationship in the episode Sectionals. Natalie Abrams of TV Guide noted that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode, and Eric Goldman of IGN has deemed their coming together [...] "very hard to not feel good about". Dan Snierson, however, wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude when Will finds Emma's empty office, and having him then question whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship. Eric Goldman of IGN commented of the following episode: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> at least see Shue and Emma as a couple for a few episodes, rather than such a quick split. It felt rushed." [...] Todd VanDerWerff added: [...] "I loved Emma's eruption to Will about how Sue Sylvester must have cheated and the kids deserved to win." [...] Robert Canning said of the Britney Spears oriented episode: [...] "The true focus of the episode was Will dealing with his lack of spontaneity. This stood as a contrast to the impulsiveness of Emma's new boyfriend, sexy dentist Carl played by the somehow always charming John Stamos. There's a fun love triangle building here which should only get better as Will becomes less of an insecure whiner." ...|$|E

But I could have run faster with better pacing--9:03 or 9:04. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have broken the meet record.... Running alone is a bit tough.

2500|$|Beginning in 1969, Eliade's past {{became the}} subject of public debate in Israel. At the time, {{historian}} Gershom Scholem asked Eliade to explain his attitudes, which the latter did using vague terms. As a result of this exchange, Scholem declared his dissatisfaction, and argued that Israel could not extend a welcome to the Romanian academic. During the final years of Eliade's life, his disciple Culianu exposed and publicly criticized his 1930s pro-Iron Guard activities; relations between the two soured as a result. Eliade's other Romanian disciple, Andrei Oişteanu, noted that, in the years following Eliade's death, conversations with various people who had known the scholar had made Culianu less certain of his earlier stances, and had led him to declare: [...] "Mr. Eliade was never antisemitic, a member of the Iron Guard, or pro-Nazi.
