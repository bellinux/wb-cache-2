2500|$|In HPLC, {{typically}} 20 μl of {{the sample}} of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction.The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components {{of the sample}} will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns [...] are 100–300mm long with outer diameter of 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6mm. [...] For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30–50mm) with 3-5 μm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrowbore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate). [...] In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with [...] smaller silica particles (~1.7 μm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).|$|E

50|$|One {{application}} in which pressure exchangers {{are widely used}} is reverse osmosis (RO). In an RO system, pressure exchangers are used as energy recovery devices (ERDs). As illustrated, high-pressure concentrate from the membranes C is directed 3 to the ERD D. The ERD uses this high-pressure concentrate stream to pressurize the low-pressure seawater stream (stream 1 becomes stream 4), which it then merges (with {{the aid of a}} circulation pump B) into the highest-pressure seawater stream created by the high-pressure pump A. This combined stream feeds the membranes C. The concentrate leaves the ERD at low pressure 5, expelled by the incoming feedwater flow 1. Pressure exchangers save energy in these systems by reducing the load on the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> In a seawater RO system operating at a 40% membrane water recovery rate, the ERD supplies 60% of the membrane feed flow. Energy is consumed by the circulation pump, however, because this pump merely circulates and does not pressurize water, its energy consumption is almost negligible: less than 3% of the energy consumed by the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> Therefore, nearly 60% of the membrane feed flow is pressurized with almost no energy input.|$|E

5000|$|A {{vacuum truck}} or vacuum tanker {{is a type}} of tank truck that has a pump and a tank, {{designed}} to pneumatically suck liquids, sludges (such as fecal sludge), slurries or sand/water mixtures without the contact of any mechanical equipment. They are used to transport sanitary waste (human excreta mixed with water, e.g. from septic tanks) as well as for some industrial liquids or slurries.

50|$|The {{central part}} of the {{hydraulic}} system was the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pump,</b> which maintained a pressure of between 130 and 150 bar in two accumulators. These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres. One was dedicated to the front brakes, and the other ran the other hydraulic systems. (On the simpler ID models, the front brakes operated from the main accumulator.) Thus in case of a hydraulic failure, the first indication would be that the steering became heavy, followed by the gearbox not working; only later would the brakes fail.|$|E

50|$|The <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> {{supplies}} the pressure needed to push water through the membrane, {{even as the}} membrane rejects the passage of salt through it. Typical pressures for brackish water range from 225 to 376 psi (15.5 to 26 bar, or 1.6 to 2.6 MPa). In the case of seawater, they range from 800 to 1,180 psi (55 to 81.5 bar or 6 to 8 MPa). This requires {{a large amount of}} energy. Where energy recovery is used, part of the high pressure pump's work is done by the energy recovery device, reducing the system energy inputs.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, Ford {{designed}} {{and produced a}} small-block engine with hemispherical heads to address the growing concerns about fuel economy. Unfortunately, even with an ahead-of-its-time direct fuel injection system feeding a stratified charge chamber, the hemi's emissions could not be made clean enough for compliance with regulations. This plus {{the cost of the}} valve actuation systems, along with the cost of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> needed to deliver fuel directly into the chamber, as well as the gilmer belt drive system needed to drive the pump, made further development pointless at the time.

50|$|Misting systems work {{by forcing}} water via a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> and tubing through a brass and {{stainless}} steel mist nozzle that has an orifice of about 5 micrometres, thereby producing a micro-fine mist. The water droplets that create the mist are so small that they instantly flash evaporate. Flash evaporation can reduce the surrounding air temperature {{by as much as}} 35 °F (20 °C) in just seconds. For patio systems, it is ideal to mount the mist line approximately 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) above the ground for optimum cooling. Misting is used for applications such as flowerbeds, pets, livestock, kennels, insect control, odor control, zoos, veterinary clinics, cooling of produce, and greenhouses.|$|E
50|$|The plant's {{buildings}} {{have been designed}} to maximise natural light during the day and a selection of high thermal materials (e.g. solid precast concrete walls and insulation) to improve thermal properties, thereby minimising energy consumption. More specifically, solar photovoltaic cells have been placed on the reverse osmosis buildings for localised power generation. Each reverse osmosis building has an approximately 100 kW solar cell array providing a site capacity of approximately 200 kW at peak sun hours.The <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> feeding the reverse-osmosis membranes are the largest consumers of energy in the plant. Energy recovery devices are installed to harness the pressure in the saline concentrate stream and use it to pressurise some of the feed water. As a result, the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> are only needed to deliver half of the water feeding the reverse osmosis system, reducing energy consumption in the plant by up to 40 per cent. Likewise, two turbine generators in the outfall tunnel take advantage of the plant elevation 50 meters above sea level. This mini-hydroelectric system is capable of producing 1,290 kW of renewable electricity which is fed back into the plant, reducing energy consumption by approximately 2.5%.|$|R
