50|$|People {{associate}} certain colours {{with certain}} flavours, and the colour of food {{can influence the}} perceived flavour in anything from candy to wine. Since orange is popularly associated with good flavour, many companies add orange food colouring to improve the appearance of their packaged foods. Orange pigments and dyes, synthetic or natural, are added to many orange sodas and juices, cheeses (particularly cheddar cheese, Gloucester cheese, and American cheese); snack foods, butter and margarine; breakfast cereals, <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> jam and candy. It is also often added to children's medicine, and to chicken feed to make the egg yolks more orange.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigate effects {{related to}} food intake in humans. In Experiment 1, we measured startle responsemodulation while study participants ate <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> and chocolate. Statistical {{analysis revealed that}} ice cream intake resulted in the most robust startle inhibition compared to no food. Contrasting females and males, we found significant differences related to the conditions yoghurt and chocolate. In females, chocolate elicited the lowest response amplitude followed by yoghurt and ice cream. In males, chocolate produced the highest startle response amplitude even higher than eating nothing, whereas ice cream produced the lowest. Assuming that high response amplitudes reflect aversive motivation while low response amplitudes reflect appetitive motivational states, it is interpreted that eating ice cream {{is associated with the}} most appetitive state given the alternatives of chocolate and yoghurt across gender. However, in females alone eating chocolate, and in males alone eating ice cream, led to the most appetitive state. Experiment 2 was conducted to describe food intake-related brain activity by means of source localization analysis applied to electroencephalography data (EEG). <b>Ice</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> a soft drink, and water were compared. Brain activity in rostral portions of the superior frontal gyrus was found in all conditions. No localization differences between conditions occurred. While EEG was found to be insensitive, startle response modulation seems to be a reliable method to objectively quantify motivational states related to the intake of different foods...|$|E

40|$|Milk protein {{concentrate}} (MPC) {{has become an}} important raw material for many applications, including processed cheese, <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> fermented dairy and meal replacement beverages. Various processing conditions during MPC production affect their physical functionalities. Quantitative knowledge {{about the relationship between}} production conditions and functional properties is limited, especially for the production of MPC using membrane technology. Understanding this relationship will lead to the establishment of design rules of manufacturing practices for production of MPC with enhanced functionalities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand how temperature, pH and calcium (Ca) chelators affect the ultra-filtration (UF) process and the functionalities of the MPC. Three major experiments were conducted: i) effect of operation temperature (i. e. 15, 30 and 50 ˚C), ii) effect of the pH of skim milk (i. e. pH 6. 7, 6. 3, 5. 9 and 5. 5), and iii) the effect of Ca chelators (EDTA and citrate, at levels of 10, 20 and 30 mM) on the UF operation and the functionalities of the MPC obtained. Raw milk was first used to investigate the effect of temperature, pH and Ca chelators, individually or in combination, on milk at its native state, avoiding the possibilities of the milk protein and minerals being disrupted by any industrial process, then commercial skim milk was selected and used for MPC production and functionality tests...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany food {{products}} such as <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>yoghurt,</b> and mayonnaise are some examples of emulsion-based food. The physicochemical properties of emulsions {{play an important role}} in food systems as they directly contribute to texture, sensory and nutritional properties of food. One of the main properties is stability which refers to the ability of an emulsion to resist physical changes over time. The aim of the present work was to analyze the effect of processing conditions and composition on sodium caseinate (NaCas) emulsions stability. The main destabilization mechanisms were identified and quantified. The relationship between them and the factors that influence them were also investigated. Emulsions stabilized with NaCas were prepared using an ultrasound liquid processor or a high pressure homogenizer. Stability of emulsions was followed by a Turbiscan (TMA 2000) which allows the optical characterization of any type of dispersion. The physical evolution of this process is followed without disturbing the original system and with good accuracy and reproducibility. To further describe systems, droplet size distribution was analyzed with light scattering equipment. The main mechanism of destabilization in a given formulation depended on different factors such as NaCas concentration, droplet size or processing conditions. The rate of destabilization was markedly lower with addition of sugar or a hydrocolloid to the aqueous phase. Xanthan (XG) and locust bean (LBG) gums produced an increase in viscosity of the continuous phase and structural changes in emulsions such as gelation. Sugars interacted with the protein decreasing particle size and increasing emulsion stability. The stability of caseinate emulsions was strongly affected not only by the oil-to-protein ratio but also by processing conditions and composition of aqueous phase. The structure of the protein and the interactions protein–sugar or the presence of a hydrocolloid played a key role in creaming and flocculation processes of these emulsions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The caja (Spondias mombin L.) {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of ice-cream, jams, pulps, bever-ages being also consumed in natura. One of the most important procedures in food conservation is drying, considering that most fresh fruits contain approximately 80 % of water. Food drying is used to obtain two basic aspects: (1) the economic factor; in the shipping and handling of the product; (2) at the manipulation; once dried and grinded, the material is rehydrated, at desirable levels, to formulate a new product as in <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> jams, <b>yoghurts</b> and drinks and may also be added to pasta, biscuits and other industrialized products. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the kinetics of caja bagasse drying in a fixed-bed tray dryer, using central composite factorial planning. The following factors were evaluated: temperature (55, 65 and 75 oC), dryer inlet air velocity (3. 2, 4. 6 and 6. 0 m. s- 1) and cake thickness (0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 6 cm) where the response of the considered variable was caja bagasse moisture content (b. s.) and the results showed that the main effects and their interactions were significant at a 95 % confidence level being the best condition obtained at temperature of 75 oC, velocity of 6. 0 m. s- 1 and cake thickness of 0. 8 cm...|$|R
50|$|Probiotics are {{increasingly}} being used in numerous dairy products such as <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> milk powders, <b>yoghurts,</b> frozen dairy desserts and cheese due to their important health benefits.

The pH, dissolved oxygen content, titratable acidity, storage temperature, species and strains of associative fermented dairy product organisms and concentration of lactic and acetic acids {{are some of the}} factors that greatly affect the probiotic viability in the product. As set by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), the standard in order to be considered a health food with probitic addition, the product should contain per gram at least 106-107 cfu of viable probiotic bacteria.
