40|$|The paper {{presents}} a thermal {{analysis of a}} single-floor, solar-powered desert house. The house is air-conditioned and provides all modern comforts and facilities. Electrical power, which drives the entire energy system, is generated by roof-mounted photovoltaic modules. The modules are fixed on special cradles which fold at night to <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to <b>the</b> night sky, thereby enhancing night-time cooling, which is substantial in the desert environment. A detailed dynamic heat transfer analysis is conducted for the building envelope, coupled with a solar radiation model. Application to a typical Middle-Eastern desert site reveals that indeed such a design is feasible with present-day technology; and should be even more attractive with future advances in technology. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a thermal analysis {{and design of}} a fully equipped, air-conditioned, zero energy house located in a desert compound at 24. 5 ° latitude. Unlike previous designs the home is two floors high, which makes the balancing of energy supply and demand even more challenging. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> of <b>the</b> house carries an array of retractable Photovoltaic modules and cover. During day light hours the modules convert the incident sun energy into useful electrical power, while shielding <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> from direct sun-radiation. At night time, <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> cover and modules are retracted to <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to <b>the</b> cool night-sky, thus enhancing cooling. The paper employs time-dependent modeling of Solar input and heat transfer to predict <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> wall and window temperature distributions and cooling loads, as well as energy generated by the modules. With the aid of battery storage, the modules provide the entire energy needs of the house.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the thermodynamic analysis of a totally solarpowered desert home. The home is air-conditioned and provides all modern comforts and facilities. It features closely spaced, roof mounted photovoltaic modules, which collect the solar energy driving the whole energy system. During the day time, the modules form an elevated horizontal surface above <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> shielding it from direct solar radiation. After sunset, the photovoltaic modules are flipped vertically upwards to <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to <b>the</b> sky, thus enhancing night-time cooling. Two methods of energy storage are proposed and compared, one using solely battery storage of electrical output, and the other employing a combination of cold water storage and battery storage. The analysis is based on detailed dynamic heat transfer calculations for the entire building envelope, coupled with a solar radiation model, and followed by energy balances. The results reveal that indeed it is feasible to employ solar energy as the only source of energy to power the home, and that each storage system has its own merits and shortcomings. © 2010 WIT Press...|$|R

Given his interest in new techniques, dendrochronology would probably have been more quickly applied to the monuments of early Europe if this architect of historic monuments had met the astronomer Andrew-Ellicott Douglass, pioneer in the analysis of tree-rings (Webb 1983). In any case, dendrochronology was applied {{for the first time in}} France only at the end of the 1960 s. At present, the gathering of results of laboratory analyses, both public and private, has permitted the establishment of a database supporting an accurate and precise chronology which allows the work of Deneux to be viewed in a new light. For the first time in France and Belgium, a substantial effort was dedicated to the collection of a maximum of dendrochronological analyses in the aim of creating a synthesis of the history of architecture (Hoffsummer et al. 2002).
