[...] Her tease, followed by Gaga's response, [...] "@rihanna <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> NASTY THINGS *dancing gaga*", lead to rumors that Rihanna would be collaborating on the version that would appear on Artpop.

500|$|In August 2013, Gaga {{released}} {{a preview of}} [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] prior to her performance of September 1, 2013 at the iTunes Festival in London. In the video, she sings [...] "When I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you". The video then shows Gaga rehearsing for the festival and displays in pink font, [...] "We wanna give you #sexdreams'". Gaga also promoted the song on social media by posting song lyrics ("Last night damn, you were in my #SexDreams <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> nasty things"), and encouraging use of a hashtag containing lyrics (#whenilayinbeditouchmyselfandthinkofyou).|$|E

500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E
500|$|In Australia, Matthew Toomey, a {{film critic}} for 612 ABC Brisbane, gave The Inbetweeners 2 a B+. He said [...] "Don’t expect a deep, {{underlying}} narrative. This {{is just a}} bunch of horny teenagers <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> dumb things. To each their own... but I was entertained. First and foremost, it shocked me– and that’s not easy given how many movies I watch. It pushes the envelope a lot further than I expected and I'd highly recommend seeing the film in a packed cinema. The audience reactions would be hilarious." [...] Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile wrote a mixed review, stating that the film {{takes a long time to}} [...] "get going" [...] due to a [...] "silly establishment skit". However, she concluded that [...] "there is genuine affection with which the filmmakers portray their characters and as a consequence, the level of offence is lessened to some degree". Simon Miraudo of Quickflix gave the film three stars out of five, calling it [...] "the biggest ribbing since The Simpsons invaded [...] shores". Although opining that the film was [...] "slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts", he concluded that a scene in which faeces chase Will down a waterslide [...] "challenges Caddyshack for the mantle of 'Best Ever S*** in Water' gag".|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "There would be nothing better for this band [...] to reconcile our differences, fucking write a killer record, which I know we can, and fucking we would be <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> big tours. My passion for playing and what we have invested in this band is very big, and I know it's really big for Dino as well, 'cause he started it with Raymond back in the day." [...] More fuel to the possibility of a reunion with the [...] "classic" [...] lineup of Bell, Cazares, Wolbers and Herrera was added later that month, when Wolbers posted an image on his Instagram account, suggesting Fear Factory's official website was [...] "under construction." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Butch Vig and Steve Marker founded Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, and Vig's {{production}} work {{brought him to}} the attention of Sub Pop. Vig's old band Spooner reunited in 1990 and released another record, but disbanded in 1993 as Vig's and Marker's careers as producers gained strength. In 1994, as Vig became [...] "kind of burned out on <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> long records", he got together with Duke Erikson and Marker, and they started producing remixes for acts such as U2, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and House of Pain, featuring different instrumentation and often highlighting new guitar hooks and bass grooves. The experience inspired the three men to form a band, in which they [...] "wanted to take that remix sensibility and somehow translate it into all of the possibilities of a band setup." [...] An early comment that their work sounded [...] "like garbage" [...] inspired the band's name.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2016, in the Rolling Stone video series 'Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena', she {{discusses}} how {{the music}} industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature.

Are you going to tell a male who {{is at the top of}} his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says [...] "Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams".|$|E

2500|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{characterized}} Gamergate as a [...] "magnet for harassment", {{and notes}} the possible financial risk for companies {{dealing with it}} on social media platforms. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a statement condemning the harassment, stating that [...] "here is {{no place in the}} video game community—or our society—for personal attacks and threats". ESA president Mike Gallagher, speaking at the June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, clarified that the ESA did not become more involved as they felt it was an argument that was outside their industry and their involvement would have been disruptive, but praised the efforts to counter harassment that will benefit the industry in the future. At BlizzCon 2014, Blizzard Entertainment president and co-founder Mike Morhaime denounced recent harassment; blaming a [...] "small group of people [...] have been <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> awful things" [...] and [...] "tarnishing our reputation" [...] as gamers. He called on attendees to treat each other with kindness and demonstrate to the world that the community rejects harassment. His statements were widely interpreted as referring to Gamergate. CEOs of both the American and European branches of Sony Computer Entertainment, Shawn Layden and Jim Ryan respectively, said the harassment and bullying were absolutely horrific and that such inappropriate behavior would not be tolerated at Sony. The Swedish Games Industry issued a statement denouncing the harassment and sexism from Gamergate supporters.|$|E
2500|$|Daredevil is {{the first}} of the ordered Netflix series, and is {{followed}} by Marvel's Jessica Jones, Marvel's Luke Cage, and Marvel's Iron Fist, which lead to the miniseries, Marvel's The Defenders. In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, [...] "It's quite possible that they could become feature films," [...] which Sarandos echoed in July 2015. In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out". In December 2014, Loeb explained that [...] "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] Dawson later elaborated that [...] "When you've got that level of superpowers, the fighting is different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> bad, elicit [...] crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs—bones are going to break.

6000|$|Lady Harman {{ceased to}} listen to Mr. Pope's {{strained}} but not unhappy tenor. She had heard him before, and she had heard his like endlessly. He was the larger moiety of every public meeting she had ever attended. She had ceased even to marvel at the dull self-satisfaction that possessed him. To-day her capacity for marvelling was entirely {{taken up by the}} details of this extraordinary reality which had sprung from her dream of simple, kindly, beautiful homes for distressed and overworked young women; nothing in the whole of life had been so amazing since that lurid occasion when she had been the agonized vehicle for the entry of Miss Millicent Harman upon this terrestrial scene. It was all so entirely what she could never have thought possible. A few words from other speakers followed, Mrs. Blapton, with the young secretary at hand to prompt, said something, and Sir Isaac was poked forwards to say, [...] "Thank you very much. It's all my wife's <b>doing,</b> <b>really....</b> Oh dash it! Thank you very much." [...] It had the effect of being the last vestige of some more elaborate piece of eloquence that had suddenly disintegrated in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|She {{found her}} ladies, in short, almost always in {{communication}} with her gentlemen, and her gentlemen with her ladies, and she read into the immensity of their intercourse stories and meanings without end. Incontestably she grew {{to think that the}} men cut the best figure; and in this particular, as in many others, she arrived at a philosophy of her own, all made up of her private notations and cynicisms. It was a striking part of the business, for example, that it was much more the women, on the whole, who were after the men than the men who were after the women: it was literally visible that the general attitude of the one sex was that of the object pursued and defensive, apologetic and attenuating, while the light of her own nature helped her more or less to conclude as to the attitude of the other. Perhaps she herself a little even fell into the custom of pursuit in occasionally deviating only for gentlemen from her high rigour about the stamps. She had early in the day made up her mind, in fine, that they had the best manners; and if there were none of them she noticed when Captain Everard was there, there were plenty she could place and trace and name at other times, plenty who, with their way of being [...] "nice" [...] to her, and of handling, as if their pockets were private tills loose mixed masses of silver and gold, were such pleasant appearances that she could envy them without dislike. They never had to give change--they only had to get it. They ranged through every suggestion, every shade of fortune, which evidently included indeed lots of bad luck as well as of good, declining even toward Mr. Mudge and his bland firm thrift, and ascending, in wild signals and rocket-flights, almost to within hail of her highest standard. So from month to month she went on with them all, through a thousand ups and downs and a thousand pangs and indifferences. What virtually happened was that in the shuffling herd that passed before her by far the greater part only passed--a proportion but just appreciable stayed. Most of the elements swam straight away, lost themselves in the bottomless common, and by so <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> kept the page clear. On the clearness therefore what she did retain stood sharply out; she nipped and caught it, turned it over and interwove it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theory that}} informational praise enhances {{self-determination}} over controlling praise {{has been supported}} by several empirical studies. In a metanalysis including five studies distinguishing informational from controlling praise, Deci, Koestner & Ryan found that informational-based praise related to greater intrinsic motivation (as measured by free-choice behavior and self-reported interest) while controlling praise was associated with less intrinsic motivation. For example, Pittman and colleagues found that adults demonstrated more free-choice engagement with a task after receiving informational ("e.g., [...] "Compared to most of my subjects, you're <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> well."), rather than controlling (e.g., [...] "I haven't been able to use most of the data I've gotten so far, but you're <b>doing</b> <b>really</b> well, and if you keep it up I'll {{be able to use}} yours.") praise.|$|E
