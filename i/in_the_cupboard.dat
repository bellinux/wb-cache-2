5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cupboard.</b> One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> for a year if {{airtight}} and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cupboard.</b>|$|E

When performing as the Isolus she had to whisper, and an echo was added in post-production. Agbaje found it [...] "a bit hard to whisper" [...] because she had a husky voice.

500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cupboard,</b> but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", said Charles, [...] "but I forgive you because you do it to get your bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E

From the {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation of Servco fume cupboard using κ-ω turbulence model, {{it is found that}} recirculation region behind the sash is the potential contributor to the leakage of the contaminants due to its large size. To have a good fume <b>cupboard,</b> <b>the</b> recirculation zone needs to be minimised while maintaining the flow distributions to all area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fume <b>cupboard.</b> <b>The</b> opening on the baffle may reduce the recirculation zone which in turn may reduce back flow that can be the cause of leakage. <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> effect of baffle openings on flow distributions of a Servco fume cupboard will be presented as a result of {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation using κ-ω turbulence model.
