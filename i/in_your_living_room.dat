While musicianship is not the strength of the band, Paul says that the fans [...] "know we're not the best singers and keyboard players, but we're okay. And they think, well, I could do that, too. I think that’s really encouraging to people..." [...] Paul sees the brothers as a [...] "bridge between this mainstream phenomena of Harry Potter and the indie rock underground. Plus, we’re also pretty strong adherents to the DIY ideal." [...] The two brothers promote this ideal of making music independently and have fused the legions of fans on to the DIY free-for-all of indie rock and punk music, albeit of the silly kind.|$|E
500|$|Flower was {{developed}} as a spiritual successor to Flow, a 2006 Flash game created by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark while the two were students at the University of Southern California. Flow was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable game by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. Flower was Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside the safety net of academia". It was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was released on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. Flower was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer Kellee Santiago, was the creative director {{in charge of the}} game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on the [...] "nature" [...] theme early in the development process, saying that he [...] "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> it leads you to somewhere else.

40|$|Where are cinemas going? Are they {{an evening}} out, a festive occasion, {{something}} of a 'luxury' {{when compared to the}} parallel availability of television? Are we looking at fewer cinemas, with more advanced technical standards, itself again a reflection of urban reorganization? Are cinemas changing to a means of education like the IMAX that shows a variety of documentary films? Or are cinemas going to fade out to make place for the comfort and ease of the cinema <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own <b>living</b> <b>room?</b> The goal of the project is to design a cinema centre that is original and offers the user a new and exciting experience. The cinema is based on the film and information technology industry especially new and future technological trends. The main focus, however, is the user's experience through the space and how it can be enhanced through the use of technology. The aim is {{to create a sense of}} voyeurism, which exemplifies the user's experience in the cinema auditorium and in the rest of the building by creating passing glipmses, which combine activity and object. The cinema centre will provide a space of invention, innovation and experience. Dissertation (MInt(Prof)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Architectureunrestricte...|$|R
500|$|The next game, Flower, was Chen and Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game {{outside the}} safety net of academia". Chen was the {{creative}} director {{in charge of the}} game, while Santiago was the producer and Clark was the lead designer. The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development. Flower was intended by Chen to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature".

I thought; wouldn't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature." [...] Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 {{as one of the top}} 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.|$|E
2500|$|About the performance-capture process Singer stated, [...] "It's fascinating... It {{takes you}} back to play-acting as a kid <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> because you are running around and having to imagine {{that you are in}} Gantua and imagine that there are these weapons and all these giant things. But there's nothing when you are there other than {{styrofoam}} and blocks. It forces the actors to regress to when they would play-act as kids or do minimalist theatre.

2500|$|In literature, Fleetwood co-authored Fleetwood – My Life and Adventures with Fleetwood Mac with writer Stephen Davis, {{published}} by William Morrow & Co. in 1990.

Reception was mixed. Robert Waddell of the New York Times described the piece as [...] "a blithe, slapdash memoir." [...] The Los Angeles Timess Steve Hochman noted that [...] "Fleetwood tells the story as if he was sitting <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> which is good for the intimacy of the tale, but bad for the rambling, sometimes redundant telling."

MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That's what rock and roll has become for some people.|$|E
