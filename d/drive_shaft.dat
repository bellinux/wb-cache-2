5|$|Charlie begins {{experiencing}} {{the effects of}} heroin withdrawal, while Jack becomes trapped in a cave. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) attempt to triangulate the signal of the French woman's broadcast. Charlie's involvement in his band <b>Drive</b> <b>Shaft</b> is featured in the episode's flashbacks.|$|E
5|$|Later, Charlie finds Liam high on heroin with groupies. Charlie {{kicks the}} groupies out, and tells Liam that he's {{done with the}} band. Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is <b>Drive</b> <b>Shaft,</b> and that nobody knows who the bass player (Charlie) is. He goes on to tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin <b>Drive</b> <b>Shaft</b> for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie {{to stay with him}} for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch.|$|E
5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, final drives and band brakes. The gearbox {{was connected to the}} engine by a <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> passing through the vehicle. A gear change lever was mounted directly on the gearbox.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{relates to}} the sizing of {{subcritical}} and supercritical laminated composite <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> The hollows <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> are designed to transmit the torsional load and to minimize the dynamic effects due to rotation. To meet this need, these structures must combined strength, rigidity and lightness. New high modulus carbon fibres {{can be adapted to}} a progress in this field. This work presents sizing tools for optimisation of supercritical <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> mounted on viscoelastic suspensions. Two items are discussed: dynamic analysis (response to forces excitation; free motion; instability), strength (buckling of thin tubes; torsional strength). Supercritical <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> examples made of high modulus fibres or high-strength fibres are presented...|$|R
50|$|In {{mechanical}} or automotive engineering, a freewheel or {{overrunning clutch}} is a device in a transmission that disengages the driveshaft from the <b>driven</b> <b>shaft</b> when the <b>driven</b> <b>shaft</b> rotates {{faster than the}} driveshaft. An overdrive is sometimes mistakenly called a freewheel, but is otherwise unrelated.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays new {{possibilities}} exists {{for the production}} process of <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> The filament winding production process is gaining popularity {{for the creation of}} composite <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> Several companies in the automotive industry are looking to adopt this knowledge for their high volume production process.|$|R
5|$|On 28 January 2008, the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> of a Danish AW101 broke, {{leading to}} an {{emergency}} landing at Billund Airport. Following the incident, the Danish fleet was grounded as a precaution and the AW101's future was publicly debated. In {{the first six months}} of 2008, the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an inadequate maintenance organisation and staff shortages.|$|E
5|$|Still unfinished, {{the vehicle}} was entered in an SPL {{competition}} in 1997 {{at which a}} complaint was lodged against the computer control of the DC motor. Instead of using the controller, two leads were touched together {{in the hope that}} the motor speed was set correctly. The <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are another}} common method used to move {{mechanical}} power around that is sometimes evaluated {{in comparison to}} chain drive; in particular belt drive vs chain <b>drive</b> vs <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> is a key design decision for most motorcycles. <b>Drive</b> <b>shafts</b> tend to be tougher and more reliable than chain drive, but the bevel gears have far more friction than a chain.For this reason virtually all high-performance motorcycles use chain drive, with shaft-driven arrangements generally used for non-sporting machines. Toothed-belt drives are used for some (non-sporting) models.|$|R

25|$|On 15 July 2008, 30 {{people were}} injured when the ride collapsed. The park manager stated that he {{believes}} a ball bearing on the ride failed. The ride was dismantled on 17 July 2008. Investigators then confirmed on 19 July 2008 that they had discovered a faulty <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> during their inspection. They believed {{that one of the}} axles that is designed to hold the passenger carriage horizontal failed. The <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> had been replaced by Huss Maschinefabrik, the ride's manufacturer, in 2003.|$|E

25|$|There were initial speculations that {{sabotage}} {{had caused}} the plane crash. Magsaysay had first come into prominence when as Secretary of Defense during the Quirino administration, he had led {{the fight against the}} communist-inspired insurgency of the Hukbalahap movement. However, no evidence emerged to support the theory of sabotage. On April 27, 1957, the chief of the Philippine Constabulary, General Manuel F. Cabal, testified before a Senate committee that the crash had been caused by metal fatigue, which had broken a <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> that caused a power failure on board the plane shortly after takeoff. He added that while the plane was gaining altitude, the spindle <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> of the engine carburetor had snapped.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} run smooth power {{transmission}} system a hydraulic coupling is employed so that many maintenance problems will be minimized such as over load, surface alignment of coupling discs, miss axial line alignment of shafts and vibrations. Therefore to overcome such problems proper collar width will be selected and designed using ANSYS software package for <b>driven</b> <b>shaft</b> at constant velocity conditions. In this work, the comparison of various stress analysis calculations is carried outbetween the fundamental natural frequency and analytical frequency of <b>driven</b> <b>shaft</b> for different collar widths. The stress analysis of the <b>driven</b> <b>shaft</b> is carried out to know {{whether it will be}} able to withstand the applicable loads. Hence, the Finite element method is a powerful tool to predict the material properties behavior of shape and sizes of <b>driven</b> <b>shaft.</b> Resultantly, static analysis is performed and applicable stresses in all the members are determined. Model analysis is done to determine the vibration characteristics, natural frequencies and mode shapes...|$|R

25|$|The {{rotation}} of the ring gear is always {{the average of the}} rotations of the side sun gears. This is why if the driven roadwheels are lifted clear of the ground with the engine off, and the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is held (say, leaving the transmission in gear preventing the ring gear from turning inside the differential), manually rotating one driven roadwheel causes the opposite roadwheel to rotate in the opposite direction by the same amount.|$|E
25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>shafts</b> {{have been}} used on {{motorcycles}} since before WW1, such as the Belgian FN motorcycle from 1903 and the Stuart Turner Stellar motorcycle of 1912. As an alternative to chain and belt <b>drives,</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> offer long-lived, clean, and relatively maintenance-free operation. A disadvantage of <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> on a motorcycle is that helical gearing, spiral bevel gearing or similar is needed to turn the power 90° from the shaft to the rear wheel, losing some power in the process.|$|R
