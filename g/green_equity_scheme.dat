40|$|Abstract: We examine three noncooperative “global warming games ” where {{carbon dioxide}} {{emissions}} and transfers are determined. An international agency implements transfers from rich to poor nations. In each game, the transfer mechanism obeys a predetermined equity principle – horizontal, proportional or “green GNP. ” Participation in each transfer scheme is voluntary. We find that implementable horizontal and proportional equity schemes are Pareto efficient. The <b>green</b> <b>equity</b> <b>scheme,</b> however, is generally inefficient. Unlike the others, our proposed proportional equity scheme is necessarily implementable – all nations always choose to participate. We conclude that proportional equity transfer schemes may be powerful instruments in controlling global warming...|$|E

40|$|The {{institutional}} economic appraisal {{conducted in}} this paper confirms that <b>equity</b> <b>schemes</b> are subject to institutional incompleteness as proposed in ICT. The incompleteness stem {{from the lack of}} verifiability related to social capital, embeddedness, governance and micro performance. In addition, they lack the requisite ex ante incentives to enable ex post adaptation, counterveilance over opportunism, and the distribution of residual claims and control. The first reason for incompleteness emanate from the motivations of the initiators, which is opportunism by landowners to secure their assets in the face of uncertainty and/or enhance their returns in the marketplace. The lack of worker effort and options in the early stages raises credible commitment questions. Examining the governance aspects of <b>equity</b> <b>schemes</b> reveal that they are consistent with modern trends to separate ownership and control. However, a key concern is the asymmetry in human capital and subsequently in power, residual control, gratification, and ultimately economic empowerment.

40|$|The entire {{venture capital}} sector of Central and Eastern Europe is characterised by the {{increased}} weight of state resources. The strengthening of public activities is mainly {{due to the}} new type of <b>equity</b> <b>schemes</b> introduced in the European Union’s 2007 to 2013 programming period, which allowed {{the countries in the}} region to use part of the Structural Funds to develop their venture capital sector. More than 60 venture capital funds undertook to invest more than EUR one billion by the end of 2015, by raising one third of the funds from private in vestors. The paper examines how successful the CEE EU Member States, with a relatively less developed venture capital industry, were in using government <b>equity</b> <b>schemes</b> based on market cooperation between the state and market actors. Since, due to the short ness of the time elapsed since launching these schemes, the success of the companies financed by such hybrid venture capital funds cannot be assessed, this paper primarily aims to analyse whether the region was able to utilise the past lessons from governm ent <b>equity</b> <b>schemes</b> in countries with a more developed venture capital industry. Similarly to the equity programs applied in the West, the government venture capital programs in the region are also characterised by the short time frame, the mass of administ rative requirements tying the hands of investors, the small fund size, which prevents efficient operation, and the limited participation of institutional investors amongst private investors. Compared to developed countries, the unjustified level of benefit s to and non - transparent selection of private fund managers and the immaturity of the investment proposals constitute disadvantages in the region. However, the greatest risk of public <b>equity</b> <b>schemes,</b> i. e. the crowding out effect on private investors, is mi ssing in the CEE region {{due to the lack of}} market investors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} {{efficiency}} and equity of morning peak ramp control schemes in a freeway corridor with limited capacity. In terms of efficiency, both short-run and long-run optimal ramp control schemes are obtained by minimizing the total travel cost and maximizing the total social benefit along the corridor. It is found that for a short-run optimum with inelastic demand, the morning peak period is of the same duration for different on-ramp locations. But for a long-run optimum with elastic demand, the peak duration for various on-ramps increases with the local capacity elasticity of demand. In terms of equity, two measures are defined from a demand-based viewpoint and a space-based viewpoint. It is shown that the short-run optimal ramp control scheme is perfectly fair from a demand-based equity viewpoint. Consequently, two typical ramp control schemes—a perfect demand-based <b>equity</b> <b>scheme</b> and a perfect space-based equity scheme—are introduced and compared with the long-run optimal ramp control scheme in terms of efficiency and equity.

It also demonstrates that they are playing important roles in the establishment of a new post GFC UK finance escalator.

Literature review of antecedents of brand equity is employed. Since there is no suitable set of accessible list to employ the probability sampling approach, a non-probability sampling method of purposive sampling was used where all the respondents must have experience(s) in purchasing any eco-friendly electronic products before. Before the questionnaire is given to the respondent to be filled up, they were asked if they have purchased any eco-friendly electronic products before. If they said yes, then they will not be asked to answer the questionnaire. Data for all the study variables were collected through self-administered survey questionnaires. The survey questionnaire is distributed to a total of 300 respondents, in which 150 of questionnaires are collected from the young Malaysian adults (19 to 26 years old), while another 150 questionnaires are gathered older Malaysian adults (53 to 64 years old). The survey is conducted in nine shopping malls which are located in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 300 primary data is examined with reliability test, two independent sample t-test, and SEM analysis (Structural Equation Modelling). Positive relationships are found to presence in all the hypothesised relationships between the four green brand constructs, namely, brand perceived quality, green brand satisfaction and green brand perceived value, albeit the positive relationships are quite weak.

Consumer lives are framed and {{marked with the}} products that they use, allegory, names and true/false promises. As consumers are becoming ecological friendly and their stress for environmental friendly products and services increases, many firms have engrossed in introducing and endorsing sustainable products and services while endeavoring to reinforce their promise to sustainability. Organizations are allocating noteworthy resources to pursue higher brand equity; thus, the authors believe the industry-level implications by exploring how the introduction of eco-friendly products transform consumers’ attitudes towards brand. Brand equity, a strategic marketing asset, can provoke a welcoming and unique relationship that differentiates the bond between products and customers. Brand equity is taken as a fundamental marketing concept for practitioners and academicians to understand the net impact, mechanisms, and objectives of marketing campaigns. The academicians aspire {{to know what it}} means for an organization and how it can measure whereas practitioners are trying to gauge consumer buying behavior to increase in brand value. An essential countenance of brand equity is sustainability which emerges as a paramount impression for environmental concerns that firms cannot oversee. Many definitions, conceptualizations, and measurements of brand equity are available on the generic definition: an additional value provided by a brand to the product. The plethora of studies indicated that brand equity is, an intangible asset, played a vital role in increasing overall performance and customer preferences, the next logical question would be: how can a firm offer environmental friendly brands and how it measures <b>green</b> brand <b>equity?</b> No systematic research is taken into consideration to develop a multidimensional <b>green</b> brand <b>equity</b> scale. Accordingly, this research enables an in-depth analysis for bringing contemporary linkage in scattered brand equity literature that has no prior history of sustainability inclusion as a key countenance. In doing so, we urge that sustainability dimension in brand equity can helpful in two perspectives: (1) firms can use this concept to trounce consumer cynicism about green attributes and brand’s functionality, and (2) it fills the significant flaws in current conceptualization of brand equity that can serve as an inspiration for theoretical soundness and its better development as measuring tool. We also advocate that brand equity concept should include sustainability paradigm other than marketing assets and stakeholder value.
