5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav left Rus' again, {{dividing}} his dominion {{into three}} parts, each under a nominal rule {{of one of}} his sons. At the head of an army that included Pecheneg and Magyar auxiliary troops, he invaded Bulgaria again, devastating Thrace, capturing the city of Philippopolis, and massacring its inhabitants. Nikephoros responded by repairing the defenses of Constantinople and raising new squadrons of armored cavalry. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> preparations, Nikephoros was overthrown and killed by John Tzimiskes, who thus became the new Byzantine emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} portrays this scene, although {{as usual}} with Matejko's work, it sacrifices some historical reality for more dramatic presentation. It {{serves as an}} allegory for all three Partitions of Poland (1772, 1793, 1795) and portrays {{a number of major}} historical figures of this era. Rejtan is the most visible, occupying the entire right side of the painting, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dramatic pose which has been compared to Liberty Leading the People. His position on this painting exemplifies the golden ratio.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{first season}} as {{head coach of the}} Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was {{due in large part to}} Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

40|$|By {{the very}} nature of what they do as scientists, sociologists and anthropologists are {{necessarily}} always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other people. They are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other people <b>the</b> way physicists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> electrons and detectors, the way chemists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> chemicals and test tubes, the way biologists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> cells and frogs. Very often now, on account of developments in social studies of science since the late 1960 s, sociologists and anthropologists find – or rather plant – themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other researchers. Sometimes, and sometimes annoyingly, they plant themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other researchers while they are engaged in their research or related professional activities. Sometimes the sociologists and anthropologists are participants who contribute to the research agenda of their subjects; sometimes they observe and interview as non-participants. Given this reality of their work, sociologists and anthropologists can or must appear at least on occasion intruders, pricks of conscience, or moral entrepreneurs, and obstacles rather than facilitators of research. This role of ethnographer of science, however, has proven itself over and over {{to be a source of}} important new insights and understandings about the nature of scientific practice. They can, of course, at the same time serve as the consciousness as well as the conscience of the research group. I have planted myself in your midst in part to continue my empirical studies of scientific and engineering practice. The other reasons I am here have to do with my interests in social robotics per se as a sociologist of mind and thinking...|$|R
5|$|For 1996, the Angels {{replaced}} Smith in {{the closer}} role with second-year pitcher Troy Percival. After only eight {{games as a}} setup pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, was traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, who was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> best season—but did not fare as well in {{his return to the}} National League. His ERA was nearly as high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E
5|$|John Thompson was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tenth {{season as}} {{head coach of the}} Georgetown Hoyas as the team entered the National Championship game. Before the season, Thompson made {{headlines}} when he signed top recruit, Patrick Ewing over several other top name schools, along with Tony Jones, Ralph Dalton, Elvado Smith, and Bill Martin. Georgetown was named by some voters as the number one team in the nation in the preseason polls due to its highly touted recruiting class. The Hoyas' starting line up was: Eric Smith, Eric Floyd, and Fred Brown as guards, Mike Hancock in the forward position, and Ewing at center.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exile, Zardari {{had several}} {{different}} legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left {{open the possibility}} of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, {{he would have had}} to deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial.|$|E

5|$|On a team-basis, Malhotra's {{first season}} with the Canucks saw them earn the Presidents' Trophy for having the best regular season record in the league. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> recovery, Malhotra made an {{appearance}} during the team's pre-game ceremony at Rogers Arena, co-accepting the trophy with captain Henrik Sedin. Despite original statements from the team {{that he would not}} return for the playoffs, Malhotra began working his way up from light practices with the team in May 2011. By the end of the month, he was cleared by doctors to play in the Stanley Cup Finals. Though he remained out of the lineup for Game 1, he returned for the following contest and played the rest of the series as the team's fourth-line centre (late-season acquisition Maxim Lapierre filled in for Malhotra on the third line). Playing against the Boston Bruins, the Finals went to a seventh game, which the Canucks lost. Malhotra's regular season performance earned him six first-place votes out of 125 for the Selke Trophy. He ranked fifth in balloting, as teammate Ryan Kesler won the distinction at the year-end Awards Ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Sound Four do {{not become}} a {{prominent}} {{part of the story}} until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke's passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five all died in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Chōji Akimichi and Neji Hyūga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> battle against Gaara and Rock Lee. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces. In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto brought them back instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also {{at the time of the}} war's climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five's DNA to access their abilities.|$|E
