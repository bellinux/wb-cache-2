5|$|A soap bubble forms a sphere, {{a surface}} with minimal area — the {{smallest}} possible surface {{area for the}} volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of Louis XVI, whose name {{is attached to the}} first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E
