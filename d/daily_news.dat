5|$|During this time, William Thompson — {{best known}} as W.F. Thompson — began {{gathering}} investors to purchase the Fairbanks <b>Daily</b> <b>News.</b> After Corson's candidacy failed and Thompson amassed $15,000 from investors, he purchased the <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> in March 1909. On March 18, 1909, the <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> published its last issue. Four days later, it reopened under the name Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, an amalgam {{of the names of}} the <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> and Thompson's previous operation, the Tanana Miner. He chose the name over his first idea, the Daily Alaska Miner.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> (originally the Los Angeles Illustrated <b>Daily</b> <b>News),</b> often {{referred}} to simply as the <b>Daily</b> <b>News,</b> was a newspaper published from 1923 to 1954. It was operated through most of its existence by Manchester Boddy. The publication has no connection with the current newspaper of the same name.|$|E
5|$|After {{the primary}} defeat, Boddy went into semi-retirement, and profits from {{sales of the}} <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> began to decrease. In early 1951, he made his assistant, Robert Smith, editor of the paper. In mid-1952, Boddy sold out to a consortium. In August 1952, Boddy {{announced}} his retirement as publisher in Smith's favor. Smith instituted changes, scrapping the money-losing Saturday edition and started a Sunday News. He called in WIlliam Townes as editor, who was well known for restoring ailing newspapers. However, Smith fired Townes after twelve weeks on the job. Smith attempted to sell the paper, and reached an agreement with a small-time Oregon newspaper owner, Sheldon F. Sackett. After signing, Smith {{backed out of the}} deal, apparently out of seller's remorse. By the time Smith finally sold the paper, in December 1952 to Congressman Clinton D. McKinnon, who was leaving office after losing a Senate primary bid, the <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> was losing over $100,000 a month. McKinnon had no better luck than anyone else in reviving the paper, and in December 1954, the paper was sold to the Chandler family, owners of the Los Angeles Mirror. Under the sale agreement, the Mirror became the Mirror & <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> (before again being renamed the Mirror-News) and all <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> employees lost their jobs. On December 18, 1954, publication of the <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> ceased.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Barnette {{was accused}} of embezzling money from the Fairbanks bank he operated, and he was sued {{by the man who}} had funded the venture that led to the {{founding}} of Fairbanks. During the lawsuit, it was revealed that Barnette had been convicted of larceny in Oregon. As his legal bills added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the lease agreement by selling the newspaper to J. Harmon Caskey and Henry Roden. That same year, the campaign to elect Alaska's first delegate to Congress was under way, and one of the candidates, Jack Corson, purchased one-third of the newspaper. Corson's campaign manager promptly was named the editor of the <b>Daily</b> <b>News,</b> and the paper switched to actively supporting Corson's candidacy.|$|E

The policy also stated that players {{were not to be}} identified for a first positive test, but the New York <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E
