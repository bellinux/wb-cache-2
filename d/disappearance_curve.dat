40|$|Radioactive (^ I-labelled) {{rose bengal}} {{has been used}} by many workers in the {{estimation}} of liver function since its introduction by Taplin and his associates in 1955. Most employed the external counting techniques; some used the first rectilinear portion of the blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> for the evaluation of hepatic function. In this investigation, the blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> of ^ IRB following a single intravenous administration was examined experimentally in dogs and clinically in patients with hepatobiliary diseases, with particular attention to obstructive jaundice. The blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> of ^ IRB can be analyzed into two exponentials. Also, it was revealed in the dog experiments that the hepatic extraction rate of ^ IRB diminishes with time. The bi-exponential blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> is accordingly attributed to the hepatic extraction rate pattern. Illustrated by a two-compartment model including the involved back-diffusion, the rate constants of transfer of ^ IRB from the blood to the liver (K_L), from the liver to the bile (K_B), and from the liver to the blood (K_L 2 ̆ 7) can be obtained by mathematical analysis of the blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> of thedye. The rate constant K_L was observed to diminish approximately in proportion to the degree of jaundice. In the presence of bile stagnation, K_B gave low values, while K_L 2 ̆ 7 was high in severe cases and not raised in mild cases. The rate of liver excretion to total liver transfer, that is, liver excretion plus back-diffusion, decreased proportionate to elevated bile stagnation. K_L and K_B dropped and KL 2 ̆ 7 rose during jaundice exacerbation, reversing the tendency upon remission. A reduced K_B value in patients without jaundice indicates the possibility of the subsequent occurrence of jaundice. In obstructive jaundice, there were low values for K_L and K_B and a raised K_L 2 ̆ 7. In hepatitis and in Banti 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome, a reduction in K_L and a rather raised value for K_B was observed...|$|E

With this method organ uptake could {{be measured by}} quantitative scintigraphy. There was no relation between the T 1 / 2 of the blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> and the T 1 / 2 of the splenic uptake curve. The T 1 / 2 of the blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> was normal in all three patient groups. However, there was asignificant shift from spleen to liver uptake in patients with active systemic lupus erythermatosus, active Wegener's granulomatosus, and membranous glomerulopathy in comparison with a control group. There was no relation with age, level of circulating immune complexes, complement level, kidney function, or immunosuppressive treatment. We conclude that an increease of the liver component of reticulo-endotherlial function may compensate abnormalities in splenic function.

40|$|Insulin- 131 I was {{administered}} intravenously to normal subjects, {{to patients with}} maturity-onset diabetes and normal renal function, and to nondiabetic patients with renal failure. The ensuing plasma <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> of immunoprecipitable radioactive insulin were determined, and these data were analyzed {{in a variety of}} ways. Firstly, fractional irreversible loss rates of insulin from plasma were calculated and found to be greatly diminished in patients with renal failure (t½ = 39 min), as compared with normal (t½ = 15 min) and diabetic subjects (t½ = 12 min). Secondly, plasma insulin- 131 I <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> were resolved into sums of three exponentials by the method of “peeling,” and values for the resultant three slopes and half-lives were determined. Patients with normal renal function had similar values for all parameters, while those patients with renal failure were differentiated {{on the basis of the}} slope of the last component, with a prolongation of its half-life to 275 min (approximately twice normal). Finally, a three pool model was formulated to describe the kinetics of plasma insulin disappearance in man, representing plasma (pool 1), interstitial fluid (pool 2), and all tissues in which insulin is utilized and degraded (pool 3). The proposed model adequately describing the <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> of insulin- 131 I observed in all patients indicated that volumes (per cent body weight) of pool 1 (4. 04) and pool 2 (10. 11), calculated on the basis of the model and the experimental data, corresponded closely to estimates of plasma and interstitial fluid volumes obtained by independent means. It also demonstrated that patients with renal failure were characterized by a decreased removal rate of insulin from pool 3 and an increased recycling rate of insulin from pool 3 to pool 2. It is concluded that the proposed model represents a reasonable description of the kinetics of insulin distribution and degradation, and that its use provides quantitative insights into the physiology of insulin metabolism...|$|R

Only two patients, with major disease activity, had a prolonged T 1 / 2 of the blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> of injected IgG coated red cells in comparison to 22 healthy controls. Circulating immune complexes (CIC) were studied with three methods: PEG precipitation, C 1 q-ELISA and the indirect granulocyte phagocytosis test (IGFT). The T 1 / 2 of the blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> related significantly to the IGFT (r = 0. 55, P less than 0. 05) {{and not to the}} PEG and C 1 q-ELISA test. Although HLA-DR 3 phenotype frequency was significantly increased in our SLE population (P less than 0. 05), it was not related to Fc receptor function. Similarly, HLA-DR 2 phenotype was not related to RES Fc receptor function. These data do not support the concept that a genetic HLA linked defect in reticuloendothelial Fc receptor function is a primary cause of SLE, predisposing the inflicted individual to immune complex deposition. However, Fc receptor-mediated immune clearance seems to be related to disease activity itself and to levels of CIC...|$|E

40|$|Measuring the glomerular {{filtration}} rate (GFR) by iohexol plasma disappearance in children requires optimization of duration and sampling times since shortening the study may overestimate GFR. To determine these parameters, we analyzed iohexol plasma disappearance curves using multiple sampling points {{in each of}} 27 children in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study. The GFR measured after 5 [*]h was comparable to that after 6 [*]h, but shortening to 4 [*]h resulted in a significant 3 % overestimation of GFR. We also sought {{to reduce the number}} of blood samples to determine GFR. This was done by adapting the Brochner-Mortensen equations to derive the relationship between a single-compartment two-sample (slow GFR model) <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> and that from a double exponential analysis (two-compartment four-sample model) in the first clinic visit of 489 children. Using polynomial regression methods, we developed coefficients to accurately measure GFR from a single-compartment model. These coefficients were employed to recalculate the GFR and compare these to values measured with the two-compartment four-sample model in 361 of these children in their second clinic visit. There was excellent correlation (r= 0. 999) and no bias or change in between-individuals' dispersion. Hence, the GFR can be accurately measured in children with chronic kidney disease using the slow component of the iohexol plasma <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve,</b> provided the duration of study is at least 5 [*]h...|$|E
40|$|That a {{hemolytic}} {{process is}} one of the potential causes of anemia in cirrhosis of the liver has been well established by repeated demonstrations of decreased red cell survival time in a large propor-tion of patients (1 - 7). Shortened survival has been noted, not only with autologous cells, but also with transfused normal donor cells (1, 2). This would clearly establish the existence of an extracorpuscular factor. Moreover, Jandl (2) has pointed out that the exponential contour of <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> observed in patients with cirrhosis suggests random fractional removal of cells by an organ such as the spleen. This of course is consistent with the widely accepted no-tion that the congestive splenomegaly of cirrhosis causes "hypersplenism. " In previous studies employing thermally dam-aged Cr 51 -labeled red cells to assess the size of the spleen by a scanning procedure, both we (8) and Wagner and co-workers (9) found that the cells tended to disappear from circulating blood more rapidly in patients with cirrhosis than in control subjects. The present investigation was conducted in order that the rate of removal of thermally damaged cells might be measured defini-tively by analysis either of blood <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> or of curves obtained by continuous record-ing of activity through an external probe placed over the spleen. It was expected that a seques-tration function could be assessed in patients with cirrhosis and other disorders affecting the spleen if the corpuscular variable were minimized by in-troducing labeled red cells that had been subjected to standardized thermal damage. At the same time the size of the spleen could be estimated by the scanning procedure previously described (8). * Submitted for publication October 28, 1963; accepte...|$|R

40|$|Glomerular {{filtration}} rate (GFR) {{is believed to}} be the overall index of renal function in health and disease. And the renal clearance of inulin (CIn) obtained during constant intravenous infusion has long been accepted as the gold standard of GFR measurement. Because of a number of technical difficulties inherent in the assay of inulin concentration in urine and plasma, its usefulness in clinical practice is limited. Iothalamate, a urographie contrast medium which behaves and is excreted in a fashion similar to inulin, has been accepted as a good filtration marker [1 – 3]. The renal clearance of iothalamate is not much more simplified than that of inulin. But its measurement is used instead of inulin in the assessment of GFR. Whether inulin or iothalamate is used, the measurement of renal clearance requires proper collection and measurement of an accurate short-timed urine specimen. Therefore improper urine collection sometimes leads to error in GFR measurement. To overcome this disadvantage, GFR is alternatively determined as the total plasma clearances calculated from serial measurement of plasma concentrations after a single rapid intravenous injection, where urine collection is not necessary [4, 5]. The total plasma clearance should be equal to glomerular {{filtration rate}}, if the compounds would be excreted solely by glomerular filtration without tubular secretion or reabsorption. The conventional method of the total plasma clearances, however, usually needs multiple blood samples to calculate from the slope of the plasma <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve.</b> The plasma <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> is generally separated into two compartments: the early phase reflects the distribution of the marker and the late phase reflects the excretion of the marker. The latter is closely related with the clearance rate [6]. So, the late phase of the plasma <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> would offer a simple and good approximation of GFR, and it would conquer the disadvantages of the renal clearances and total plasma clearances, that is, timed urine collections and multiple blood sampling, respectively. The aim of this investigation was to study whether GFR could be estimated by the modified plasma clearance technique to calculate only from the late phase of the plasma decline at 60, 90, and 120 minutes, without urine collection, when iothalamate was used as filtration marker and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system as the analyzing method...|$|E

Soluble immune complexes at fivefold antigen excess {{were prepared}} from isolated specific antibodies and HSA, human λ-chains, human λG-globulins, and a Waldenström's macroglobulin as antigens. In all these preparations a characteristic immune complex was encountered that represented the smallest stable antigen-antibody union. In the HSA-anti-HSA system they {{were found to be}} AgAb 2 complexes, and Ag 2 Ab complexes in the γG-anti-γG system. These stable complexes fixed complement ineffectively. Also, a spectrum of larger complexes was present in each system, and these complexes fixed complement effectively. With intact antibodies the <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> of immune complexes from the circulation were composed of three exponential components. The immune complexes larger than AgAb 2 were quickly removed from the circulation with half-lives of 0. 09 – 0. 37 hr. Their clearance was not dependent on complement components, in that depletion of complement by cobra venom factor and aggregated γG-globulin did not alter the pattern of their removal from the circulation. However, when the interchain disulfide bonds of antibodies were reduced and alkylated, the removal of the λ-anti-λ, HSA-anti-HSA, and γG-anti-γG complexes was altered. In these experiments the <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> were composed of two exponential components and the rapid removal of the greater than AgAb 2 complexes did not occur. The immune complexes prepared from reduced and alkylated antibodies fixed complement ineffectively. The presented data indicate that the rapid removal of circulating immune complexes, containing γG-globulin molecules as antibodies, depends primarily on the number of antibodies involved. Furthermore, complement fixation is not involved in the rapid removal of such complexes. Nevertheless, the rapid removal of immune complexes and their ability to fix complement have similarities for optimal function in that both processes require intact interchain disulfide bonds of antibodies and complexes that exceed the AgAb 2 combination...|$|R

40|$|Although sulfobromophthalein sodium (BSP, Bromsulphalein) {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for testing hepatic function since its introduction by Rosenthal and White in 1925 (1), relatively little was learned regarding its transport and metabo-lism until recent years. Disappearance of BSP from the blood after intravenous administration of the dye involves a complicated process (2). It is effected by the interrelated functions of hepatic uptake, storage, conjugation, and biliary excre-tion, each {{of which may be}} influenced by such dynamic factors as blood circulation and pro-tein availability (3). The precise role of extra-hepatic metabolism (4) and the importance of the enterohepatic circulation (5) of BSP in the physiology of normal and of pathologic states have not yet been clearly established. The rate of disappearance of BSP from the blood (fractional clearance or percentage disap-pearance rate, PDR) has been suggested as a more sensitive index of liver function than is the percentage of intravenously administered BSP retained after a specific time interval (6, 7). Barber-Riley, Goetzee, Richards, and Thomson (8) have shown that after a single intravenous dose of BSP, the <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> can be ex-pressed as two exponential terms from which the rate of transfer from plasma to liver and that from liver to bile may be calculated.

Metabolic clearance rate was considerably lower and volume of fast initial distribution slightly larger in that group. This fact emphasizes {{the important role of}} kidneys in the utilization and/or the degradation of human calcitonin...|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{specific}} radioactivity of arginine guanidine 14 C-labelled protein {{has been}} measured {{at various times}} after the injection of labelled protein precursor (Na 214 CO 3). The resulting `appearance' curve is {{a balance between the}} rate of synthesis and delivery of new protein and the rate of destruction and distribution of new plus existing protein. The measured appearance curve can be corrected to give a measure solely of the rate of synthesis of the plasma protein concerned, if the amplitude of the curve at every point is increased by an amount that compensates for the destruction and distribution processes. The decrease of plasma specific radioactivity of labelled plasma protein after an injection of exogenously labelled protein is termed the `disappearance' curve, and the method of correcting the appearance curve by using the <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve</b> is shown to {{take the form of a}} deconvolution...|$|E
40|$|REPLY: The {{letter written}} by Peters et al. {{can be divided}} in two parts. The first part is {{directly}} related to the problem discussed in our paper, namely background correction; the second part is related to an important point in quantification of the separate renal function, namely the errors inherent to the use of a heart curve as a representation of the true plasma <b>disappearance</b> <b>curve.</b> This problem was, however, not the subject of our paper. The renal background is a composite, with variable pro portions ofinterstitial and vascular components in each organ. We have underlined the fact that from anatomic and angio graphic data it is well known that the vascular component in the kidney area is higher than in the peri-renal area and that this component is lower in the subrenal area than in the pen renal area. On the other hand, it seems reasonable to assum...|$|E
40|$|Human {{metabolism}} of bilirubin is {{investigated by}} plasma <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> of 3 H-bilirubin in normal, hemolytic, and Gilbert's states. A two-compartment model of bilirubin kinetics is presented. Structural identifiability {{of the model}} is investigated. Model's parameter estimation from experimental data is performed in the least-squares sense with a procedure particularly suitable for this criterion function. Some problems related to the estimation of parameters of compartmental models are discussed. Several parameters of clinical interest are derived from the model. The system has been simulated on a digital computer using the CSMP simulation language, provided with the estimation algorithm. Results obtained on a sample of two clinical situations (Gilbert's syndrome, hemolytic syndromes) and on a control group are presented. Clinical inferences drawn from the parameters obtained by the model are discussed: (i) in Gilbert's syndrome the metabolic defect possibly concerns the intrahepatic binding of bilirubin; (ii) if alterations in radiobilirubin kinetics occur under hyperhemolitic conditions, they possibly indicate that the excretory capacity of the liver has been exceeded...|$|R
40|$|In {{dogs and}} cats an {{assessment}} of renal function is often needed, however, existing methods including urine and plasma clearances are invasive, cumbersome and time consuming. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a transcutaneous glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement in {{dogs and cats}}. Additionally the optimal dose and location for the transcutaneous measurement device were investigated. Renal elimination of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labelled sinistrin (FITC-S) was measured transcutaneously for 4 hours. The procedures were performed in awake, freely moving animals using escalating doses of FITC-S (10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg) with a wash-out period of at least 24 h in between. Multiple devices were placed on each animal. The resulting FITC-S <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> were visually assessed to determine the most suitable location and the appropriate dose to reach an adequate transcutaneous peak signal for kinetic analysis. In both species 30 mg/kg were adequate for kinetic calculation. The most suitable place for the device was the lateral thoracic wall in dogs and the ventra...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of a monoclonal IgG cryoglobulin was {{studied in}} a patient with primary idiopathic cryoglobulinaemia under two different clinical conditions. Early in the illness, cryoprotein levels were diminished to 770 mg% by plasmapheresis and plasma disappearance assayed while serum levels of cryoprotein increased to 1100 mg%, i. e. the study was performed {{during a period of}} unstable cryoprotein synthesis. A second study was performed 1 year later when serum levels of cryoglobulin were stable at 1500 mg% which allowed a synthetic rate of 64 mg/kg of body weight per day to be computed. This was the upper limit of normal IgG synthesis. The final slopes of the plasma <b>disappearance</b> <b>curves</b> were nearly identical for both studies, indicating that the same fractional percentage of the cryoglobulin serum pool was degraded regardless of its serum level. T 1 / 2 of 15 · 5 and 17 · 0 days were obtained when plasma levels were unstable and stable, respectively...|$|R
