5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the propeller blades. United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> in the cockpits of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed.|$|E
5|$|United Airlines {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying it had begun installing the device on its fleet of DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft one week before the accident, having used it successfully in service on their fleet of Douglas DC-7 aircraft. A Martin bar had not yet been fitted on Mainliner Idaho. United Airlines also said a program had begun to install reverse thrust <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> on all their DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft. The signals, fitted in the cockpit of the aircraft, would have warned the flight crew that the thrust lever had been pulled back too far, and the propellers had been reversed.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E

25|$|The XG was {{essentially}} an update of the XF. It gained the EB II's 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or column shift), meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the instrument cluster, centre console (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed to chrome on XF's) EB style door 'rubbing' strips, and <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> on the front quarter panels.|$|E
25|$|The term {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{miniature}} neon glow lamp, developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting. While neon tube lights are typically meters long, the neon lamps can be less than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights. They are still in use as small <b>indicator</b> <b>lights.</b> Through the 1970s, neon glow lamps were widely used for numerical displays in electronics, for small decorative lamps, and as signal processing devices in circuity. While these lamps are now antiques, the technology of the neon glow lamp developed into contemporary plasma displays and televisions.|$|E

5000|$|Railroads: if the <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> {{landed on}} one of the four railroads, players got the chance to [...] "ride" [...] the {{particular}} railroad to a monopoly and initiate a [...] "hostile takeover". A tossup was asked, and the first player to answer the clue correctly chose one of his/her opponents' monopolies to take over. The <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> then moved to the first property in the chosen monopoly, and the player trying to take it over had to answer a series of clues unopposed, one for each property. Every correct answer advanced the <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> to the next property in line. If the player answered all the clues correctly, he/she won control of the monopoly; its combined value was added to his/her score, and any houses or hotels built on it became his/her property. A wrong answer ended the takeover attempt and the player had to pay the corresponding rent to the owner of the monopoly, based on where the indicator was when the wrong answer was given.|$|R

25|$|The {{first sign}} of trouble aboard Estonia was when a {{metallic}} bang was heard, caused by a heavy wave hitting the bow doors around 01:00, when the ship was {{on the outskirts of}} the Turku archipelago, but an inspection—limited to checking the <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> for the ramp and visor—showed no problems. Over the next 10 minutes, similar noises were reported by passengers and other crew. At about 01:15, the visor in which the ship's bow door opened separated, and the ship immediately took on a heavy starboard list (initial 30 to 40 degrees, but by 01:30, the ship had rolled 90 degrees) as water flooded into the vehicle deck. Estonia was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely.|$|E
25|$|The Spitfires {{with the}} {{single-stage}} Merlin engines used four different wing types, Type A, B, C and D wings, {{which had the}} same dimensions and plan but different internal arrangements of armament and fuel tanks. All Mk Is, IIs, and Vs and their derivatives had small, rectangular undercarriage indicator pins which projected at an angle from the upper wing surfaces when the undercarriage legs were locked down, providing a positive mechanical indication that the landing gears were indeed down and locked, since the pilot {{could not see the}} landing gear for himself. These were a backup to the <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> on the instrument panel, in case the lights malfunctioned or failed. All of these variants used Dunlop AH2061 tyres, mounted on alloy mainwheels which had five openings. The fixed, castering tailwheels used Dunlop AH2184 tyres.|$|E
500|$|The flag {{has used}} two {{different}} color schemes {{with the letter}} [...] "W" [...] on a solid background, {{and there is a}} loss indicator flag with a letter [...] "L". [...] Additionally, the flags have been complemented by different color schemes of <b>indicator</b> <b>lights.</b> The flag is also changed after each Cubs win. The flag has become a very symbolic emblem for devout Cubs fans. [...] Some retailers sell slightly different versions that also have the Cubs logo at the bottom.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} {{deployed}} with an earlier two-stage switch labeled “Auto-Sport”, with a later modification of “Auto-Soft-Mid-Hard”. Some variations used a dial to specifically select {{the level of}} hardness to the driver’s desires. For most driving situations, the “Auto” selection was recommended. When the system was activated, an <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> reflected the suspension setting selected.The system components consisted of a control switch, <b>indicator</b> <b>light,</b> four shock absorbers, shock absorber control actuator, shock absorber control computer, vehicle speed sensor, stop lamp switch, with a throttle position sensor and {{a steering angle sensor}} on TEMS three stage systems only.|$|R

50|$|A {{knowledge}} of the Simon effect is useful {{in the design of}} man-machine interfaces. Aircraft cockpits, for example, require a person to react quickly to a situation. Imagine that you are flying a plane and {{there is a problem with}} the left engine. In an aircraft with a good man-machine interface design (which most have), the <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> for the left engine should be positioned physically to the left of the <b>indicator</b> <b>light</b> for the right engine. This interface would display information in a way that matches the types of responses that people should make. If it were the other way around, you may respond incorrectly and adjust the wrong engine.|$|R
500|$|The C5 was {{initially}} {{sold at a}} cost of £399, but to keep the cost under the £400 mark a number of components were sold as optional accessories. These included <b>indicator</b> <b>lights,</b> mirrors, mud flaps, a horn, and a [...] "High-Vis Mast" [...] consisting of a reflective strip on a pole, designed to make the C5 more visible in traffic. Sinclair's C5 accessories brochure noted that [...] "the British climate isn't always ideal for wind-in-the-hair driving" [...] and offered a range of waterproofs to keep C5 drivers dry in the vehicle's open cockpit. Other accessories included seat cushions and spare batteries.|$|E
500|$|On 8 May 2006, B-1B (s/n 86-0132) {{from the}} 7th Bomb Wing, 9th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, landed [...] "gear-up" [...] during {{recovery}} from an 11-hour ferry {{flight to the}} island of Diego Garcia. A resulting fire was quickly extinguished and the crew escaped through the top hatch with only a minor back injury to the co-pilot. The air force investigation concluded that the crew [...] "forgot to lower the landing gear" [...] based on the following reasons: 1) co-pilot task oversaturation, 2) co-pilot's wanting to complete a long mission, 3) neither pilot completed the landing checklist, 4) co-pilot's belief that the pilot had lowered the landing gear when he had not, 5) pilot had turned over control to the co-pilot on the final approach and the pilot had reported to base that the landing gear was down when it was not – <b>indicator</b> <b>lights</b> showing the landing gear was still up were working and apparently ignored. As a result, the B-1B impacted and slid on the runway, which caused approximately $8 million of damage to the aircraft and runway.|$|E
