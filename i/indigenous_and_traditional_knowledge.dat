It has vigorously condemned the abject surrender to the conditionality of the IMF and WB as that would amount to giving up our sovereignty. BMS considers the movement as an opportunity to build up Swadeshi Model of Economy. Hence it has inspired movement for the use of Swadeshi (Indigenous) Products as against the foreign or MNC products. It has offered to cooperate in turning the loss making PSUs profitable where practicable, it has agreed to induce the workers to take up their unit to run them on sound lines. To curb excessive profiteering, which is the main culprit behind price rise; it has suggested that the Government should take steps to make the consumer aware of the cost of production of each product to daily use. This awareness will serve as a watch dog to restrain the prices. BMS is also of the view that for creating enough job opportunities, agricultural development should get more attention as also agro-based and small and tiny industries. Vishwakarma Sector (Self-employment sector) should get more encouragement than at present. On modern technology, BMS while not being antagonistic would prefer developing our own technology based on <b>indigenous</b> <b>and</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> to best suit our conditions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} arises out of deep {{concerns over}} how <b>Indigenous</b> Intellectual Property <b>and</b> <b>Traditional</b> <b>Knowledge</b> should be ethically accessed and used and reviews existing mechanisms of protection. It focuses on how <b>Indigenous</b> Intellectual Property <b>and</b> <b>Traditional</b> <b>Knowledge</b> should best be ethically, legislatively and legally {{treated in the}} public domain and in other public usage - and what mechanisms are required to protect it - particularly regarding Indigenous cultural expression. The dissertation argues that existing regimes of protection - such as copyright, patent, trade secrets, trademark, commercial law, and international regulation and convents - do not provide adequate protection for certain forms of <b>Indigenous</b> Intellectual Property <b>and</b> <b>Traditional</b> Knowledge; <b>and</b> that, therefore, new systems of protection need to be considered, developed and implemented. The purposes of this dissertation are: 1) to outline and establish principles in the use of Indigenous <b>Traditional</b> <b>Knowledge</b> for commercial, industrial, and other public purposes, and in cultural practice, artworks and other tangible and intangible cultural expressions; 2) to establish theoretical frameworks on Indigenous peoples' transformation of <b>Traditional</b> <b>Knowledge</b> through their cultural practice; and 3) to develop useful models and concepts to regulate the use of <b>Traditional</b> <b>Knowledge</b> by third parties in the contemporary contexts. In order to achieve these purposes, this dissertation will review the history of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>and</b> European knowledge systems and the interface between the two systems. It will also examine the development of <b>Indigenous,</b> national <b>and</b> International regulatory mechanisms and how the current discourse is evolving at these levels...|$|R
30|$|Although {{the brief}} review of the Yokohama Strategy in the first pages of the HFA reiterates the {{importance}} of “involving people {{in all aspects of}} DRR in their own local communities” (UNISDR 2005, p. 2), in the HFA there is a notable shift in language and tone. Reference to indigenous knowledge in the HFA is made in the context of incorporating it into top-down advisories. More emphasis is placed on considering cultural heritage in order to develop information appropriate for “target” audiences (UNISDR 2005, p. 9) rather than acknowledging and respecting local circumstances and understandings. HFA, of course, includes references to <b>indigenous</b> <b>and</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> but the main motivation beyond these allusions {{does not appear to be}} because of local knowledge’s own value for DRR as was the case in the Yokohama Strategy.

The continuation of this practice is threatened by the following challenges: the impacts of climate change on mountain ecosystems, socioeconomic changes, market influence on livelihood decisions, youth migration and labor shortage, low motivation of local people to engage in livestock rearing, and conflicts between herder and nonherder communities and institutions, as well as inadequate policy support and institutional arrangements.

40|$|This UNESCO report {{looks into}} the {{damaging}} {{effects of climate change}} on Indigenous cultures. When considering climate change, indigenous peoples and marginalized populations warrant particular attention. Impacts on their territories and communities are anticipated to be both early and severe due to their location in vulnerable environments, including small islands, high-altitude zones, desert margins and the circumpolar Arctic. Indeed, climate change poses a direct threat to many indigenous societies due to their continuing reliance upon resource-based livelihoods. Heightened exposure to negative impacts, however, is not the only reason for specific attention and concern. As many indigenous societies are socially and culturally distinct from mainstream society, decisions, policies and actions undertaken by the majority, even if well-intended, may prove inadequate, ill-adapted, and even inappropriate. There is therefore a need to understand the specific vulnerabilities, concerns, adaptation capacities and longer-term aspirations of indigenous peoples and marginalized communities throughout the world. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>and</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> contribute to this broader understanding...|$|E

Focusing on eight newspapers in Canada, the USA, Australia, and New Zealand, we examine articles published from 1995 to 2015, and analyze them using content and framing analyses. The impacts of climate change are portrayed as having severe ecological, sociocultural, and health/safety impacts for Indigenous peoples, who are often framed as victims and “harbingers” of climate change. There is a strong focus on stories reporting on the Arctic. The lack of substantive discussion of colonialism or marginalization in the reviewed stories limits media portrayal of the structural roots of vulnerability, rendering climate change as a problem for, rather than of society. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>and</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is widely discussed, but principally {{as a means of}} corroborating scientific knowledge, or in accordance with romanticized portrayals of Indigenous peoples.

40|$|During {{the course}} of bio-prospecting and {{biodiversity}} conservation projects, scientists, researchers from the life-science industry, and environmental protection groups attempt to access <b>indigenous</b> <b>and</b> <b>traditional</b> communities’ <b>knowledge</b> of the local biodiversity. They confront these groups {{with the idea that}} their knowledge can be commercialized. Although the affected communities partly adapt to this view, they insist on their right to decide autonomously and by their own laws whether they are willing to share their knowledge. External actors, however, often reject the right of indigenous self-determination. The evolving conflicts do not only take place on a local level – varying domestic regulatory approaches also shape them.

Conservation of wildlife species, their habitats, and other natural ecosystems such as water catchment areas and wetlands are increasingly coming under intense pressure and threat of extirpation. The pressure is as a result of an increase in human population, changing land uses, and the ever-increasing need for goods and services from the ecosystems. These ecosystems therefore need proactive management. Management interventions are necessary to ensure wise use for sustainable socioeconomic development. Conser-vation education becomes a necessary management tool to inform and impart knowledge, particularly to local communities, as well as to enhance <b>indigenous</b> <b>and</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> that is useful for conservation. Our starting point Formal conservation education in Kenya started in 1966 when the first education center was established in Nairobi. The establishment of the education center was inspired by the Nai-robi Animal Orphanage, which became operational in 1964 (KWS 1996). The goal of the orphanage was to give orphaned wildlife a place to recuperate and a temporary home before being returned to the wild. The education center was to use animals from the orphanage for educational purposes. Prior to this, there was no organized way of imparting wildlife conservation education to the public. Indigenous knowledge on matters of wildlife ruled, with some knowledge passed on in the form of folklore and myths. From one education center in 1966 the number has grown to 15, and more are planned.

In this paper we investigate: (1) themes, questions, or problems encountered for integration of <b>indigenous</b> knowledge <b>and</b> science; (2) the relationship between knowledge integration and social-ecological system resilience; and (3) critical features of knowledge integration practice needed to foster productive and mutually beneficial relationships between <b>indigenous</b> knowledge <b>and</b> science.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{creation}} of the Nunavut government {{has been accompanied by}} an emphasis on Inuit knowledge—Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) —in the making of policy and in procedures affecting Nunavutmiut (Nunavummiut). Definitions of IQ parallel those of <b>traditional</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> (TEK), <b>indigenous</b> <b>knowledge</b> (IK), <b>and</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge</b> (TK). The extent to which cosmologies and belief systems are incorporated into definitions of these terms {{and the extent to which}} their use is narrowly focused on the management of biological resources are ongoing sources of concern. The language used to define and promote IQ often serves to move IQ away from its cosmological implications and define it as a tool useful for filling gaps in scientific knowledge. To appreciate a seamless definition of IQ, a better understanding of Inuit social and cultural history is necessary. An examination of this history depicts IQ as a form of resistant practice that can seriously challenge characteristic assumptions of Western science, such as the separation of humans from other forms of life. Inuit operating with a seamless definition of IQ are, however, confronted with contemporary social, economic, and political realities that challenge and may limit the use of IQ in the management and development of Nunavut...|$|R

The MBA is also used in the management of water for First Nations communities throughout Ontario and Canada. Literature on water quality management for First Nations suggests that despite these changes, many communities continue to face challenges for ensuring the safety and quality of their drinking water supplies. Fort William First Nation, Gull Bay First Nation, and Mattagami First Nation, were selected for this study in order to investigate the use of the MBA in these communities. Data was collected using key informant interviews with representatives of institutions that affect water management for the case study communities, direct observations during visits to two of the communities and attendance at a First Nations water policy forum, and through a review of recent reports and publications on safe drinking water for First Nations. The research has provided insight into the challenges that the case study communities face for ensuring safe drinking water under the MBA, as well as opportunities that exist to address those challenges. The findings suggest that the MBA currently does not meet the unique needs of some First Nations communities. They also suggest that specific adaptations of existing water management strategies to the MBA framework may lead to a more effective approach to ensure safe drinking water for First Nations communities. This thesis focuses on several key ways to make these changes: Strengthen public involvement and awareness; Introduce effective legislative and policy frameworks; Encourage research, science and technology for First Nations’ water management; Allocate sufficient financial resources to First Nations to recruit, train and retain qualified water managers and maintain drinking water infrastructure, and; Increase efforts to ensure that water management goals are supported by local <b>and</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> beliefs <b>and</b> perspectives...|$|R

Amid these concerns, debates have emerged between midwives and the state about the best way to standardize midwifery education. In this dissertation, based on 17 months of ethnographic research with midwives, students, doctors and politicians, I describe the historical roles that midwives have played in Mexico, situate Mexican midwifery within broader trends in development and the expansion of Western biomedicine, and trace the lived experiences of Mexican midwives and their students to see how such trends impact their daily practices, experiences, and goals. My findings about midwives and their shifting fields of practice illustrate the stakes, challenges, and productive possibilities of large-scale attempts to standardize new models of medical training and care. They also refresh our understandings of what midwives do and know, and reveal how medical innovations from the margins may arise unexpectedly. By engaging critically with actors at all levels of Mexican midwifery, I reveal how claims to truth, such as in debates over best practices in women’s health care, cannot be separated from the broader socio-political contexts from which they emerge. Specifically, I argue that we must critically examine how medical practices and training develop, especially outside of the global North. My work further engages with discussions about processes of development in Latin America, arguing that we must broaden our conception of what might count as “modern,” while not forgetting the historical legacies tied to notions of modernity. Mexico’s current investment in midwifery destabilizes assumptions about the roles of <b>indigenous,</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>and</b> biomedical <b>knowledge</b> within the development paradigm. I show how both expertise and marginalized knowledge are strategically levied in light of international standards, national projects of development, and local conceptions of appropriate knowledge forms. Finally, my work contributes to debates around reproductive politics by interrogating the relationship between women’s health and national development concerns; international pressures to reduce maternal mortality in Mexico have allowed midwives, who had long been categorized as unsafe, to regain authority in the field of reproduction...|$|R
