40|$|The stilling basins {{are used}} to {{dissipate}} the energy of flowing water and protect the downstream structures like spillways, canals, etc. from the scouring. The aim of the present experimental investigation is to design the new stilling basin models for non circular pipe outlet using <b>intermediate</b> <b>sill</b> of different shapes having height equal to the diameter of pipe outlet. The experimental study was carried out for three Froude numbers namely 3. 85, 2. 85 and 1. 85 for pipe outlet. Scour index (SI) {{has been used to}} evaluate the performance of stilling basin models with different shapes of <b>intermediate</b> <b>sill,</b> tested using same sand base material and test run time. The scour pattern was measured for each test run and flow pattern was also observed. After twelve tests runs, it was found that scour process were reduced for a shaped of <b>intermediate</b> <b>sill</b> having height equal to the diameter of pipe outlet at a particular location of <b>intermediate</b> <b>sill</b> combined with end sill of particular size and shape along with impact wall. Performance of this model having square shaped <b>intermediate</b> <b>sill</b> was found to be much better than USBR VI impact basin model for similar flow conditions...|$|E

40|$|El Teniente {{occurs in}} the late Miocene-early Pliocene metallogenic belt of central Chile. It is the world's largest known copper resource, {{containing}} 94. 4 Mt of fine copper, and 2. 5 Mt of fine molybdenum. The ore deposits formed during {{the final stages of}} a period of compression and crustal thickening initiated approximately 15 m. y. ago due to subduction of the Juan Fernandez Ridge. El Teniente is hosted by the Miocene Farellones Formation and is located at the intersection of two major faults. The NNW trending Codegua Fault is interpreted to have formed from reactivation of a basement Triassic rift and has localised late Miocene volcanism. The NNE-trending Teniente Fault Zone controlled the emplacement of the 8. 9 to 7 Ma Sewell Diorite complex. The Teniente host sequence is a strongly altered package of mafic to <b>intermediate</b> <b>sills,</b> stocks, extrusives and volcaniclastic rock. Early, widespread, barren magnetite-Ca-plagioclase alteration of the host sequence occurred, prior to emplacement of the late Miocene - early Pliocene calc-alkaline Teniente intrusive complex. Copper-molybdenum ore at El Teniente is hosted in veins and subordinate breccias, and is associated with extensive zones of hydrothermal alteration. Sulfide minerals are zoned from bornite (core) through chalcopyrite to pyrite (deposit periphery). The 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|Magmatic sills in {{the study}} area are {{positive}} high amplitude anomalies with similar polarity as the seabed reflection. The sills have saucer, transgressive and concave-up geometries occurring at three principal stratigraphic intervals but importantly formed an interconnected sill complex at depth of about - 5000 ms TWTT. Sill-sill interactions are identified based on sill-sill junction types. Area coverage of magmatic sills in this study area include 15. 2 to 94. 3 km 2 for shallow sills, 8. 8 to 186. 4 km 2 for <b>intermediate</b> <b>sills</b> and 48. 4 to 186. 4 km 2 for the deeper sills. An evidence for lateral migration of sills for longer distances upon ascent from a magma chamber. To understand the importance of fault-sill interaction, 136 faults associated with magmatic sills were interpreted and studied for their throw-depth (T-z) and displacement (D-x) characters. Magmatic sills in the Naglfar Dome show disparate relationship with faults. At fault-sill junctions, C-type junctions are predominant. The propagation of magma through pre-existing faults causes formation of inclined sheets, intrusive steps, and reorientation of magma flow along faults strike. Thirteen (13) magmatic sills associated with hydrothermal vents {{in the study}} area have eye-, dome-, crater-, and pyramid-shaped upper parts. Vertical ascent of hydrothermal fluids caused local perturbation of the stress state within the overlying polygonal faults creating radial faults at the tops of the vents. This thesis describes the complexity of fault-sills interaction in magma-rich basins and represents a good case study to understand the role of faults during subsurface magma plumbing. This thesis has broader implications for regional tectonic history, mineral exploration and hydrocarbon prospectivity...|$|R
40|$|The Matagami mining {{camp in the}} {{northern}} Abitibi greenstone belt of Canada contains 19 known Archean volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits, 11 of which have collectively produced 46. 5 Mt of zinc-rich ore to date. The VMS deposits occur in three NW-SE – to WNW-ESE–oriented trends called the north flank, the south flank, and the west camp, which are composed of a felsic to mafic volcanic sequence cut by mafic to <b>intermediate,</b> synvolcanic <b>sills</b> and dikes. In order to clarify stratigraphic relationships between the south flank and the west camp, and to constrain the temporal evolution of volcanic activity, six new high-precision U-Pb zircon ages have been obtained. These data show that the total duration of felsic volcanism in the south flank {{was no more than}} 2. 5 m. y., with the rhyolites extruded in the following order: Watson Rhyolite (2725. 9 ± 0. 8 Ma), Bracemac Rhyolite (2725. 8 ± 0. 7 Ma), Dumagami Rhyolite at the Persévérance Mine (2725. 4 ± 0. 7 Ma), and Dumagami Rhyolite in the Orchan West VMS deposit area (2724. 9 ± 0. 7 Ma). A hiatus in effusive volcanism is represented by the Key Tuffite, an important marker horizon in the camp. The hiatus probably lasted on the order of 0. 5 m. y. Significantly, the rhyolite from the footwall of the Caber VMS deposit in the west camp has an age of 2725. 9 ± 1. 2 Ma, identical to that of the Watson Rhyolite on the south flank...|$|R

The models are tested on 4 cm x 4 cm square opening (d = 4 cm) for Froude number (Fr) = 6. 83 with a diverging side walls at a slope of 1 V: 0. 8 H. Appurtenances of several shapes and sizes like splitter block, impact wall, baffle blocks, <b>intermediate</b> <b>sill,</b> and end sills are tested in the laboratory at different locations. It {{has been found that}} a row of wedge shaped block quite is helpful in spreading the jet of water in a shorter length of basin with diverging side walls, resulting into better and more energy dissipation. It was found that the length of stilling basin models can be reduced (12. 9 d to 10. 9 d) i. e. by more than 15 % as compared to USBR impact type VI stilling basin model...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiple}} {{basic to}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>sill</b> is {{reported for the}} first time in the south-eastern Iberian Ranges. It is composed of several tabular to irregular levels intercalated within the fluvial sediments of the Alcotas Formation (Middle-Upper Permian). The sill could represent the youngest Paleozoic subvolcanic intrusion in the Iberian Ranges. The igneous rocks are classified as basaltic andesites. They show a subophitic microstructure constituted by plagioclase (An 62 – An 6), augite (En 48 Wo 44 Fs 7 –En 46 Wo 39 Fs 15), pseudomorphosed olivine, minor amounts of oxides (magnetite and ilmenite) and accessory F-apatite. According to the mineralogy and whole-rock composition, their geochemical affinity is transitional from subalkaline to alkaline. Radiometric dating of the sill is not feasible due to its significant alteration. Field criteria, however, suggest an emplacement coeval to the deposition of the Alcotas Formation (Middle-Upper Permian). This hypothesis is supported by the transitional affinity of these rocks, similar to other Middle-Upper Permian magmatisms in the western Tethys, e. g., from the Pyrenees. Taking into account their isotopic signature (εSr: - 6. 8 to - 9. 2; εNd:+ 1. 7 to + 8. 3), an enriched mantle source with the involvement of a HIMU component has been identified. This interpretation is supported by the trace element contents. Some of these HIMU characteristics have been recognised in the Middle-Upper Permian magmatisms of the Central Pyrenees (Anayet Basin) and the High Atlas (Argana Basin). However, none of these source features are shared with other Middle-Upper Permian magmatisms of the western Tethys (Catalonian Coastal Ranges, Corsica-Sardinia and southern France), nor with the Lower Permian magmatism of the Iberian Ranges. These differences support the presence of a heterogeneous mantle in the western Tethys during the Permian...|$|E
40|$|From {{at least}} the Early Jurassic to the Miocene, eastward {{subduction}} of oceanic crust took place beneath the Antarctic Peninsula. Magmatism associated with the subduction generated a N-S linear belt of volcanic rocks known as the Antarctic Peninsula Volcanic Group (APVG), and which erosion has now exposed at about the plutonic/volcanic interface. Large central volcanoes from the APVG are described {{here for the first}} time. The structures are situated in north-west Palmer Land within the main Mesozoic magmatic arc. One centre, Zonda Towers, is recognized by the presence of a 160 m thick silicic ignimbrite, containing accidental lava blocks up to 25 m in diameter. This megabreccia is interpreted as a caldera-fill deposit which formed by land sliding of steep caldera walls during ignimbrite eruption and deposition. A larger centre, Mount Edgell-Wright Spires, is dominated by coarse-grained debris flow deposits and silicic ignimbrites which, with minor lavas and fine-grained tuffs, form a volcanic succession some 1. 5 km thick. Basic <b>intermediate</b> and silicic <b>sills</b> c. 50 m thick intrude the succession. A central gabbro-granite intrusion is interpreted to be a high-level magma chamber of the Mount Edgell volcano...|$|R
40|$|The LaRonde Penna Au-rich volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit is {{the largest}} Au deposit {{currently}} mined in Canada (58. 8 Mt at 4. 31 g/t, containing 8. 1 Moz of Au). It {{is part of the}} Doyon-Bousquet-LaRonde mining camp located {{in the eastern part of}} the Blake River Group of the Abitibi greenstone belt which is host to several of the world’s most important, present and past, Au-rich VMS deposits (e. g., Horne, Quemont, Bousquet, Bousquet 2 -Dumagami). The LaRonde Penna deposit consists of massive to semimassive sulfide lenses (Au-Zn-Ag-Cu-Pb), stacked in the upper part of a steeply dipping, south-facing homoclinal volcanic sequence composed of extensive tholeiitic basaltic flows (Hébécourt Formation) overlain by tholeiitic to transitional, mafic to intermediate, effusive and volcaniclastic units at the base (lower member of the Bousquet Formation) and transitional to calc-alkaline, intermediate to felsic, effusive and intrusive rocks on top (upper member of the Bousquet Formation). The mafic to felsic volcanism of the Hébécourt Formation and of the lower member of the Bousquet Formation formed an extensive submarine basement or platform on which the intermediate to felsic rocks of the upper member of the Bousquet Formation were emplaced at restricted submarine eruptive centers or as shallow composite intrusive complexes. The submarine felsic volcanic rocks of the upper member of the Bousquet Formation are characterized by dacitic to rhyodacitic autoclastic (flow breccia) deposits that are cut and overlain by rhyodacitic and rhyolitic domes and/or partly extrusive cryptodomes and by <b>intermediate</b> to mafic <b>sills</b> and dikes. This volcanic architecture is thought to have been responsible for internal variations in ore and alteration styles, not only from one lens to another, but also along a single mineralized horizon or lens. In the upper part of the mine, the 20 North lens comprises a transposed pyrite-chalcopyrite (Au-Cu) stockwork (20 N Au zone) overlain by a pyrite-sphalerite-galena-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite (Zn-Ag-Pb) massive sulfide lens (20 N Zn zone). The latter was formed, at least in part, by replacement of footwall rhyodacitic autoclastic deposits emplaced within a subbasin located between two rhyolite domes or cryptodomes. The 20 N Zn zone tapers with depth in the mine and gives way to the 20 N Au zone. At depth in the mine, the 20 N Au zone consists of semimassive sulfides (Au-rich pyrite and chalcopyrite) enclosed by a large aluminous alteration halo on the margin of a large rhyolitic dome or cryptodome. U-Pb zircon geochronology gives ages of 2698. 3 ± 0. 8 and 2697. 8 ± 1 Ma for the footwall and hanging-wall units of the 20 North lens, respectively. Thus, the formation of the 20 North lens was coeval with other VMS deposits in the Bousquet Formation and in the uppermost units of the Blake River Group. Although deformation and metamorphism have affected the primary mineral assemblages and the original geometry of the deposit, these events were not responsible for the different auriferous ore zones and alteration at LaRonde Penna. Studies of the LaRonde Penna deposit show that the hydrothermal system evolved in time and space from near-neutral seawater-dominated hydrothermal fluids, responsible for Au-Cu-Zn-Ag-Pb mineralization, to highly acidic fluids with possible direct magmatic contributions, responsible for Au ± Cu-rich ore and aluminous alteration. The different ore types and alteration reflect the evolving local volcanic setting described in this study...|$|R
