40|$|We {{describe}} {{two methods}} for staining resinless thin sections with antibodies and gold-conjugated second antibodies. Immunolocalization of specific proteins {{is a powerful}} tool for cell structure studies but current techniques do not develop its full potential. Immunofluorescence provides only low-resolution localization, whereas conventional thin-section electron microscopy images and immunostains only the section surface. Resinless sections of extracted cell structures offer a simple and effective means of immuno-electron microscopy. Without embedding plastic or soluble proteins, the cell cytostructure produces high-contrast, three-dimensional images. Resinless sections of detergent-extracted cells are prepared by embedding in diethylene glycol <b>distearate,</b> sectioning, and removing diethylene glycol <b>distearate</b> before microscopy. In the first method of immunostaining, extracted cells were fixed and stained with antibodies before embedment, sectioning, removal of the embedding resin, and critical point drying. In the postembedment method, the sample was embedded and sectioned, the diethylene glycol <b>distearate</b> was removed, and the sample was rehydrated before antibody staining. With these techniques, specific proteins were localized with high resolution throughout the entire section.

40|$|International audienceEthylene glycol <b>distearate</b> (EGDS) {{was forced}} to {{crystallize}} as thin platelet {{in order to obtain}} a pearlescent effect. This was possible by performing a cooling surface crystallization in oil-in-water emulsion with the presence of an emulsifier. Under stagnant conditions, nucleation events and growth of faceted crystals in the oil phase were in situ monitored under microscope. After a first primary nucleation of dendritic crystals, a second population of faceted crystals arose by secondary nucleation and seemed to be the prevailing population. In a stirred vessel, the platelet shape of EGDS crystals was driven by the surfactant choice. Only a non-ionic surfactant, located at the liquid interface was supposed to interact with EGDS during the development of the crystals favouring a platelet habit. The nature of the interaction was not yet established. Moreover, the mastery of the platelet shape was lost when the amount of non-ionic surfactant relatively to the EGDS was decreased. This underlined the importance of the non-ionic surfactant for the obtaining of desired shape. The different physical qualities of crystals produced allowed us to confirm relationships between EGDS particle features with their effect of pearlescence of a cold pearl blend...|$|E

The oil phase components can be selected from mineral oils, vegetable oils and synthetic esters, which enable different variety of application profile of these emulsions. It is possible to prepare stable emulsions using low-level concentration of the PMD (2 - 3 %) if lotions contain 10 - 25 %, and creams 20 - 40 % of oil phase. PMD forms liquid crystal structure {{in the presence of}} stearic acid, glyceryl stearate, fatty alcohols, or their combinations. The o/w type creams, stabilized by these mixed emulsifiers are complex, multiphase systems. The aim of this work was to formulate, prepare and investigate long-term stability of the o/w creams stabilized by mixed emulsifier polyglyceryl- 3 methylglucose distearate/glyceryl stearate/stearyl alcohol, depending on concentration levels of PMD (2 % or 3 %) and oil:water phase ratio (20 : 80 and 30 : 70). The samples were prepared using hot/hot procedure. Organoleptic inspection, centrifugation test, rheological measurements, electric conductivity and pH value measurements were performed 72 h, 1, 3, 12 and 30 months after preparation. The prepared samples were apparently white and homogenous creams. The consistency and homogeneity were preserved after centrifugation of the creams after 72 h, 1, 3, 12 and 30 months storage, and no phase separation could be detected. The pH values obtained are suitable for skin application. Conductivity values (25. 2 - 63. 7 μS cm 1, 72 h after preparation) were attributed to the multiple phase o/w emulsions with high percentages of fixed water. Results of the rheological measurements have shown that the investigated creams exhibited non-Newtonian thyxotropic behavior. The concentration of emulsifier PMD and oil phase content had an influence on the rheological parameters of investigated samples. The creams prepared with higher content of emulsifiers (3 %) and oil phase (30 %) exhibited higher values of apparent viscosities and thyxotropic area. The observed decrease of electrical conductivity and increase of apparent viscosities values, which occurred in the creams during 3 months of storage, were probably attributed to bulk water content decreasing. These changes are mildly expressed in the samples with higher content of oil phase. The obtained results of organoleptic characteristics, pH, electric conductivity value and rheological parameters during 30 months of storage indicate good long-term stability of the o/w creams prepared with mixed emulsifier containing PMD at low concentration levels (2 % or 3 %). Changes during ageing, caused by structuration of creams were less expressed in samples with 30 % of oil phase, however, the observed differences were not related with the PMD concentration. In this case, advantage could be given to o/w cream prepared with 30 % of oil phase, stabilized by using 2 % emulsifier polyglyceryl- 3 methylglucose <b>distearate...</b>|$|E

Microbubbles were also prepared containing a fluorinated phospholipid, perfluoroalkylated glycerol-phosphatidylcholine, F-GPC shells encompassing perfluorohexane-saturated nitrogen gas. These microbubbles were evaluated in terms of physico-chemical characteristics such as size and stability. In parallel to these studies, DSPC microbubbles were also formulated containing nitrogen (N 2) gas and compared to air-filled microbubbles. By preventing advection, signal drifts were used to assess their stability. DSPC microbubbles were found to have a drift of 20 % signal change per bar of applied pressure in contrast to the F-GPC microbubbles which are considerably more stable with a lower drift of 5 % signal change per bar of applied pressure. By increasing the pressure of the system and monitoring the MR signal intensity, the point at which the majority of the microbubbles have been damaged was determined. For the DSPC microbubbles this occurs at 1. 3 bar whilst the F-GPC microbubbles withstand pressures up to 2. 6 bar. For the comparison between air-filled and N 2 -filled microbubbles, the MRI sensitivity is assessed by cycling the pressure of the system and monitoring the MR signal intensity.

However, owing to its poor aqueous solubility, effective delivery and absorption across biological barriers, {{in particular the}} blood brain barrier (BBB), are challenging. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have shown a promising potential as a drug delivery system to carry lipophilic drugs across the BBB, a major obstacle in brain cancer therapy. Nevertheless, limited information is available about the cytotoxic mechanisms of nano-lipidic carriers with AA on normal and glioma cells. This study assessed the anti-cancer efficacy of AA-loaded SLNs against glioblastoma and their cellular uptake mechanism in comparison with SVG P 12 (human foetal glial) cells. SLNs were systematically investigated for three different solid lipids; glyceryl monostearate (MS), glyceryl <b>distearate</b> (DS) and glyceryl tristearate (TS). The non-drug containing MS-SLNs (E-MS-SLNs) did not show any apparent toxicity towards normal SVG P 12 cells, whilst the AA-loaded MS-SLNs (AA-MS-SLNs) displayed a more favourable drug release profile and higher cytotoxicity towards U 87 MG cells. Therefore, MS-SLNs were chosen for further in vitro studies. Cytotoxicity studies of SLNs (±AA) were performed using MTT assay where AA-SLNs showed significantly higher cytotoxicity towards U 87 MG cells than SVG P 12 normal cells, as confirmed by flow cell cytometry. Cellular uptake of SLNs also appeared to be preferentially facilitated by energy-dependent endocytosis as evidenced by fluorescence imaging and flow cell cytometry.

Methods: Testosterone SLMs were formulated using an emulsion melt homogenization method. Various types and concentrations of fatty materials, namely glyceryl monostearate (GM), glyceryl <b>distearate</b> (GD), stearic acid (SA) and glyceryl behanate (GB) were used. The formulations contained 2. 5 or 5 mg TS g- 1. Morphology, particle size, entrapment efficiency (EE), rheological properties and thermal behaviour of the prepared SLM were examined. In vitro release characteristics of TS from various prepared SLM were also evaluated over 24 h using a vertical Franz diffusion cell. In addition, the effect of storage and freeze-drying on particle size and release pattern of TS from the selected formulation was evaluated. Results: The results indicated that the type of lipid affected the morphology and particle size of SLM. A relatively high drug percentage entrapment efficiency ranging from 80. 7 - 95. 7 % was obtained. Rheological studies showed plastic flow characteristics of the prepared formulations. DSC examination revealed that TS existed in amorphous form in the prepared SLM. Release studies revealed the following rank order of TS permeation through cellophane membrane after application of various formulations: 5 % GM< 5 % GD< 5 % SA< 5 % GB< 2. 5 % GM< 2. 5 % SA< 10 % GD< 10 % GB. The drug permeation through excised abdomen rat skin after application of 10 % GB- 2. 5 mg TS g- 1 SLM was lower than that permeated through cellophane membrane. Moreover, SLM containing 10 % GB- 2. 5 mg TS g- 1 stored at 5 °C showed good stability as indicated by the release study and particle size analysis. Trehalose showed high potential as a cryoprotectant during freeze drying of the selected SLM formulation.

40|$|International audienceAbstract A {{series of}} 25 virgin and refined edible oils, {{obtained}} from the retail market was analyzed for the content of free 3 -MCPD and 3 -MCPD released from its esters with higher fatty acids (bound 3 -MCPD). The oils contained free 3 -MCPD ranging from < 3 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) to 24 ƒÝg/kg. Surprisingly, the bound 3 -MCPD level was much higher and varied between < 100 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) and 2462 ƒÝg/kg. In average, virgin oils had relatively low levels of bound 3 -MCPD ranging from < 100 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) to < 300 ƒÝg/kg (LOQ). Higher levels of bound 3 -MCPD were found in oils obtained from roasted oilseeds (337 ƒÝg/kg) and {{in the majority of}} refined oils (< 300 ƒÝg/kg to 2462 ƒÝg/kg), including refined olive oils. In general, it appears that the formation of bound 3 -MCPD in oils is linked with the preliminary heat treatment of oilseeds and with the process of oil refining. The analysis of unrefined, degummed, bleached, and deodorized rapeseed oil showed that the level of bound MCPD decreased during the refining process. However, additional heating of seed oils for 30 minutes at temperatures ranging from 100 oC to 280 oC, and heating at 230 oC (260 oC) for up to 8 hours led to an increase of the bound 3 -MCPD level. On the contrary, heating of olive oil resulted in a decrease of the bound 3 -MCPD level. For comparison, the fat isolated from salami was analyzed for the intact fatty acid esters of 3 -MCPD. This fat contained the bound 3 -MCPD at the level of 1670 ƒÝg/kg and the fatty acid esters of 3 -MCPD mainly consisted of 3 -MCPD diesters, monoesters of 3 -MCPD were present in smaller amounts. The major types of 3 -MCPD diesters (about 85 %) were mixed diesters of palmitic acid with C 18 fatty acids (stearic, oleic, linoleic acids).

Active targeting of DDSs relies on specific interactions between the ligand (generally conjugated onto the surface of DDSs) and its receptor, which is overexpressed on target tumour tissues. In this study, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide was used to target the αvβ 3 integrin receptor that is overexpressed by both tumour endothelial cells and various tumour tissues, potentially providing a double-killing (by targeting tumour and tumour endothelial cells) effect. Asiatic acid (AA) is an extract from a medical plant, Centella Asiatica and has demonstrated potential anti-inflammatory, as well as anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer properties. However, its poor water solubility (0. 03 mg/mL) {{is one of the major}} limitations for its progression for clinical applications. To help overcome the solubility issue of AA and also to improve its therapeutic efficacy, AA was incorporated into RGD-containing solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) after optimisation of the SLN preparation comprised of glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl <b>distearate</b> and glyceryl tristearate lipids and subsequent characterisation on their physicochemical properties. The targeting ability of these AA-containing RGD-conjugated SLNs and their apoptotic / necrotic induction on cancer cells were assessed using U 87 MG glioma cells and ECV- 304 bladder cancer endothelial-like cells, which are known to express αvβ 3 integrin. Moreover, the efficacy of both AA and AA-loaded SLNs were tested for the first time on in vitro 3 D U 87 MG tumour spheroids. Besides the anti-tumour efficacy, AA-containing RGD-SLNs were also investigated for their potential anti-angiogenic effect using various cellular assays of ECV- 304 endothelial-like cells. Results obtained from this study showed that RGD-targeted SLN formulations improved the cellular uptake of nanoparticles compared to non-RGD containing SLNs and thus enhanced drug accumulation and cytotoxic effect seen on U 87 MG and ECV- 304 cells. Furthermore, AA-containing SLNs showed prevention of spheroid formation, inhibition of spheroid growth and cytotoxic effect on U 87 MG spheroids, where RGD-SLNs also showed improved spheroid penetration compared to non-RGD containing SLNs. In addition, AA-loaded RGD-SLNs showed potential anti-angiogenic effect by demonstrating concentration-dependent inhibition of cell adhesion, migration and invasion, as well as disruptions in tube network of endothelial cells in in vitro angiogenesis assay. To conclude, AA-loaded RGD-targeted SLNs showed promising anti-cancer and anti-angiogenic effects in vitro, which supports its development for future clinical applications and warrants further investigation on an appropriate in vivo angiogenesis model to maximise its clinical potential...|$|E
