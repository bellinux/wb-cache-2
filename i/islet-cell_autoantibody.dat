40|$|Objective: The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} {{type 1 diabetes}} (T 1 D) is essential for appropriately identifying prevention trial participants. Moreover, improved prediction accuracy might ultimately result in an earlier diagnosis. Thus, we have developed a risk score for the prediction of T 1 D. Research Design and Methods: Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT- 1) participants, <b>islet-cell</b> <b>autoantibody</b> (ICA) positive relatives of T 1 D patients (n= 670), were randomly divided into development and validation samples. Risk score values were calculated for the validation sample from development sample model coefficients obtained through forward stepwise proportional hazards regression. Results: A risk score based on a model including log-BMI, age, log-fasting C-peptide, and post-challenge glucose and C-peptide sums from 2 -hr oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) {{was derived from the}} development sample. The baseline risk score strongly predicted T 1 D in the validation sample (chi-square= 82. 3, p< 0. 001). Its strength of prediction was almost the same as (chi-square= 83. 3) a risk score additionally dependent on a decreased first-phase insulin respons...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{assessed}} {{the extent to}} which both standard and alternative indexes from 2 -h oral glucose tolerance testing predict type 1 diabetes and whether oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) predict type 1 diabetes in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The prediction of type 1 diabetes from baseline OGTTs was studied in 704 Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 participants (<b>islet-cell</b> <b>autoantibody</b> [ICA]-positive relatives of type 1 diabetic patients). The maximum follow-up was 7. 4 years. Analyses utilized receiver-operator curves (ROCs), proportional hazards models, and survival curves. RESULTS — ROC areas under the curve (ROCAUCs) for both the AUC glucose (0. 73 0. 02) and an OGTT prediction index (0. 78 0. 02) were higher (P 0. 001) than those for the fasting (0. 53 0. 02) and 2 -h glucose (0. 66 0. 02). ROCAUCs for the 60 - and 90 -min glucose (0. 71 0. 02 and 0. 72 0. 02, respectively) were also higher (P 0. 01) than those for the fasting and 2 -h glucose. Among individuals with normal glucose tolerance, OGTTs were highly predictive, with 4 th versus 1 st quartile hazard ratios for the 2 -h glucose, AUC glucose, and OGTT prediction index ranging from 3. 77 to 5. 30 (P 0. 001 for all) ...|$|E
40|$|Human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) DQ haplotypes {{have the}} strongest genetic association with {{type 1 diabetes}} (T 1 DM) risk. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of the study was}} to analyze whether HLA DQ alleles influence the development of antiislet autoantibodies, the progression to T 1 DM among autoantibody-positive relatives, or both. DESIGN: The Diabetes Prevention Trial- 1 screened more than 90, 000 nondiabetic relatives of patients for cytoplasmic <b>islet-cell</b> <b>autoantibody</b> (ICA) expression between 1994 and 2002. SETTING: The study was conducted in the general community. PARTICIPANTS: The Diabetes Prevention Trial- 1 found 2817 ICA-positive relatives who were tested for biochemical autoantibodies (GAD 65, ICA 512, and insulin) and HLA-DQ haplotypes, and 2796 of them were followed up for progression to diabetes for up to 8 yr (median, 3. 6 yr). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Progression to T 1 DM was measured. RESULTS: High-risk DQ haplotypes and genotypes were associated with a higher percentage of relatives expressing multiple biochemical autoantibodies and higher T 1 DM risk (e. g., respectively, 59 and 36 % at 5 yr for carriers of the DQA 1 * 0301 -DQB 1 * 0302 /DQA 1 * 0501 -DQB 1 * 0201 genotype). The number of autoantibodies expressed significantly increased T 1 DM risk and across different DQ genotypes, autoantibody positivity directly correlated with diabetes risk. However, multivariate analyses indicated that the influence of most genotypes on T 1 DM risk was not independent from autoantibody expression, with the possible exception of DQA 1 * 0102 -DQB 1 * 0602. Specific genotypic combinations conferred 5 -yr diabetes risks significantly lower (e. g. 7 %-DQA 1 * 0201 -DQB 1 * 0201 /DQA 1 * 0501 -DQB 1 * 0201 and 14 %-DQA 1 * 0301 -DQB 1 * 0301 /DQA 1 * 0501 -DQB 1 * 0201) than when those haplotypes were found in other combinations. CONCLUSION: HLA DQ alleles determine autoantibody expression, which is correlated with diabetes progression. Among autoantibody-positive relatives, most HLA DQ genotypes did not further influence T 1 DM risk...|$|E

40|$|The {{pancreatic}} islet beta-cells are the target for an autoimmune process that eventually {{results in an}} inability to control blood glucose {{due to the lack}} of insulin. The different steps that eventually lead to the complete loss of the beta-cells are reviewed to include the very first step of a triggering event that initiates the development of beta-cell autoimmunity to the last step of appearance of <b>islet-cell</b> <b>autoantibodies,</b> which may mark that insulitis is about to form. The observations that the initial beta-cell destruction by virus or other environmental factors triggers islet autoimmunity not in the islets but in the draining pancreatic lymph nodes are reviewed along with possible basic mechanisms of loss of tolerance to islet autoantigens. Once islet autoimmunity is established the question is how beta-cells are progressively killed by autoreactive lymphocytes which eventually results in chronic insulitis. Many of these series of events have been dissected in spontaneously diabetic mice or rats, but controlled clinical trials have shown that rodent observations are not always translated into mechanisms in humans. Attempts are therefore needed to clarify the step 1 triggering mechanisms and the step to chronic autoimmune insulitis to develop evidence-based treatment approaches to prevent type 1 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) is {{a chronic}} autoimmunedisorder {{in which the}} destruction of the insulin-producing cells and resulting clinical symptomsare preceded by the appearance of a number of <b>islet-cell</b> specific <b>autoantibodies.</b> Linkage (1) and associa-tion analyses have demonstrated that type 1 diabetes has a very strong genetic component, with specific alleles and haplotypes at the HLA class II genes, as well as HLA-A and-B alleles, conferring either susceptibility to or protection from T 1 D (2 – 6). The ability to identify individuals at high risk for type 1 diabetes using genetic and/or autoantibody markers (7 – 10) has been a long-standing goal of the di-abetes research and clinical community and a critical el-ement in T 1 D prevention strategies. The role of prediction in prevention is twofold: 1) Clinical trials to evaluate po-tential preventative interventions are more efficient if the recruited subjects are at high T 1 D risk, and 2) inter-ventions {{are likely to be more}} effective if administered early in disease progression or during the prediabeti...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{correlated}} {{genetic background}} and pancreatic <b>islet-cell</b> <b>autoantibody</b> status (type and number) in type 1 A diabetes mellitus (T 1 AD), {{but there are}} no data evaluating the relationship among these markers with serum cytokines, regulatory T cells and beta cell function. This characterization has a potential importance with regard to T 1 AD patients' stratification and follow-up in therapeutic prevention. in this study we showed that peripheral sera cytokines [interleukin (IL) - 12, IL- 6, II- 1 beta, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -a, IL- 10] and chemokines (CXCL 10, CXCL 8, CXCL 9, CCL 2) measured were significantly higher in newly diagnosed T 1 AD patients when compared to healthy controls (P < 0. 001). Among T 1 AD, we found a positive correlation between CXCL 10 and CCL- 2 (r = 0. 80; P = 0. 000), IL- 8 and TNF-alpha (r = 0. 60; P = 0. 000); IL- 8 and IL- 12 (r = 0. 57; P = 0. 001) and TNF-alpha and IL- 12 (r = 0. 93; P = 0. 000). Glutamic acid decarboxylase- 65 (GAD- 65) autoantibodies (GADA) were associated negatively with CXCL 10 (r = - 0. 45; P = 0. 011) and CCL 2 (r = - 0. 65; P = 0. 000), while IA- 2 A showed a negative correlation with IL- 10 (r = - 0. 38; P = 0. 027). Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DR 3, DR 4 or DR 3 /DR 4 and PTPN 22 polymorphism did not show any association with pancreatic islet cell antibodies or cytokines studied. in summary, our results revealed that T 1 AD have a proinflammatory cytokine profile compared to healthy controls and that IA- 2 A sera titres seem to be associated with a more inflammatory peripheral cytokine/chemokine profile than GADA. A confirmation of these data in the pre-T 1 AD phase could help to explain the mechanistic of the well-known role of IA- 2 A as a more specific marker of beta-cell damage than GADA during the natural history of T 1 AD.

40|$|Based on American Diabetes Association (ADA), {{diabetes}} can {{be classified}} into the following general categories: type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), type 2 diabetes (T 2 D), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and specific types of diabetes due to other cause. Obesity {{is by far the}} main underlying factor causing T 2 D and its pathological potential lies in obesity-associated insulin resistance, activation of innate immunity and chronic low-grade inflammation. When tissue inflammation induced, tissue destruction occurs, 'self' antigens, which are generally not accessible to T cells, can be released from the affected tissues and promote autoimmune activation. The 4 major <b>autoantibodies</b> are <b>islet-cell</b> cytoplasmic <b>autoantibodies</b> (ICA), glutamid acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA), islet antigen- 2 antibody (IA- 2 A) and insulin autoantibodies (IAA). In addition, ZnT 8 A has recently been found to predict T 1 D. ZnT 8 is contained in the islets of Langerhans, with the highest expression is in β cells of the pancreas. ZnT 8 A measurements simultaneously with GADA, IA- 2 A and IAA achieve rates of 98 % detection for onset level of autoimmune diabetes. Presence of antibodies in T 2 D also shows the potential serious complications compared with T 2 D without antibodies. The combination of GADA, IA- 2 A and ZnT 8 A can be suggested as the most powerful and cost-effective diagnostic approach in patients with T 1 D.
