5|$|A {{study by}} Arima et al. {{published}} in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling {{to provide the}} first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to soy production. Previously, the indirect impacts of soy crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a <b>global</b> <b>scale,</b> while the study took a regional approach. The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for cattle production on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC in measuring the carbon footprint of soy crops, whether produced for biofuels or other end-uses.|$|E
5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} expert Dr. William M. Gray on April7 predicted eleven named storms, {{with eight}} reaching hurricane strength {{and three of}} the eight reaching Category3 strength. The prediction issued on June7 was similar, increasing the named storms to twelve, eight hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. On May10, NOAA issued a season outlook, which gave the indication of an above-average season. According to NOAA, the <b>global</b> <b>scale</b> atmospheric circulation pattern which was taking place was conducive to an above-average hurricane season. However, La Niña was present it the Eastern Pacific, which was a factor in the activity in the season. NOAA issued a 75% chance of above average activity.|$|E

A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water.|$|E
30|$|We present {{three sets}} of results. First, we analyze the human-induced changes in water balance for the Aral Sea region. We focus on this region because, to the authors’ knowledge, very few studies have used model results to {{mechanistically}} explain the natural and human-induced changes in river flows that caused the desiccation of the sea {{over the past several}} decades. Second, we present the results from offline simulations at both regional and <b>global</b> <b>scales</b> to examine the changes in surface energy balance due to irrigation. Finally, we use online model simulations to detect the irrigation-induced climate impacts, again at both regional and <b>global</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|R

The chapter also explores how local and <b>global</b> <b>scales</b> might be integrated into a single and effective policy framework, incorporating the advantages of decentralization and local action along with the advantages of centralized and national action.

5|$|After {{collecting}} {{all four}} artefacts, Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers that Dr. Willard {{had been using}} the knowledge gained from the meteorite to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a <b>global</b> <b>scale,</b> using the combined power of the artefacts and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating the treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteorite by recovering the artefacts, kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.|$|E

As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a <b>global</b> <b>scale.</b> On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations.

5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program.

Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park.

5|$|In contrast, Roman {{expansion}} into Spain and Gaul occurred as {{a mix of}} alliance-seeking and military occupation. In the 2nd century BC, Roman involvement in the Greek east remained a matter of alliance-seeking, but {{this time in the}} face of major powers that could rival Rome. According to Polybius, who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate the Greek east in less than a century, this was mainly a matter of several Greek city-states seeking Roman protection against the Macedonian kingdom and Seleucid Empire in the face of destabilisation created by the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt. In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only Rome could fill. This had some important similarities to (and important differences from) the events in Italy centuries earlier, but this time on a <b>global</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
5|$|Possibly, it was {{accelerated}} by {{the creation of}} the Deccan Traps, however, some scientists maintain the extinction was caused or exacerbated by other factors, such as volcanic eruptions, climate change, or sea level change, separately or together. A 2016 drilling project into the Chicxulub peak ring confirmed that the peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep in the earth (rather than usual seafloor rock), and evidence of colossal seawater movement directly afterwards (from layered sand deposits). Crucially the cores also showed a near complete absence of gypsum, the usual sea floor rock in the region, which is sulfate-containing; this would have been vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, providing evidence of a probable link between the impact and a <b>global</b> <b>scale</b> of longer-term effects on the climate and food chain.|$|E

In places with {{wet and dry}} seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates with the time of outbreaks.

Bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a <b>global</b> <b>scale.</b> Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, in crowded households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion.
