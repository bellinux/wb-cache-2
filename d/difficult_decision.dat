Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the <b>difficult</b> <b>decision</b> to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E
5|$|Clement XIII died {{suddenly}} on 2 February 1769, {{a day before}} {{the date of the}} consistory that he had convoked to examine the demands for the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, in 1762 from the Kingdom of France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII left this <b>difficult</b> <b>decision</b> to his successor.|$|E
5|$|The band {{existed for}} almost a decade before {{mainstream}} success. The members met and played in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School under the name Pezz and remained underground in Toronto's indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of Warner Music Canada's A department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success. Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada, and continues to expand their success overseas, this included touring for 20 months supporting their second album. They released their third album, entitled Billy Talent III, on July 14, 2009, and their fourth album, entitled Dead Silence, on September 4, 2012. Dead Silence was followed up by a full UK tour over the course of October and November 2012. To commemorate the longevity since the release of their first studio album, the band has released a greatest hits album entitled Hits on November 4, 2014. The band regrouped and began to prepare material for its fifth studio album. Just prior to entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk made the <b>difficult</b> <b>decision</b> to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with multiple sclerosis. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and in early 2016 the group completed work on Afraid of Heights, which was released that July.|$|E

40|$|Perceptual {{decision}} making requires the comparison and integra-tion of sensory evidence {{to generate a}} behavioral response. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate the temporal dynam-ics of {{decision making}} during an auditory task that required forced-choice decisions about whether a pair of syllables S 1 and S 2 differed either in their acoustic patterns or in the perceived position of their sound sources. Conditions with easy and <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> were created by varying the similarity of S 1 and S 2. Statistical probability mapping showed enhanced gamma-band activity (GBA) over posterior parietal cortex for spatial and over left inferior fron-tal cortex for pattern changes (at ~ 120 to 220 ms after S 2 onset). Activations were stronger for easy than <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions.</b> GBA over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more pronounced at ~ 280 to 430 ms for easy than <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> regardless of type of change, possibly reflecting decision-relevant networks that in-tegrate information from higher sensory areas representing the per-ceptual alternatives. Sensorimotor beta desynchronization {{as a measure of}} motor preparation peaked at ~ 460 ms for easy and at ~ 520 ms for <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions,</b> thus reflecting the reaction time difference between both conditions. In summary, the analysis of oscillatory activity in magnetoencephalogram served to elucidate the temporal dynamics of perceptual decision making in humans...|$|R

40|$|Increased liking of one's choice {{following}} <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> (e. g., {{choosing between}} similarly attractive options) is well documented. Given the common mechanism proposed for this effect-a highly involving dissonance reduction process-it would be {{reasonable to expect}} such choice enhancement to be quite durable and resistant to later change. Instead, we show the contrary: that difficulty-driven choice enhancement is exceptionally fragile, collapsing easily against even minor attack. In three experiments, consumers make easy or difficult product choices, report attitudes toward their choice, and subsequently encounter a negative customer review. Compared to easy <b>decisions,</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> lead to more extreme initial positivity toward chosen products but also to more vulnerability to subsequent attack. Moreover, this fragile enhancement effect is exacerbated, not ameliorated, by choice involvement. Thus, making <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> between similarly attractive options may motivate a bubble-like inflation of positivity that has some semblance of strength yet remains highly prone to collapse.
