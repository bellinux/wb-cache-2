The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state.

While the quoted values for the E°(No2+→No0) and E°(No3+→No0) vary among sources, the accepted standard estimates are −2.61and−1.26V.

In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> 2.3 MeV.|$|E

However, the lifetimes of these possible decays differed from theoretical expectations, and the results could not be confirmed due to lack of beam time.|$|E

If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E
