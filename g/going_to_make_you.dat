[...] Don asks what Glen would do if he could do anything; later in Don's car, Glen drives and smiles as Don helps him steer.|$|E

[...] According to his father, Francisco Taveras, about age 5, he started to call himself [...] "El Fenómeno," [...] which was Spanish for [...] "The Phenomenon." [...] "He would say, ‘I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> the happiest dad in the world. [...] I want to be a star. [...] I want to be a major leaguer. [...] I’m the phenomenon. [...] I’m the best,’" [...] recounted his father.|$|E

Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "She loves candy, [...] about the juxtaposition of tough and sweetness, or as Madonna so eloquently expressed: 'I'm gonna kick your ass, but it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel good." [...] The album cover art was also released {{at the same time}} and featured Madonna with short cropped hair in a black leotard with a [...] professional wrestling championship belt across her waist. The belt includes the inscription [...] "Give It to Me", the original {{title of the}} album. The backdrop displayed pink peppermint swirls. The photo was taken during a photoshoot with Klein for Interview magazine's April 2008 issue.|$|E

500|$|I {{felt sorry}} for him because he must really be stuck in the past. Not only has his music not evolved, but also homeboy is still obsessed with my wife, the same female that wouldn't let him get to second base from eight years ago. What type of grown ass man lies about getting with a chick? Only Slim Lamey! LOL! I’m putting this out there now. Marshall Mathers, you need to holler at me... Man to man, let’s meet up and deal with this like adults. So, Miss Marshall, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> wish you never spoke my name and regret the ungodly things you said about my wife.

500|$|Gjokaj {{was cast}} in the role in August 2014. [...] "He was a soldier, {{and he had been}} very active all his life, and now he has {{to figure out how to}} use his brains, how to try to be smart," [...] Gjokaj {{explained}} of the character. [...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E
500|$|... "Intro (Listen To My Drama)" [...] is {{in a minor}} key and {{features}} a string ensemble and synthesizers. In the rap, Ivy Queen sings: [...] "1-9-9-3 was the year that I started, Many have seen my rise and fall I've seen many. Vigilant, I have an angel on my back, I have a throne flanked by holy souls." [...] Lyrically, Ivy Queen highlights her position as the queen of reggaeton. [...] "Te Voy A Recordar" [...] (I'm <b>Going</b> <b>To</b> <b>Make</b> <b>You</b> Remember), also in a minor key, also employs a string ensemble and synthesizers. Lyrically, the song describes when the passion in a relationship has been lost. [...] "Me Quiere" [...] (They Like Me) is an R power ballad built on a snapping rhythm. Also in a minor key, it features synthesizers and percussion. In the song, Queen says that people listen to her because they like her. The lyrics reveal that when she wants it smooth she puts on R. Kelly, and when she is discontented she plays Mary J. Blige (both of whom Queen has said {{she would like to}} work with in the future). The song highlights her hip-hop status. [...] "De La Calle" [...] (From the Street) is an R power ballad exploring the love between two people ("love from the street"), with Queen and De La Ghetto reprising their 2006 collaboration on a remix of Luny Tunes' [...] "Noche de Entierro (Nuestro Amor)".|$|E

500|$|Despite her ongoing {{relationship}} with Rhys, the series explores possibilities {{of a romantic}} connection between Gwen and her boss Jack. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and stated that [...] "it's the real thing and they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> wait for that." [...] AfterElton's Locksley Hall interprets Jack's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Myles states of Gwen's interest in Jack that [...] "the most monogamous {{woman in the world}} would probably go for him". Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement. Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and [...] "fights every day to be with [...] " [...] even though Jack remains [...] "a huge temptation". Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between [...] "Rhys, the sweet, kind handsome prince, and Jack, the compelling trickster". She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen. John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more".|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{states in}} a behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and opines that [...] "with Jack and Gwen, it’s the real thing and they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> wait for that." [...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, {{as well as the}} scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him– it'd be hard not to". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.|$|E
2500|$|Ellison recalls [...] "I {{had played}} in the winning tour to India of 1984–85 and bowled well, or so I thought. But I was injured for {{the early part of}} the 1985 season, which was {{incredibly}} frustrating. I knew that if fit, I could make a compelling case for my inclusion in the Ashes team." [...] His determination to get back into the Test squad was not deterred by not being selected for the first three Tests, but he then had an opportunity to impress the then England captain, David Gower. Ellison's recollection is that [...] "Kent, my county, were playing a game against Leicestershire in July and I approached [...] David Gower and said: 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> pick [...] me.' I soon started to take wickets and was called into the squad for the fourth Test in Manchester." [...] Ellison took 3–58 in the first-class match, including Gower's wicket in the only innings in which he bowled.|$|E

2500|$|Curtis replaces him, {{strongly}} {{determined to}} make his black singers household names. Curtis attempts to transform Jimmy Early into a Perry Como-esque pop singer ("I Want You Baby"), and concentrates on establishing the Dreamettes as their own act, renaming them The Dreams, changing their act {{to give them a}} more sophisticated and pop-friendly look and sound. The most crucial of these changes is the establishment of Deena as lead singer, instead of Effie. Effie is resentful of her change in status within the group. C.C. convinces her to go along with Curtis's plan ("Family"). After a fight between Marty and Curtis, Marty quits as Jimmy's manager and Curtis takes over. The Dreams make their club debut in the Crystal Room in Cleveland, Ohio, singing their first single ("Dreamgirls"). After a triumphant show, the press is eager to meet the newly minted stars ("Press Conference"). Curtis declares to Deena, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> the most famous woman who's ever lived," [...] as the slighted Effie asks [...] "What about me?" [...] ("Only the Beginning"). Over the next few years, the Dreams become a mainstream success with hit singles ("Heavy"). As Deena is increasingly feted as a star, Effie becomes temperamental and unpredictable. She suspects Curtis and Deena of having an affair. Lorrell attempts to keep peace between her bandmates, but the task seems difficult.|$|E

If I do say it myself, there are not five men in New York who would have pulled off this deal for him. Now the proposition I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> is this: that we get cosey in a cabin de luxe on that German boat, hire an automobile on the other side, and do up Europe.
