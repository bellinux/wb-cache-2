5|$|The Lords {{would only}} be able to delay money bills for one month, {{effectively}} ending their ability to do so. These were defined as any public bill which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof. It did not however, cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures. Some Finance Bills have not fallen within this criterion; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills have. The Speaker of the House of Commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill, endorsing it with a Speaker's certificate. The Local Government <b>Finance</b> <b>Bill</b> 1988, which introduced the Community Charge ("Poll Tax"), was not certified as a Money Bill and was therefore considered by the Lords. Whilst Finance Bills are not considered Money Bills, convention dictates that those parts of a <b>Finance</b> <b>Bill</b> dealing with taxation or expenditure (which, if in an Act alone, would constitute a Money Bill) are not questioned.|$|E
5|$|Edward habitually smoked twenty {{cigarettes}} and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, {{a type of}} cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with radium. Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the <b>Finance</b> <b>Bill</b> passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E

25|$|On 24 January, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan {{met with}} {{delegations}} from Fine Gael, Labour, and the Greens, striking a final deal. Labour and Fine Gael agreed {{to drop their}} no-confidence motions in exchange for an agreement that the <b>finance</b> <b>bill</b> would be finalised in the Dáil by Friday the 28th (with the Seanad to finalise on Saturday), upon which Cowen would immediately petition Presidednt McAleese for a dissolution.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{election}} to the House of Commons then Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy made Huhne the party's shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. In this role Huhne led the party's debate on the 2005 <b>Finance</b> <b>Bill,</b> suggesting that amendments {{should be made to}} stop a pensions loophole which would have allowed a 40% discount on property and other investments. In the pre-budget report for 2006, the Chancellor conceded the change.|$|E
25|$|On {{foreign affairs}} and defence issues, Touche opposed the reform of {{government}} in India (his wife {{was the daughter of}} an Indian colonial administrator). In 1937 he joined with others including Admiral Roger Keyes and Brendan Bracken in urging rejection of the <b>Finance</b> <b>Bill</b> because of its proposal for a 'National Defence Contribution', a separate tax on the most profitable businesses to pay for rearmament. He backed Neville Chamberlain in the Norway Debate of 1940.|$|E

25|$|He again abstained on {{a motion}} {{supporting}} the Government's {{handling of the}} economic situation in July 1957. In April 1958, Turner joined {{with two of his}} fellow Independent Conservatives to table a motion to reject the Distribution of Industry (Industrial <b>Finance)</b> <b>Bill,</b> which allowed the Government to give grants and loans to industry in areas of high unemployment; Turner's motion argued that the Bill placed the burden of reducing unemployment on the taxpayer, when the unemployment was a result of market conditions or deliberate Government policy.|$|E
25|$|None {{of these}} bills were {{important}} enough to dissolve parliament and seek a new mandate at a general election. Asquith and Lloyd George believed the peers would back down if presented with Liberal objectives contained within a finance bill—the Lords had not obstructed a money bill since the 17th century, and after initially blocking Gladstone's attempt (as chancellor) to repeal Paper Duties, had yielded in 1861 when it was submitted again in a <b>finance</b> <b>bill.</b> Accordingly, the Liberal leadership expected that after much objection from the Tory peers, the Lords would yield to policy changes wrapped within a budget bill.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 2016, Vote Leave {{presented}} its roadmap to lay {{out what}} would happen if Britain left the EU.

25|$|Older British plates had white, grey {{or silver}} {{characters}} {{on a black}} background. This style of plate was phased out in 1972 and, until 2012, legal to be carried only on vehicles first registered before 1 January 1973. A vehicle which was first registered on or after 1 January 1973 shall be treated {{as if it was}} first registered before that date if it was constructed before 1 January 1973. However, the <b>Finance</b> <b>Bill</b> 2014 and subsequent Finance Acts extended the Historic Vehicle class cut-off year from 1973 to 1974 and subsequently, a rolling forty years. This had the effect of linking eligibility to display old-style plates with 'Tax Exempt' vehicle status. It follows that the older style plates are now available for any vehicle constructed 40 or more years ago, provided that an application has been made to the DVLA to have the vehicle included in the historic vehicle class; it is so registered and is nil-rated for Vehicle Excise Duty.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 2012, France {{introduced}} a financial transaction tax in French tax regulation pursuant to Article 5 of the French Amended <b>Finance</b> <b>Bill</b> of 14 March 2012. Two other taxes applicable to financial transactions were also introduced, including {{a tax on}} high-frequency trading, (Article 235 ter ZD bis of the FTC); and a tax on naked sovereign credit default swaps (Article 235 ter ZD ter of the FTC). The FTT levies a 0.2% tax on stock purchases of French publicly traded companies with a market value over €1 billion. The scheme does not include debt securities, except convertible and exchangeable bonds, which are included but benefit from a dedicated exemption to the FTT. According to French president Francois Hollande the tax will generate €170 million in additional revenue for 2012 and another €500 million in 2013. France is the first European country to impose a transaction tax on share purchases. From 2 January 2017 settlement date the rate increased to 0.3%.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 2009, {{after hearing}} {{constitutional}} petitions concerning PCO judges, {{the appointment of}} judges, and the steps taken in declaring the 2007 Pakistani state of emergency, the Pakistan Supreme Court decided the declaration of emergency rule by Musharraf to be unconstitutional under Article 279 of the Constitution of Pakistan. The Supreme Court also declared the steps taken in declaring {{the state of emergency}} to be null and void, and specifically stated that the removal of judges was unconstitutional and illegal. This included the removal from office of the Chaudhry and other justices. The appointment of Dogar and of all justices between 3 November 2007 and 24 March 2008 was deemed unconstitutional. Musharraf's increase to the number of justices, accomplished through a <b>finance</b> <b>bill,</b> was declared unconstitutional, and the number of justices was set at seventeen. The verdict did not change the legality of the new government, nor that of the presidential oath taken by Zardari. The verdict also referred the issue of the Provisional Constitutional Order judges to the Supreme Judicial Council.|$|E
50|$|While the State Senate was {{controlled}} by Republicans, the crucial lower house Assembly, where <b>finance</b> <b>bills</b> originated, was split between conservative and socialist-leaning Democrats.

5000|$|Goff {{introduced}} the Terrorism (bombings and <b>financing)</b> <b>bill</b> to [...] parliament on 3 May 2001.

The bill was then sent to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade select committee for review and submissions.|$|R
500|$|The <b>Finance</b> <b>Bill</b> {{passed the}} Commons on 5 November 1909 but was {{rejected}} by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge and had forbidden his adviser Lord Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested {{that this would be a}} suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass. In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered [...] "outrageous" [...] by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.|$|E

50|$|The Senate is a {{permanent}} legislative body with equal representation {{from each of the}} four provinces, elected by the members of their respective provincial assemblies.

Both the Senate and the National Assembly can initiate and pass legislation except for <b>finance</b> <b>bills.</b> Only the National Assembly can approve the federal budget and all <b>finance</b> <b>bills.</b> In the case of other bills, the president may prevent passage unless the legislature in joint sitting overrules the president by a majority of members of both houses present and voting.

5000|$|In 2009, Murray was {{the prime}} sponsor of a $2.4 billion Washington Senate <b>financing</b> <b>bill</b> authorizing the {{construction}} of a deep-bore tunnel underneath Seattle to replace the unsafe Alaskan Way Viaduct. Murray has consistently advocated in favor of the project, despite well-documented concerns regarding the viability of the project and his <b>financing</b> <b>bill,</b> including language that places responsibility for paying cost overruns with Seattle-area taxpayers. Bertha, the machine drilling the deep-bore tunnel, broke down in December 2013 and did not move in over a year, leading to costly delays and significant challenges such as destabilizing soil conditions under Seattle's historic Pioneer Square and the Viaduct itself.
