According to the Court of Appeal, the content of fundamental rules of natural justice {{is the same as}} the common law rules of natural justice, but there is a qualitative difference in how the rules apply. A breach of the former can lead to legislation being struck down on the <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> unconstitutionality. On the other hand, a breach of the latter has the effect <b>of</b> <b>invalidating</b> administrative decisions but cannot affect the validity of legislation.|$|R
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, has the effect <b>of</b> <b>invalidating</b> an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court {{to apply for the}} order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} invalidating childhood environments are positively related to the symptoms of eating disorders. However, it is unclear how childhood environments might impact upon the development of eating disorder symptoms. This study examined the relationship between parental invalidation and eating disorder-related attitudes in a nonclinical sample and tested the mediating effect of attitudes towards emotional expression. Two hundred women, {{with a mean age of}} 21 years, completed measures <b>of</b> <b>invalidating</b> childhood environments, attitudes towards emotional expression, and eating pathology. Eating concerns were positively associated with recollections <b>of</b> an <b>invalidating</b> parental environment. The belief that the expression of emotions is a sign of weakness fully mediated the relationship between childhood maternal invalidation and adult eating concern. Following replication and extension to a clinical sample, these results suggest that targeting the individual's attitude towards emotional expression might reduce eating attitudes among women who have experienced an invalidating childhood environment. ...|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{provides}} a framework for evaluating the enforceability of contracts under the Copyright Act. First, two major approaches for finding contract terms to be unenforceable are presented. Federal preemption is evaluated as one means <b>of</b> <b>invalidating</b> contract terms {{that would otherwise be}} enforceable under state contract law. A 2 ̆ 2 public policy 2 ̆ 2 approach is suggested as an additional method for finding contract provisions to be unenforceable. Then, by using analogy with patent law where possible, the enforceability of certain contract provisions that extend or enlarge the rights given to the copyright owner by the Act are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using {{a variant}} of Lehmann’s Default Logics and Probabilis-tic Description Logics we {{recently}} presented a framework that invalidates those unwanted inferences that cause concept unsatisfiability without the need to remove explicitly stated axioms. The solutions of this methods were shown to outperform classical ontology repair w. r. t. the number <b>of</b> inferences <b>invalidated.</b> However, conflicts may still exist in the knowledge base and can make reasoning ambiguous. Furthermore, solutions with a minimal number <b>of</b> inferences <b>invalidated</b> do not necessarily minimize the number of conflicts. In this paper we provide an overview over finding solutions that have a minimal number <b>of</b> conflicts while <b>invalidating</b> as few inferences as possible. Specifically, we propose to evaluate solutions w. r. t. the quantity of information they convey by recurring to the no-tion of entropy and discuss a possible approach towards computing the entropy w. r. t. an ABox. ...|$|R

We exploit this distinguishing property by developing parallel algorithms and suggest its further application to error recovery and incremental analysis.
