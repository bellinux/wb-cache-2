500|$|The man sits {{before an}} {{imitation}} parapet with {{three sets of}} painted inscriptions, each rendered {{to look as if}} chiselled or scratched into stone. Van Eyck did not have full command of either classical Greek or Latin and made errors, so readings by modern scholars vary. The first inscription is in Greek and seems to spell [...] "TYΜ.ωΘΕΟC", which has not been satisfactorily interpreted but has led some to title the work Timotheus. The middle reads in French [...] "Leal Souvenir" [...] ("Loyal Memory") and indicates that the portrait is a posthumous commemoration. The third records van Eyck's signature and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> The 19th-century art historian Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert identified the lettering [...] "TYΜ.ωΘΕΟC" [...] with the Greek musician Timotheus of Miletus. Panofsky drew the same conclusion, eliminating other Greeks bearing the name Timothy; they were of religious or military background, professions that do not match the civilian dress of the sitter. Panofsky believed the man was probably a highly placed musician in Philip's court.|$|E
2500|$|The judge {{presiding}} over a capital case sets the execution date once {{it appears that}} all the offender's appeals have been exhausted. The initial <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> cannot be prior to the 91st day after the day the order is entered and (if the original order is withdrawn) subsequent execution dates cannot be less than the 31st day after the order is entered, provided that no habeas corpus motion has been filed under Article 11.071; otherwise, the date cannot be set prior to the court either denying relief, or issuing its mandate.

2500|$|Initial plans {{called for}} the use of five H8K aircraft. They would fly to French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, to be refueled by {{submarines}} prior to taking off for Oahu. The raid was planned to coincide with the full moon to illuminate the Pearl Harbor target area, but the actual <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> would depend on calm weather for refueling at French Frigate Shoals and clear skies over Pearl Harbor. [...] If the first raid was successful, additional raids would be made.|$|E
2500|$|TBAs—short for [...] "to-be-announced" [...] securities—involve {{a special}} type of trading of mortgage-backed securities. TBAs {{are the most}} liquid and {{important}} secondary mortgage market, with volume in the trillions of dollars annually. TBAs are traded by MBS traders with notional amounts. There are settlement days when the traders have {{to make good on}} their trades. At that time, they choose fractions from various pools to make up their TBA. Only agency mortgage-backed securities trade in the TBA market. [...] "In a TBA transaction, the parties agree on a price for delivering a given volume of Agency Pass-Through Mortgage-Backed Securities at a specified future date. The distinguishing feature of a TBA transaction is that the actual identity of the securities to be delivered at settlement is not specified on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> (“Trade Date”). Instead, the parties to the trade agree on only five general parameters of the securities to be delivered: issuer, mortgage type, term, coupon, and month of settlement." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{day after}} the jury reached their verdict, Celia's defense team {{requested}} that the court [...] "set aside the verdict of the jury...and grant a new trial." [...] Judge Hall denied their request and sentenced Celia to be [...] "hanged by the neck until dead on the sixteenth day of November 1855." [...] Celia's defense team then requested for an appeal to be heard by the Supreme Court of Missouri. The appeal was granted, but Judge Hall refused to issue a stay of execution order to guarantee that Celia wouldn't be executed before her appeal could be heard. On the night of November 11, 1855, just five days before she {{was scheduled to be}} hanged, Celia was taken from her jail cell. She was returned to her cell sometime after her original <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> had passed, and given a new execution date: December 21. After her return, Celia's defense team wrote a letter to Judge Abiel Leonard of the Supreme Court of Missouri, explaining that Celia had been [...] "taken out by someone" [...] and that they felt [...] "more than ordinary interest in behalf of the girl Celia, believing that she did the act (of slaying Newsom) to prevent a forced sexual assault." [...] They also included a record of Celia's case, which they asked the Supreme Court to review, and requested that a stay of execution order be issued to ensure that Celia would not be executed before the Supreme Court had a chance to review her case. The Supreme Court responded on December 14, 1855, stating [...] "upon an examination of the record and proceedings of the Circuit Court of Callaway County in the above case, it is thought proper to refuse the prayer of the petitioner...It is therefore ordered by the Court, that an order for the Stay of the execution in this case be refused." ...|$|E
