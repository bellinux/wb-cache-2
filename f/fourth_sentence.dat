40|$|In this study, we used {{electroencephalography}} {{to investigate}} the influence of discourse-level semantic coherence on electrophysiological signatures of local sentence-level processing. Participants read groups of four sentences that could either form coherent stories or were semantically unrelated. For semantically coherent discourses compared to incoherent ones, the N 400 was smaller at sentences 2 – 4, while the visual N 1 was larger at the third and <b>fourth</b> <b>sentences.</b> Oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range (13 – 21  Hz) was higher for coherent discourses. We relate the N 400 effect to a disruption of local sentence-level semantic processing when sentences are unrelated. Our beta findings can be tentatively related to disruption of local sentence-level syntactic processing, but it cannot be fully ruled out that they are instead (or also) related to disrupted local sentence-level semantic processing.
