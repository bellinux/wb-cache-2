40|$|To {{refer to}} the social {{dimension}} of a contract is to challenge {{the idea that a}} contract is simply an act of autonomy (self-determination). However, if a certain degree of heteronomy can coexist within a contract, the different strands must be identified in order to render this coexistence sustainable. The contract is, in reality, an expression of the autonomy and individual responsibility of those, who, in the act of concluding a contract, are consciously bound by that act. What is required is a solution that does not distort the essential nature of the contract, but instead determines the scope of intervention, conditions and procedures that are compatible with the concept of the contract that can be integrated in the neo-institutionalist model that characterises the law in Europe after the crisis of pure normativism. From an abstract point of view it is possible to hypothesise two complementary strands, which are not necessarily incompatible, in order to fully understand the social dimension of contracts. indisputable heteronomy based on the legislative power of the majority. An addition to the contract by reference to moral values, justified by the fact that contracts are acts of social relationality and legally binding. Thus, the moral values that are considered integral elements of contracts are to be intended as ethical–legal values, that is, values of an implicitly dual nature, being both moral and legal. In the first case, the social dimension could seem to be an authoritarian intervention in the contract, resulting in expropriation with a punitive effect on certain categories of people to the advantage of others. In the second case, the intervention is less authoritarian and can be explained intersubjectively. Indeed, autonomy is not purely arbitrary, because contracts operate within a social context and consequently must take into account a measure of morality. They are not merely private affairs, but also juridical, and so must be applicable to the general rationality of the law. The law is tertium related to the parties, and when they seek enforcement of their contract they accept this third dimension. This concept is pan-European and concerns not only procedural rules but the content of the contract as well. In certain countries it is more explicit than in others, such as in England, where the courts work with so-called implied terms. With regard to moral values, I wish to emphasise legalised moral values. Moral values become legal principles and are therefore subject to the test of reasonableness and the need to establish coherence with other principles. There is no place in the law for fundamentalism of any sort, ethical, religious or even economic. Two fundamental issues relating to Reethisierung should be highlighted: 1 justifying duties without compensation, these being generally purposes based on the principles of solidarity (safeguarding good faith and the weak generally). This view proposes a justification closer to the idea of autonomy as a social facet of cooperation. Everybody relies on a general principle of ethics when they enter into a relationship with another. From a general perspective, the rules derived from moral values are not merely authoritarian decisions, but products of intersubjective research in the field of the social experience of values. In particular, this should be valid regarding ‘basic necessity life-time contracts’, such as contract of labour, loan for the purchase of a house, guarantee in favour of a family member, tenancy for housing, healthcare contracts, etc. Those are contracts that usually last for a long time of life and regard basic needs of people. 2 establishing boundaries demarcating the tendency towards universal commodification and an extension of the market into the voluntary sector (so-called third sector). Creating or leaving the condition unmodified in order for gratuitous acts to be realised. Only the first issue will be examined in this abstract. It is not true that bilateral contracts are ethically indifferent, as Max Weber and many others maintain. Canaris stressed the link between bilateral contracts and what we can call Freiheitsethik. Bilateral contracts are an application of the principle of commutative justice in a formal sense (sinallagma in a subjective sense), and thus they are tools of self-determination and pluralism. There is also a certain sense of dignity implicit in the meaning expressed in the famous quotation from Adam Smith: «It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens» A. Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations, Liberty Press, Indianapolis 1981, 26 - 27. Dignity is intended as economic independence and willingness to pay what one party requests from another. The ethics of the contract cannot, however, simply be reduced to this. If commutative justice in a formal sense may be considered to be an instructive aid in explaining, in part, the fundamental principles pertaining to the concept of the social contract, it does not explain everything. At least two questions remain unanswered: a. Why {{at the time of the}} social contract did the wolves agree to establish a contract with the lambs? When the strong man respects the weak man a moral issue is raised; otherwise the strong take complete advantage of their strength. In a nutshell, it can be said that the metaphor of the social contract is not sufficient to resolve this paradigm. b. Why does the creditor trust the butcher not to supply him with rotten meat or the physician to cure him not only for remuneration (creditor in the literal sense means he who trusts, as Gläubiger derives from glauben) ? Are we sure that all professionals, or the majority of them, carry out their work only to receive remuneration and not also because of the fact that they have pride in a job well done? Compensation cannot explain all the rules of obligation. For instance, the rule that the creditor may not cancel a debt without the consent of the debtor. Iustitia commutativa is only a part of the iustitia involved in contracts. Ultimately, as a metaphor of civilisation, we should take into consideration the inherent ties to the concept of social contract, the dimension of ‘care’ that Heidegger proposed as the basis of humanity. It is not just a question of freedom, but also the idea of taking care of others. In other words, there is not just one paradigm, but rather two: one that refers to the social contract as a framework for the formal freedom of everybody, and the paradigm of the family in the generic (not necessarily traditional) sense of solidarity (there is now reference to maternalism, or maternage in French, in order to avoid the ambivalence of the concept of paternalism), which means ensuring that the weak are not further weakened in a social and economic sense. This point of view is typical of post-Auschwitz constitutions like the German and Italian ones, which provide for formal and substantive equality. This is undoubtedly a crucial step. Formal equality and substantive equality must cohabit, especially when we refer to contracts in the field of autonomy. If we consider that cohabitation, that is, the idea of a general protection of the weaker party of a contract, is absurd because every contract has a stronger party and a weaker party, the logical result would be the elimination of contracts. It is therefore essential that a formal procedure be established to provide general rules applying to contracts in circumstances where a party may be typically in a stronger position and to protect typical categories of people such as workers or consumers, who are formally (by statutory law or socially) considered the weaker party. Having once established the limits to the contractual protection of the weak, we can continue the discussion on the moral perspective of contracts; the arguments relating to moral aspects can be diagnosed in a more rational manner. According to the continental tradition of law, there remain rules allowing moral points of view to filter through into the contract. Leaving aside the protection of gute Sitten (buoni costumi), e. g. § 138 BGB, good faith is the most essential principle. Fides means trust, reliance on the morality of the other party. We assume the existence of an ethical code that provides a set of criteria that can be applied to assess the behaviour of both parties. In the Italian code as in the German civil code, good faith is already enshrined as a guiding principle during the pre-contractual period when both parties are still negotiating. It should be noted that good faith introduces the fundamental principle of Diskursethik – in the sense of Habermas and Apel – between the parties. Both have to communicate or act in good faith, and in good faith they have to understand each other. Usually we refer to procedural fairness for these types of rules. Duties of information, of clare loqui (speaking clearly), are well established; in English law we should remember the duty of confidentiality (for instance in the Seager vs Copydex case). However, good faith can also provide substantive fairness. The development of the Unzumutbarkeit (inesigibilità) is highly significant, a limitation on the creditor’s claim when the performance of an obligation conflicts with another duty that is more important from a constitutional perspective. This perspective is of particular interest in the context of the duration of contracts that may infringe upon the relationships of the debtor, especially in family relationships. The principle of specific performance (adempimento in natura, Naturalherstellung) is also a rule based on ethical values. The duty is a categorical imperative without the ability to opt for damages instead of performing the obligation. I wish to emphasise, obviously, the efficient breach theory that provides for “[t]he view that a party should be allowed to breach a contract and pay damages, if doing so would be more economically efficient than performing under the contract. ” The duration of the contract is the framework in which an ethical approach is more appropriate, and we should note three points. One is that when a relationship lasts for an extended period it creates reliance and proximity. This is valid, even though one party is an enterprise; otherwise we create a moral shield in favour of people who take advantage of the enterprise and conceive the enterprise as a machine in which people are mere cogs to be exploited. Moreover, regarding ‘Basic Necessity Life-contracts’, the extended period tends to aggravate the differences between a professional party (an enterprise) and a person who contracts for personal purposes (labour, loan for the purchase of a house, guarantee in favour of a family member, tenancy for housing), especially in the case of a change in circumstances, given that an enterprise is more able to calculate risks and administer their costs than are non-professionals. Finally, the different relationships may be inextricable, and in certain cases we can speak about contractual links (collegamento negoziale, Verbundene Verträge) : for example, labour, tenancy, loans, family relationships. Art. 33 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides for the principle of reconciliation between family and professional life. In this perspective, the contract of labour ensures the sanctity of maternity; evidently the duty to the family (child) is more important than the duty to perform. The law restricts the right to withdrawal of a tenancy in order to protect the rights to housing not only of the tenant but also of family or cohabitants with children. We can imagine a right to suspend payment of instalments on a loan in cases of redundancy through no fault of the debtor when the worker has to provide for a member of the family (to pay school fees, to pay medical bills for themselves or for a member of the family). In cases of a guarantee by a non-professional person in favour of a member of the family, the bank has at least a duty to keep the guarantor regularly updated as to the financial circumstances of the debtor and the consequences the guarantee would have to share in order to allow the guarantor to terminate the contract before <b>default</b> <b>proceedings</b> have been initiated, when circumstances have varied too greatly from the initial contractual obligations. Scholars tend to be too rigid in their distinction between the purposes of private law and those of public law. The first must provide rules in order to promote commutative justice and Freiheitsethik, while only public law has the obligation to apply distributive justice. This distinction appears to me to be too rigid, and I would prefer a more systemic view, stressing that the relationship between the two distinctive components of the law should be more coherent. Private law is able to pursue some distributive justice under certain conditions. A clear definition is needed of the subjects (weak parties) who are protected and the subjects who should be protected. Interests or goods to be protected should also be clearly defined. There should be goods of recognisable intrinsic value (necessary goods like water, schooling, housing, health, etc). Some are referred to as common goods (commons) because they relate to the fundamental rights of people and thus should not be subject to exclusive possession, but instead be governed according to the law so that everyone can benefit from them. Self-determination in a solidaristic system cannot be the unique criterion for evaluating the value of goods. In particular, it is essential to specify a number of constitutional values related to certain professions. Bankers, for example, must execute due diligence with respect to the savings of non-professional people to ensure that those savings are safeguarded, since savings are a good protected by the law (an example is the Italian constitution: see art. 47. La repubblica incoraggia e tutela il risparmio in tutte le sue forme, disciplina, coordina e controlla l’esercizio del credito). Thus, certain rules should be taken into consideration in order to promote ‘responsible credit’ as a paradigm for measuring the performance of the good banker (as Reifner suggests). This could be considered as an application of good faith that requires the professional debtor to perform the specific skills of their particular profession in order to pursue the interests of the creditor. The reference to a moral value provides a justification for duties, whether or not those duties are disproportionate to the compensation for them or are imposed without any compensation at all, simply to protect the weaker party. However, elements of distributive justice require social recognition of the fact that public law must provide (incentives, benefits, advantages). Otherwise the duties imposed on a private individual may be interpreted as expropriation or punishment. Of course, solidarity should not become a synallagma, but it still requires a degree of reciprocity, which is a social response. In conclusion, distributive justice remains in general a duty and prerogative of public law, and one should not overload contract law, but contract law can be made to cohere with it through the provision of rules consistent with this purpose...|$|E

We compare this formula with the fully specified bilateral risk formula, where the first to default time is taken into account. The latter correct formula depends on default dependence between the two parties, whereas the simplified one does not. We also analyze a candidate simplified formula in case the replacement closeout is used upon default, following ISDA's recommendations, and we find the simplified formula to be the same as in the risk free closeout case. We analyze the error that is encountered when using the simplified formula in a couple of simple products: a zero coupon bond, where the exposure is unidirectional, and an equity forward contract where exposure can go both ways. For the latter case we adopt a bivariate exponential distribution due to Gumbel to model the joint default risk of the two parties in the deal. We present a number of realistic cases where the simplified formula differs considerably from the correct one. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{going concern}} {{principle}} assumes that an entity {{will continue to}} exist into the future. This assumption implies that the entity will not be compelled to end their operations, liquidate their assets, or go into bankruptcy. It is an integral assumption in financial statements since it allows for the deferral of recognition of certain expenses until {{a period of time}} into the future, when the company is still assumed to exist. Members of management, as well as financial statement auditors, are required to identify signs that could indicate that an entity {{will not be able to}} continue their operations into the near future. Some of these signs include a trend of operating losses, loan <b>defaults,</b> legal <b>proceedings</b> against the entity and so forth. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated the going concern guidelines so that issuers of financial statements are uniform in frequency and substance of going concern determination. Prior to the Accounting Standards Update, U. S. GAAP lacked sufficient guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt of the entity’s ability to continue as going concern. In order to clarify the uncertainty, FASB issued a new financial reporting standard. This new reporting will be in effect for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016. The updated standard will require management to perform annual and interim assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of financial statements issuance...|$|R

If it be necessary to send troops to do this, they will not be sectional, as it is the fashion nowadays to call people who insist on their own rights and the maintenance of the laws, but federal troops, representing the will and power of the whole Confederacy. A danger is always great so long as we are afraid of it; and mischief like that now gathering head in South Carolina may soon become a danger, if not swiftly dealt with. Mr. Buchanan seems altogether too wholesale a disciple of the laissez-faire doctrine, and has allowed activity in mischief the same immunity from interference which is true policy only in regard to enterprise wisely and profitably directed. He has been naturally reluctant to employ force, but has overlooked the difference between indecision and moderation, forgetting the lesson of all experience, that firmness in the beginning saves the need of force in the end, and that forcible measures applied too late may be made to seem violent ones, and thus excite a mistaken sympathy with the sufferers by their own misdoing. The feeling of the country has been unmistakably expressed in regard to Major Anderson, and that not merely because he showed prudence and courage, but because he was the first man holding a position of trust who did his duty to the nation.

40|$|Cognition {{is thought}} to result from {{interactions}} within large-scale networks of brain regions. Here, we propose a method to identify these large-scale networks using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Regions belonging to such networks are defined as sets of strongly interacting regions, each of which showing a homogeneous temporal activity. Our method of large-scale network identification (LSNI) proceeds by first detecting functionally homogeneous regions. The networks of functional interconnections are then found by comparing the correlations among these regions against a model of the correlations in the noise. To test the LSNI method, we first evaluated its specificity and sensitivity on synthetic data sets. Then, the method was applied to four real data sets with a block-designed motor task. The LSNI method correctly recovered the regions whose temporal activity was locked to the stimulus. In addition, it detected two other main networks highly reproducible across subjects, whose activity was dominated by slow fluctuations (0 - 0. 1 Hz). One was located in medial and dorsal regions, and mostly overlapped the "default" network of the brain at rest [Greicius, M. D., Krasnow, B., Reiss, A. L., Menon, V., 2003. Functional connectivity in the resting brain: a network analysis of the <b>default</b> mode hypothesis. <b>Proceedings</b> of the National Academy of Sciences of the U. S.

40|$|We {{consider}} a reinterpretation {{of the rules}} of default logic. We make Reiter’s default rules into a constructive method of building models, not theories. To allow reasoning in first‐order systems, we equip standard first‐order logic with a (new) Kleene 3 ‐valued partial model semantics. Then, using our methodology, we add defaults to this semantic system. The result is that our logic is an ordinary monotonic one, but its semantics is now nonmonotonic. Reiter’s extensions now appear in the semantics, not in the syntax. As an application, we show that this semantics gives a partial solution to the conceptual problems with open defaults pointed out by Lifschitz [V. Lifschitz, On open <b>defaults,</b> in: <b>Proceedings</b> of the Symposium on Computational Logics (1990) ], and Baader and Hollunder [F. Baader and B. Hollunder, Embedding defaults into terminological knowledge representation formalisms, in: Proceedings of Third Annual Conference on Knowledge Representation (Morgan‐Kaufmann, 1992) ]. The solution is not complete, chiefly because in making the defaults model‐theoretic, we can only add conjunctive information to our models. This is in contrast to default theories, where extensions can contain disjunctive formulas, and therefore disjunctive information. Our proposal to treat the problem of open defaults uses a semantic notion of nonmonotonic entailment for our logic, related to the idea of “only knowing”. Our notion is “only having information” given by a formula. We discuss the differences between this and “minimal‐knowledge” ideas. Finally, we consider the Kraus–Lehmann–Magidor [S. Kraus, D. Lehmann and M. Magidor, Nonmonotonic reasoning, preferential models, and cumulative logics, Artificial Intelligence 44 (1990) 167 – 207] axioms for preferential consequence relations. We find that our consequence relation satisfies the most basic of the laws, and the Or law, but it does not satisfy the law of Cut, nor the law of Cautious Monotony. We give intuitive examples using our system, on the other hand, which on the surface seem to violate these two laws. We make some comparisons, using our examples, to probabilistic interpretations for which these laws are true, and we compare our models to the cumulative models of Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor. We also show sufficient conditions for the laws to hold. These involve limiting the use of disjunction in our formulas in one way or another. We show how {{to make use of the}} theory of complete partially ordered sets, or domain theory. We can augment any Scott domain with a default set. We state a version of Reiter’s extension operator on arbitrary domains as well. This version makes clear the basic order‐theoretic nature of Reiter’s definitions. A three‐variable function is involved. Finding extensions corresponds to taking fixed points twice, with respect to two of these variables. In the special case of precondition‐free defaults, a general relation on Scott domains induced from the set of defaults is shown to characterize extensions. We show how a general notion of domain theory, the logic induced from the Scott topology on a domain, guides us to a correct notion of “affirmable sentence” in a specific case such as our first‐order systems. We also prove our consequence laws in such a way that they hold not only in first‐order systems, but in any logic derived from the Scott topology on an arbitrary domain...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to study}} the data on losses on {{mortgage}} insurance in the Dutch housing market to find the key drivers of the probability of loss. In 2013, 25 per cent of all Dutch homeowners were "under water": selling the property will not cover the outstanding mortgage debt. The double-trigger theory predicts that being under water is a necessary but not sufficient condition to predict mortgage default. A loss for the mortgage insurer {{is the result of}} a <b>default</b> where the <b>proceedings</b> of sale and the accumulated savings for postponed repayment of the principal associated to the loan are not sufficient to repay the loan. Design/methodology/approach - For this study, the authors use a data set on losses on mortgage insurance at a national aggregate level covering the period from 1976 to 2012. They apply a discrete time hazard model with calendar time- and duration-varying covariates to analyze the relationship between year of issue of the insurance, duration, equity, unfortunate events like unemployment and divorce and affordability measures to identify the main drivers of the probability of loss. Findings - Although the number of losses increases over time, the number of losses relative to the active insurance is still low, despite the fact that the Dutch housing market is the world’s most strongly leveraged housing market. On average, the peak in loss probability lies around a duration of four years. The average loss probability is virtually zero for durations larger than 10 years. Mortgages initiated just prior to the beginning of the financial crisis have an increased loss probability. The most important drivers of the loss probability are home equity, unemployment and divorce. Affordability measures are less important. Research limitations/implications - Mortgage insurance is available for the lower end of the market only and is intended to decrease the impact of risk selection by banks. The analysis is based on aggregate data; no information on individual households, like initial loan-to-value and price-to-income ratios; current home equity; and unfortunate events, like unemployment and divorce, is available. The research uses averages of these variables per calendar year and/or duration. Information on repayments of insured mortgages is missing. Originality/value - This paper is the first to describe the main drivers of losses on insured mortgages in The Netherlands by using loss data covering two housing market crises, one in the early 1980 s and the current crisis that started in 2008. Much has changed between the two crises. For instance, prices have risen steeply as has household indebtedness. Furthermore, alternative mortgage products have increased in popularity. Focusing a study on the drivers of mortgage losses exclusively on the current crisis could therefore be biased, given the time-specific circumstances on the housing market...|$|R
