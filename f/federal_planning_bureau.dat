Electricity only amounts to 16% of total energy use, and while nuclear-powered electricity amounts to 9% of use in Belgium, {{in many parts of}} Belgium, especially in Flanders, it makes up more than 50% of the electricity provided to households and businesses. This was one of the major reasons to revert the earlier phase-out, since it was impossible to provide more than 50% of the electricity by 'alternative' energy-production, and a revert to the classical coal-driven electricity would mean inability to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol.|$|E

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{describes}} the second version of MIDAS (an acronym for ‘Microsimulation for the Development of Adequacy and Sustainability'), a dynamic population model with dynamic cross-sectional ageing. This model simulates the life spans {{of individuals in}} the base dataset, including with their interactions, for the years between 2003 and 2060. It enables to produce, on that period, adequacy assessment of pensions in Belgium that is coherent with the baseline budgetary projections of the 2009 report of the Study Committee for Ageing realized by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Bureau's</b> semi-aggregated MALTESE model. Indeed, MIDAS aligns its socio-economic and demographic projections and its macro-economic assumptions on the 2009 report of the Study Committee for Ageing. The adequacy of pensions is analysed through the replacement ratio, inequality measures among pensioners and poverty risk indicators of the elderly. Adequacy, Pensions, Microsimulation...|$|R

5000|$|Bogaert studied {{economics}} at the University of Namur (Belgium). After his studies {{he worked for the}} Belgian <b>Federal</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Bureau</b> {{as a member of the}} team undertaking macro-economic modelling, analyses and forecasts. In 1980, he anticipated the explosion of public debt in Belgium and pointed out [...] "the snowball effect of debt." [...] In 1982, he was part of the team responsible for preparing the devaluation of the Belgian franc. From 1989 to 1990, he participated in the foundation of a private company (ADE) specialized in economic studies. From 1990 to 1992, as deputy director of the economic advisers of the Prime Minister, he prepared the first Belgian convergence programme designed to introduce the euro. In 1993, he was appointed director of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Bureau</b> by the Government and took part in the group of experts designated by the Government to prepare the Social Pact that would lead the government to adopt the [...] "Global Plan for employment, competitiveness and social security" [...] which aimed to restore the Belgian economy after the sharp crisis in 1993. Henri Bogaert has also been member and chairman of the European Economic policy Committee as well as Chairman of the Working Group on ageing population and fiscal sustainability of public finances for 10 years. In this context, he contributed to the addition of criteria for sustainability of public finances to the Stability and Growth Pact. In addition, he has been Deputy Chairman of the OECD Economic Policy Committee.|$|E

50|$|When the FPB {{was founded}} on 14 October 1959, it carried the name of Programming Bureau. Its mission was to {{elaborate}} the economic policy framework, which had been absent until then, by submitting proposals to the Ministerial Committee for Economic and Social Coordination. In 1970, the Programming Bureau’s name was changed into Planning Bureau, {{in accordance with the}} law of 15 July of that same year. The economic programmes are replaced by economic plans marked by a more formalized approach and regional components. From 1980 onward, the Planning Bureau abandoned its former approach and focused on the elaboration of economic medium-term projections and impact studies on different subjects. In 1994, {{in the wake of the}} fourth Belgian state reform, the Planning Bureau’s name was once more changed into the <b>Federal</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Bureau.</b> From then on, the Bureau would also be charged with forecasts for the government budget.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the year}} 1999 the policy {{statement}} of the Verhofstadt I Government (a coalition including the green parties Groen! and Ecolo) introduced the plan to phase-out nuclear power generation. The following year a government appointed commission reported that nuclear power was important to Belgium and recommended further development. Nevertheless, in 2003 {{near the end of}} its term Belgium's government passed phase-out legislation. It stipulates that no new commercial reactors are to be built and that Belgium's seven reactors would be shut down when they reach an operational lifetime of 40 years. All reactors reach this age in the period 2015-2025. When the law was being passed, there was speculation it would be overturned again as soon as an administration without the green parties was in power. A report published in 2005 by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Bureau</b> noted that in many parts of Belgium nuclear power makes up more than 50% of the electricity generated. It would therefore be difficult for Belgium to adhere to the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocols without nuclear power. In 2007, the Belgian Commission on Energy said that the use of nuclear energy is imperative to meet [...] requirements and maintain economic stability. Furthermore, the commission believed that energy prices would double without the use of nuclear energy. The commission finally recommended that the operating lives of the seven nuclear reactors should be extended. The International Energy Agency also stated that the phase-out should be reconsidered.|$|E
