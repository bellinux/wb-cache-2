In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap, easily available, and the quickest way to destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising.</b>|$|E
25|$|Droughts are {{becoming}} more frequent and intense in arid and semiarid western North America as temperatures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising,</b> advancing the timing and magnitude of spring snow melt ﬂoods and reducing river flow volume in summer. Direct {{effects of climate change}} include increased heat and water stress, altered crop phenology, and disrupted symbiotic interactions. These effects may be exacerbated by climate changes in river ﬂow, and the combined effects are likely to reduce the abundance of native trees in favor of non-native herbaceous and drought-tolerant competitors, reduce the habitat quality for many native animals, and slow litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Climate change effects on human water demand and irrigation may intensify these effects.|$|E
25|$|However, {{other forces}} may {{mitigate}} these processes. Some observe that {{a growing number}} of multinationals, especially from wealthier areas, are starting to see the benefits of keeping more of their operations close to home. For many products, labor is a small and diminishing fraction of total costs. Long, complex supply chains, it turns out, are likely riskier than many firms may have realized. For example, when an epidemic such as SARS hits Asia or when an earthquake hits Japan, supply chains are disrupted. Also, as emerging economies boom, wages there are rising. The benefits of global labor arbitrage may disappear, particularly in basic manufacturing and especially in China, where wages <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> the fastest.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, raw scores on IQ tests have {{increased}} {{in most parts of}} the world. When a new version of an IQ test is normed, the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of IQ 100. The phenomenon of rising raw score performance means if test-takers are scored by a constant standard scoring rule, IQ test scores <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> at an average rate of around three IQ points per decade. This phenomenon was named the Flynn effect in the book The Bell Curve after James R. Flynn, the author who did the most to bring this phenomenon to the attention of psychologists.|$|E
25|$|IQ {{scores are}} used for {{educational}} placement, assessment of intellectual disability, and evaluating job applicants. Even when students improve their scores on standardized tests, they do not always improve their cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention and speed. In research contexts they have been studied as predictors of job performance, and income. They are also used to study distributions of psychometric intelligence in populations and the correlations between it and other variables. Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in the journal Science in September 2009 determined that temperatures in the Arctic are higher presently than they have been {{at any time in the}} previous 2,000 years. Samples from ice cores, tree rings and lake sediments from 23 sites were used by the team, led by Darrell Kaufman of Northern Arizona University, to provide snapshots of the changing climate. Geologists were able to track the summer Arctic temperatures as far back as the time of the Romans by studying natural signals in the landscape. The results highlighted that for around 1,900 years temperatures steadily dropped, caused by precession of earth's orbit that caused the planet to be slightly farther away from the sun during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. These orbital changes led to a cold period known as the little ice age during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. However, during the last 100 years temperatures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising,</b> despite the fact that the continued changes in earth's orbit would have driven further cooling. The largest rises have occurred since 1950, with four of the five warmest decades in the last 2,000 years occurring between 1950 and 2000. The last decade was the warmest in the record.|$|E

At the time of first French contact in the mid-17th century, men of the Crane doodem held the positions of hereditary peace chiefs of Chippewa communities at both Sault Ste. Marie and La Pointe. Andaigweos was a skilled orator and favorite of the French officials and voyageurs. In that period, leaders of the Cranes were concerned more with internal matters. By the 19th century, it was Buffalo's clan the Loons, rather than the Cranes, who were recognized as principal chiefs at La Pointe.|$|E

2500|$|The {{current cost}} of living {{adjustment}} {{is based on the}} consumer price index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely checks the prices of 211 different categories of consumption items in 38 geographical areas to compute 8,018 item-area indices. Many other indices are computed as weighted averages of these base indices. CPI-W is based on a market basket of goods and services consumed by urban wage earners and clerical workers. The weights for that index are updated in January of every even-numbered year. People who say that the CPI-W overestimates inflation recommend updating the weights each month; this produces the Chained Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (C-CPI-U). People who say that the C-CPI-U [...] disadvantages the elderly point out that seniors consume more medical care than younger people, and that the costs of medical care <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> faster than inflation {{in other parts of the}} economy. According to this view, the costs of the things the elderly buy <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> faster than the market basket averaged to obtain CPI-W, CPI-U or C-CPI-U.
