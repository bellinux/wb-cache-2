5|$|Virginia Tech had <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> field {{position}} {{at their own}} 44-yard line. One quick first down later, the clock ran out on the thirdquarter. As neither team had scored in the quarter, the score remained tied at 1616.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter Alabama {{completed}} a 10-play, 58-yard drive by scoring on a two-yard run by backup tailback Trent Richardson. The key plays were a 15-yard pass from McElroy to Darius Hanks and a 13-yard pass from McElroy to Richardson. After an exchange of punts gave Alabama <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> position at the Auburn 45, the Tide quickly struck again with McElroy hitting tight end Colin Peek on a 33-yard touchdown pass that left the game tied 14–14 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, {{with the staff}} of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} {{brought the}} score to 41–26 with 11:29 {{remaining in the}} game. Florida State received the post-touchdown kickoff, then benefited from a 10-yard holding penalty against Virginia Tech. Three subsequent plays failed to gain another first down, however, and on fourth down, a pass by Manuel was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Davon Morgan {{and returned to the}} Florida State 34-yard line. With 9:29 remaining, Virginia Tech's offense entered the game. The Hokies went three-and-out, but capitalized on the <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> field position by kicking a 43-yard field goal that increased their lead to 44–26.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E

25|$|Side reins are {{adjusted}} {{longer for}} less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened, and raised higher (from {{point of shoulder}} {{up to the point}} of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. For green horses, the side reins are adjusted so that the horse can take contact with the bit, but does not have to flex beyond its abilities. A <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point is to adjust the reins so the green horse carries its head approximately 4inches in front of the vertical. In any case, the head is not to be pulled behind the vertical.|$|E
25|$|Gaining {{popularity}} as a folk {{instrument in}} the early 19th century in the Celtic music revivals, penny whistles now play {{an integral part of}} several folk traditions. Whistles are a prevalent starting instrument in English traditional music, Scottish traditional music and Irish traditional music, since they are often cheap (under US$10), relatively easy to start with (no tricky embouchure such as found with the flute), and the fingerings are nearly identical to those on the traditional six holed flute (Irish flute, baroque flute). The tin whistle is a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> instrument to learn the uilleann pipes, which has similar finger technique, range of notes and repertoire. The tin whistle is the most popular instrument in Irish traditional music today.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Hostetler lost a fumble while being sacked by Steve McMichael, and Bears lineman Dan Hampton {{recovered}} the ball. Chicago then {{drove to the}} Giants 1-yard line. But on a fourth down conversion attempt, Giants defensive end John Washington plowed through Jim Covert's block attempt and tackled fullback Brad Muster for a loss. Still, the Bears managed to force a three-and-out, and convert <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> field position into a 33-yard field goal by Kevin Butler. But {{before the end of}} the half, the Giants went up 17-3 with an 80-yard, 11-play scoring drive. On the first play, Hostetler scrambled away from a Bears blitz and rushed for 11 yards. Later on, he converted a fourth and 1 at the Bears 32 with a 10-yard burst, and eventually he finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Howard Cross.|$|E

Principal photography rolled for 106 days between June and November 2010, with locations in Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and California. Filming employed 3D cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film Avatar, and ten companies were involved with the film's visual effects. Following inflated production costs it is currently noted as the most expensive film ever made with a net budget of $379 million.|$|E

500|$|Flanders {{argues that}} nonhuman animals could be [...] "below" [...] politics, {{in that they}} do not have {{politically}} considerable interests, or [...] "above" [...] politics, in that they have rights which trump political decision-making processes. Flanders argues that if animals are excluded from basic justice, as John Rawls held, they can be defended on metaphysical grounds (what Rawls refers to as on the basis of comprehensive doctrines, as opposed to the public reasons which must be used for arguments in the political realm). This is potentially liberating for animal advocates. Nonetheless, Flanders argues, animal issues may be matters of basic justice insofar as they affect humans or the animals themselves have rights. Alternatively, the wrongness of animal cruelty may be a [...] "fixed point" [...] in our political reasoning. Flanders concludes that Rawlsianism provides a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point for the inclusion of animals in political decision-making.|$|E

Picard and the Romulans agree to pool their resources to discover the culprit.

500|$|IGN's Ryan Geddes {{called it}} [...] "a strong anime-style Japanese RPG", {{generally}} citing {{the game as}} an enjoyable experience. Francesca Reyes, writing for Official Xbox Magazine, found {{some aspects of the}} battle system frustrating, but stated that most other aspects of the game made up for this deficiency. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot was positive overall, despite noting a lack of strategy in a lot of battles and similarity to previous Tales games. Hardcore Gamers Steve Hannley called the game a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> point for the series on then-current consoles. RPGFan's Ashton Liu said that, while it stood as perhaps the best entry in the series, he also noted that it had not evolved very much mechanically when compared to other RPG series. GameSpy's Gabe Graziani cited it as a graphical improvement over other JRPGs on the console, and praised the characters despite citing the story as being conventional, and called it [...] " [...] superior blend of style and production value".|$|E
