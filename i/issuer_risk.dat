30|$|The {{credit risk}} {{has been the}} most {{important}} management issue to banks. The quality of credit risk management, good or bad, matters a lot to banks which absorb the financial risks in exchange of benefits as their essence of business. The credit risk is like as follows: the borrower or the business counterparties are unable to fulfill the duty of their contracts out of the deterioration and other factors from the entrepreneurs (such as entanglement between firms); therefore this causes the risk of agreement violation and the loss of money. Generally, from different objects and behaviors, the credit risk could be further divided into two types: (1) lending risk, also called, <b>issuer</b> <b>risk.</b> This type of risk is duo to the violation of agreement when borrowers or bond issuers do not repay their debts or their credits get deteriorated, causing the money loss. Lending risk or <b>issuer</b> <b>risk</b> are often correlated to borrowers and bond issuers’ debt credit situations, and correlated to the risk sensitiveness degree of the financial products. (2) The second credit risk is counterparty risk; it could be further divided into two risks: settlement risk and pre-settlement risk. Settlement risk is the risk that counterparties do not fulfill their contract duties in the due settlement time and cause the loss of the equality principal to the bank. Pre-settlement risk is the risk that counterparties violate the agreement before the final settlement day and cause the risk of contract violation to the bank.|$|E

40|$|The pricing of {{structured}} notes with credit risk It is inappropriate to ignore counterparty risk when pricing structured products, {{especially after the}} financial tsunami that occurred in 2008. Motivated by these circumstances, we developed an exogenous model that embeds the concept of Moody’s KMV model for evaluating the <b>issuer’s</b> credit <b>risk</b> premium under the framework of American binary put option. We select equity-linked {{structured notes}} to illustrate that the model is applicable {{to any kind of}} financial deriva-tive. The CIR model and GJR-GARCH model are employed to forecast both risk-free rate and variance paths. Fair price under <b>issuer’s</b> credit <b>risk</b> can then be estimated by deducting the premium from the default-free price. The default event can be triggered at any time point and the recovery rate is time-varying, depending on the capital structure of the issuer upon default. Our numerical example shows that the price of a 2 -year USD equity-linked note issued by JP Morgan Chase is about 0. 9 % lower than otherwise identical the default-free note. The default probability within 2 years is 1. 8 %. Besides, based on the comparative static analysis, the initial asset to debt ratio and asset to strike ratio {{have a negative effect on}} default premium, while the asset volatility has a positive effect...|$|R

We find average flotation costs to be 7. 77 percent of gross proceeds, while underwriting fees average 5. 01 percent. Our results extend the literature in two important directions. First, contrary to the conventional economies of scale view we find marginal spreads to be rather constant in gross proceeds and to be higher for more risky and more complex offerings. Fixed costs amount to 5 to 9 percent of underwriting fees. Second, by applying a principal component analysis we find issue size, an <b>issuer</b> <b>risk</b> factor, and an offering method complexity factor to have an economicaly meaningful impact on underwriting fees.

We evaluate more than 72, 000 single stock discount certificates on a daily basis from 2004 through 2008. The certificates are quoted an average of 0. 58 % above their fair value before the financial crisis, increasing to 1. 24 % during 2008. Although credit risk explains a major part (39 %) of the certificates' overpricing, we find that <b>issuer</b> default <b>risk</b> does not have any influence on investors' product choices. Instead, retail investors are strongly influenced by irrational factors such as issuer and product familiarity. Finally, investors are found to make poor product choices (in terms of bid/ask spreads and markups over fair value), resulting in significant losses. 21 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{current regulation}} {{with respect to}} the use of derivatives and leverage by mutual funds in the U. S. and Germany. After presenting a detailed overview of U.

Funds can extend these limits indirectly by using derivatives beyond their net assets (e. g., by selling credit default swaps protection with a notional amount equal to their net assets). Additionally, issuer-oriented rules in the U. S. and Germany account for <b>issuer</b> <b>risk</b> differently: U.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years, {{there has been}} a {{remarkable}} advance in financial integration in the EU and especially the euro area. As evidenced by European Central Bank research, money markets are now completely integrated within the euro area, and the only significant reason why government bonds are not perfect substitutes to each-other is the persistence of specific <b>issuer</b> <b>risk.</b> A large, liquid and efficient corporate bond market has been created, whose size has more than doubled since the launch of the single currency. Public (let alone private) equity markets are still less integrated and less competitive, but changes are noticeable. Finally, after having remained sheltered for a long time, the banking sector has recently experienced a recent rise in large-scale cross-border mergers. There are certainly not only bright spots in the landscape. Some markets remain segmented, and the Lamfalussy process for legislation and regulation is a slow and cumbersome one. According to the European Commission (2004, 2005) there is very little evidence of integration, or advance towards it, in retail services such as consumer credit, mortgage credit and insurance. In these sectors, cross-border transactions are virtually nonexistent and price divergence remains important. The picture is therefore not a uniform one...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies two {{well known}} anomalies, the asset growth anomaly and the {{external}} financing anomaly. Chapter 1 examines {{the role of}} limits to arbitrage on the asset growth anomaly or the negative relationship between capital investment or asset growth and subsequent stock returns. We hypothesize that if the negative relationship is due to mispricing, it should be more pronounced and more persistent when there are more severe limits to arbitrage. The empirical evidence supports our hypothesis and the anomaly also vanishes when arbitrage is easy. Our findings are neither due to conventional risks, firm characteristics, equity issuance, idiosyncratic risk, manifestation of liquidity risk, and are not ex-post justified by trading expenses consisted of bid-ask spreads and commissions. Finally, limits to arbitrage also subsume the firm-size effect in the cross-sectional variation in the asset growth anomaly documented by Cooper et al. (2008) and Fama and French (2008). Chapter 2 offers a novel understanding of {{the cause of the}} external financing anomaly or the negative relationship between net overall external financing activities and future stock returns. Recent studies argue that the negative relationship is driven by earnings management and/or investment growth. However, we find that about half of the anomaly remains unexplained by these interpretations. The remaining predictability is not due to exposures to conventional risks, firm characteristics, the accruals factor, the asset growth factor, the wealth transfer hypothesis, or the <b>issuer</b> <b>risk</b> hypothesis, and is not driven by performance delistings or delistings associated with negative returns or unknown risks. Instead, it is attributed to the overvalued young and small unprofitable firms that lack internal funds and have limited access to public debt markets rely heavily on equity and modestly on private debt external financing to pursue their ambitious growth strategies through heavily investing in research and development...|$|E

A quasi-closed-form formula is obtained in fair value for the price of the considered life insurance contract. This allows us to investigate the impact of strategic parameters as well as structural ones, as is shown in the numerical section of this paper.

Both the default decision of the sovereign as well as the exchange offer are modeled endogenously and in closed form.

40|$|Abstract. We analyse {{contracts}} which pay out {{a guaranteed}} minimum {{rate of return}} and {{a fraction of a}} positive excess rate, which is specied {{on the basis of a}} benchmark portfolio. These contracts are closely related to unitlinked lifeinsurance/savings plan products and can be considered as alternatives to a direct investment in the underlying benchmark portfolio. The option embedded into the savings plan is in fact a power op-tion, and thus the specication of the " contract parameters is closely related to well known features of these nancial derivatives. The key issue, both in order to rigorously justify valuation by arbitrage arguments and to prevent the guarantees from becoming uncontrollable liabilities to the <b>issuer,</b> is the <b>risk</b> management of the embedded options by a tractable and realistic hedging strategy. The long maturity of lifeinsurance prod-ucts makes it necessary to lift the Black/Scholes assumptions and consider an uncertain volatility scenario, thus explicitly taking into account risk".

This highlights the necessity of a careful choice of guarantees which are granted to the insurance customer and suggests a new role for a type of account " customary in many lifeinsurance contracts...|$|R
40|$|This {{series of}} paper studies {{convertible}} bond financing {{from the perspective}} of both issuers and investors. Based on an empirical study, convertible bond financing seems to be overused: it would appear that convertible bond financing should be dominated by sequential issues of straight bonds followed by new equity issues sometime thereafter. A new model is introduced to demonstrate that managers of all types of firms, irrespective of quality would choose convertible bonds in their financing plans when facing uncertainties about the timing of the project. Convertible bond issuance can be optimal for firms that do not have an established record of strong historical performance but have opportunity sets that include good projects subject to timing uncertainties. The first part of this study focuses on the investor perspective and investigates the returns of holding convertibles/underlying stocks, as well as the returns of convertible hedging strategies. Naked long position of convertible bonds from issuance date and hedging based on the characteristics of convertibles can derive good returns. Consequently, investors can benefit from both the upside expectation of convertible issuing firms and the structured terms of convertibles. Next, convertible bonds are studied {{from the perspective of}} <b>issuer.</b> Here, liquidity <b>risk,</b> firm risk, and issue risk premium factors are identified as determinants of abnormal returns around the convertible bond issue dates.

40|$|Equity-Indexed Annuity {{products}} (EIAs) {{are becoming}} increasingly popular as they are tax-deferred accumulation vehicles that offer participation in the equity market growth while keeping the initial capital protected. This thesis focuses in particular on a special type of EIAs; the Compound Ratchet (CR). Sellers of this product, such as insurance companies and banks, retain the right to change one of the pricing parameters on each contract anniversary date, while promising not to cross a certain predetermined threshold. Changing these parameters can sometimes {{have an impact on}} the value of the EIA, which makes them interesting to study, especially when the issuer's changing policy is not clear. In order to reproduce the pattern of these changing parameters, a new approach of dynamically hedging the CR EIA and simultaneously protecting the <b>issuer</b> from hedging <b>risk</b> is proposed and tested. Assuming the Black-Scholes Financial framework and in the absence of mortality risk, closed-form solutions for the price and value of the CR EIA at any time throughout the contract term are obtained and then used to find the Greeks, which are in turn used build the hedging strategies. In reality, trading can only be done in discrete time, which produces hedging errors. A detailed numerical example shows that the Gamma-hedging strategy outperforms the Delta-hedging strategy by reducing the magnitude of these errors. However hedging risk still exists, therefore, the new approach is applied to transfer the errors from the issuer to the buyer by dynamically changing the pricing parameters. Additionally in the numerical example, the distribution of these parameters is extracted and analyzed, as well as the resulting reduction in the hedging errors, which represent the reduced cost for the issuer...|$|R
