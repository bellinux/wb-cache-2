500|$|Bakke {{complained to}} Dr. George Lowrey, {{chairman}} of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. [...] At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. [...] If he was not accepted the second time, “he could then research the legal question. [...] He {{had been a good}} candidate. [...] I thought he’d be accepted and that would end the matter.” [...] Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, “I don’t think Storandt meant to injure the university. [...] It’s simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.” [...] Storandt stated, “I simply gave Allan the response you’d give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. [...] I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn’t know this would be the case.” Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the Bakke case, Storandt was fired.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and wrote, [...] "Watching High Fidelity, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> I could {{walk out of the}} theater and meet the same people on the street [...] and want to, which is an even higher compliment." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe praised Jack Black as [...] "a bundle of {{verbally}} ferocious energy. Frankly, whenever he's in the scene, he shoplifts this movie from Cusack." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised Cusack's performance, writing that he was [...] "a master at projecting easygoing camaraderie, he navigates the transitions with such an astonishing naturalness and fluency that you're almost unaware of them." [...] USA Today did not give the film a positive review: [...] "Let's be kind and just say High Fidelity doesn't quite belong beside Grosse Pointe Blank and The Sure Thing in Cusack's greatest hits collection. It's not that he isn't good. More like miscast." [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "In High Fidelity, Rob's music fixation is a signpost of his arrested adolescence; he needs to get past records to find true love. If the movie had had a richer romantic spirit, he might have embraced both in one swooning gesture." ...|$|E

60|$|As I {{walked away}} he called after me, but I refused to return. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{in spite of}} all I had said that he would attempt to rustle a little grub and make his start on the trail. The whole goldseeking {{movement}} was, in a way, a craze; he was simply an extreme development of it.|$|E
60|$|To {{my great}} surprise, the duke saluted me quite civilly. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of facing a treacherous bull which would gore {{me as soon}} as ever my back was turned. He was always putting me in mind of a bull, with his short neck and heavy, hunched shoulders,--and with the ugly tinge of red in the whites of his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|A line came {{between his}} brows. [...] "Well!" [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "I would say, I think, that a woman who crucifies her flesh with a cheerful spirit in {{obedience}} to God's law, stands higher {{in the eyes of}} God than one who undergoes no such sacrifice in her married life." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that his stare was passing through me, on its way to an unseen goal.|$|E

5000|$|... "More and more, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that {{quantum theory}} and general {{relativity}} are both deeply {{wrong about the}} nature of time. It is not enough to combine them. There is a deeper problem, perhaps going {{back to the beginning of}} physics." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had always}} heard that Mr. Parable was an amusing speaker, but on {{previous}} visits had not myself noticed it. But {{this time he}} seemed ten years younger than I had ever known him before; and during dinner, while we were talking and laughing quite merry like, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> more than once that people were meandering about outside. I had just finished clearing away, and cook was making the coffee, when there came {{a knock at the}} door.|$|E
60|$|When I was in America <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that it was}} {{far more}} foreign than France or even than Ireland. And by foreign I mean {{fascinating}} rather than repulsive. I mean that element of strangeness which marks the frontier of any fairyland, or gives to the traveller himself the almost eerie title of the stranger. And I saw there more clearly than in countries counted as more remote from us, in race or religion, a paradox {{that is one of}} the great truths of travel.|$|E
60|$|There {{were some}} boys of {{about my own}} age, William's sons, and as they at once led me away down into the grove, I can say little {{of what went on}} in the house after that. It must have been still in the warm September weather for we climbed the slender leafy trees and swayed and swung on their tip-tops like bobolinks. Perhaps I did not go so very high after all but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of being very close to the sky.|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot trust a woman," [...] he {{answered}} coldly. [...] "All <b>the</b> time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of insecurity. <b>I</b> {{fear that it}} must sound ungallant if I tell you what is the sober truth--that your sex for <b>the</b> present <b>has</b> lost all charm for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{months before}} {{composing}} this first component part of Montag aus Licht, Stockhausen said: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{for some time}} that Monday will be very different—very new for me too, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> Monday is <b>the</b> reverse, because it's the birth. So it's the reverse of everything that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done up to now. Most probably all the formulas will be upside-down, will be mirrored: like The Woman is in respect to the men. I think all the structural material all of a sudden is going to change drastically in the detail.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment a man knocked up against me. It was not his fault. I had stopped abruptly, not giving him time to avoid me. We both apologised, blaming the darkness. It may have been my fancy, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that, instead of going on his way, he had turned and was {{following}} me. I waited till the next corner, and then swung round on my heel. But {{there was no sign}} of him, and after a while I found myself back in the Edgware Road.|$|E
6000|$|I remembered, one day as I sat in {{the train}} hastening to Charing Cross on my way from France, that that was George's birthday. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of him upon me, heavily, and I could not rid myself of the depression. I put it down to travel fatigue, and tried to dismiss it. As I watched the evening sun glitter along the new corn-stubble in the fields we passed, trying to {{describe}} the effect to myself, I found myself asking: [...] "But—what's the matter? I've not had bad news, have I, to make my chest feel so weighted?" ...|$|E
60|$|After his {{departure}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that a great}} loss, a great calamity, had befallen me, but I was still smarting at his too candid criticism, all the more because in my heart I acknowledged its truth. And that night, lying awake, I repented of the cruel retort I had made, and resolved to ask his forgiveness and leave it to him to determine the question of our future relations. But he was beforehand with me, and with the morning came a letter begging my forgiveness and asking me to go that evening to dine with him.|$|E

[...] "You can't imagine how pleased <b>I</b> am to <b>have</b> you here. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> ever since <b>I</b> came of being shut up in a hostile camp.

5000|$|Budgie has {{generally}} received moderately positive reviews. Sounds criticized the album as being somewhat nondescript, but praised it for having [...] "a {{lot of good}} natured foot-tapping music" [...] and concluded [...] "I certainly find it infinitely preferably to Black Sabbath, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that Budgie might develop into something a lot more interesting." ...|$|R
60|$|The only {{flowers in}} the church were early daffodils, but those first {{children}} of the sun were somehow extraordinarily appropriate to the wedding of this girl. When she came out she was pelted with them, and with that miserable confetti without which not even the simplest souls can pass to bliss, it seems. There are things in life which make one feel good--sunshine, most music, all flowers, many children, some animals, clouds, mountains, bird-songs, blue sky, dancing, and {{here and there a}} young girl's face. And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that all of us there felt good for the mere seeing of her.|$|E
60|$|We {{went to his}} yellow-brick {{house for}} refreshments, salad and ice-cream and (in {{the face of the}} Hutchins traditions) champagne. Others had been invited in, some twenty persons.... Once in a while, when I looked up, I met Maude's eyes across the room. I walked home with her, slowly, the length of the Hutchinses' block. Floating over the lake was a waning October moon that cast through the {{thinning}} maples a lace-work of shadows at our feet; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of well-being that comes to heroes, and the presence of Maude Hutchins was an incense, a vestal incense far from unpleasing. Yet she had reservations which appealed to me. Hers was not a gushing provincialism, like that of Mrs. George.|$|E
6000|$|... "Home" [...] {{proved to}} be the big chateau which the British Government has leased for the kindly purpose of {{entertaining}} such American guests as they choose to invite. It is known as the [...] "American Chateau," [...] and {{in the early morning hours}} we reached it after a long drive through the gale. We crossed a bridge over a moat and traversed a huge stone hall to the Gothic drawing-room. Here a fire was crackling on the hearth, refreshments were laid out, and the major in command rose from his book to greet me. Hospitality, with these people, has attained to art, and, though I had come here at the invitation of his government, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of being his personal guest in his own house. Presently he led the way up the stone stairs and showed me the room I was to occupy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but that}} is impossible!" [...] she replied. [...] "I cannot keep the bitter {{thoughts}} from my own heart. I am ashamed when I think of your kindness, of your fidelity, of all that you have given and done for me throughout these years. And now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that <b>I</b> am leaving you when you need me most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] the Howadji reflected. [...] "But I am full of my subject, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that <b>I</b> {{am getting}} more out, even if I can't get more in, by talking fast.

2500|$|When I {{hear what}} we call music, {{it seems to me}} that someone is talking. And talking about his feelings, or about his ideas of relationships. But when I hear traffic, the sound of traffic—here on Sixth Avenue, for instance—I don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that anyone is talking. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that sound is acting. And I love the {{activity}} of sound [...] I don't need sound to talk to me.|$|R
60|$|That {{of course}} was not my name. It served me then as it will serve for this story. In all sorts of strange places I was alluded to as “that young gentleman they call Monsieur George.” Orders came from “Monsieur George” to men who nodded knowingly. Events pivoted about “Monsieur George.” I haven’t the {{slightest}} doubt that {{in the dark and}} tortuous streets of the old Town there were fingers pointed at my back: there goes “Monsieur George.” I had been introduced discreetly to several considerable persons as “Monsieur George.” I had learned to answer to the name quite naturally; and to simplify matters I was also “Monsieur George” in the street of the Consuls and in the Villa on the Prado. I verily believe that at that time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that the name of George really belonged to me. I waited for what the girl had to say. I had to wait some time, though during that silence she gave no sign of distress or agitation. It was for her obviously a moment of reflection. Her lips were compressed a little in a characteristic, capable manner. I looked at her with a friendliness I really felt towards her slight, unattractive, and dependable person.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile he {{had never}} ceased to work at his art; but, soon tiring of the studios, entirely by himself. He {{had never been so}} poor that he could not buy canvas and paint, and really he needed nothing else. So far as I could make out, he painted with great difficulty, and in his unwillingness to accept help from anyone lost much time in finding out for himself the {{solution}} of technical problems which preceding generations had already worked out one by one. He was aiming at something, I knew not what, and perhaps he hardly knew himself; and I got again more strongly the impression of a man possessed. He did not seem quite sane. It seemed to me that he would not show his pictures because he was really not interested in them. He lived in a dream, and the reality meant nothing to him. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that he worked on a canvas with all the force of his violent personality, oblivious of everything in his effort to get what he saw with the mind's eye; and then, having finished, not the picture perhaps, for I had an idea that he seldom brought anything to completion, but the passion that fired him, he lost all care for it. He was never satisfied with what he had done; it seemed to him of no consequence compared with the vision that obsessed his mind.|$|E
60|$|I was bicycling through Norfolk, and one afternoon, {{to escape}} a coming thunderstorm, I knocked {{at the door of}} a lonely cottage on the {{outskirts}} of a common. The woman, a kindly bustling person, asked me in; and hoping I would excuse her, as she was busy ironing, returned to her work in another room. I thought myself alone, and was standing at the window watching the pouring rain. After a while, without knowing why, I turned. And then I saw a child seated on a high chair behind a table in a dark corner of the room. A book of pictures was open before it, but it was looking at me. I could hear the sound of the woman at her ironing in the other room. Outside there was the steady thrashing of the rain. The child was looking at me with large, round eyes filled with a terrible pathos. I noticed that the little body was misshapen. It never moved; it made no sound; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that out of those strangely wistful eyes something was trying to speak to me. Something was forming itself before me--not visible to my sight; but it was there, in the room. It was the man I had last looked upon as, dying, he sat beside me in the hut below the Jungfrau. But something had happened to him. Moved by instinct I went over to him and lifted him out of his chair, and with a sob the little wizened arms closed round my neck and he clung to me crying--a pitiful, low, wailing cry.|$|E
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that [the shop] {{is their}} first child. And the web shop {{is the second}} child, and the {{publishing}} house, well, let’s say that became their third child. But {{now that they have}} all these children, the shop is neglected. And I feel that this is not because of us, but they nevertheless expect us to provide a solution, to shape it as we want to, but that child is not ours.|$|R
