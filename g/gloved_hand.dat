Discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was in his mind. He takes pictures of his <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear {{the same as the}} one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|Instructed {{to become}} a wizard, Simon is told to seek out wizards in the local tavern,. He {{performs}} tasks for various people, recovering the spell book he lost, as well as locating Sordid's tower. After, gaining entry, he {{ends up in the}} tower's garden. Searching the tower, Simon helps to send some demons back to hell, and uses a teleporter {{to take him to the}} Fiery Pits of Rondor, so as to destroy Sordid's wand. Simon defeats him, and is sent back to his world. Although he assumes he had a dream, a portal opens in his bedroom, and a large <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> appears, taking him back through it.|$|E

5|$|Nancy decides {{the only}} way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and {{explains}} that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would {{no longer be able to}} wake up. Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> off, and then slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the leather}} is natural {{as well as}} delicate, the wearer must take {{precaution}} as to not damage them. The constant handling of damp or wet surfaces will discolor lighter-colored gloves and stiffen the leather of any glove. The wearer will often unknowingly damage or stain their gloves while doing such tasks as twisting a wet door knob or wiping a running nose with a <b>gloved</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Screenwriters and {{directors}} use {{the image of}} a man or woman slipping on a pair of leather gloves to indicate knowledge that a crime is happening. It is a common cliche in film for the hero to hold on to a person's <b>gloved</b> <b>hand,</b> and for the person to slip out of the glove and fall to their death. This can be seen in Batman and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.|$|E

25|$|Freddy attacks Nancy once again. Realizing he {{is powered}} by his victim's fear, she calmly turns her back on him, {{reducing}} him to nothingness. She steps outside into a bright morning where all of her friends and mother are still alive. She gets into Glen's car {{to go to school}} when the top comes down and suddenly locks them in. As the car is driven uncontrollably down the street, Marge is grabbed through the window of their front door by Freddy's <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> and is dragged through it to her apparent death.|$|E
25|$|A studded, <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> {{holding a}} whip {{surrounded}} by a circle and a small 6 in the lower right corner. This symbol {{has been used by}} Death in June since at least the She Said Destroy 7″/12″, stated by Pearce to signify control and relates to having the whip hand, a British expression. The hand is gloved, giving it both a medieval and fetishistic element, and is often used either in place of the Totenkopf or with it. This symbol was used later than the Totenkopf and is usually secondary to it. As with the Totenkopf-6, the 6 presumably refers to June.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Nancy {{discovers that}} Darren and Maxine Minniver have buried Patrick Blake's {{body in the}} City Wall and she agrees {{to keep it a}} secret. In April 2016, she along with several other Hollyoaks residents, learn Lindsey was the <b>Gloved</b> <b>Hand</b> Killer. Nancy is now blonde due to Fox's choice to change her hair colour. Later this month, someone will overhear Nancy, Darren and Maxine talking about Patrick's death, this person is thought to be Neeta Kaur who takes a sudden dislike to Darren, but this is because of Darren {{grabbing}} Maxine, it is later revealed that Nico Blake was the one who overheard them.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes {{the pocket of his}} glove, with his bare hand in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E
25|$|The gesture is omnipresent in David's painting, from St. Roch Interceding {{with the}} Virgin for the Plague Stricken to Mars {{disarmed}} by Venus and the Graces. The raised {{hands of the}} Oath of the Horatii, the Tennis Court Oath or The Distribution of the Eagles are rhetorical devices making pleading manifest in the paintings. In The Death of Socrates, the philosopher—on the point of drinking hemlock—continues teaching his disciples with a gesture of reprimand at their emotional displays. In Napoleon Crossing the Alps, the gesture leaves no doubt as {{to the will of}} the commander to arrive to his goal. It does not indicate the summit, but rather shows the observer the inevitability of victory {{and at the same time}} orders his soldiers to follow. The bare rather than <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> may indicate Napoleon desiring to appear as a peacemaker rather than a conqueror.|$|E
25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and a <b>gloved</b> <b>hand.</b> The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull's mouth to speak to a character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E

25|$|Silas {{returns to}} Hollyoaks in January 2016 as he visits Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison {{under the name}} Mr. E Mann (Mystery Man). It is {{revealed}} that Silas had been writing to Trevor as he heard about the <b>Gloved</b> <b>Hand</b> Killer who had murdered seven residents throughout 2015. As Silas asks Trevor disturbing questions, Trevor tells Silas to back off and never contact him again. Silas leaves but has a feeling that Trevor is innocent and is determined {{to find out who}} the real killer is. Silas returns to Hollyoaks again in February, this time for an appointment with Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis), a nurse at Dee Valley Hospital. During the appointment, Silas tells Tegan he believes that the killer is one of the nurses or doctors who work at the hospital as medical equipment mysteriously disappeared {{during the time of the}} murders. Silas's interrogation about the murders makes Tegan uncomfortable and she leaves briefly, and once she returns Silas has already left. Silas visits Dee Valley Hospital again a few weeks later, this time imitating a human resources officer while visiting Lindsey Roscoe (Sophie Austin) in her office. After she confides in him about her feelings on her sister Kim Butterfield's (Daisy Wood-Davis) arrest for the murders, he leaves with the chilling parting words that he is a keen admirer of her good work and to keep it up, implying that he knows she is the real killer.|$|E
500|$|Clippard {{is listed}} at [...] and [...] He has an unorthodox {{pitching}} delivery, rocking forward while sticking his <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> {{high in the}} air, which creates an unusual arm angle while pitching, {{making it difficult for}} hitters to pick up the ball in their line of vision. Clippard's father taught him to pitch this way when Clippard was eight years old by having him throw his baseball glove. McCatty nicknamed Clippard's delivery [...] "The Funk".|$|E

Jules Breton for example suggested moving the obelisk to La Villette abattoir and designing a large <b>gloved</b> <b>hand</b> of a woman holding the obelisk in a suggestive manner, and adapting the Vendome into a factory chimney with a nude woman climbing it.|$|E

40|$|Addition {{silicone}} impression {{materials have}} been used as impression material for more than 20 years. Although they are among the most expensive impression materials, they became popular during the past decade as they have excellent physical properties. Prevention of infection is an important aspect in dental treatment since dental professionals are routinely exposed to the wide variety of microorganisms present in saliva. Gloves are the most common protective measure used during dental treatment. The gloves are mostly made of latex. In this study, we examine how the setting time of three types polyvinyl putty materials were affected by the use of five different brands of latex gloves and one brand of vinyl gloves. Each material was first mixed without wearing gloves according to the manufacturer′s instructions. After the stipulated mixing time, the setting time was measured using the Vicat needle. The setting time is measured from the time of mixing till the time that the needle does not produce any indentation {{on the surface of the}} material. The putty material was then mixed with <b>gloved</b> <b>hands</b> (using the five different brands of latex gloves in turn) and the setting time was measured. Then the material was mixed with washed <b>gloved</b> <b>hands,</b> and the setting time was measured again. Finally, the material was mixed with vinyl <b>gloved</b> <b>hands</b> and the setting time was measured. The following conclusions were drawn from the study: Reprosil™ and Express™ showed significant variation in the setting time with the latex <b>gloved</b> <b>hands.</b> There was no significant variation in the setting time when material was mixed with unwashed vs washed <b>gloved</b> <b>hands.</b> Vinyl <b>gloves</b> did not significantly affect the setting time of any of the putty impression materials...|$|R
