However, financial markets have recently shown high intraday volatility, which could bring more risk than expected. Such a phenomenon is well documented {{in the literature on}} high-frequency data and has prompted some exchanges to set intraday <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> and ask intraday margin calls. This article proposes to set <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> by taking into account the intraday dynamics of market prices. <b>Daily</b> <b>margin</b> levels are obtained in two ways: first, by using daily price changes defined with different time-intervals (say from 3 pm to 3 pm on the following trading day instead of traditional closing times); second, by using 5 -minute and 1 -hour price changes and scaling the results to one day. An application to the FTSE 100 futures contract traded on LIFFE demonstrates the usefulness of this new approach.

However, as well documented by research on high-frequency data, financial markets have recently shown high intraday volatility, which could bring more risk than expected. This paper tries to answer two questions relevant for margin committees {{in practice}}: is it right to compute margin levels based on closing prices and ignoring intraday dynamics?

The paper focuses {{on the impact of}} intraday dynamics of market prices on <b>daily</b> <b>margin</b> levels. <b>Daily</b> <b>margin</b> levels are obtained in two ways: first, by using daily price changes defined with different time-intervals (say from 3 pm to 3 pm on the following trading day instead of traditional closing times); second, by using 5 -minute and 1 -hour price changes and scaling the results to one day.

40|$|The use of <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> as a {{potential}} policy tool for controlling sudden stock price changes and market volatility has attracted considerable attention in the developed stock markets. However, no consensus has emerged regarding {{the significance of the}} impact of changes in <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> of the stock market. The existing analyses are extended to test the impact of changes in <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on stock prices in an emerging stock market. Using recent data from the Stock Exchange of Thailand, <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> are demonstrated to have an important impact on the behaviour of stock prices. Increases (decreases) in <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> usually lead to a downward (upward) trend in stock prices. An interesting aspect of the result is the apparently asymmetric nature of the response of stock prices to changes in <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> The market appears to respond immediately and forcefully to a decrease in the margin requirements; whereas the response to an increase in <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> is much slower and weaker. ...|$|R

Contrary to previous partial equilibrium results, stock prices are not affected by <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> Small changes in <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> produce large effects on the long-run distribution of wealth among investors. From a welfare perspective <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> might benefit the constrained less risk averse investors, while they always make more risk averse investors worse-off. ...|$|R

Only a few studies focus on the optimization and performance evaluation of portfolios in the presence of <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> In this paper, we investigate the theoretical foundation of DEA (data envelopment analysis) approach to evaluate the performance of portfolios with <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> from a different perspective. Under the mean-variance framework, we construct the optimization model and portfolio possibility set on considering <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> The convexity of the portfolio possibility set is proved and the concept of efficiency in classical economics is extended to the portfolio case. The DEA models are then developed to evaluate the performance of portfolios with <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> Through the simulations carried out in the end, we show that, with adequate portfolios, DEA can be used as an effective tool in computing the efficiencies of portfolios with <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> for the performance evaluation purpose.

To address this question, I investigate the relationship between margin changes and futures price volatility for 24 different futures contracts, which include contracts on agricultural commodities, livestock, equity indices, interest rate and foreign currency. I provide evidence using univariate tests that the futures price volatility is significantly reduced following margin increases, while the futures price volatility increases but to a lesser extent following margin decreases. A regression analysis shows that larger margin changes have a greater negative effect on the futures price volatility. This relationship holds for the different futures contracts. Finally, it may be argued that <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> and futures price volatility are endogeneous variables. To address the potential presence of endogeneity, I employ the instrumental variables technique along with two stages least squares estimation and find that the inverse relationship between margin changes and volatility still holds...|$|R
