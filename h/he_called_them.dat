5|$|In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain {{separated}} Marignac's ytterbia {{into two}} components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later {{became known as}} the element ytterbium, and lutecia {{became known as the}} element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact that}} the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain. After Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium.|$|E
5|$|Krüger visited {{several other}} {{concentration}} camps {{to assemble the}} people he needed, primarily selecting those with skills in draftsmanship, engraving, printing and banking. In September 1942 the first 26 prisoners for Operation Bernhard arrived at Sachsenhausen; 80 more arrived in December. When met by Krüger, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> in the formal and polite form , rather than the more demeaning , which was normally used when the Nazis spoke to a Jew. Several of the prisoners selected later reported that Krüger had interviewed them for the role, and treated them with politeness and good manners. He also provided the prisoners with cigarettes, newspapers, extra rations and a radio. Prisoners had a ping pong table, and they would play with the guards and among themselves; evenings of amateur theatricals also took place, staged by the prisoners, with a mixed audience of guards and counterfeiters; Krüger provided musicians for musical numbers.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{advocated}} by various ancient and medieval authors, although they differed in {{approach to the}} problem of the initial place of their origin. The theory seems to have been popular in medieval Georgia. The prominent Georgian religious writer George the Hagiorite (1009–1065) wrote about the wish of certain Georgian nobles to travel to the Iberian peninsula and visit the local Georgians of the West, as <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|In France, quite {{early in}} the Nineteenth Century, Jewish moneylenders were accused of usury, in Alsace, {{as well as of}} abusing other rights, which were given to them in their {{emancipation}} in 1791 under Louis XVI. Napoleon sided with popular French opinion. Though he desired equality for the Jews, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> “the most despicable of men” and proclaimed he did not want their number to increase in an 1808 letter to his brother Jerome.|$|E
25|$|As Jerome {{completed}} his translations of each {{book of the}} Bible, he recorded his observations and comments in an extensive correspondence with other scholars. These letters were collected and appended as prologues to the Vulgate text for those books where they survived. In these letters, Jerome described those books or portions of books in the Septuagint that were {{not found in the}} Hebrew as being non-canonical; <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> apocrypha. Jerome's views did not prevail and all complete manuscripts and editions of the Vulgate include some or all of these books.|$|E

25|$|Peirce {{agreed with}} Auguste Comte in {{regarding}} mathematics as more basic than philosophy {{and the special}} sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them,</b> including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and {{is not just the}} science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science about drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> earlier or later. The three ages became six periods. The British {{seized on}} the concept immediately. Worsaae's earlier and later became Lubbock's palaeo- and neo- in 1865, but {{alternatively}} English speakers used Earlier and Later Stone Age, as did Lyell's 1883 edition of Principles of Geology, with older and younger as synonyms. As {{there is no room}} for a middle between the comparative adjectives, they were later modified to early and late. The scheme created a problem for further bipartite subdivisions, which would have resulted in such terms as early early stone age, but that terminology was avoided by adoption of Geikie's upper and lower Paleolithic.|$|E
25|$|Although at {{the time}} of Millikan's oil-drop {{experiments}} it was becoming clear that there exist such things as subatomic particles, not everyone was convinced. Experimenting with cathode rays in 1897, J. J. Thomson had discovered negatively charged 'corpuscles', as <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them,</b> with a charge-to-mass ratio 1840 times that of a hydrogen ion. Similar results had been found by George FitzGerald and Walter Kaufmann. Most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism, however, could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable; {{in much the same way}} that many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a continuous wave rather than as a stream of photons.|$|E

25|$|In 1699, the Guru {{requested}} the Sikhs to congregate at Anandpur on Vaisakhi (the annual spring harvest festival). According to the Sikh tradition, {{he asked for}} a volunteer from those who gathered, someone willing to sacrifice his head. One came forward, whom he took inside a tent. The Guru returned to the crowd without the volunteer, but with a bloody sword. He asked for another volunteer, and repeated the same process of returning from the tent without anyone and with a bloodied sword four more times. After the fifth volunteer went with him into the tent, the Guru returned with all five volunteers, all safe. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> the Panj Pyare and the first Khalsa in the Sikh tradition.|$|E

From at least early 1954, {{he came to}} believe that the planet was under attack by UFOs, or [...] "energy alphas," [...] as <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them.</b> He said he often saw them flying over Orgonon – shaped like thin cigars with windows – leaving streams of black Deadly Orgone Radiation in their wake, which he believed the aliens were scattering to destroy the Earth.|$|E
500|$|In Potsdam in 1906, the Danish {{astronomer}} Ejnar Hertzsprung {{noticed that}} the reddest stars—classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme—could {{be divided into two}} distinct groups. These stars are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter. To distinguish these groups, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> [...] "giant" [...] and [...] "dwarf" [...] stars. The following year he began studying star clusters; large groupings of stars that are co-located at approximately the same distance. He published the first plots of color versus luminosity for these stars. These plots showed a prominent and continuous sequence of stars, which he named the Main Sequence.|$|E

500|$|Kaspersky Lab has defended {{itself against}} {{allegedly}} frivolous patent claims more aggressively than most IT companies. In 2012, {{it was the}} only one of 35 firms named in a suit by patent troll Information Protection and Authentication (IPAC) to take the case to court, rather than pay a fee. The case was ruled in Kaspersky's favor. Also in 2012, another company, Lodsys, sued Kaspersky and 54 other companies for patent infringement, and that case also resulted in the claimant dropping the case against Kaspersky. According to an article in TechWorld, the company's aversion to settling these claims is most likely because Eugene [...] "just hates" [...] patent trolls.

He examined protozoa and grew cultured vesicles using grass, sand, iron and animal tissue, boiling them and adding potassium and gelatin. Having heated the materials to incandescence with a heat-torch, he wrote that he had seen bright, glowing, blue vesicles. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> [...] "bions" [...] and believed they were a rudimentary form of life, halfway between life and non-life.

500|$|In 1932 Gielgud {{turned to}} directing. At the {{invitation}} of George Devine, {{the president of the}} Oxford University Dramatic Society, Gielgud took charge of a production of Romeo and Juliet by the society, featuring two guest stars: Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet and Edith Evans as the Nurse. The rest of the cast were students, led by Christopher Hassall as Romeo, and included Devine, William Devlin and Terence Rattigan. The experience was satisfactory to Gielgud: he enjoyed the attentions of the undergraduates, had a brief affair with one of them, James Lees-Milne, and was widely praised for his inspiring direction and his protégés' success with the play. Already notorious for his innocent slips of the tongue (<b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> [...] "Gielgoofs"), in a speech after the final performance he referred to Ashcroft and Evans as [...] "Two leading ladies, the like of whom I hope I shall never meet again." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{aesthetics}} {{were generally}} well received.

Knutson, meanwhile, was positive regarding the graphics, art, and animation: <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> [...] "nearly flawless" [...] and praised the realism they brought to the inherently fantastical skateboarding genre. Williams said that [...] "THUGs cityscapes are incredibly well designed" [...] and singled out the GameCube version of Underground as exceptionally well rendered. Rybicki called the levels [...] "big and beautiful". Knutson commended the soundtrack's large size and the sound effects' realism. Perry appreciated the [...] "hilariously hurtful" [...] injury sounds and the extensive song list.
