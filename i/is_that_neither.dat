25|$|The bearing {{of these}} ideas on current {{thinking}} on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong competitive pressure not to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might {{prove to be a}} fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>neither</b> articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until our ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.|$|E
25|$|One {{contention}} by {{some tax}} protesters {{is that a}} taxpayer {{should be allowed to}} introduce, as evidence in court, copies of statutes, cases or other materials to persuade the jury about what the law is. Courts do not allow this procedure as, under the U.S. legal system, the general rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>neither</b> side in a civil or criminal case is allowed to try to prove to the jury what the law is. For example, in a murder case the defendant is not allowed to persuade the jury that there is no law against murder, or to try to interpret the law for the jury. Likewise, the prosecution is not allowed to do this. Instead, disagreements about what the law is are argued by both sides before the judge, who then makes a ruling. Prior to jury deliberations, the judge instructs the jury on the law. Examples of applications of this rule in tax controversies are United States v. Ambort, United States v. Bonneau, and United States v. Willie.|$|E

25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>neither</b> running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E

2500|$|A {{major problem}} with associating Lukashevka and Zarubintsy with the Bastarnae {{is that both}} {{cultures}} had disappeared by the early 1st century AD, although the Bastarnae continue to be attested in those regions throughout the Roman Principate. Another issue is that the PoieneÅŸti-Lukashevka culture has also been attributed to the Costoboci, a people considered ethnic-Dacian by mainstream scholarship, which inhabited northern Moldavia, according to Ptolemy (ca. AD 140). Indeed, Mircea BabeÅŸ and Silvia Theodor, the two Romanian archaeologists who identified Lukashevka as Bastarnic, nevertheless insisted {{that the majority of}} the population in the Lukashevka sphere (N.

2500|$|One {{effect of}} {{defining}} the Celsius scale at the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW, 273.16K and 0.01Â°C), and at absolute zero (0K and âˆ’273.15Â°C), <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>neither</b> the melting nor boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere (101.325kPa) remains a defining {{point for the}} Celsius scale. In 1948 when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in Resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point {{was so close to}} being 0.01Â°C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as precisely 0.01Â°C. However, current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of VSMOW is actually very slightly (<0.001nbsp&Â°C) greater than 0.01nbsp&Â°C. Thus, the actual melting point of ice is very slightly (less than a thousandth of a degree) below 0nbsp&Â°C. Also, defining water's triple point at 273.16nbsp&K precisely defined the magnitude of each 1nbsp&Â°C increment in terms of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale (referencing absolute zero). Now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water, the value [...] "100nbsp&Â°C" [...] is hotter than 0nbsp&Â°C â€“ in absolute terms â€“ by a factor of precisely [...] (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering strictly to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339nbsp&K (99.9839nbsp&Â°C). When calibrated to ITS-90 (a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW is slightly less, about 99.974nbsp&Â°C.|$|E
