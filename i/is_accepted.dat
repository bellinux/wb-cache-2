5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown {{has suggested that}} because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected by}} the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may impersonate the material's owner {{after the}} victim has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to confidentiality. However, an attacker impersonating a victim may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a confidentiality breach for many systems.|$|E
