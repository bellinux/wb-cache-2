5|$|In 1758, Johnson {{began to}} write a weekly series, The <b>Idler,</b> which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760, {{as a way to}} avoid {{finishing}} his Shakespeare. This series was shorter and lacked many features of The Rambler. Unlike his independent publication of The Rambler, The <b>Idler</b> was published in a weekly news journal The Universal Chronicle, a publication supported by John Payne, John Newbery, Robert Stevens and William Faden.|$|E
5|$|The M2 Light Tank {{led to the}} US M3-series and M5-series light tanks. The Ordnance Department {{viewed the}} M2A4 as a stopgap tank; work to improve it further began in June 1940. The first M3 Stuart tanks began to be {{produced}} in March 1941; the original riveted M3s closely resembled the M2A4, and the two types occasionally served in the same units; the easiest recognition feature is the rear <b>idler</b> wheel. On the M2A4, the <b>idler</b> is raised; on the M3 it trails on the ground, increasing the flotation of the heavier vehicle. The M3 retained the same Continental W-670 engine, but incorporated ½-inch thicker (1½ inch total thickness) armor; weight increased to 14 tons. The tank initially kept the same 37mm gun and the forward firing hull machine guns, but the turret incorporated improvements. Eventually over 4,500 examples of all variants were produced.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An <b>idler</b> wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIdlers {{rotational}} resistance has {{a significant}} impact on energy consumption of belt conveyors. The conducted analyses showed that this component can account for 30 % of total belt conveyor resistance to motion (Gładysiewicz and Kawalec, 2008; Błażej et al., 2013). The causes for <b>idlers</b> rotational resistance including structural factors were precisely determined in (Gładysiewicz and Król, 2005). Since then, many works have been carried out with the aim to assess the quality of <b>idlers</b> and to acquire the knowledge necessary to optimize belt conveyor haulage process (Bukowski et al., 2011 a, Gładysiewicz and Król, 2009; 2012). It was due to, inter alia, the fact that the calculations of belt conveyors designs are based only on empirical relationships which give a good approximation for laboratory tested <b>idlers,</b> but are imprecise in relation to new construction solutions of <b>idlers.</b> The results of research and development works carried out at the Wroclaw University of Technology have shown that one of the conditions for successful reduction of the energy consumption of belt conveyors drives is to use high-quality <b>idlers</b> characterized by low rotational resistance under a wide range of working loads (Bukowski et al., 2011 c, Król and Kisielewski 2014). The studies allowed expanding knowledge about <b>idlers</b> rotational resistance and about the impact of working loads on belt conveyors resistance to motion and showed that <b>idlers</b> rotational resistance depends also on value of the <b>idlers</b> radial loads caused by transported masses. A series of laboratory and operational tests based on using advanced analytical tools and modern measuring techniques have been carried out and allowed to observe dependence between instantaneous mass output of belt conveyor and loads of individual <b>idlers</b> in the set. This allowed determining the dependence of <b>idlers</b> rotational resistance as a function of random loading of transported bulk material (Bukowski 2012, Król 2013) ...|$|R
5000|$|In both 1980 and 1982, The <b>Idlers</b> {{performed}} at Carnegie Hall during Eve Queler's performance of Wagner's Rienzi opera. In 1984, the <b>Idlers</b> and Icebreakers {{appeared on a}} sailing ship float with a Statue of Liberty head (and Robert Vaughn [...] ) in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The 1980s {{drew to a close}} with Don Janse's retirement in 1987. Dr. Robert Newton had been conducting the <b>Idlers</b> sister group, The Icebreakers, and now began directing both groups. Dr. Newton took the <b>Idlers</b> on their first annual tour of Florida in 1989, performing for Magic Music Days at Walt Disney World, and at the Palm Beach International Polo Club, accompanied on the keyboard by then LTjg Mark Dietrich, I'86. The <b>Idlers</b> {{performed at}} three Balls during President George H. W. Bush's Inauguration in 1989.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, you mistake," [...] he had rushed on. [...] "All {{persons in}} society, all cliques in society--or, rather, nearly all persons and cliques--ape their betters. Now, {{who are the}} best betters? The <b>idlers,</b> the wealthy <b>idlers.</b> They do not know, as a rule, the things known by the persons who are doing {{something}} in the world. To listen to conversation about such things would mean to be bored, wherefore the <b>idlers</b> decree that such things are shop and must not be talked about. Likewise they decree {{the things that are}} not shop and which may be talked about, and those things are the latest operas, latest novels, cards, billiards, cocktails, automobiles, horse shows, trout fishing, tuna-fishing, big-game shooting, yacht sailing, and so forth--and mark you, these are the things the <b>idlers</b> know. In all truth, they constitute the shop-talk of the <b>idlers.</b> And the funniest {{part of it is that}} many of the clever people, and all the would-be clever people, allow the <b>idlers</b> so to impose upon them. As for me, I want the best a man's got in him, call it shop vulgarity or anything you please." ...|$|R
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An <b>idler</b> wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
5|$|Demag was {{contracted}} {{to design a}} new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 in 1944 with ten road wheels, a strengthened front axle, a strengthened <b>idler</b> crank arm, an improved track tensioner and increased ground clearance. Three prototypes were completed; two were delivered in September 1944, but the third was retained at the factory. Development, however, did not proceed any further. Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogramm) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in <b>Idler</b> 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, The <b>Idlers</b> {{supported}} the Coast Guard's Bicentennial celebration with performances at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, AL, {{and the military}} tribute ball in Dallas, TX. With {{the start of the}} Gulf War, The <b>Idlers</b> supported dozens of USO functions throughout the country, with notable performances in and around New York City, at Ellis Island, and at Fisher's Island in Miami, FL. The <b>Idlers</b> were in such great demand that several quartets were formed, featuring one vocalist for each of the 4 parts. Singing Valentines, intimate dinner parties, accent performances for Flag Dinners - nothing was too small for an <b>Idlers</b> Quartet. The <b>Idlers</b> marched in the November 22, 1990 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with Miss America 1991, Marjorie Vincent. The group performed throughout Washington D.C. during President William J. Clinton's Inauguration in 1993. The group sang aboard the Aircraft Carrier USS Intrepid as part of the October 24, 1995 tribute to slain leader Yitzhak Rabin.|$|R

50|$|All Ae 8/14 were double-{{locomotives}} {{with eight}} driving axles and six <b>idlers.</b> The running gear {{was built for}} 100 km/h so that the locomotives {{could be used for}} passenger trains. At the beginning all locomotives had special devices fitted which could mechanically transfer weight from the <b>idlers</b> on the driving axles by slightly lifting the <b>idlers</b> with pneumatic cylinders. These equipment was abolished in the 1950s. All engines has originally no driver's seats, that means that the engineer had to operate the engine in upright position.|$|R
25|$|A {{booster engine}} for steam {{locomotives}} {{is a small}} two-cylinder steam engine back-gear-connected to the trailing truck axle on the locomotive or, if none, the lead truck on the tender. A rocking <b>idler</b> gear permits it {{to be put into}} operation by the engineer. It would drive one axle only and could be non-reversible with one <b>idler</b> gear or reversible with two <b>idler</b> gears.|$|E
25|$|In {{the optical}} {{parametric}} oscillator the initial <b>idler</b> and signal waves {{are taken from}} background waves, which are always present. If the <b>idler</b> wave is given from the outside along with the pump beam, then the process is called difference frequency generation (DFG). This is a more efficient process than optical parametric oscillation, and in principle can be thresholdless.|$|E

50|$|Don Janse {{went back}} to school in the early 1960s and John Heffermann briefly {{directed}} the <b>Idlers.</b> When Don returned he brought a number of new tunes which would soon become <b>Idlers</b> staples, including arrangements of Banua, The First Time I Ever, and the Coast Guard Hymn.|$|R

25|$|The OPO {{consists}} essentially of {{an optical}} resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical resonator serves to resonate {{at least one}} of signal and <b>idler</b> waves. In the nonlinear optical crystal, the pump, signal and <b>idler</b> waves overlap. The interaction between these three waves leads to amplitude gain for signal and <b>idler</b> waves (parametric amplification) and a corresponding deamplification of the pump wave. The gain allows the resonating wave(s) (signal or <b>idler</b> or both) to oscillate in the resonator, compensating the loss that the resonating wave(s) experience(s) at each round-trip. This loss includes the loss due to outcoupling by one of the resonator mirrors, which provides the desired output wave. Since the (relative) loss is independent of the pump power, but the gain is dependent on pump power, at low pump power there is insufficient gain to support oscillation. Only when the pump power reaches a particular threshold level, oscillation occurs. Above threshold, the gain depends also on the amplitude of the resonated wave. Thus, in steady-state operation, the amplitude of the resonated wave is determined by the condition that this gain equals the (constant) loss. The circulating amplitude increases with increasing pump power, and so does the output power.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} predicted {{that all three}} fields (pump, signal and <b>idler)</b> must be entangled, a prediction which was experimentally demonstrated by the same group.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{armament}} was a Type 91 6.5×50mm machine gun, {{although in}} later models carried a Type 92 7.7 mm machine gun. The suspension consisted of four bogies - two on each side. These were suspended by bell-cranks resisted by armored compression springs placed horizontally, one {{each side of}} the hull, externally. Each bogie had two small rubber road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the <b>idler</b> at the rear. There were two track-return rollers. In combat service the Type 94 was found to be prone to throwing its tracks in high speed turns. Further redesign work was carried out in 1937 on the suspension and the small <b>idler</b> was replaced by a larger diameter <b>idler</b> wheel suspended from a rocker arm which was now in ground contact; it did not completely solve the problem. A better suspension on a longer chassis appeared in later models of the Type 94.|$|E

25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the <b>idler</b> to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both <b>idler</b> sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|E
25|$|With {{the clutch}} off, so the shaft does not spin, the idlers {{in the two}} {{differentials}} are fixed in place. This is just like the controlled differential with the brake on. When the steering clutch is engaged, the shaft spins one of the <b>idler</b> sets forward and the other backward, causing one track to speed up {{and the other to}} slow down.|$|E
25|$|A {{design feature}} of the Peregrine {{was that it was}} {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve aircraft handling by providing a counter-rotating propeller facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an <b>idler</b> gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Idlers</b> {{were formed}} in 1957 by eight {{members of the}} USCGA Class of 1959 on summer cruise. They quickly drew the {{attention}} of the Academy's bandmaster Don Janse and began building their repertoire and fame. In the fall of 1957, the <b>Idlers</b> membership was extended to all Academy classes, as reflected in this photo, taken several months thereafter. Within two years the <b>Idlers</b> had recorded three vinyl albums (for both the Design [...] and MGM labels), and had performed for President and Mrs. Eisenhower at the White House and on The Bell Telephone Hour (NBC).|$|R
25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An <b>idler</b> reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|The photon {{conversion}} efficiency, {{the number}} of output photons per unit time in the output signal or <b>idler</b> wave relative to number of pump photons incident per unit time into the OPO can be high, {{in the range of}} tens of percent. Typical threshold pump power is between tens of milliwatts to several watts, depending on losses of the resonator, the frequencies of the interacting light, the intensity in the nonlinear material, and its nonlinearity. Output powers of several watts can be achieved.|$|E

In fact, only the chassis, bogies, track, <b>idler</b> and drive sprockets, wheels, winches, transfer case, rollers, and machine gun mount were interchangeable. The M5 is heavier than the M3, {{due in part to}} heavier armor. Its body was welded, rather than bolted. The M5 was primarily for Lend-Lease, to Britain, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union.|$|E
