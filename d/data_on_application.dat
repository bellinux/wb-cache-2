The determinants of application quantity and application quality (being the extent to which applications conform to material considerations) are argued and then explored using <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>application</b> numbers and refusal rates. The analysis indicates relative application quality for each of six main development types. It also identifies changes over time in local authority planning policy (as evidenced by the decisions that the authority takes), in applicant awareness of that policy, and application quality, and suggests policy, awareness, and quality differences between areas.

40|$|While most user {{studies on}} mobile {{telecommunications}} focus on adoption of services, preferences {{in the use}} of data networks has hardly been studied. In this paper, we analyse data collected directly on smartphones to study preferences of users between cellular and WiFi networks. Moreover, we assess how the use of specific types of applications contributes to data consumption. In absolute terms, use of WiFi is higher than use of cellular networks. The spread among participants in use of cellular networks is very high, ranging from 0 to 100 % of their total traffic. There are no significant differences between Apple and Android users. No effects were found {{of the size of the}} data plan on the amount of cellular data being consumed. Cellular network usage is especially driven by chat, social networking and browsing applications. High users of video applications do not significantly consume more bandwidth, which is at odds with conventional ideas on the capacity crunch. Log <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>application</b> usage explains data consumption better than self- -reported usage levels. The results are relevant for telecom operators to steer the amount of data being consumed over their cellular and WiFi networks. However, data consumption levels do differ greatly across the population, and as a large proportion of data traffic cannot be explained by application usage levels, preferences for data usage cannot be very well explained...|$|E
40|$|This author’s {{work on this}} {{material}} has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0307072 We study an emerging setting where data stored on a database server are retrieved and modified by applications via a cluster of application servers, which interface with end users and are often geographically distributed. This OLTP scenario is typical in many commercial application domains, including financial, trading, and insurance industries. As desirable system functionalities include enterprise-class reliability and scalable performance, it is often not possible to afford the overhead of having a distributed database that takes care of transactional consistency. A popular solution is to cache <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>application</b> servers; the use of distributed caching necessitates a cache-invalidation policy to keep copies of data in sync. In this paper we present {{the results of our}} experimental study of cache-invalidation protocols in clusters of multiple logically distributed application servers, in presence of a central database server. The main contribution of this work is guidelines that could help system designers decide effectively which invalidation algorithm would perform better for propagating updates and invalidations. The results of this study could be useful to commercial applications such as enterprise servers based on clustered J 2 EE technology [14], which need to provide highly scalable and available software. Other scenarios that could directly benefit from the results include distributed database systems and clientserver systems, in applications that exhibit frequent data-access conflicts over heavily shared data items. ...|$|E

For the 460 applications to the Loan Guarantee Program (LGP), DOE has made loan guarantees for 7 percent and committed to an additional 2 percent. The time the LGP took to review loan applications decreased {{over the course of the}} program, according to GAOs analysis of LGP data. However, when GAO requested data from the LGP on the status of these applications, the LGP did not have consolidated data readily available and had to assemble these data over several months from various sources. Without consolidated data on applicants, LGP managers do not have readily accessible information that would facilitate more efficient program management, and LGP staff may not be able to identify weaknesses, if any, in the programs application review process and approval procedures. Furthermore, because it took months to assemble the data required for GAOs review, it is also clear that the data were not readily available to conduct timely oversight of the program. LGP officials have acknowledged the need for a consolidated system and said that the program has begun developing a comprehensive business management system that could also be used to track the status of LGP applications. However, the LGP has not committed to a timetable to fully implement this system. ...|$|E
40|$|Th e {{application}} of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers on agricultural landscapes {{has the potential}} to generate concerns of environmental degradation at fi ne to coarse scales across the catchment and landscape. Inorganic nitrogen species (NO 3 NO 2 −, and NH 3) are typically associated with subsurface fl ow processes; however, surface runoff from rainfall events in no-till agriculture with inorganic surface fertilizers might contribute to downstream eutrophication. Inorganic nitrogen reduction capacity of agricultural drainage ditches under no-till cotton was determined under natural, variable rainfall conditions in northern Mississippi. Monthly grab basefl ow samples and storm-generated fl ow samples were variably sampled temporally within two experimental farm ditches over 2 yr. Inorganic nitrogen concentrations, in conjunction with Manning’s equation and Natural Resources Conservation Service dimensionless hydrographs, provided individual water volumes per storm event and thus maximum effl uent and outfl ow nitrogen loads. Base and stormfl ow regression results indicate drainage ditches reducing NO 3 − and NH 3 over the length of the ditch for growing and dormant seasons. Overall, maximum storm loads of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from the farm over the 2 -yr sampling period accounted for 2. 2 % of the initial fertilizer application, of which 1. 1 % left the ditch (0. 84 kg ha− 1 yr− 1) (a 57 % ditch reduction of DIN load over 2 yr). Long-term sampling incorporating <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>application</b> and loss of fertilizers and farm management will provide critical information for farmers and scientists on the potential of economic gains and downstream ecosystem eutrophication, respectively...|$|E
