40|$|This {{study used}} Aday and Andersen’s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use {{to examine the}} role of chronic disease and the joint impact of race and chronic disease type on mental health utilization. Using data from Community Tracking Survey Household Survey, we tested the {{assumption}} that chronic disease, chronic disease type, and race are related to lower rates of mental <b>health</b> <b>visits</b> when adjusted for predisposing, enabling, and need factors. After adjusting for population characteristics, we found that race significantly moderated the impact of chronic disease type on mental health utilization, showing that African Americans with cardiovascular disease were half as likely as whites with cardiovascular disease to have a mental <b>health</b> <b>visit,</b> and Hispanics relative to whites with other chronic diseases were two thirds a {{likely to have a}} mental <b>health</b> <b>visit.</b> Overall, chronic disease status was positively associated with mental health utilization.

This study assessed the impact of multiple <b>health</b> <b>visits</b> by non-governmental organizations and the ministry of health on behavioral change in rural villages peripheral to Ebola infected zones. Randomized surveys in seven rural villages in southeastern Senegal were used {{to collect data on}} 100 adults’ knowledge and response to Ebola health trainings. Individuals who experienced multiple <b>health</b> <b>visits</b> were less likely to adopt preventive behavioral changes in some regions. Locational differences affected individuals’ likelihood of adopting behaviors related to hygiene and bushmeat practices. Multiple <b>health</b> <b>visits</b> were ineffective in increasing protective behavioral change. These results will assist in the assessment of the adequacy of Ebola health campaigns and provide insight in designing future behavioral change interventions to thwart pathogen transmission and prevent future outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Objective. This study {{explores the}} {{association}} of patient and emergency department (ED) mental <b>health</b> <b>visit</b> characteristics with wait time and length of stay (LOS). Methods. We examined data from 580 ED mental <b>health</b> <b>visits</b> made to two urban EDs by children aged ≤ 18 years from April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2006. Logistic regressions identified characteristics associated with wait time and LOS using hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Results. Sex (male: HR= 1. 48, 95 % CI= 1. 20 – 1. 84), ED type (pediatric ED: HR= 5. 91, 95 % CI= 4. 16 – 8. 39), and triage level (Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) 2 : HR= 3. 62, 95 % CI= 2. 24 – 5. 85) were statistically significant predictors of wait time. ED type (pediatric ED: HR= 1. 71, 95 % CI= 1. 18 – 2. 46), triage level (CTAS 5 : HR= 2. 00, 95 % CI= 1. 15 – 3. 48), number of consultations (HR= 0. 46, 95 % CI= 0. 31 – 0. 69), and number of laboratory investigations (HR= 0. 75, 95 % CI= 0. 66 – 0. 85) predicted LOS.
