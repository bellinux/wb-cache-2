5|$|Dozens of {{communities}} across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines, and, in some instances, entire nativity scenes, Washington, D.C. journalist Daniel Nasaw reports for the British newspaper The Guardian. <b>He</b> <b>observes</b> {{that it is}} unclear whether such theft is on the rise, as it is not tracked by federal law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|The author {{questions}} {{the actions of}} the media with respect to privacy. <b>He</b> <b>observes</b> that public expectations regarding morality and what constitutes an impermissible violation of the right to privacy has changed over time. Lewis cites the dissenting opinion by Brandeis in Olmstead v. United States, which supported a right to privacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire day}} of a Jain monk is spent in {{ensuring}} that <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hiṃsā (injury).|$|E
50|$|During {{his career}} <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> 21 comets, mostly from Grahamstown, South Africa. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> a transit of Mercury in 1894. In 1907 {{he studied the}} planet Mars with great detail and {{published}} drawings that were highly acclaimed.|$|R
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, {{and at first}} mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think {{that two of the}} bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> the planet in 1616, further confusing him.|$|R

5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E
5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. <b>He</b> <b>observes</b> that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} chapters {{describe in}} detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, {{as well as on}} the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the biogeographic patterns <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E
60|$|I was pained to {{find him}} taking this tone, and <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> it.|$|R
5000|$|In his letters, Vincent Van Gogh {{notes that}} the {{sketches}} <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> by Pieter Ter Meulen in 1881 were much better than when <b>he</b> had <b>observed</b> Ter Meulen [...] "struggling and swotting" [...] in Bakhuyzen's studio.|$|R

5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. <b>He</b> <b>observes</b> a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E
5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|Karim Benzema {{was born}} in the city of Lyon, France to French {{nationals}} of Algerian descent. As a practicing Muslim, <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> fasting during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. His grandfather, Da Lakehal Benzema, lived in the village of Tigzirt, located in the northern town of Beni Djellil in Algeria before migrating to Lyon, where he eventually settled in the 1950s. Benzema's father, Hafid, {{was born in}} Tigzirt, while his mother, Wahida Djebbara, {{was born and raised in}} Lyon; her family originated from Oran. Benzema is the third youngest in the family and grew up with eight other siblings in Bron, an eastern suburb of Lyon. His younger brothers Gressy and Sabri are also footballers. The former currently plies his trade at the amateur level with Vaulx-le-Velin in the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football, while the latter plays in the youth academy of a club in the family's hometown of Bron. Since establishing himself as an international footballer, Benzema has been involved in numerous promotional campaigns. Since 2008, he has regularly appeared on the cover of the French version of the annual FIFA video game. Benzema is sponsored by German sportswear company Adidas and has, subsequently, appeared in several television advertisements for the brand.|$|E

25|$|The {{claim that}} EPR effects violate the {{principle}} that information cannot travel faster {{than the speed of}} light have been countered by noting that they cannot be used for signaling because neither observer can control, or predetermine, what <b>he</b> <b>observes,</b> and therefore cannot manipulate what the other observer measures.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, in {{the issue}} of ecology <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> that the {{problems}} facing our environment are only present within the capitalist imaginary that values the continuous expansion of industries. Trying to solve it by changing or managing these industries better might fail, since it essentially acknowledges this imaginary as real, thus perpetuating the problem.|$|E
25|$|Paifu is a half-vampire half-werekoala. When <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> any cross-like {{figure for}} more than three seconds, Paifu shapeshifts into a crazed and {{powerful}} were-koala and can only change back to his normal state after looking at a round object. Despite being part vampire, he can not fly because he skipped flying practice.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>observes</b> {{that using}} one round of simple {{tabulation}} hashing {{to expand the}} input keys to six times their original length, and then {{a second round of}} simple tabulation hashing on the expanded keys, results in a hashing scheme whose independence number is exponential in the parameter r, the number of bits per block in the partition of the keys into blocks.|$|E
