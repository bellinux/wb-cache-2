50|$|Goosegrass (sometimes <b>Goose</b> <b>grass)</b> is {{a common}} name for several grasses, sedges, and annual herbs. The origin of the name is due either to a plant's use as food for geese or plant parts that look like {{the foot of a}} goose.|$|E
50|$|The savanna {{consists}} of rolling grasslands and a semi-deciduous forest, with trees such as mountain syringa, silver cluster-leaf and lavender tree. The canopy is mostly leafless {{during the dry}} winter. Native grasses include signal grass, <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> and heather-topped grass. Indigenous grasses provide graze to support native species including impala, kudu, klipspringer and blue wildebeest. Some Pachypodium habitats are found especially in isolated kopje formations.|$|E
5000|$|FMA IA-58 Pucara: The Argentine-built {{counter-insurgency}} aircraft operated {{from the}} <b>Goose</b> Green <b>grass</b> airstrip during the battle. The aircraft were armed with rocket pods, two 20 mm cannons and four 7.62 mm machine guns.|$|R
50|$|During the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentine Air Force {{deployed}} two Bell 212s to <b>Goose</b> Green <b>grass</b> airstrip {{from where}} they performed general support duties including the recovery of many downed pilots. By {{the end of the}} hostilities both aircraft were still intact but were dismantled by the Argentinians.|$|R
50|$|While wintering, the red-breasted <b>goose</b> {{feeds on}} <b>grasses,</b> leaves and seeds. Since owl and buzzard populations {{fluctuate}} every few years, depending on lemming abundance, the only consistent protection from predators are river islands and the peregrine falcon.|$|R
5000|$|Ruth, {{desperate for}} helping hands, takes {{up a new}} {{initiative}} from the Ministry of Labour to employ children on the farm. They camp in the woods nearby, and pick herbs and medicinal plants like <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> and foxglove which can be sold on to Britain's pharmaceutical industry. She prepares sandwiches for them using steamed tinned salmon from Canada, and organises entertainment from a local folk musician, including the wartime favourite [...] "Run Rabbit Run".|$|E
50|$|Weeds are {{the major}} biotic {{stresses}} for finger millet cultivation. Its seeds are very small, {{which leads to a}} relatively slow development in early growing stages. This makes finger millet a weak competitor for light, water and nutrients compared with weeds. In East and Southern Africa, the closely related species Eleusine indica (common name Indian <b>goose</b> <b>grass)</b> is a severe weed competitor of finger millet. Especially in early growing stages of the crop and the weed and when broadcast seeding instead of row seeding is applied (as often the case in East Africa), the two species are very difficult to distinguish. Besides Eleusine indica, the species Xanthium strumarium, which is animal disperesed and the stolon-owning species Cyperus rotondus and Cynodon dactylon are important finger millet weeds. Measures to control weeds include cultural, physical and chemical methods. Cultural methods could be sowing in rows instead of broadcast sowing in order to make distinction between finger millet seedlings and Eleusine indica easier when hand weeding. ICRISAT promotes cover crops and crop rotations to discrupt the growing cycle of the weeds. Physical weed control in financial resource limited communities growing finger millet are mainly hand weeding or weeding with a hand hoe.|$|E
40|$|The host {{suitability}} {{of five of}} the most common weed species occurring in maize (Zea mays L.) fields in South Africa to Pratylenchus zeae was tested. Based on the number of nematodes per root unit, mealie crotalaria (Crotalaria sphaerocarpa) was a good host; <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> (Eleusine indica), common pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus), and thorn apple (Datura stramonium) were moderate hosts; and khaki weed (Tagetes minuta) was a poor host. Only the root residues of khaki weed suppressed the P. zeae infestation of subsequently grown maize. When <b>goose</b> <b>grass,</b> khaki weed, and mealie crotalaria were grown in association with maize in soil infested with P. zeae, <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> and khaki weed severely suppressed maize root development; this resulted in a low number of nematodes per maize root system and a high number of nematodes per maize root unit. Mealie crotalaria did not restrict maize root growth and did not affect nematode densities per maize root system or maize root unit. Special attention should be given to the control of mealie crotalaria, which is a good host for P. zeae, and <b>goose</b> <b>grass,</b> which, in addition to its ability to compete with maize, is also a suitable host for P. zeae...|$|E
40|$|The {{anthraquinone}} formula {{marketed as}} Flight Control ™ (FC) is advertised as a goose repellant with both an ultraviolet and post-ingestional repellency {{when applied to}} turf. Two {{studies have been conducted}} with FC, one at the National Wildlife Research Center in the U. S., and one at the Mumbay, India airport, but neither included the information necessary to determine if it is practical to use at Portland International Airport (PDX). The Port of Portland wanted to determine: 1) If FC is effective in deterring <b>geese</b> from <b>grass.</b> 2) Whether <b>geese</b> will avoid the entire project area or just the treated plots. 3) How long FC will last in our rainy climate. 4) If geese will avoid the test plots after the product has reduced in concentration. 5) Whether the product effects non-target species. 6) Whether FC will have any negative effect on treated grass. 7) If FC is a cost-effective way to reduce birdstrikes at PDX. A field with heavy goose activity was divided into five transects, which wer...|$|R
60|$|The yew-tree's shade in Gray's Elegy had not {{prepared}} me for a whole forest of yews, and I had never imagined them of the vastness I beheld. The place had its peculiar gloom through the church-yard associations of the trees, {{but there was a}} rich, Thomas Hardyish flavor in the lawless fact that in times when it was less protected than now, or when its wood was more employed in furniture-making, predatory emissaries from London used to come out to the forest by night and lop away great limbs of the yews, to be sold to the shyer sort of timber-merchants. From time to time my host put his hand on a broad sawn or chopped surface where a tree had been so mutilated and had remained in a dry decay without that endeavor some other trees make to cover the stump with a new growth. The down, he told us, was a common, and any one might pasture his horse or his cow or his <b>goose</b> on its <b>grass,</b> and I do not know whose forest rights, if any one's, were especially violated in these cruel midnight outrages on the yews; but some one must have had the interest to stop it.|$|R
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportCanada goose {{conflicts}} in suburban areas of NYS have been increasing {{based on a}} recent IPM survey of school districts. Communities continue to search for non-lethal ways to manage geese, as many urban flocks are not easily hunted. We explored a novel method using hobby aircraft (a drone) to disperse problem goose flocks. We also implemented goose fecal transects on turf grass areas at a local park, along with distributing educational fliers to recreational users of these sites. The drone was ineffective for hazing <b>geese</b> from turf <b>grass</b> areas at the park. We then tried {{a combination of a}} remote-controlled vehicle (RCV) along with pyrotechnics (bird bangers) to disperse goose flocks. The RCV was very effective in open turf areas and athletic fields. Pyrotechnics were also effective for hazing geese from both turf grass and water areas near the park and golf course. However, we were unable to break site fidelity of the goose flocks, as they sought refuge on the inlet canal for Cayuga Lake where we could not effectively haze the birds. Fecal counts along transects declined over time, but it was unclear if this was due to our hazing efforts, or routine movements of geese away from the park as the summer progressed...|$|R
40|$|Vulpia (Vulpia myuros) and <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> (Bromus hordeaceus) {{are common}} annual grass weeds {{throughout}} New Zealand in dryland pastures. They compete with sown species, suppressing pasture production and livestock performance. Their seeds may also damage hides and carcasses. Choice of sown pasture species can {{be important in}} limiting their spread. The abundance and fecundity of sown vulpia and <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> was measured over 1 year in dryland Canterbury pastures sown with different grass and legume species. Survival and seedhead production of both vulpia and <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> were lower in pastures oversown with the annual legumes subterranean and balansa clover. Annual grass weed establishment was also lower in cocksfoot than perennial ryegrass pastures. In Canterbury dryland pastures subject to summer drought, cocksfoot-based pastures oversown with subterranean and balansa clover show promise as a better alternative to ryegrass-based pastures for suppressing the ingress of these species. Repeating this study over several years in different environments would determine how widely these conclusions can be applied...|$|E
40|$|The host {{suitability}} to Ditylenchus destructor {{of seven}} common weed species in peanut (Arachis hypogaea) fields in South Africa was determined. Based {{on the number}} of nematodes per root unit, white goosefoot (Chenopodium album), feathertop chloris (Chloris virgata), purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus), jimson weed (Datura stramonium), <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> (Eleusine indica), khaki weed (Tagetes minuta), and cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) were poor hosts. Ditylenchus destructor survived on all weed species; population densities increased in peanut hulls and caused severe damage to seeds of peanut grown after weeds. Roots of purple nutsedge left in the soil suppressed populations of D. destructor and root and pod development in peanut grown after the weed. However, nematode populations in peanut hulls and seeds were not suppressed. Some weed species, especially purple nutsedge which is common in peanut fields, can be used to indicate the presence of D. destructor in the absence of peanut...|$|E
40|$|Wetlands {{have been}} used as a {{potentially}} cost-effective secondary waste water treatment system to treat the waste water before discharge into the water bodies. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the pollution reduction ability of plant species at various depths in a constructed wetland system. Two different grass species such as Eleucine indica (<b>Goose</b> <b>grass),</b> Dactyloctenium aegyptium (Crowfoot grass) and a sedge namely Cyperus iria (umbrella sedge) and the control without any plant species were introduced in the constructed wetland system. The system was operated continuously by inlet valve from tank filled with storm water. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, DO, BOD, TS, Nitrate and Phosphate contents were measured in one week interval using standard procedures. The results revealed that the pollution reduction ability was very high in Cyperus iria at one foot depth whereas the nitrate and phosphate reduction ability was comparatively high in Cyperus iria at their 1. 5 feet depth...|$|E
40|$|Typical white leaf disease {{symptoms}} were observed on Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) in Magway and Nyungoo, and goosegrass (Eleusine indica) in Kyaukpadaung of Myanmar, 2011. Phytoplasma associations with these grasses {{were determined by}} polymerase chain reaction analysis with amplified DNA fragment of 1. 8 kbp including nearly full–length of 16 S rRNA, 16 S– 23 S spacer region and partial of 23 S rRNA gene. The 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis resulted that two Bermuda grass white leaf (BGWL) isolates had the highest similarity (99 %) with members of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma cynodontis’. The goosegrass white leaf (GGWL) phytoplasma showed < 98. 8 % identity with 16 S rRNA gene sequences of ‘Ca. P. cynodontis’ and sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma (SCWL, AB 646271), and shared 99. 5 % similarity with that of sorghum grassy shoot (SGS, AF 509324). Percent homology of 16 S– 23 S spacer region sequences showed that the GGWL isolate was closet (97 % identity) to SCWL. Putative restriction site analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence including spacer region and partial of 23 S rRNA gene revealed that the GGWL isolate was distinguished from the BGWL isolate. The phylogenetic analysis proved that the GGWL isolate diverged from the sugarcane white leaf phytoplasmas and closely related with SGS phytoplasma. In addition, the GGWL phytoplasma was distantly related with ‘Ca. P. cynodontis’ and SCWL group. This is the first report {{on the presence of}} Bermuda grass white leaf and <b>goose</b> <b>grass</b> white leaf phytoplasmas in Myanmar...|$|E
