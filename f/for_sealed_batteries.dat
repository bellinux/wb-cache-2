The increase is not only for industry and large-scale applications but also for small or housing scale systems. For the latter case, the PV system components especially battery and module commonly used are usually the ones which are widely available and easily bought in traditional markets or shops. Therefore, the present study will investigate the performance of battery and module for a PV system which are mainly available in the traditional shops and commonly used for small scale system. It is found from the study that maximum of PV module efficiency {{used in the present study}} is 71. 59 % <b>for</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>battery</b> and 68. 7 % for flooded battery charging. Moreover, it can also be concluded that the performance of the <b>sealed</b> <b>battery</b> is higher than flooded battery type...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} three design {{approaches to}} individual cell {{monitoring and control}} <b>for</b> <b>sealed</b> secondary <b>battery</b> cells. One technique involves a modular strap-on single cell protector which contains all the electronics required for monitoring cell voltage, responding to external commands, and forming a bypass circuit for the cell. A second technique, the multiplexed cell protector, uses common circuitry to monitor and control each cell in a battery pack. The third technique, the computerized cell protector, by replacing the hard-wired logic of the multiplexed cell protector with a microprocessor, achieves greatest control flexibility and inherent computational capability with a minimum parts count implementation...|$|R

50|$|This sealed, {{non-spill}} feature made {{it possible}} to make very small VRLA batteries (1 -12 Amp hr. range) that fit into the growing portable electronics market. A large market <b>for</b> inexpensive smaller <b>sealed</b> lead acid <b>batteries</b> was generated quickly. Portable TV, light for news cameras, children's toy riding cars, emergency lighting, and UPS systems for computer back-up, to name a few, were powered with small <b>sealed</b> VRLA <b>batteries.</b>|$|R

50|$|Early cars did {{not have}} batteries, as their {{electrical}} systems were limited. A bell was used instead of an electric horn, headlights were gas-powered, and the engine was started with a crank. Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with electric starters. The <b>sealed</b> <b>battery,</b> which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} grab {{and place the}} <b>sealing</b> rings of <b>battery</b> lid quickly and accurately, an {{automatic}} assembling system <b>for</b> <b>sealing</b> rings based on machine vision is developed in this paper. The whole system is composed of the light sources, cameras, industrial control units, and a 4 -degree-of-freedom industrial robot. Specifically, the sealing rings are recognized and located automatically with the machine vision module. Then industrial robot is controlled <b>for</b> grabbing the <b>sealing</b> rings dynamically under the joint work of multiple control units and visual feedback. Furthermore, the coordinates of the fast-moving battery lid are tracked by the machine vision module. Finally the sealing rings are placed on the <b>sealing</b> ports of <b>battery</b> lid accurately and automatically. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can grab the sealing rings and place them on the sealing port of the fast-moving battery lid successfully. More importantly, the proposed system can improve {{the efficiency of the}} battery production line obviously...|$|R

Instrumentation and analytical procedures used for each method are described...|$|R
50|$|Since {{at least}} the mid-1960s, {{battery-operated}} electric razors have been available using rechargeable <b>batteries</b> <b>sealed</b> inside the razor's case, previously nickel cadmium or, more recently, nickel metal hydride. Some modern shavers use Lithium-ion batteries that do not suffer from memory effect. <b>Sealed</b> <b>battery</b> shavers either have built-in or external charging devices. Some shavers may be designed to plug directly into a wall outlet with a swing-out or pop-up plug, or have a detachable AC cord. Other shavers have recharging base units that plug into an AC outlet and provide DC power at the base contacts (eliminating {{the need for the}} AC-to-DC converter to be inside the razor, reducing the risk of electric shock).|$|R
