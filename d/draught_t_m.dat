40|$|Triturus marmoratus pygmaeus, a {{problematic}} subspecies of the Marbled Newt {{from the southern}} part of the Iberian Peninsula, is redescribed using specimens collected in the “typical” area. Diagnostic external morphological features are provided to permit the accurate determination of the specimens belonging either to <b>T.</b> <b>m.</b> marmoratus or to <b>T.</b> <b>m.</b> pygmaeus. These diagnostic features were applied to individuals both from the field and from museum collections. The results indicate a larger distributional area for <b>T.</b> <b>m.</b> pygmaeus than was previously recognized. The distribution of <b>T.</b> <b>m.</b> marmoratus ranges over the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula and most of France; <b>T.</b> <b>m.</b> pygmaeus occupies the southwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula. The contact area between the two subspecies seems to be located along the Central Range Mountains (Sistema Central) in Portugal and Spain. <b>T.</b> <b>m.</b> marmoratus extends southwards beyond this borderline in three areas: Serra da Estrela (Portugal), Sierra de Gata (Spain) and Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain). The only point at which <b>T.</b> <b>m.</b> pygmaeus reaches northwards beyond the Central System is near Puerto de Malagón (Madrid Province, Spain). No cases of strict sympatry, nor individuals with intermediate morphological features have been observed.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{addition}} to their use in detecting undesired real-time PCR products, melting temperatures are useful for detecting variations in the desired target sequences. Methodological improvements in recent years allow the generation of high-resolution melting-temperature (<b>T</b> <b>m)</b> data. However, there is currently no convention on how to statistically analyze such high-resolution <b>T</b> <b>m</b> data. Results Mixture model analysis was applied to <b>T</b> <b>m</b> data. Models were selected based on Akaike's information criterion. Mixture model analysis correctly identified categories in <b>T</b> <b>m</b> data obtained for known plasmid targets. Using simulated data, we investigated the number of observations required for model construction. The precision of the reported mixing proportions from data fitted to a preconstructed model was also evaluated. Conclusion Mixture model analysis of <b>T</b> <b>m</b> data allows the minimum number of different sequences {{in a set of}} amplicons and their relative frequencies to be determined. This approach allows <b>T</b> <b>m</b> data to be analyzed, classified, and compared in an unbiased manner. </p...|$|R

Solutions investigated include sugars, neutral weak acids and bases, neutralized acids and bases, neutral and protonated amino acids, surfactants, and both strong and ion-paired electrolytes. We have made measurements at molalities m from 0. 005 mol·kg− 1 to 0. 5 mol·kg− 1, at temperatures T from 278. 15 K to 393. 15 K, and at the pressure P = 0. 35 MPa. We have calculated the apparent molar volumes Vφ and apparent molar heat capacities Cp,φ of the solutions and fit them by regression to equations that describe the surfaces (Vφ, <b>T,</b> <b>m)</b> and (Cp,φ, <b>T,</b> <b>m).</b> These results reflect changes and differences in both solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions. Standard state partial molar volumes V 2 ° and heat capacities Cp, 2 ° were estimated by extrapolation to the M = 0 mol·kg− 1 plane of the fitted surfaces.
