5|$|During the Russian Civil War, and {{immediately}} afterwards, the Commissariat usually confiscated property to support government operations. Following {{a short period}} of stability after the civil war the Commissariat introduced several governmental taxes on the population.

The Commissariat, and later the Ministry, prepared the state budget <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> process with its republican and local branches. The Ministry's structure went through few changes due to the Soviet government's conservative approaches to change.
