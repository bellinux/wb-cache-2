40|$|Diesel {{fuel oil}} (DFO) spills at fueling {{platforms}} increase railroad operating costs by decreasing the locomotive miles traveled per gallon of DFO dispensed {{and increasing the}} cost of recovering and treating spilled DFO. Pressure fluctuations in the fuel system can trigger inadvertent dispensing nozzle shut off before a locomotive fuel tank is full. Fuel tanks occasionally overflow after the automatic shut-off mechanism on a nozzle is disabled to prevent subsequent inadvertent nozzle shut off. A hydraulic pressure surge analysis of two <b>fueling</b> <b>yards</b> suggests a correlation between the magnitude of these pressure fluctuations {{and the amount of}} DFO lost from fuel tank overflows. For example, at a <b>fueling</b> <b>yard</b> with a history of high DFO spillage, system pressure fluctuations are predicted to be large enough to trigger inadvertent shut off and potential fuel tank overflow following closure of one nozzle. In contrast, at a <b>fueling</b> <b>yard</b> with a history of low DFO spillage, pressure fluctuations insufficient to cause inadvertent shut off and potential overflow are predicted following the simultaneous closure of up to four (4) nozzles. Appropriately sized, pressurized bladder surge tanks installed on fueling platforms prevent inadvertent nozzle shut off, eliminating the need to monitor the filling process and reducing fuel tank overflows and the subsequent loss of DFO. Key Words: fuel spill, nozzle, pressure surg...|$|R

40|$|In Japanese sugi(Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) plantation, a {{quantity}} of logging residues occurs {{in the process of}} thinning and final yield felling. The case of a heavy snowy area in Niigata Prefecture showed that a line thinning generated 9. 0 m 3 /ha residues and final yield felling generated 167 m 3 /ha residues. These residues correspond to 42 % and 28 % of each felling wood and caused large waste of wood production. So, in order to examine the possibility of using them as the wood <b>fuel,</b> <b>yarding,</b> transporting and processing cost and the energy cost were estimated. The result showed if logging residues were cropped together with profitable logs and processed into wood fuel, such as saw dust, chip or pellet, they could be used as the fuel comparable with kerosene, town gas, liquefied gas and electricity. Wood fuel apparatus have still inconveniences but wide use of them will bring more improvement in the near future...|$|R

50|$|Osaka, a {{strategic}} port city {{and location of}} several shipyards was initially ranked as a third echelon naval port or yokobu (要港部) reporting to the Kure Naval District. The military base itself was established in 1939, but {{was little more than}} a base in name only, and was intended to form an administrative structure as legal representative of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Osaka area. It lacked in any base facilities, not even a repair <b>yard,</b> <b>fueling</b> depot or stores, and it relied on civilian-owned port facilities to service passing warships. Nonetheless, it was raised to the status of Guard District on March 13, 1940.|$|R

This was known as Poplar Dock, {{not to be confused}} with the North London Railway's Poplar Dock built in 1851 further west, and still in use as a marina. During World War II the dock was seriously damaged by bombing and it was later filled in and used as a <b>fuel</b> oil storage <b>yard</b> by Charringtons.

Other specifications included that it could transported by rail, a sufficient supply of lubrication oil to match the range of the tank (dictated by the fuel carried), a wireless set, a gun capable of defeating enemy armour at a range of at least a thousand <b>yards,</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks external to the main compartments and bottom armour sufficient to withstand heavy machine-gun fire when exposed while climbing a crest.

40|$|The {{streets of}} Portland were deserted {{yesterday}} afternoon as Mayor Baker’s early-closure order went into effect. • “Interpretation {{of the regulations}} was found difficult in many cases, {{but most of the}} store owners and others were anxious to abide by the spirit of the order designed to put a check to the influenza epidemic. ”• Vital statistics from the City Health Bureau indicate that influenza may be falling off in Portland. There were 34 deaths (the largest number for any one day) and 175 new cases reported but these statistics cover 48 hours. • To limit confusion, clarification about the early closure order was offered by the Mayor’s office. o All pool rooms, card rooms, bowling alleys, cigar stands, and refreshment parlors are to close at 3 : 30 PM. Clubs should discontinue all attractions at this time as well. o Closing orders do not doctors’ offices, dental offices, or other persons who are engaged in medical service or war work. o Grocery stores, meat markets, and drug stores should remain open. o Express and railroad companies close at 3 : 30 PM and release their office employees then. o The offices of factories, <b>fuel</b> <b>yards,</b> and wholesale establishments close at 3 : 30 PM. Deliveries may continue beyond 3 : 30 PM. “Release workers whenever possible, but can clean up day’s business with few remaining. ”• The entire police force and fifty members of the Oregon Military Police were sent out yesterday to explain to citizens the particulars of the order and to enforce the order. • Parrish is planning to send out a flying squadron of schoolteachers to educate the public and to help clean Portland homes in the fight against influenza. Teachers should arrive at 2 : 30 PM at the council chamber of the City Hall to receive instructions. The plan is entirely dependent on the co-operation of teachers. A large number of the 2, 200 teachers are expected to volunteer. Superintendant Grout endorses the plan and so do other school officials. • Health bureau employees will placard all houses where influenza patients are present. No one but the attending physician and those who live in the house will be allowed to enter. • Judge Tucker announced {{that there will be no}} more cases set in the Circuit Court until after the epidemic is over. The November jury will not be called. The courts will remain open only for cases where no jury is required for a verdict. In the absence of a jury, there are few persons in the court room and therefore court sessions will continue. • Besides courts, all other county offices will remain open during the usual hours. • Total number of deaths is now 280.

30|$|Investigation {{of heavy}} metals is very {{essential}} according to Yahaya et al. (2009), since little modification in their concentration above the threshold levels to biogenic or anthropogenic factors, leading to serious environmental hazard and subsequent welfare health problems. Klavins et al. (2000), Tam and Wong (2000), Yuan et al. (2004), Hakan (2006) all reiterated that heavy metals are serious environmental pollutants with toxicity tendency, longevity and persistency in the environment. Environmental pollution by heavy metal ions arises {{as a result}} of many activities in the environment. In the soil system, pollution by toxic metals is due to both biogenic processes (weathering of minerals) and anthropogenic activities (agriculture, burning of fossil <b>fuels,</b> industry, scrap <b>yards,</b> vehicular emissions, mining and metallurgical processes and waste disposal) as investigated by Kumar (2005), Biasioli et al. (2006), and Martin et al. (1982) while concluding that heavy metal contamination in the soil–water–plant ecosystem is of great importance because of possible influence on food chain (Gray et al. 2003).|$|R
