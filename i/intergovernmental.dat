5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units {{in the custody of}} national or local authorities as standards. Control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the later French governments until 1875, when it was passed to an international <b>intergovernmental</b> organisation, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's proposal that carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper. The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent <b>Intergovernmental</b> Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report has further increased {{the profile of the}} issue.|$|E
5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US {{have been attributed}} to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam. From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the <b>Intergovernmental</b> Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming.|$|E
5|$|For Gore's wide-reaching {{efforts to}} draw the world’s {{attention}} {{to the dangers of}} global warming which is centerpieced in the film, Al Gore, along with the <b>Intergovernmental</b> Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Gore also received the Prince of Asturias Prize in 2007 for international cooperation. The related album, which featured the voices of Beau Bridges, Cynthia Nixon and Blair Underwood, also won Best Spoken Word Album at the 51st Grammy Awards.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Rwanda {{joined the}} East African Community, an <b>intergovernmental</b> {{organisation}} for the East Africa region comprising Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The country's accession required {{the signing of}} various agreements with the other members, including a defence intelligence sharing pact, a customs union, and measures to combat drug trafficking. The countries of the Community established a common market in 2011, and plan further integration, including moves toward political federation and a possible single currency.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 2010 the European Council agreed a two line {{amendment}} to the EU Lisbon Treaty {{to allow for a}} permanent bail-out mechanism to be established including stronger sanctions. In March 2011, the European Parliament approved the treaty amendment after receiving assurances that the European Commission, rather than EU states, would play 'a central role' in running the ESM. The ESM is an <b>intergovernmental</b> organisation under public international law. It is located in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Intergovernmental</b> Council of Copper Exporting Countries, {{formed in}} 1967 by Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, {{operated}} in the copper market as OPEC does in oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, {{was never a}} member; it was dissolved in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations is a {{worldwide}} <b>intergovernmental</b> organization {{that was created}} {{with the goal of}} intervening in the disputes between nations, thereby avoiding armed conflict. The U.N. serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law. When the consensus of the membership permits, it provides a mechanism for armed intervention.|$|E
5|$|The author, {{coauthor}} or {{editor of}} 23 scholarly books and over 100 articles and book chapters, {{in addition to}} numerous other papers, addresses, and professional reports, Adelman {{has written extensively on}} the Middle East, humanitarian intervention, membership rights, ethics, early warning and conflict management, refugee repatriation, policy and resettlement, including his contribution in 2000 to the Institutional Component of the Early Warning and Conflict Management System set up by IGAD (<b>Intergovernmental</b> Authority on Development) for the Horn of Africa.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks was {{concluded}} and came into effect in March 2010. It was the first global instrument concluded under CMS and aims at facilitating international coordination for the protection, conservation and management of migratory sharks, through multilateral, <b>intergovernmental</b> discussion and scientific research.|$|E
5|$|A country's {{decision}} to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications {{captured by the}} balance of payments. It also renders exposure to risks in international finance, such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for property rights and investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the global financial system. Consumers and international businesses undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and <b>intergovernmental</b> bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{formation}} of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the <b>Intergovernmental</b> Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{developed}} country {{and has the}} fifteenth-highest nominal per capita income globally {{as well as the}} tenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a realm within the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and <b>intergovernmental</b> institutions or groupings including the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G7 (formerly G8), the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an <b>intergovernmental</b> organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the five}} {{principal}} organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City. The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi. Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six official languages of the UN, used in <b>intergovernmental</b> meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. On {{the basis of the}} Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's impartiality with regard to the host and member countries.|$|E
5|$|Gore has {{received}} a number of awards including the Nobel Peace Prize (joint award with the <b>Intergovernmental</b> Panel on Climate Change, 2007), a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album (2009) for his book An Inconvenient Truth, a Primetime Emmy Award for Current TV (2007), and a Webby Award (2005).

He also starred in the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2007 and wrote the book , which won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as {{the primary cause of}} the flooding. An <b>intergovernmental</b> working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams {{had little to do with}} the flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the statements of the People's Network.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the various departments and agencies under gubernatorial control, the Governor has an executive administrative staff that assist in coordinating the executive duties. This staff is led by a Chief of Staff, and includes five offices: <b>Intergovernmental</b> Relations, Legal Counsel, Legislative and Policy, Press, and the Governor's Office in Washington, D.C.. The Chief of Staff {{has a number of}} deputies to assist in running these departments. The Governor's staff is appointed and therefore largely exempt from state civil service laws.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993 provincial election, Stelmach {{was elected}} as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vegreville-Viking (later Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville). A Progressive Conservative, {{he served in}} the {{cabinets}} of Ralph Klein—at various times holding the portfolios of <b>Intergovernmental</b> Relations, Transportation, Infrastructure, and Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development—where he developed a reputation as a low-key politician who avoided the limelight. When Klein resigned the party's leadership in 2006, Stelmach {{was among the first to}} present his candidature to replace him. After a third-place finish on the first ballot of the leadership race, he won an upset second ballot victory over former provincial treasurer Jim Dinning.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{supported}} {{an active}} climate protection policy and {{was instrumental in}} the passing of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the establishment of the <b>Intergovernmental</b> Panel on Climate Change, and in founding the Hadley Centre for Climate Research and Prediction. She helped to put climate change, acid rain and general pollution in the British mainstream in the late 1980s, and in 1989 she called for a global treaty on climate change. Her speeches included one to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988 and to the UN General Assembly in November 1989. However, following her retirement as Prime Minister in 1990, she became sceptical about climate change policy and rejected climate alarmism.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is an <b>intergovernmental</b> {{organisation}} of six independent {{member states}} whose principal {{function is to}} mark, record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members {{who died in the}} two World Wars. The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who {{died as a result of}} enemy action during World War II. The Commission was founded by Fabian Ware and constituted through Royal Charter in 1917 named the Imperial War Graves Commission. The change to the present name took place in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The Regional Somali Language Academy is an <b>intergovernmental</b> {{regulating}} {{body for}} the Somali language in the Horn region. In January 2015, President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud announced that the institute was slated to be finalized {{in conjunction with the}} governments of Djibouti and Ethiopia. Among the scheduled projects was {{the construction of a new}} headquarters for the Academy in Mogadishu, in recognition of Somalia's traditional position as the center for the development and promotion of the Somali language. In February 2015, the foundation stone for the new Regional Somali Language Academy was officially laid at an inauguration ceremony in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor has}} the {{responsibility}} to enforce all city laws, administer and coordinate city departments and <b>intergovernmental</b> activities, set forth policies and agendas to the Board of Supervisors, and prepare and submit the city budget {{at the end of}} each fiscal year. The mayor has the powers to either approve or veto bills passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, participate in meetings of the Board of Supervisors and its committees, appoint a replacement to fill vacancies in all city elected offices until elections, appoint a member of the Board as acting mayor in his/her absence, and to direct personnels in the case of emergency.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the Council is to act as one of the two {{chambers}} of the EU's legislative branch, the other chamber being the European Parliament. It also holds, jointly with the Parliament, the budgetary power of the Union and has greater control than the Parliament over the more <b>intergovernmental</b> areas of the EU, such as foreign policy and macroeconnomic co-ordination. Finally, before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it formally held the executive power of the EU which it conferred upon the European Commission.|$|E
5|$|The three {{communities}} were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the European Communities. The institutions were carried {{over from the}} European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it {{a key role in}} the two new pillars of the EU which were based on <b>intergovernmental</b> principles.|$|E
5|$|Under the Merger Treaty of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together {{with their}} other {{independent}} institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC, which {{would act as}} a single Council of the European Communities. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following {{the establishment of the}} European Union by the Maastricht Treaty. That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more <b>intergovernmental</b> elements in the three pillars system. However, {{at the same time the}} Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the Community pillar, curtailing the ability of the Council to act independently.|$|E
5|$|A fire on {{the night}} of 6November 1995 {{destroyed}} or damaged all the structures within the Rova complex shortly before it was due to be inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Although officially declared an accident, rumours persist that politically motivated arson may have been the actual cause of the fire. The chapel and tombs, as well as Besakana and Mahitsielafanjaka, have since been fully restored with bilateral government donations, state funds and grants from <b>intergovernmental</b> and private donors. Completion of the reconstruction of the Manjakamiadana exterior is estimated for 2012, while interior restoration work will continue until at least 2013. Once the building is fully restored, Manjakamiadana will serve as a museum showcasing royal artefacts saved from destruction in the fire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tribes}} made {{progress}} {{in implementing the}} Hathaway plans with the paper and timber companies, Krulitz ceased to support the proposal when {{the full extent of}} the required federal appropriations became clear. Krulitz was replaced with Eric Jankelassistant for <b>intergovernmental</b> affairs to Interior Secretary Cecil Andruswith whom Tureen had previously negotiated the settlement to the Narragansett land claim in Rhode Island. Tureen and Jankelalong with Donald Perkins, a lawyer for the paper and timber companiesnegotiated a solution whereby $30 million of the settlement funds would come from various programs in the federal budget. That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it. Governor Langley, in turn, refused to accept any deal that would limit the state's jurisdiction over the tribes.|$|E
5|$|Explicit {{goals of}} {{financial}} regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated {{to establish a}} host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and <b>intergovernmental</b> organizations {{have the capacity to}} influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new <b>intergovernmental</b> treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu University (MU) is a {{non-governmental}} {{university that}} {{is governed by}} a Board of Trustees and a University Council. It {{is the brainchild of}} a number of professors from the Somali National University as well as other Somali intellectuals. Financed by the Islamic Development Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as well as other donor institutions, the university counts hundreds of graduates from its seven faculties, some of whom continue on to pursue Master's degrees abroad thanks to a scholarship programme. Mogadishu University has established partnerships with several other academic institutions, including the University of Aalborg in Denmark, three universities in Egypt, seven universities in Sudan, the University of Djibouti, and two universities in Yemen. , MU also has accreditation with the Board of the <b>Intergovernmental</b> Organization EDU.|$|E
