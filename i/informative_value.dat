30|$|For {{application}} as biomarkers of course, miRNA candidates must be detectable in surrogate {{tissue and}} availability of samples has to be ensured especially in tuberculosis endemic countries. Application of surrogate tissues/cells/body fluids comprises inherent jeopardy (i.e. differential cellular composition of blood or serum) that may confound results [1],[12]. Hence, single biomarker or biomarker signatures must be robust enough to define or predict e.g. disease stages, treatment efficacy, or susceptibility despite of natural variability. To estimate the <b>informative</b> <b>values</b> of miRNA as biomarkers, several studies performed comparative expression analysis mainly in peripheral blood and sputum samples.

However, every 2 - 5 years outbreaks in unprotected adults creates an epidemy for children and infants. Based on conserved genomic sequences, Real time PCR could be an easy, cost- benefit, fast and highly sensitive method for pertussis detection. Materials and Methods: A total of 170 nasopharyngeal swabs of infants with history of cough for more than 2 weeks were collected. In the first stage, Bordetella pertussis bacteria detection was performed by culture and followed by Real time PCR using a commercial kit and then repeated with newly designed primers. Results: Performance of our home made primers for detecting pertussis using Real Time PCR in comparison with those by commercial kit was acceptable based on diagnostic classical guidance (WHO) and the (CDC).

40|$|Our goal is {{to enhance}} multidimensional {{database}} systems with a suite of advanced operators to automate data analysis tasks that are currently handled through manual exploration. In this paper, we present {{a key component of}} our system that characterizes the information content of a cell based on a user's prior familiarity with the cube and provides a context-sensitive exploration of the cube. There are three main modules of this component. A Tracker, that continuously tracks the parts of the cube that a user has visited. A Modeler, that pieces together the information in the visited parts to model the user's expected values in the unvisited parts. An Informer, that processes user's queries about the most informative unvisited parts of the cube. The mathematical basis for the expected value modeling is provided by the classical maximum entropy principle. Accordingly, the expected values are computed so as to agree with every value that is already visited while reducing assumptions about unvisited values to the minimum by maximizing their entropy. The most <b>informative</b> <b>values</b> are defined as those that bring the new expected values closest to the actual values. We believe and prove through experiments that such a user-in-the-loop exploration will enable much faster assimilation of all significant information in the data compared to existing manual explorations...|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to assess}} the {{clinical}} and prognostic <b>informative</b> <b>values</b> of SI in patients with SLE. Subjects and methods. One hundred and forty-six male patients aged 15 to 64 years with a valid diagnosis of SLE who had been followed up for 15 years were assessed. The patients underwent conventional clinical, laboratory, and instrumental investigations using the standard methods of disease activity assessment. SI and SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI) were used to characterize the course and outcomes of SLE. The SI and SDI were analyzed in 133, 91, and  63 patients over time at 1, 5, and 10 years of the disease, respectively. Results. Significant correlations {{were found between the}} SI on study inclusion and the indices reflecting the course and activity of SLE. Analysis of changes in SLE indicated that its maximum increase during the first 5 years of the disease was observed in patients aged < 20 years at the onset of SLE. The patients who had SLE concurrent with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome showed a more marked SI rise than those without these abnormalities. The highest survival rates were noted in patients with an early SI of 0. Conclusion. SI is a good indicator reflecting the accumulated activity of the disease. It increases with longer disease duration; moreover, its rise may occur at any disease stages. This trend depends on the form of the disease, the time of diagnosis, and the presence of comorbidity. SI correlates well with the activity and damage indices traditionally used in SLE and with the frequency of exacerbations, suggesting that SI may be used as a prognostic marker. </p...|$|R

The test material used in this exercise was the Quality Control material (IRMM- 310) from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) a poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) granulated that has been fortified with commercially available technical mixtures of polybrominated diphenylethers and polybrominated biphenyls. The material was relabelled to avoid its recognition. Twenty-five laboratories from 15 countries registered to the exercise, from which 23 reported results. The <b>informative</b> <b>values</b> provided by the IRMM- 310 material information sheet were taken as the assigned values and their associated uncertainties for all measurands. Studies to asses the adequacy of the selected test material regarding its homogeneity for all the selected measurands were undertaken Participants were invited to report the uncertainty of their measurements. Laboratory results were rated with z- and ζ-scores (zeta-scores) in accordance with ISO 13528. The standard deviation for proficiency assessment was fixed to 25 % of the respective assigned value by the advisory board of this ILC. The outcome of the exercise was illustrating quite well the difficulties laboratories do have to provide consistent values for the investigated measurands; the share of satisfactory z-scores ranged between 61 and 88 %.
