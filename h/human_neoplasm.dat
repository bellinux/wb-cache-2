40|$|OBJECTIVE: Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common <b>human</b> <b>neoplasm</b> worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in human OSCC and is a target for cancer therapy and prevention. This study investigated the therapeutic and preventive effects of an inhibitor of EGFR (PD 153035) on OSCC. METHODS: The effects of PD 153035 were examined in human cancer cell lines in vitro, in an athymic nude mouse xenograft model in vivo, and in the 7, 12 -dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) -induced hamster cheek pouch tumour model in vivo. RESULTS: PD 153035 significantly inhibited cell growth, delayed cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in human OSCC cells in vitro. In vivo, PD 153035 inhibited xenograft tumour growth in nude mice in a dose-dependent manner and prevented the development of OSCC at the postinitiation stage in the DMBA-induced hamster cheek pouch tumour model. PD 153035 inhibited the DMBA-induced increases in cell proliferation and in levels of phosphorylated EGFR and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) protein in the hamster cheek pouch.

40|$|Aims: Intravascular {{lymphoma}}tosis (IVL) is a {{very rare}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by proliferation of lymphoma cells in the vascular lumina without involvement of adjacent parenchymal tissue. IVL is predominantly of B-cell lineage, but occasional cases of T lineage IVL involving almost exclusively the skin have been described. A case of IVL that occurred initially in the epididymis of a patient with an antecedent nasopharyngeal carcinoma was studied to define the clinicopathological features associated with this unique presentation. Methods and results: This lymphoma was studied by standard histological and immunophenotyping methods. The results showed lymphoma cells confined within the blood vessels, which expressed leucocyte common antigen, and T-cell markers CD 3 and UCHL- 1. The T- cell origin of the IVL prompted investigations for an association with Epstein-Barr virus infection (EBV). Insitu hybridization with digoxigenin- labelled anti-sense RNA probes to EBV encoded RNA (EBER) showed strong signals in the nuclei of {{virtually all of the}} lymphoma cells. Conclusions: EBV infection of the malignant cells was demonstrated by in-situ hybridization. This case suggests that T-cell IVL may be another EBV related <b>human</b> <b>neoplasm.</b> This observation will need to be validated by further studies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In osteosarcoma, no difference {{was seen in the}} incidence of p 53 accumulation according to the histologic grade of malignancy and any clinical factors including prognosis, but the incidence was significantly higher in conventional osteosarcoma than in other subtypes of osteosarcoma. In MFH of bone, the p 53 -positive group had a significantly worse prognosis compared with the p 53 -negative group. p 53 accumulation is thus considered {{to be related to the}} prognosis of MFH of bone although it did not demonstrate any prognostic value for osteosarcoma in the current study.

40|$|Burkitt's {{lymphoma}} (BL) is {{an aggressive}} B cell neoplasm, {{which is one}} of the most common neoplasms of childhood. It is highly widespread in East Africa, where it appears in endemic form associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, and around the world in a sporadic form in which EBV infection is much less common. In addition to being the first <b>human</b> <b>neoplasm</b> to be associated with EBV, BL is associated with a characteristic translocation, in which the Ig promoter is translocated to constitutively activate the c-myc oncogene. Although many BLs respond well to chemotherapy, a significant fraction fails to respond to therapy, leading to death. In this article, we demonstrate that EBV-positive BL expresses high levels of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that ROS directly regulate NF-κB activation. EBV-negative BLs exhibit activation of phosphoinositol 3 -kinase, but do not have elevated levels of ROS.

Small tumor fragments were incubated in a chemically-defined medium without serum and were hormonally stimulated in vitro. The procedure used allowed discrimination between weak labeling, suggestive of DNA repair mechanism, and strong labelling, suggesting a true DNA synthesis (S phase). Taking this into account, our results have shown that both estradiol and progesterone can induce in vitro cell replication of both ER+PgR+ and ER-PgR- human breast fibroadenoma, without affecting those of fibrocystic dysplasia, gynecomastia and phylloda. Progesterone, but not estradiol, might significantly decrease DNA repair mechanism in fibrocystic dysplasia, according to the Pg-induced decrease of nuclear incorporation of small amounts of 3 H-dThd.

40|$|Abstract. A tumor of {{the left}} {{testicle}} resembling a gonadoblastoma was an incidental finding at necropsy in a 15 -year-old male Shetland Sheepdog. This neoplasm was characterized by discrete intratubular aggregates of intimately mixed germ cells and smaller cells resembling Sertoli cells. The latter small cells often formed a single cell layer surrounding the margin of eosinophilic, PAS-positive Call-Exner-like bodies. Electron microscopy showed these bodies to be composed of whorled laminae resembling basement membrane. Gonadoblastoma has not {{been reported in the}} dog. Human gonadoblastoma, first described in 1953 [131, is composed of germ cells and sex cord derivatives resembling immature Sertoli and granulosa cells. Elements resembling interstitial or lutein cells are common. Subsequent human cases have been reported and reviewed [14]. The ultrastructure and steroidogenic capacity of this <b>human</b> <b>neoplasm</b> have been reported [9]. Gonadoblastoma usually arises in dysgenetic gonads.

40|$|The Philadelphia {{chromosome}} [t(9; 22) -(q 34;q 11) ] is the cytogenetic {{hallmark of}} human chronic myelogenous leukemia. RNA splicing joins sequences from a gene on chromosome 22 (BCR) across the translocation breakpoint to {{a portion of}} the ABL oncogene from chromosome 9, resulting in a chimeric protein (P 210) that is an active tyrosine kinase. Although strongly correlated with this specific <b>human</b> <b>neoplasm,</b> and implicated as an oncogene by analogy to the gene product of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, the P 210 gene had not been tested directly for oncogenic potential in hematopoietic cells. We have used a retroviral gene-transfer system to express P 210 in mouse bone marrow cells. When infected bone marrow is plated under conditions for long-term culture of cells of the B-lymphoid lineage, cells expressing high amounts of P 210 tyrosine kinase dominate the culture and rapidly lead to clonal outgrowths of immature lymphoid cells. Expression of P 210 is growth-stimulatory but not sufficient for full oncogenic behavior. Some clonal lines progress toward a fully malignant phenotype as judged by increased cloning efficiency in agar suspension and frequency and rapidity of tumor induction in syngeneic mice. Such in vitro systems should be useful in evaluating the sequential and perhaps synergistic involvement of the P 210 gene and other oncogenes as models for the progressive changes observed in human chronic myelogenous leukemia...|$|E

Estrogen receptor (ER), Progesteron receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER- 2 /neu) expressions {{play an important role in}} diagnosis and prognosis of breast carcinoma. Tissue microarray (TMA) technique is a high throughput technique which provides a standardized set of images which are uniformly stained, facilitating effective automation of the evaluation of the specimen images. TMA technique is widely used to evaluate hormone expression for diagnosis of breast cancer. If one considers the time taken for each of the steps in the tissue microarray process workflow, it can be observed that the maximum amount of time is taken by the analysis step. Hence, automated analysis will significantly reduce the overall time required to complete the study. Many tools are available for automated digital acquisition of images of the spots from the microarray slide. Each of these images needs to be evaluated by a pathologist to assign a score based on the staining intensity to represent the hormone expression, to classify them into negative or positive cases. Our work aims to develop a system for automated evaluation of sets of images generated through tissue microarray technique, representing the ER expression images and HER- 2 /neu expression images.

The first example of involvement of miRNAs in a <b>human</b> <b>neoplasm</b> was provided by the discovery of mir- 15 a and mir- 16 - 1 locus within the minimal region of deletion at chromosome 13 q 14 in human CLL. The proof {{that a large number of}} miRNAs are deregulated in malignant cells was initially given by genome-wide expression studies of miRNAs in CLL. The finding of a prognostic miRNA signature was discovered in human CLL. One of the first molecular links with cancer molecular pathways came by the discovery of the regulation of the BCL 2 oncogene operated by miR- 15 a/miR- 16 - 1, which is aberrant in CLL cells. Finally, the potential cancer predisposing role of miRNAs was suggested by the discovery of mir- 15 a/mir- 16 - 1 germ-line mutations in families associated with an increased risk of CLL. Together with the CLL studies, many additional investigations increased the importance of the field as they proved that numerous miRNAs are deregulated in human cancers and may act either as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Aberrant miRNA expression has been linked to cell cycle progression, loss of differentiation, increased survival, invasion and metastasis. The discovery that miRNAs interact with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes established multiple links with molecular pathways implicated in malignant transformation.

To clarify the roles of the EWS-POU 5 F 1 chimera in tumorigenesis and tumor cell maintenance, we used small-interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing. Knockdown of EWS-POU 5 F 1 in the t(6; 22) sarcoma-derived GBS 6 cell line resulted in a significant decrease of cell proliferation because of G 1 cell cycle arrest associated with p 27 Kip 1 up-regulation.

During this time, we have observed and treated both Ph 1 + and Ph 1 - patients. The contrasts between the two groups have been striking. Clinically, hematologically, and in therapeutic response, the Ph 1 - pa-tients appear to differ from the Ph 1 + group. CLINICAL MATERIAL AND METHODS This report is based on clinical and cyto-genetic studies of 28 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) referred to this Institute from 1959 to 1963. The group comprises 18 males and 10 females, ranging in age from 33 to 79 years. Detailed descrip-tions of the karyotypes of 16 of these pa-tients have been reported previously (3). Bone marrow aspirations were performed as part of our initial study and at periodic intervals thereafter. Blood and marrow were processed for chromosome analysis by techniques previously described (3). When splenic aspiration was performed, the aspi-rate was processed {{in the same manner as}} bone marrow smears. White blood cell counts were performed using an electronic cell counter (Coulter Instruments). Hemo-globin was determined using the cyan-methemoglobin method, and platelets were counted by a technique employing phase microscopy. Leukocytic alkaline phospha-tase activity was estimated by the metho...|$|E
40|$|Immunological {{gene therapy}} of cancer {{relies heavily on}} the {{activation}} of T cells, but tumors with defects in MHC gene expression are not recognized by MHC-restricted T cells. To investigate the potential of cytokine genes for the therapy of MHC-negative tumors, we transduced B 78 H 1, a class I-negative murine melanoma clone, with a polycistronic vector carrying murine interleukin (IL) - 12 genes. The clones studied produced 400 - 25, 000 pg/ml IL- 12; their in vitro growth properties {{were similar to those}} of parental cells. A complete inhibition of growth was observed in vivo both after s. c. and i. v. administration of all IL- 12 clones. IL- 12 -transduced cells were also used as a therapeutic vaccine in mice bearing micrometastases by nontransduced parental cells. A significant (80 - 90 %) {{reduction in the number of}} lung nodules was obtained. Immunohistochemical analysis and studies in immunocompromised hosts showed that T cells and natural killer cells had a significant role in the elimination of IL- 12 -releasing cells. In situ hybridization with cytokine probes detected a strong increase in the proportion of leukocytes positive for IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL- 1 beta, and IFN-inducible protein 10 at the site of rejection of IL- 12 -engineered tumor cells. However, it was clear that the loss of in vivo growth was also due to T-cell- and natural killer cell-independent factors, possibly related to the antiangiogenic properties of IL- 12. In conclusion, tumor therapy based on IL- 12 gene transduction was effective on a MHC-negative metastatic tumor, suggesting a possible application to MHC-defective <b>human</b> <b>neoplasm...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Among <b>human</b> <b>neoplasms</b> thymomas are {{associated}} with highest frequency with paraneoplastic autoimmune diseases. Case presentation A case of a 42 -year-old woman with paraneoplastic pemphigus as the first manifestation of thymoma is reported. Transsternal complete thymoma resection achieved pemphigus regression. The clinical correlations between pemphigus and thymoma are presented. Conclusion Our case report provides further evidence for {{the important role of}} autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of paraneoplastic skin diseases in thymoma patients. It also documents the improvement of the associated pemphigus after radical treatment of the thymoma. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade several studies {{provided}} evidence that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) infiltrate <b>human</b> <b>neoplasms</b> with poor prognosis. However, the role of tumor-associated pDCs remains controversial. Various studies indicate that pDCs play an immuno-suppressive role and facilitate tumor progression in both animal models and humans. In contrast, others found {{that the presence of}} activated tumor-associated pDCs results in tumor regression in mice. Given these findings, understanding pDC function in tumor biology is an important necessity and may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies to fight malignancies...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{extensive}} recognition and documentation of a heterogenous group of <b>human</b> <b>neoplasms</b> characterized morphologically by cells with histiocytic and fibroblastic qualities [5, 8, 10, 18, 19, 21, 231. There are now convincing data from tissue culture and ultrastructural studies to suggest a common histogenesis of these cells [8, 191. The generic term fibrous histiocytoma is used for those varieties considered benign. The less common malignant group includes the atypical fibrous histiocytoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant histiocytoma and epithelioid sarcoma [8, 15, 2 11. Malignant fibrous histiocytom...|$|R
