The entry of attB-adenoviral genomes into the cell nucleus early at early timepoints post-infection was not impaired and viral protein expression levels were found to be similar to those <b>of</b> control <b>adenovirus.</b> However, electron microscopy and capsid protein composition analyses revealed that attB-adenoviruses remain at an intermediate state of maturation 36 hours post-infection in comparison to control adenovirus which were fully mature and infective at this time point. Therefore, an additional 20 – 24 hours were found to be required for the appearance of mature attB-adenovirus. Interestingly, attB-adenovirus assembly and infectivity was restored by inserting a second packaging signal close to the right-end ITR, thus discarding the possibility that the attB-adenovirus genome was retained in a nuclear compartment deleterious for virus assembly.

Although the cellular receptor(s) for adenovirus is unknown, evidence indicates that a single receptor does not function as the attachment site {{for each of the}} 49 different serotypes <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus.</b> Sequence variation <b>of</b> the fiber ligand, particularly in the C- terminal knob domain, is associated with serotype-specific binding specificity. Additionally, this domain of fiber functions as a major serotype determinant. Fiber involvement in cell targeting and its function as a target of the host immune response make the fiber gene an attractive target for manipulation, both from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> biology and from the perspective <b>of</b> using <b>adenovirus</b> vectors for gene transfer experiments. We have constructed a defective chimeric adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) reporter virus by replacing the Ad 5 fiber gene with the fiber gene from Ad 7 A. Using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, we have characterized this virus with respect to infectivity both in vitro and in vivo. We have also characterized the role of antifiber antibody in the host neutralizing immune response to adenovirus infection. Our studies demonstrate that exchange of fiber is a strategy that will be useful in characterizing receptor tropism for different serotypes <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus.</b> Additionally, the neutralizing immune response to Ad 5 and Ad 7 does not differentiate between two viruses that differ only in their fiber proteins.

We describe retrovirus infection of cells outside of their normal host range when the {{infection is}} performed in the presence <b>of</b> a replication-defective <b>adenovirus</b> (dl 312). In the presence <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus,</b> several different ecotropic vectors are shown to infect human cell lines (HeLa and PLC/PRF), and a xenotropic vector is shown to infect murine cells (NIH 3 T 3). Infectivity is demonstrated by 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) staining, selection with G 418 for neomycin resistance, and PCR identification of the provirus in infected cells. Infectivity is quantitatively dependent upon both the concentration <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> (10 (6) to 10 (8) PFU/ml) and the concentration of retrovirus. Infection requires the simultaneous presence <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> in the retrovirus infection medium and is not stimulated by preincubation and removal <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> from the cells before retrovirus infection.

40|$|Adeno-associated {{satellite}} virus type 4 {{interferes with the}} replication <b>of</b> its helper <b>adenovirus.</b> No interferon-like soluble substance could be detected in satellite-infected cultures and other DNA- and RNA-containing viruses were not inhibited by coinfection with {{satellite virus}} under conditions which reduced adenovirus yields by more than 90 % in monkey cells. Altering the concentration <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> {{in the presence of}} constant amounts of satellite resulted in a constant degree of interference over a wide range <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> inocula and suggested that adenovirus concentration was not a significant factor in the observed interference. The interference with adenovirus replication was abolished by pretreating satellite preparations with specific antiserum, ultraviolet light or heating at 80 °C for 30 min. This suggested that infectious satellite virus mediated the interference. Satellite virus concentration was found to be a determinant of interference and studies indicated that the amount <b>of</b> interference with <b>adenovirus</b> was directly proportional to the concentration of satellite virus. 8 hr after adenovirus infection, the replication <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> was no longer sensitive to satellite interference. This was true even though the satellite virus was enhanced as effectively as if the cells were infected simultaneously with both viruses. Interference with adenovirus infectivity was accompanied by reduced yields of complement-fixing antigen and of virus particles which suggested that satellite virus interfered with the formation and not the function <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> products. When cells were infected either with adenovirus alone or with adenovirus plus satellite, the same proportion of cells plated as adenovirus infectious centers. However, the number of plaque-forming units <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> formed per cell in the satellite-infected cultures was reduced by approximately 90 %, the same magnitude of reduction noted in whole cultures coinfected with satellite and adenovirus.

Adenovirus is the preferred gene therapy vector for systemic delivery because of its unparalleled in vivo transduction efficiency.

Increasing the Ad dose even more will saturate both the Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Then sinusoid endothelial cells bind adenovirus particles in an RGD motif-dependent manner. Strategies to eradicate the binding to liver cells include drugs to interfere or eliminate binding to specific cell types, adenovirus capsid protein mutations and chemical modifications <b>of</b> <b>adenovirus</b> to shield the capsid proteins from cellular receptors.
