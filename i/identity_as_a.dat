40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a social identity perspective to job insecurity research. Worrying about becoming jobless, we argue, is detrimental because it implies an anticipated membership of a negatively evaluated group – {{the group of}} unemployed people. Job insecurity hence threatens <b>a</b> person’s social <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> employed person. This in turn will affect well-being and job performance. A three-wave survey study among 377 British employees supports this perspective. Persons who felt higher levels of job insecurity {{were more likely to}} report <b>a</b> weaker social <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> employed person. This effect was found to be stable over time, and also held against a test of reverse causality. Furthermore, social <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> employed person influenced well-being and in-role job performance and mediated the effect of job insecurity on these two variables over time. Different to the expectations, social <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> employed person and organisational proactivity were not connected. The findings deliver interesting evidence for the role of social <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> employed person in the relationships between job insecurity and its consequences. Theoretically, this perspective illustrates the individual and group-related nature of job insecurity and offers a novel way of connecting work situations with individual well-being, behaviour, and attitudes...|$|R

Shortly thereafter, the storm passed near Varanus Island as a {{high-end}} Category4 or low-end Category5 cyclone. Within several hours of passing by Varanus Island, Olivia made landfall near Mardie at peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to weaken overland. Accelerating to the southeast, the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below hurricane-force. During the afternoon of 11April, Olivia weakened to a tropical low over southern Australia. It moved over the Great Australian Bight and lost its <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gale-force low on 12April, after it was absorbed by a trough.|$|E

The remnants of the typhoon initially continued moving east-northeast before stalling that evening. Faye began to reorganize, and was estimated to have re-attained typical storm strength on August28. Faye intensified slightly, nearly attaining typhoon intensity on August29, but this trend was short-lived due to increased wind shear. By August31, a building ridge to Faye's north led to a southwest motion as the system steadily weakened. However, Faye managed to maintain its <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weak tropical cyclone for several days, before finally dissipating on September3.|$|E

In an August 1999 interview, Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 {{that he would be}} interested in using the licence of Nights into Dreams to reinforce Sega's <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> video game developer.

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} on 15 August 1945, the New Zealand government {{agreed to}} contribute units {{to a joint}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). The 9th New Zealand Infantry Brigade – including Div Cav, which regained its <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> regiment – {{became part of the}} NZ contingent, known as J Force. In October, D Squadron was changed into an all-Maori unit, replacing men sent back to New Zealand. The regiment embarked for Kure on 21 February 1946, reaching its destination on 19 March and relieving the 67th Australian Battalion on Eta-Jima on 23 March; it was billeted in Naval Academy Etajima. After patrolling the island, the regiment was replaced by the Royal Welch Fusiliers and moved to Hirao. By May its permanent headquarters was at the Mizuba naval barracks. Lieutenant Colonel John Worsnop took command on 28 June 1946 and the regimental flag was lowered for the last time on 5 August 1947; the regiment was disbanded on 1 September 1947.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural <b>identity.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{reconcile}} some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case. To explain the degree of facial resemblance (which even Cockburn accepted) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family, Onslow suggested in The Englishman that Orton's mother was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Roger Tichborne's grandfather. An alternative story has Orton's mother seduced by James Tichborne, making Orton and Roger half-brothers. Other versions have Orton and Roger as companions in crime in Australia, with Orton killing Roger and assuming his identity. The Claimant's daughter by Mary Ann Bryant, Teresa Mary Agnes, maintained that her father confessed to her that he had killed Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years. There is no direct evidence for any of these theories. Teresa continued to proclaim her <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Tichborne daughter, and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family.|$|E

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Cuba's {{economy grew}} in 1974 {{as a result}} of high {{international}} sugar prices and new credits with Argentina, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization of American States (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice. Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming that this would further democratization and decentralize power away from Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> socialist state, the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, making him both head of state and head of government.|$|E
