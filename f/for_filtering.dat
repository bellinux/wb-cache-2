40|$|The {{usefulness}} of {{three types of}} lead acrylic filter in gastric cancer screening was studied on reducing effective dose. Effective dose was estimated using the software Monte Carlo program for Windows. The results indicated that each filter contributed {{to a reduction in}} effective dose; 62. 63 ± 2. 10 μSv <b>for</b> no <b>filter,</b> 58. 86 ± 1. 70 μSv <b>for</b> <b>filter</b> A, 55. 80 ± 1. 98 μSv <b>for</b> <b>filter</b> B and 54. 10 ± 1. 80 μSv <b>for</b> <b>filter</b> C. 　The use of lead acrylic filter in gastric cancer screening is one of effective methods to protect examinees against radiation. 胃がん検診に３種類の含鉛アクリルフィルタを使用した場合の有効性を，実効線量低減の観点から研究した。実効線量は，ウインドウズ対応のソフトウエアであるモンテカルロプログラムを使用して推定された。その結果，各々のフィルタにより実効線量が低減することが明らかになった。すなわち，フィルタなしで 62. 63 ± 2. 10 μSv，フィルタA使用で 58. 86 ± 1. 70 μSv，フィルタB使用で 55. 80 ± 1. 98 μSv，フィルタC使用で 54. 10 ± 1. 80 μSvとなった。　胃がん検診における含鉛アクリルフィルタの使用は，受診者を放射線被曝から防御する有効な一つの方法であると言える...|$|R
25|$|The {{required}} {{capacitance tolerance}} {{is determined by}} the particular application.

25|$|The {{required}} tolerance {{is determined}} by the particular application. The narrow tolerances of E24 to E96 are used for high-quality circuits such as precision oscillators and timers. General applications such as non-critical filtering or coupling circuits employ E12 or E6. Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used <b>for</b> <b>filtering</b> and bypassing capacitors mostly have a tolerance range of ±20% and need to conform to E6 (or E3) series values.|$|E

25|$|Membrane {{filters are}} widely used <b>for</b> <b>filtering</b> both {{drinking}} water and sewage. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2μm—including giardia and cryptosporidium. Membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging the water into a river {{that is used by}} towns further downstream. They {{are widely used}} in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including bottled water). However no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as phosphorus, nitrates and heavy metal ions.|$|E

25|$|Power {{capacitors}} can be {{used for}} a wide variety of applications, even where extremely non-sinusoidal voltages and pulsed currents are present. Both AC and DC capacitors are available. AC capacitors serve as damping or snubbing capacitors when connected in series with a resistor, and are also specified for the damping of undesirable voltage spikes caused by the so-called charge carrier storage effect during switching of power semiconductors. In addition, AC capacitors are used in low-detuned or close-tuned filter circuits <b>for</b> <b>filtering</b> or absorbing harmonics. As pulse discharge capacitors, they are useful in applications with reversing voltages, such as in magnetizing equipment.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they appear}} to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, {{alligators}} and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species' family. Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands <b>for</b> <b>filtering</b> out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.|$|E
500|$|Zobel invented several filters whose {{defining}} characteristic was {{a constant}} resistance as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band. With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem. [...] The main application of these sections has been not so much <b>for</b> <b>filtering</b> out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.|$|E

500|$|A {{diplexer}} is {{a device}} used to combine two signals occupying different frequency bands {{into a single}} signal. [...] This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel, or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another. (This specific use of a diplexer is called a duplexer.) The same device {{can be used to}} separate the signals again {{at the far end of}} the channel. [...] The need <b>for</b> <b>filtering</b> to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self-evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals. [...] Without filtering, some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output. [...] This will have the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the output impedance of source B thus causing mismatch. [...] These problems could be overcome with the use of a [...] directional coupler, but as explained in the previous section, a wideband design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well.|$|E
