60|$|Outside <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> {{calling for}} me. I {{glanced at the}} clock. It was {{within a few minutes}} of the time fixed for our departure. Mr. Bundercombe nodded to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> all," [...] said Alice, with sincerity {{that made}} Mrs. Mavering laugh as light-heartedly as Dan himself, and {{that seemed to}} suggest the nest thing to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, 'm; {{it was so}} lonesome in the rain, {{and this}} place seemed kinder like home, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>'em</b> talkin' outside, and Sanch he found vittles, and I was pretty comfortable." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{peculiar}} wakefulness {{seemed to}} have seized upon me, which appeared, moreover, to afflict the other passengers as well. In {{the darkness of the}} car <b>I</b> <b>could</b> distinctly <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> groaning at intervals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Abnormal? I don't call it abnormal," [...] I began, and I was {{sensible}} of my wife's thoughts {{leaving her}} own injuries for {{my point of}} view so swiftly that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> whir.|$|R
6000|$|When I flew to Blackmoor Vale, [...] Whence the green-gowned faeries hail, Roosting {{near them}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> [...] Speak of queenly Nature's ways, [...] Means, and moods,--well known to fays.|$|E
6000|$|My next {{care was}} for the children. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> crying frantically for [...] "papa!" [...] and I hurried to where they stood cowering {{in the door of}} the barn. [...] "O, papa, put it out. I don't want it to burn. Put it out!" [...] moaned Mary Isabel with passionate intensity.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was little}} time for reflection. Already were the Indians so near that I fancied <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> breathing. I knew that the cave had no other outlet than this one at which we crouched, but also that two {{determined}} men might hold half an hundred in check {{as long as their}} ammunition lasted--but then? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must be off {{to board}} the Turkish vessel before it comes inshore. Good-bye, sir, in case we do not meet again." [...] He said the last few words in so low a voice that <b>I</b> only <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> Then he kissed his wife, and told her he {{expected}} {{to be back in}} time for breakfast, and was gone. He met Rooke--I am hardly accustomed to call him Captain as yet, though, indeed, he well deserves it--at the edge of the cordon of sentries, and they went quickly together towards the port, where the yacht was lying with steam up.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had heard}} each theme {{in my head}} while copying the score, but now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> at all! Mahler had overscored the {{percussion}} instruments and side-drum so madly and persistently that little beyond the rhythm was recognizable. I hurried home sobbing. ... For a long time I refused to speak. At last I said between my sobs: 'You've written it for percussion and nothing else'. He laughed, and produced the score. He crossed out the side drum in red chalk and half the percussion instruments too. He had felt the same thing himself, but my passionate protest turned the scale." [...] (Alma Mahler-Werfel, 'Memories and Letters', p.73) ...|$|R
60|$|All this {{occurred}} {{so rapidly that}} a minute could hardly have elapsed from the time I mounted the companion until I found myself gagged and powerless. It was so sudden that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarce bring myself to realise it, or to comprehend what it all meant. I heard the gang round me speaking in short, fierce whispers to each other, and some instinct {{told me that my}} life was the question at issue. Goring spoke authoritatively and angrily--the others doggedly and all together, as if disputing his commands. Then they moved away in a body to {{the opposite side of the}} deck, where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> whispering, though they were concealed from my view by the saloon skylights.|$|R
6000|$|When I had got out I {{shut the}} window, and went away fifty yards or so, where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> come back. Presently I heard some {{footsteps}} {{coming from the}} opposite direction. Then I heard a voice I knew say, [...] "There is the fire; we shall soon know whether the poor lad has got ashore." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{crew had}} been {{obviously}} on the jump. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> running about. The modern spirit of haste was loudly vocal in the orders to [...] "Heave {{away on the}} cable"--to [...] "Lower the sideladder," [...] and in urgent requests to me to [...] "Come along, sir! We have been delayed three hours for you. [...] . Our time is seven o'clock, you know!" ...|$|E
60|$|The siege-party did {{not stop}} to argue. They stampeded as one man. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> {{clattering}} across the flagstones to every point of the compass. In a few seconds silence prevailed, {{broken only by the}} swish of the rain. Round two had been brief, hardly worthy to be called a round at all, and, like round one, it had ended wholly in our favour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} knew {{by the words}} {{that there was more}} than one boy out with slings, and I was so tired that it didn't seem as if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> run another inch! When I was knocked into the brook I somehow was turned around, so that I was headed away from home, and we had a long, long {{distance}} to go before there was the littlest kind of a show for safety. It seemed as if matters were just as bad as they could be; but it appears that they were not, for just then who should pop out of some tall grass but my poor little Sonny Bunny, and those dreadful boys so close behind that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> breathe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who was I to {{get such}} {{information}} from? The Governments of Naples and Sicily either knew not, or chose {{to keep me}} in ignorance. Was I to wait patiently until I heard certain accounts? If Egypt were their object, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>them,</b> {{they would have been}} in India. To do nothing was disgraceful; therefore I made use of my understanding. I am before your lordships' judgment; and if, under all circumstances, it is decided that I am wrong, I ought, {{for the sake of our}} country, to be superseded; for at this moment, when I know the French are not in Alexandria, I hold the same opinion as off Cape Passaro--that, under all circumstances, I was right in steering for Alexandria; and by that opinion I must stand or fall." ...|$|R
60|$|After going {{round the}} town, the {{procession}} repaired {{to a certain}} appointed place, where, as the printed programme set forth, it would be received by {{the children of the}} different free schools, 'singing Temperance Songs.' I was prevented from getting there, in time to hear these Little Warblers, or to report upon this novel kind of vocal entertainment: novel, at least, to me: but I found in a large open space, each society gathered round its own banners, and listening in silent attention to its own orator. The speeches, judging from the little <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>them,</b> were certainly adapted to the occasion, as having that degree of relationship to cold water which wet blankets may claim: but the main thing was the conduct and appearance of the audience throughout the day; and that was admirable and full of promise.|$|R
6000|$|... '"He {{went over}} sideways, very gently, {{and this is}} the last thing I {{remember}} seeing on board," [...] he continued. [...] "I did not care what he did. It looked as though he were picking himself up: I thought he was picking himself up, of course: I expected him to bolt past me over the rail and drop into the boat after the others. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> knocking about down there, and a voice as if crying up a shaft called out 'George!' Then three voices together raised a yell. They came to me separately: one bleated, another screamed, one howled. Ough!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, Baas," [...] {{said the}} man in a whine, [...] "but {{half an hour ago}} I heard you coming. I don't know what is the matter with the air to-night, but it sounded as though twenty people were {{galloping}} after you. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> all quite clearly; first the big black horse, and then all those that followed, just as though they were hunting you. So I came out and lay down to listen, and it was not till you were quite close that one by one the others stopped. Perhaps it was the devils who galloped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is, {{they agreed}} to furnish me food and money for tools and share in profits. Dan went to work with me, and do you know, it ended in ruining them both. We {{organized}} a company called the 'Biddy Mining Company.' I was president, and Dan was vice-president, and Biddy was treasurer. Biddy kept us going by her eating-house, but eventually we wanted machinery, and we mortgaged the eating-house, and the money went into that hole in the ground. But I knew we would succeed. I could hear voices call me, 'Come, come!'--whenever I was alone <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> plainly." ...|$|E
60|$|Those {{words are}} {{engraved}} upon my heart. Ah, gladly would I {{give up my}} life a thousand times <b>could</b> <b>I</b> only <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> once again; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not then give even a second to the rapture of her sweet embrace, and pressing my lips to hers for the first time, I picked her up bodily and tossed her to her seat behind Sola again, commanding the latter in peremptory tones to hold her there by force, and then, slapping the thoat upon the flank, I saw them borne away; Dejah Thoris struggling to the last to free herself from Sola's grasp.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Jackson, who {{was close}} {{friends with the}} band during the time, later cited Hot Space as an {{influence}} for his own album Thriller. In a 2015 interview with Greg Prato of Songfacts, Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt described how Hot Space was an important album {{for him as a}} musician. [...] "I think it's interesting because that album taught me two things. It taught me that even if you're in a band as a guitar player, music doesn't have to be driven by guitar - it's about the song, first. But I think the main thing is that Queen actually did an album like that - it was the fans' least favorite, but it was one of my favorites because it took a risk and branched out. All those synth parts they did and horns, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> with guitar in my head somehow. But quite oddly enough, or coincidentally enough, the title Hot Space is exactly what it meant: it's all the space between the music. That's what makes it funky and that's what makes it have a pocket." ...|$|R
60|$|From another ridge {{we saw a}} cabin {{dotting the}} rolling plain, and {{in half an hour}} we reached it. As we climbed down from the wagon a brown and black dog came dashing out of the cabin, and {{promptly}} jumped at Moze. His selection showed poor discrimination, for Moze whipped him before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> separate <b>them.</b> <b>Hearing</b> Jones heartily greeting some one, I turned in his direction, only to be distracted by another dog fight. Don had tackled Moze for the seventh time. Memory rankled in Don, and he needed a lot of whipping, some of which he was getting when I rescued him.|$|R
60|$|But it was {{the cold}} that was most distressing. I felt that I could survive but a few minutes. People were {{struggling}} and floundering in the water about me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> crying out to one another. And I heard, also, the sound of oars. Evidently the strange steamboat had lowered its boats. As the time went by I marvelled that I was still alive. I had no sensation whatever in my lower limbs, while a chilling numbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into it. Small waves, with spiteful foaming crests, continually broke over me and into my mouth, sending me off into more strangling paroxysms.|$|E
6000|$|... "A young {{genius in}} Dodgetown, who {{promises}} {{one day to}} render {{the name of an}} American illustrious. He has painted a new sign for the store, that in its way is quite equal to the marriage of Cana. 'I have stood with tears over the despair of a Niobe,'" [...] continuing to read, [...] "'and witnessed the contortions of the snakes in the Laocoon with a convulsive eagerness to clutch them, that has made me fancy <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> hiss." [...] That sentence, I think, will be likely to be noticed even in the New-Old-New-Yorker, one of the very best reviews of our days, gentlemen." ...|$|E
60|$|But I fixed him. I lacerated his {{feelings}} and pride several dollars' worth. He {{tried to scare}} me by threatening to come in after me and kick the stuffing out of me. In return, I promised to kick {{him in the face}} while he was climbing in. The advantage of position was with me, and he saw it. So he kept the door shut and called for help {{from the rest of the}} train-crew. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> answering and crunching through the gravel to him. And all the time the other door was unlatched, and they didn't know it; and in the meantime the gay-cat was ready to die with fear.|$|E
5000|$|Although widely {{reported}} as a delayed effect of being {{hit in the}} head by a train's hinged car side, the coma was actually the result of a 5-centimeter brain tumor. Over time, Grzebski's aging caused the tumor to shrink enough to relieve pressure on his brain stem, and he eventually and gradually regained full consciousness. Grzebski began to wake from his coma in 1992. Doctors had not expected Grzebski to survive, let alone emerge from the coma. He credited his survival to his wife, Gertruda Grzebska, who cared and prayed for him. Grzebski was a father of four {{at the time of the}} accident. While disabled he gained eleven grandchildren. In an interview on 1 June 2007, with the Polish news channel TVN 24, Grzebski described his recollections of the communist system's economic collapse. [...] "When my family spoke to me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> actually <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not talk back. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not send them a signal to tell them that I was still alive." [...] Afterwards, Grzebski died in 2008 from the brain tumor soon after he awoke in 2007. Jan Grzebski had lived in an invalid state for 19 years of his 66-year life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the thought}} that I was a 'tarnal fool came to me pretty strong, you bet. One of those fellows had ridden on and brought {{down some of the}} Regulators, as we used to call them in the mining camps, but I believe the Mormons call them Destroying Angels, though there is mighty little of angels about them. I hoped now that they had not caught sight of me during the day, and that the band were going right down to the waggon camp; but as I had not taken any {{particular}} pains to hide myself, I reckoned they must have made me out. It war pretty nigh dark, and as I took cover behind a bush <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarce see them as they rode along. They went down about two hundred yards and then stopped, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> some of <b>them</b> dismount.|$|R
6000|$|Conceiving {{that when}} an officer is not {{successful}} in his plans {{it is absolutely}} necessary that he should explain the motives upon which they were founded, Nelson wrote at this time an account and vindication of his conduct for having carried the fleet to Egypt. The objection which he anticipated was that he ought not to have made so long a voyage without more certain information. [...] "My answer," [...] said he, [...] "is ready. Who was I to get it from? The governments of Naples and Sicily either knew not, or chose to keep me in ignorance. Was I to wait patiently until I heard certain accounts? If Egypt were their object, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>them</b> {{they would have been}} in India. To do nothing was disgraceful; therefore I made use of my understanding. I am before your lordships' judgment; and if, under all circumstances, it is decided that I am wrong, I ought, {{for the sake of our}} country, to be superseded; for at this moment, when I know the French are not in Alexandria, I hold the same opinion as off Cape Passaro--that, under all circumstances, I was right in steering for Alexandria; and by that opinion I must stand or fall." [...] Captain Ball, to whom he showed this paper, told him he should recommend a friend never to begin a defence of his conduct before he was accused of error: he might give the fullest reasons for what he had done, expressed in such terms as would evince that he had acted from the strongest conviction of being right; and of course he must expect that the public would view it in the same light. Captain Ball judged rightly of the public, whose first impulses, though, from want of sufficient information, they must frequently be erroneous, are generally founded upon just feelings. But the public are easily misled, and there are always persons ready to mislead them. Nelson had not yet attained that fame which compels envy to be silent; and when it was known in England that he had returned after an unsuccessful pursuit, it was said that he deserved impeachment; and Earl St. Vincent was severely censured for having sent so young an officer upon so important a service.|$|R
60|$|We were awakened, {{about eight}} o'clock this morning, by the cathedral bell, {{which is near}} by, and by the {{chanting}} of the service. It was a beautiful, sunny morning, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> sing all the time I was dressing. I think, by {{the style of the}} singing, it was Protestant service: it brought to mind the elms of Andover--the dewy, exquisite beauty of the Sabbath mornings there; and I felt, more than ever, why am I seeking any thing more beautiful than home? But today the sweet shadow of God's presence is still over me, and the sense of his love and protection falls silently into my soul like dew.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt) And It came to pass, when Paul was at Corinth, he {{and certain}} disciples {{came upon a}} mob that was stoning an organist. And Paul said unto them, 2 ̆ 2 What then hath he done unto thee that his head should be bruised? 2 ̆ 2 And the people cried with one voice, 2 ̆ 2 He hath played too loud. Yea, in the singing of psalms, he maketh our heads to ring {{as if they were}} beaten with hammers. Behold, he sitteth up high in the loft, and mighty are the pipes and mighty is the noise thereof, and though there be few of us below, he {{nonetheless}} playeth with all the stops, the Assyrian trumpet stop and the stop of the ram 2 ̆ 7 s hom and the stop that soundeth like the sawing of stone, and we cannot hear the words that cometh out of our own mouths. He / always tosseth in variations that confuse us mightily and he playeth loud an discordant and always in a militant tempo, so that we have not time to breathe as we sing. Lo, he is a plague upon the faith and should be chastised. 2 ̆ 2 Paul, hearing this, had himself picked up a small stone, and was about to cast it, but he set It down, and bade the organist come forward. He was a narrow man, pale of complexion, dry flaking, thin of hair. And Paul said unto him, 2 ̆ 2 Why hath thou so abused thy brethren? 2 ̆ 2 And the organist replied, 2 ̆ 2 <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> singing from where I sat, and therefore played the louder so as to encourage them. 2 ̆ 2 And Paul turned round to the mob and said loudly, 2 ̆ 2 Let him who has never played an organ cast the first stone. 2 ̆ 2 And they cast stones for a while until their arms were tired and Paul bade the organist repent and he did. And Paul said unto him, 2 ̆ 2 Thou shalt take up the flute and play It for thirty days, to cleanse thy spirit, 2 ̆ 2 and afterwards they returned to Corinth and sang psalms unaccompanied and then had coffee and were refreshed in the faith...|$|R
