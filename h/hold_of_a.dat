Andrei recognizes Giani's car parked in front of block P7, so he goes in.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally large thefts of {{diamonds}} take place. In February 2013 armed robbers {{carried out a}} raid at Brussels Airport and escaped with gems estimated to be worth $50m (£32m; 37m euros). The gang broke through a perimeter fence and raided the cargo <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Swiss-bound plane. The gang have since been arrested and large amounts of cash and diamonds recovered.|$|E

And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of de Vere? For where is Bohun? Where is Mowbray? Where is Mortimer? Nay, which is more, and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Michael's (Steve Carell) {{controversial}} {{imitation of}} a Chris Rock routine forces the staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar. A consultant (Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge—aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff—and creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing tempers to slowly simmer until they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself.|$|E
5|$|Little Bee {{explains}} that although Nkiruka was gang raped, murdered, and cannibalised by the soldiers, she {{was allowed to}} escape, and stowed away in the cargo <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship bound for England. Sarah allows Little Bee to stay with her, intent on helping her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little Bee in to the police. When he informs Little Bee that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, Little Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, Little Bee and Charlie take a trip to the park. Charlie goes missing, and Little Bee calls the police while Sarah searches for him. Although he is quickly found, the police become suspicious of Little Bee, and discover that she is in the country illegally.|$|E

5|$|Only {{microscopic}} {{quantities of}} plutonium were available until the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, {{but there were}} already some worrying signs. When plutonium fluoride was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to reduce it to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15g/cm3, and a measurement using X-ray scattering techniques pointed to a density of 13g/cm3. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density {{was the same as}} uranium, about 19g/cm3. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with Arthur Wahl had devised a procedure for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they got <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined that there were two different fluorides: the light colored plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4) and the dark plutonium trifluoride (PuF3). The chemists soon discovered how to make them selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20g/cm3.|$|E

25|$|Containerization {{greatly reduced}} {{the expense of}} {{international}} trade and increased its speed, especially of consumer goods and commodities. It also dramatically changed the character of port cities worldwide. Prior to highly mechanized container transfers, crews of 20–22 longshoremen would pack individual cargoes into the <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship. After containerization, large crews of longshoremen were no longer necessary at port facilities, and the profession changed drastically.|$|E
25|$|Bhattacharya {{suggests}} that the Tantrika may even murder to get <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable corpse for shava sadhana. A young chandala boy may be intoxicated and then killed by the tantrika by deceit. However, Professor McDaniel notes that tantrikas she met in Tarapith disagreed. They believed that the appropriate corpse is chosen by the Goddess herself and murdering someone for the ritual is interfering with the Goddess' work.|$|E
25|$|The P-36s {{had been}} {{delivered}} to Hawaii in February 1941 by being loaded on the carrier the USS Enterprise in California, {{then in a}} first for the USAAC, flown off the carrier's deck by the P-36's U.S. Army Air Corps pilots when the Enterprise neared the coast of Hawaii. This saved considerable time over the traditional shipping method of having the fighters first disassembled, crated and then loaded by crane in the <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> freighter, then unloaded and reassembled in Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|The first 13 {{aircraft}} for the Indian Air Force (IAF) were assembled at Hamble-le-Rice, {{they were}} followed by partly completed aircraft and then sub-assemblies as Hindustan Aircraft slowly took over first assembly, and then production of the aircraft. The first flight of an Indian Air Force Gnat was in the United Kingdom on 11 January 1958, it was delivered to India in the <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> C-119, and accepted by the Air Force on 30 January 1958. The first Gnat squadron was the No. 23 (Cheetah), which converted from Vampire FB.52 on 18 March 1960 using six Folland-built Gnats. The first aircraft built from Indian-built parts first flew in May 1962. The last Indian-built Gnat F.1 was delivered on 31 January 1974.|$|E

In the last phase of the war, the British fleet and legio XIV were brought in from Britain to attack the Batavian coast, but the Cananefates, allies of the Batavians, were able to destroy or capture {{a large part of}} the fleet. In the meantime, the new Roman commander, Quintus Petillius Cerialis, advanced north and constructed a new fleet. Civilis attempted only a short encounter with his own fleet, but could not hinder the superior Roman force from landing and ravaging the island of the Batavians, leading to the negotiation of a peace soon after.|$|E
25|$|After {{the crowd}} (perhaps accidentally) toppled {{one of the}} Angels' motorcycles, the Angels became even more aggressive, {{including}} toward the performers. Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane jumped off the stage to try and sort out the problem, only to be punched {{in the head and}} knocked unconscious by an Angel during the band's set, as seen in the documentary film Gimme Shelter. When Jefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner sarcastically thanked the Angels for knocking the singer out, one of the bikers took <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> microphone and argued with him about it. The Grateful Dead had been scheduled to play between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and the Rolling Stones, but after hearing about the Balin incident from Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, they refused to play and left the venue, citing the quickly degenerating security situation.|$|E
25|$|In Chapter 45, Jiang Gan {{volunteers to}} persuade Zhou Yu to {{surrender}} to Cao Cao and travels to Zhou's camp. Zhou Yu knows Jiang Gan's true purpose of the visit, so he tricks Jiang into believing that two of Cao Cao's naval commanders (Cai Mao and Zhang Yun) are planning to assassinate their lord and defect to his side. Jiang Gan also gets <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> letter apparently written by Cai Mao and Zhang Yun to Zhou Yu, in which they claimed that they will kill Cao Cao soon and present his head to Zhou Yu. He then steals the letter while Zhou Yu is asleep, returns to Cao Cao's camp, and shows Cao the letter. The letter is actually a fake one created by Zhou Yu. Cao Cao falls for the ruse and orders Cai Mao and Zhang Yun to be executed. He realises his folly later {{but it is too}} late already.|$|E
