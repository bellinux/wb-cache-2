50|$|Influenced by {{aerodynamicist}} Paul Jaray, {{the hull}} shape was more streamlined than the preceding P class, although traditionalists {{in the company}} insisted that {{a portion of the}} hull should be parallel sided to prevent instability. The structure consisted of 20 wire braced 13-sided <b>transverse</b> <b>frames,</b> all but the rear three and front two frames made up of kingpost-braced girders. These were spaced 10 m (32 ft 9 in) apart, with an intermediate frame in the middle of each bay, and were attached to a triangular section ventral keel, the apex of which was braced {{to the ends of the}} outer ends of the lower <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> girders on each side. The <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> were connected by 13 principal longitudinal girders, of which the one at the top of the hull was a more substantial W-section girder. There were secondary longitudinal girders between the principal girders. A central axial bracing cable running the length of the hull was fitted to reduce the load on the transverse bracing of the mainframes in the case of the deflation of a single gasbag. This feature was the subject of a Schütte Lanz patent, and had not previously been used by Zeppelin.|$|R
40|$|Using a {{covariant}} coalescence model, {{we study}} hadron production in relativistic heavy ion collisions from both soft partons in the quark-gluon plasma and hard partons in minijets. Including transverse flow of soft partons and independent fragmentation of minijet partons, {{the model is}} able to describe available experimental data on pion, kaon, and antiproton spectra. The resulting antiproton to pion ratio is seen to increase at low transverse momenta and reaches a value of about one at <b>intermediate</b> <b>transverse</b> momenta, as observed in experimental data at RHIC. A similar dependence of the antikaon to pion ratio on transverse momentum is obtained, but it reaches a smaller value at <b>intermediate</b> <b>transverse</b> momenta. At high transverse momenta, the model predicts that both the antiproton to pion and the antikaon to pion ratio decrease and approach those given by the perturbative QCD.

40|$|In {{erection}} phase, {{when the}} static scheme {{is in progress}} and {{the connection between the}} concrete slab and the upper flange of steel beams is not yet effective, lateral-torsional buckling in steel-concrete composite bridges is restrained by provisional horizontal steel bracing systems.

30|$|The load–displacement curves were {{identical}} for the 2 D and 3 D specimens up to a vertical displacement of 18  mm. Because the flexural and arching {{actions of the}} in-plane beams are dominant during this stage, this similarity is obvious. Numerical analyses {{in the next section}} demonstrate that within this stage, small axial forces were developed in the transverse beam. Generally, owing to the lack of axial restraint in the transverse beam, arching actions could not develop. Hence, flexural action is the dominant mechanism in the <b>transverse</b> <b>frame.</b> The flexural capacity of a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> leads to higher resistance for 3 D specimen events – in the post peak phase of the load–displacement curve (Fig.  11). The area under the load–displacement curve for the 3 D specimen is 1.9 times larger than the corresponding value for the 2 D assembly.|$|R
50|$|In {{longitudinal}} <b>framing,</b> {{very heavy}} <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> are spaced much further apart than in traditional framing - about 12 ft A {{large number of}} longitudinal frames are then attached to hold the shell plating. The longitudinal frames at the sides fit into notches cut into the <b>transverse</b> <b>frames,</b> while the ones {{near the bottom of}} the ship are sometimes made continuous between transverse bulkheads. The transverses are connected to the shell plating at heavy angles and with a tank top are cut at the margin plate. Strong tie bars extend from the face angle on the transverses to the tank top plating. Under the tank top, except for notches cut for the bottom and tank top longitudinals, the transverses are much like ordinary floor plates. The deck longitudinals furnish ample strength, even when large hatch openings must be accommodated.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{measurements}} of strange hadron elliptic flow at mid-rapidity in Au + Au collisions at √(s_NN) = 7. 7 - 200 GeV using the STAR detector {{in the years}} 2010 and 2011. The transverse momentum and collision centrality dependence of elliptic flow is presented. At the <b>intermediate</b> <b>transverse</b> momentum Ω baryon and ϕ-meson show baryon-meson separation effect similar to proton and pion for minimum-bias Au+Au collision at √(s_NN) = 200 GeV. This indicates formation of collective flow at the early partonic phase. The separation between baryons and mesons at <b>intermediate</b> <b>transverse</b> momentum decreases with decrease in beam energy and almost disappears at √(s_NN) ≤ 11. 5 GeV, indicating hadronic interaction being dominant at the lower beam energy. We observe difference in elliptic flow between particle and anti-particle and this increases with decrease in beam energy. Differences are larger for baryons than mesons. Relative difference between particle and anti-particle elliptic flow is larger in central collisions than in peripheral ones. Comment: 7 pages, ICPAQGP 2015 conference proceedin...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} usage of {{floating}} frames in boats. A floating <b>frame</b> is a <b>transverse</b> <b>frame</b> fittedto the longitudinal stiffener flanges without contact with the shell plating, {{as opposed to the}} traditionalfixed frame which is welded to the shell plating with the stiffeners most commonly fitted through cut outsin the frame. To study the floating frame structure in a bigger perspective a finite element analysis is performed on amid ship compartment of an existing 60 m high speed catamaran ferry. The analysis is performed on amodel with scantlings as the original craft but with introduced floating frames. Stresses are analysed withrespect to maximum allowable stress as given in the DNV-rules for HAZ. High stresses are found {{in the bottom of the}} frames due to the reduced bending stiffness without effectiveflange from the shell plating. A large deformation in the shell plating relative the <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> isfound, creating high stresses in the stiffener webs. This deformation is induced by a large verticaldeformation of the frames. It is concluded that the <b>transverse</b> <b>frames</b> requires an increased stiffness to achieve acceptable stress levels. Possible solutions to increase stiffness are discussed, further studies are required to achieve an acceptablestructure. A design criterion for stiffeners in floating frame constructions is evaluated. The criterion considers theinteraction between a concentrated contact force and a bending moment with the purpose of simplifyingthe design process of stiffeners. The criterion is a combination of design methods from DNV HSLC andEurocode 9. The design criterion is found to give conservative results, although not unreasonably conservative. Thecriterion is suitable for the design of smaller work boats where the scantlings traditionally are not veryoptimized...|$|R
