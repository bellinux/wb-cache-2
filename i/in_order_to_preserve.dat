The area within the middle moat of the castle complex is a designated Special Historic Site and five structures of the castle are also designated National Treasures. Along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle, Himeji Castle is considered one of Japan's three premier castles. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the castle buildings, it underwent restoration work for several years and reopened to the public on March 27, 2015.

This factor, and the need for costly upgrades to expand the paper onto the Internet, led to a decision to sell the News-Miner to Dean Singleton and Richard Scudder, co-founders of the MediaNews Group newspaper chain. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the paper's independence—something desired by Snedden—the News-Miner was purchased by the family trusts of the two men, with ownership split 50/50 between the two trusts.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} dwellings {{were probably}} built between 3000 and 2000 BC, {{with the introduction}} of agriculture to Norway. Available evidence indicates that wood was the most used building material for these structures. Iron Age dwellings typically combined shelter for animals and humans in long houses <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> heat. Remains of structures from the Stone Age through the Bronze Age and the Iron Age have been excavated at Forsand in Ryfylke, near Stavanger and several other locations. Most prehistoric long houses had pairs of roof-bearing posts dividing the interior into three naves, and walls of palisades, wattle and daub or turf. Similar buildings have been excavated all over Northwestern Europe.|$|E

In this approach we consider DCE-MRI series as multivariate images. A full multivariate segmentation method based on dimensionality reduction, noise filtering, supervised classification and stochastic watershed is explained and tested on several data sets. The two main key-points introduced in this paper are noise reduction preserving contours and spatio temporal segmentation by stochastic watershed. Noise reduction is performed in a special way that selects factorial axes of Factor Correspondence Analysis <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserves</b> contours. Then a spatio-temporal approach based on stochastic watershed is used to segment tumours. The results obtained are {{in accordance with the}} diagnosis of the medical doctors...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer Stadium had fallen below the standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball in 1990. At the time, team president Larry Schmittou tried to convince the city to approve a new ballpark, but was unsuccessful. Throughout the 2000s, the team continued in its attempts to gather approval and financing for a new ballpark to replace Greer. At one point, a new stadium, First Tennessee Field, was planned for construction {{on the west bank}} of the Cumberland River in downtown. Disagreements over who would pay for the ballpark repeatedly pushed back opening day at the stadium, and eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project altogether. In the meantime, numerous upgrades and repairs, including over $2.5million worth of improvements from 2008 to 2009, were made to Greer <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> its functionality until a new stadium could be built.

The United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand also deployed forces to Thailand {{in response to this}} perceived threat, though Malaysia and several other SEATO members chose not to be involved. On 28May, Minister for Defence Athol Townley announced that Australia's contribution would be an RAAF squadron equipped with Sabre fighters. The eight aircraft, along with their pilots and ground crew, were drawn from No.77 Squadron, which formed part of Australia's Commonwealth Strategic Reserve forces at RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> Malaysia's neutrality, the Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore.

5|$|James de Connick {{established}} the first breed {{standard for the}} French Spaniel in 1891. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we now have. The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier {{as the president of the}} association.

5|$|Lindwall {{played as}} a right-arm opening fast bowler and {{right-handed}} batsman {{in the lower}} middle-order. Along with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed Australia's first-choice pace duo, {{regarded as one of}} the best of all time, and Bradman typically used them in short and sharp bursts against the home batsmen with the new ball. The pair were used to target England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton during the major matches, and subdued Hutton for much of the summer. England had agreed to make a new ball available after every 55 overs, more often than the usual regulations at the time, thereby allowing the pair more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace. Bradman gave the duo lighter workloads in the tour matches <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> their energy for the new ball battles against England’s key batsmen in the Tests. Lindwall was a capable lower-order batsman who made two Test centuries during his career, and he featured in several rearguard actions that boosted Australia's scores during the tour.|$|E

It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese.
