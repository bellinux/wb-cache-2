40|$|Our seismic study {{together}} with the MT analysis reveal a “R-shape” flow existing in both the lower crust and uppermost mantle, which suggests the crustal deformation along the deep, large sutures (such as the Longmen Shan fault and the Anninghe Fault) under the southeastern Tibetan Plateau is maintained by dynamic pressure from the regional flow intermingled with the hot upwelling asthenosphere. The material in the lower crust and uppermost mantle flowing outward {{from the center of}} the plateau is buttressed by the old, strong lithosphere that underlies the Sichuan basin, pushing up on the crust above and maintaining steep orogenic belt through dynamic pressure. We therefore consider that the “R-shape” regional flow played a key role in the crustal deformation along the deep suture zones of the Bangong-Nujiang, the Longmen-Shan faults, and other local <b>heavily</b> <b>faulted</b> <b>zones</b> beneath the southeastern Tibetan Plateau...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> {{study was to examine}} the relationship between internal <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> properties and seismic images, using detailed laboratory analysis and modeled seismic responses. Three classic <b>fault</b> <b>zones,</b> the San Andreas, Brevard and Outer Hebrides Thrust, where studied, representing a diverse range of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> geometries, rocks, and seismic images. Laboratory analyses of the rock samples collected to represent the <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> and their surrounding geology, included: petrographic descriptions, whole rock chemical analyses, measurement of compressional and shear wave velocities, densities, seismic anisotropies, and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratios. ^ The individual <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> studies each provided important interpretations of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> structures and properties. The study of the San Andreas fault in Southern California lead to an interpretation of crustal composition and structure surrounding the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> by correlating measured seismic properties with seismic field data. Detailed analysis of the shear wave properties in the Brevard <b>fault</b> <b>zone,</b> North Carolina, illustrated the ability of shear wave studies to enhance traditional compressional wave interpretation of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> composition and structure. Measuring the seismic properties of rocks representing a brittle-ductile transition in a <b>fault</b> <b>zone,</b> the Outer Hebrides Thrust, provided a critical link between the properties observed in brittle and ductile faults. ^ Combining the individual <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> results produced additional conclusions regarding <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> properties and seismic imaging. First, the diverse geologic setting surrounding <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> generate a wide range of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> rocks, compositions and seismic properties. Second, seismic properties in a <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> are directly related to mineral composition, where seismic velocities increase with a progressive change from quartz and feldspars to amphiboles and pyroxenes. Third, determining shear wave images and properties enhance our understanding of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> structure and highlight possible regions of high pore pressure. Fourth, seismic anisotropy affects seismic imaging in various ways, such as enhancing reflectivity or complicating crustal velocity structure. Thus, anisotropy must be carefully considered when interpreting seismic images. Finally, the complexities of the brittle-ductile transition in <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> make it difficult to correlate deformation and seismic properties. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In outcrops, a fault often {{appears to}} be a {{geologic}} body with some volume which is called as a <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> In the geologic modeling, a fault is often characterized as a surface which cannot characterize the inner structures of the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> and the physical differences led by different clast fillings in the <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> So, a new method of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> modeling was applied in Weizhou oilfield, the proposed method was as follows: First, the two boundaries of a <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> were characterized as two surfaces, and the distance between the two surfaces was decided by the extent of the <b>fault</b> <b>zone,</b> and the area between the two boundary surfaces was the <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> Second, <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> could be divided into several parts which would characterize its inner structures and properties.

40|$|Often, the {{structure}} of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> cutting poorly lithified sediment examined in outcrop indicate such <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> should behave as hydraulic barriers, but hydrological observations indicate they behave as conduit-barriers. This thesis investigates the hydrogeological structure of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> cutting poorly lithified sediment {{to better understand the}} observed conduit-barrier behaviour. The macro- and micro-structure of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> was investigated at outcrops of five fault arrays cutting syn-rift sediment of the rapidly extending Gulf of Corinth rift, Central Greece. <b>Fault</b> <b>zone</b> evolution was interpreted from these observations and changes to sediment hydraulic characteristics in <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> estimated. Based upon the field data, characteristic <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> hydrogeological structure was represented in two-dimensional numerical fluid-flow models in order to assess likely hydraulic impacts. <b>Fault</b> <b>zone</b> structure is found to be dominated by a mixed zone and differs to those previously reported. Two models of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> evolution are proposed for faults cutting: 1. Only poorly lithified sediment, in which beds are rotated and smeared in the mixed zone, where these can mix at the grain-scale through distributed, controlled particulate flow. 2. Sediment of contrasting competency, with mixed zones comprising blocks and lenses, and fine-grained smears in which strain localisation and fault-tip bifurcation are central to their evolution. Both models apply to <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> that juxtapose fine and coarse-grained sediment. Numerical models show that the majority of these <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> will behave as barriers to fluid-flow due to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity. <b>Fault</b> <b>zones</b> of all sizes influence fluid-flow, but hydraulic impact increases with fault throw. Conduit-barrier behaviour can be explained by anisotropies, particularly from slip-surface cataclasites, in <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> cutting poorly lithified sediment only. Fault hydraulic behaviour is strongly dependent on structural hetereogeneities and their geometry in the <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> The cumulative effects of these faults will be significant for subsurface fluid-flow...|$|R

40|$|Using dynamic {{modeling}} of earthquake rupture on a strike-slip fault and seismic wave propagation in a three dimensional inhomogeneous elastoplastic medium, I investigate the inelastic response of compliant <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> to nearby earthquakes. I primarily examine the plastic strain distribution within the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> and the displacement field {{that characterizes the}} effects of the presence of the <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> I find that when the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> rocks are close to failure in the prestress field, plastic strain occurs along the entire <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> near the Earth?s surface and some portions of the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> in the extensional quadrant at depth, while the remaining portion deforms elastically. Plastic strain enhances the surface displacement of the <b>fault</b> <b>zone,</b> and the enhancement in the extensional quadrant is stronger than that in the compressive quadrant. These findings suggest that taking into account both elastic and inelastic deformation of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> to nearby earthquakes may improve our estimations of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> structure and properties from small-scale surface deformation signals. Furthermore, identifying the inelastic response of nearby <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> to large earthquakes may allow us to place some constraints on the absolute stress level in the crust. I also investigate how to distinguish inelastic and elastic responses of compliant <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> to the nearby rupture. I explore in detail the range of plastic parameters that allow plastic strain to occur and examine its effect on the displacement field around compliant <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> I find that the sympathetic motion (i. e., consistent to long-term geologic slip) or the reduced retrograde motion (i. e., opposite to long-term geologic slip) observed in residual displacement on fault parallel horizontal direction can be directly used to distinguish the inelastic deformation from the elastic deformation. This may help better interpret the geodetic observations in the further. In addition, I conduct models with various <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> geometries (i. e., depth, width and shape) and rigidity reduction properties to test their effects on the displacement field. The results from elastic models suggest that to the same dynamic rupture source, the deeper and wider pre-existing nearby <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> will result in larger residual displacement. But this only applies to <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> with large depth extent. For shallow <b>fault</b> <b>zones,</b> residual displacement tends to keep the same magnitude or even decreases with <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> width.

For a strike-slip source, the synthetic seismograms show that the wavefield is more affected by the velocity structure than by the degree of anisotropy, which makes it difficult to estimate the anisotropic (shearwave splitting) parameters.

This study is one of the rst examples where high resolution numerical simulations in two and three dimensions have been applied to hydrothermal systems in order to preserve geological detail in the models explicitly. Two prime examples in Iceland for seismicity-induced uid ow and groundwater ow during volcanic eruptions, respectively, have been selected for this purpose. The rst example is the Tjörnes Fracture <b>Zone,</b> a <b>heavily</b> <b>faulted</b> transform <b>zone</b> o shore in North Iceland where most of the Icelandic earthquakes occur. The work demonstrated that a moderate permeability contrast between the shallow sedimentary basins and deep crustal basement causes two distinct uid ow regimes which are only connected during a seismic event. When such an event occurs, faults in the Tjörnes Fracture Zone in ate and connect the two uid ow systems, causing hot uids migrating from the basement into the basins at extreme ow rates. This explains key geochemical observations made in the Tjörnes Fracture Zone before and after a seismic event. The second study investigated the 1874 to 1875 volcano-tectonic episode at the Askja volcano, which is the third largest silicic eruption since settlement in Iceland. Here it was demonstrated how syn-eruptive groundwater ow inside the Askja caldera changed the eruptive style of the March 1875 eruption, causing a well-documented change from a wet to dry eruptive style. The results of this work provide some fundamental {{new insights into the}} transient dynamics of uid ow in active high temperature hydrothermal systems and suggest that these kind of simulations may be used to complement studies assessing the risk and hazard of future volcanic eruptions and seismic events...|$|R

The Honaz <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone</b> is about 2 km wide and 13.5 km long, E-W trending and graben-facing step-like normal <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> It consists of four parallel north dipping major fault segments and five synthetic fault segments (Koçyiğit, 2005). Koçyiğit (2005) indicates that the major segment of the Honaz <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone</b> is an oblique-slip normal fault dipping an average of 56 °NE, with a minor dextral strike-slip component. The Honaz <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone</b> is seismically active and generated the 1703 earthquake during the historical period (before 1900 AD) (Ergin et al., 1967; Soysal et al., 1981; Ambraseys and Finkel, 1995).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{performed}} in situ multidisciplinary analyses {{of two different}} <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> in carbonate formations. One is a seismically active <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> several kilometers long (the Roccasseira Fault Zone); {{the other is a}} small <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> a few hundred meters long (the GAS <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone).</b> The smaller, "immature" <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> displays a discontinuous damage zone, because tectonic deformations have been accommodated differently according to the initial properties of the host rock. The larger, "mature" <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> displays a continuous damage zone caused by the presence of secondary fault cores embedded in a heavily fractured area inside the damage zone. These markedly different fault-zone architectures were reflected in two hydraulic and geomechanical fault models, both generated from a coupled fluid-flow and geomechanical simulator, to examine the impact of hydromechanical property distribution on fault stability when the faults are reactivated by CO 2 injection. In the smaller <b>fault</b> <b>zone,</b> marked differences in hydromechanical properties (Young's modulus and permeability) favor fluid accumulation, inducing high pressurization in parts of the damage zone, potentially resulting in small seismic events. On the other hand in the mature <b>fault</b> <b>zone,</b> fluid flows more easily and thus fluid-induced earthquakes may not readily occur, because the fault-zone pressurization is much lower, insufficient for triggering a seismic event...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{internal}} structure and petrophysical property distribution of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> are commonly exceedingly complex {{compared to the}} surrounding host rock from which they are derived. This in turn produces highly complex fluid flow patterns which affect petroleum migration and trapping as well as reservoir behavior during production and injection. Detailed rendering and forecasting of fluid flow inside <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> require high-resolution, explicit models of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> structure and properties. A fundamental requirement for achieving this {{is the ability to}} create volumetric grids in which modeling of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> structures and properties can be performed. Answering this need, a method for generating volumetric <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> grids which can be seamlessly integrated into existing standard reservoir modeling tools is presented. The algorithm has been tested {{on a wide range of}} fault configurations of varying complexity, providing flexible modeling grids which in turn can be populated with <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> structures and properties...|$|R

The Gemini <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> is a 9. 3 -km-long, left-lateral fault {{system that was}} active at depths of 8 – 11 km within the transpressive Late-Cretaceous Sierran magmatic arc. The <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> cuts four granitic plutons and is composed of three steeply dipping northeast- and southwest-striking noncoplanar segments that nucleated and grew along preexisting cooling joints. The fault core is bounded by subparallel fault planes that separate highly fractured epidote-, chlorite-, and quartz-breccias from undeformed protolith. The slip profile along the Gemini <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> shows that the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> consists of three 2 – 3 -km-long segments separated by two ‘zones’ of local slip minima. Slip is highest (131 m) on the western third of the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> and tapers to zero at the eastern termination. Slip vectors plunge shallowly west-southwest and show significant variability along strike and across segment boundaries. Four types of microstructures reflect compositional changes in protolith along strike and show that deformation was concentrated on narrow slip surfaces at, or below, greenschist facies conditions. Taken together, we interpret the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> to be a segmented, linked <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> in which geometrical complexities of the faults and compositional variations of protolith and fault rock resulted in nonuniform slip orientations, complex fault-segment interactions, and asymmetric slip-distance profiles...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{characteristics}} of fault rocks distributed within major <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> provide basic information {{in understanding the}} physical aspects of faulting. Mesoscopic structural observations of the drilled cores from Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project Hole-A are reported in this article to describe and reveal the distribution of fault rocks within the Chelungpu Fault System. The Chelungpu Fault System in Hole-A was encountered {{at a depth of}} between 1050 - 1250 m where deformation structures increased. Three major <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> structures were found at approximate depths of 1111, 1153, and 1221 m. The presence of wide fault rock regions were mostly concentrated in these 3 <b>fault</b> <b>zones.</b> The <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> at 1111 m mainly consists of a nearly brecciated fracture zone and a clayey <b>fault</b> gouge <b>zone</b> of about 1. 05 m in thickness. Fault rocks from the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> at 1153 m are characterized by the presence of sand grains in the matrix content, consisting of a 1. 1 -m thick <b>fault</b> breccia <b>zone</b> and a 0. 35 -m thick <b>fault</b> gouge <b>zone.</b> The <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> at 1221 m consists of fault breccia and fault gouge of 1. 15 m in total thickness. These are relatively harder and darker in color than the previous 2 <b>fault</b> <b>zones.</b> Each of the 3 <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> contains a few layers of dark colored rocks of approximately 5 - 80 mm in thickness within the fault breccia and <b>fault</b> gouge <b>zones.</b> These dark colored rocks were found distinctively within the fault rocks. However, there relation to the process of faulting is not clearly understood and shall be discussed in detail with the aid of microscopic observations...|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} apparent that faults are typically not discrete planes but zones of deformed rock with a complex internal structure and three-dimensional geometry. In {{the last decade}} {{this has led to}} renewed interest in the consequences of this complexity for modelling the impact of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> on fluid flow and mechanical behaviour of the Earth's crust. A number of processes operate during the development of <b>fault</b> <b>zones,</b> both internally and in the surrounding host rock, which may encourage or inhibit continuing <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> growth. The complexity of the evolution of a faulted system requires changes in the rheological properties of both the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> and the surrounding host rock volume, both of which impact on how the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> evolves with increasing displacement. Models of the permeability structure of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> emphasize the presence of two types of fault rock components: fractured conduits parallel to the fault and granular core zone barriers to flow. New data presented in this paper on porosity–permeability relationships of fault rocks during laboratory deformation tests support recently advancing concepts which have extended these models to show that poro-mechanical approaches (e. g., critical state soil mechanics, fracture dilatancy) may be applied to predict the fluid flow behaviour of complex <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> during the active life of the fault. Predicting the three-dimensional heterogeneity of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> internal structure is important in the hydrocarbon industry for evaluating the retention capacity of faults in exploration contexts and the hydraulic behaviour in production contexts. Across-fault reservoir juxtaposition or non-juxtaposition, a key property in predicting retention or across-fault leakage, is strongly controlled by the three-dimensional complexity of the <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> Although algorithms such as shale gouge ratio greatly help predict capillary threshold pressures, quantification of the statistical variation in <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> composition will allow estimations of uncertainty in fault retention capacity and hence prospect reserve estimations. Permeability structure in the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> is an important issue because bulk fluid flow rates through or along a <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> are dependent on permeability variations, anisotropy and tortuosity of flow paths. A possible way forward is to compare numerical flow models using statistical variations of permeability in a complex <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> in a given sandstone/shale context with field-scale estimates of <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> permeability. <b>Fault</b> <b>zone</b> internal structure is equally important in understanding the seismogenic behaviour of faults. Both geometric and compositional complexities can control the nucleation, propagation and arrest of earthquakes. The presence and complex distribution of different <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> materials of contrasting velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening properties {{is an important factor in}} controlling earthquake nucleation and whether a fault slips seismogenically or creeps steadily, as illustrated by recent studies of the San Andreas Fault. A synthesis of laboratory experiments presented in this paper shows that <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> materials which become stronger with increasing slip rate, typically then get weaker as slip rate continues to increase to seismogenic slip rates. Thus the probability that a nucleating rupture can propagate sufficiently to generate a large earthquake depends upon its success in propagating fast enough through these materials in order to give them the required velocity kick. This propagation success is hence controlled by the relative and absolute size distributions of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening rocks within the <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> Statistical characterisation of the distribution of such contrasting properties within complex <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> may allow for better predictive models of rupture propagation in the future and provide an additional approach to earthquake size forecasting and early warnings...|$|R
