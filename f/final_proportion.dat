Metallurgists wishing to produce brass thus used calamine (actually a mixture of the virtually indistinguishable zinc ores smithsonite and hemimorphite) as the zinc component of brass. The resulting brasses, produced by heating a mixture of copper and calamine to a high temperature for several hours (allowing zinc vapor to distill from the ores and permeate the metallic copper), contained a significant amount of slag material resulting from the non-zinc components of calamine. The use of ore rather than metallic zinc also made it difficult to accurately produce the desired <b>final</b> <b>proportion</b> of copper to zinc. This process is known as cementation.|$|E

Our diffusion {{model can be}} viewed as a variant of a cellular automaton growth process: assume that each node can be in one of the two possible states, inactive or active. The parameters of the model are two given functions θ: N → N and α: N → [0, 1].

Presence of the active vertices triggers a percolation process: if a node v is active, it remains active forever. And if it is inactive, it will become active when at least θ(dv) of its neighbors are active. In the case where α(d) = α and θ(d) = θ, for each d ∈ N, our diffusion model is equivalent to what is called bootstrap percolation.

Traditional models consider that the rumor is propagated by pairwise interactions between spreaders and ignorants. Spreaders can become stiflers only after contacting spreaders or stiflers. Here we propose a model that considers the traditional assumptions, but stiflers are active and try to scotch the rumor to the spreaders. An analytical treatment based on the theory of convergence of density dependent Markov chains is developed to analyze how the <b>final</b> <b>proportion</b> of ignorants behaves asymptotically in a finite homogeneously mixing population. We perform Monte Carlo simulations in random graphs and scale-free networks and verify that the results obtained for homogeneously mixing populations can be approximated for random graphs, but are not suitable for scale-free networks. Furthermore, regarding the process on a heterogeneous mixing population, we obtain a set of differential equations that describes the time evolution of the probability that an individual is in each state. Our model {{can be applied to}} study systems in which informed agents try to stop the rumor propagation. In addition, our results can be considered to develop optimal information dissemination strategies and approaches to control rumor propagation. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{phenomenon}} of the evolution of cooperation in networks, where each player in networks plays an iterated game against its neighbours. An iterated game in a network is a multiple round game, where, in each round, a player gains payoff by playing a game with its neighbours and updates its action by using the actions and/or payoffs of its neighbours. The interaction model between the players is usually represented as a two-player, two-action (i. e., cooperation and defection) Prisoner 2 ̆ 7 s Dilemma game. Currently, many researchers developed strategies for the evolution of cooperation in structured networks in order to enhance cooperation, i. e., to increase the proportion of cooperators. However, experimental results, reported in current literature, demonstrated that each of these strategies has advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, a self-organisation based strategy is proposed for the evolution of cooperation in networks, which can utilise the strengths of current strategies and avoid the limitations of current strategies. The proposed strategy is empirically evaluated and its good performance is exhibited. Moreover, we also theoretically find that, in static networks, the <b>final</b> <b>proportion</b> of cooperators evolved by any pure (or deterministic) strategies fluctuates cyclically irrespective of the initial proportion of cooperators...|$|E

40|$|Six surveys for protein-energy {{malnutrition}} {{were carried out}} in sequence in Bas-Zaire beginning {{at the end of}} 1978 at the estimated height of the famine and continuing throughout the recovery period. Utilizing a stratified multi-stage sampling technique, over 1000 children aged 6 months to 6 years were measured anthropometrically and examined for {{the presence or absence of}} bilateral pedal oedema in each survey. The proportions of children who were less than 80 % of the reference median weight-for-height and who had oedema decreased, respectively, from 12. 8 % and 14. 4 % initially to 2. 1 % and 1. 8 % in the <b>final</b> survey. The <b>proportion</b> of oedematous children who were found to be not less than 80 % of the reference median weight-for-height was high, varying from 71. 7 ± 7. 0 % to 94. 4 ± 10. 6 %. The importance of these findings for the interpretation of anthropometric data from nutritional surveys in developing countries is discussed...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} the early rehabilitation of remnant pulmonary artery in unilateral absent intrapericardial pulmonary artery and the factors affecting pulmonary artery growth. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records and imaging modalities of 15 patients with unilateral absent intrapericardial pulmonary artery (7 left and 8 right; median age at diagnosis, 5 months) from 1991 to 2008. ResultsThe remnant pulmonary artery was found in 12 patients (mean diameter, 2. 6  ± 0. 7 mm) at the hilum. Eleven patients underwent operation (main pulmonary artery flap angioplasty in 5 patients; tube graft interposition in 6 patients), and 4 patients were inoperable. Transcatheter balloon angioplasty or stent implantation was required for the remaining pulmonary artery stenosis in 6 patients (55 %). The last ipsilateral lung perfusion proportion at lung perfusion scan was 39 % (range, 15 %– 51 %), and the Z value of the last ipsilateral pulmonary artery diameter was − 0. 5 (range, − 4. 2 to 2). The patients with a smaller initial remnant pulmonary artery required more interventions (P = . 003). The <b>final</b> perfusion <b>proportion</b> of affected lung was higher in the patients treated early (≤ 6 months, n =  7) than in those treated late (> 6 months, n =  4) (41. 9 % ± 8. 5 % vs 24. 9 % ± 10. 7 %, respectively, P = . 024). The patients with graft interposition showed a lower perfusion proportion of affected lung than those with main pulmonary artery flap angioplasty (P = . 017). ConclusionsIn patients with unilateral absent intrapericardial pulmonary artery, early and aggressive management of combined surgical reconstruction and transcatheter intervention improved pulmonary artery growth and lung perfusion...|$|R
