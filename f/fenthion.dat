50|$|Despite short {{half-life}} in the environment, <b>fenthion</b> toxicity {{is highly}} significant to birds and estuarine/marine invertebrates. Even though {{some parts of}} the world use <b>fenthion</b> to control pest birds, such as weaver bird, many non-targeted wild birds are victim of <b>fenthion</b> poisoning. Acute symptoms of <b>fenthion</b> poisoning in birds include tearing of the eyes, foamy salivation, lack of movement, tremors, congestion of the windpipe, lack of coordination in walking, and an abnormally rapid rate of breathing or difficult breathing. <b>Fenthion</b> has been found toxic to fishes and other aquatic invertebrates. Bees are also found to be greatly affected by <b>fenthion</b> contamination.|$|E
50|$|Some common {{trade names}} for <b>fenthion</b> are Avigel, Avigrease, Entex, Baytex, Baycid, Dalf, DMPT, Mercaptophos, Prentox, <b>Fenthion</b> 4E, Queletox, and Lebaycid. <b>Fenthion</b> is {{available}} in dust, emulsifiable concentrate, granular, liquid concentrate, spray concentrate, ULV, and wettable powder formulations.|$|E
50|$|Amid {{concerns}} of harmful effects on environment, especially birds, Food and Drug Administration no longer approves uses of <b>fenthion.</b> However, <b>fenthion</b> {{has been extensively}} used in Florida to control adult mosquitoes. After preliminary risk assessments on human health and environment in 1998 and its revision in 1999, USEPA issued an Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision (IRED) for <b>fenthion</b> in January 2001. The EPA has classified <b>fenthion</b> as Restricted Use Pesticide (RUP), and warrants special handling because of its toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fenthion</b> {{exposure}} to general population is quite limited {{based on its}} bioavailability. Common form of <b>fenthion</b> exposure is occupation related, and occurs through dermal contact or inhalation of dust and sprays. Another likely means of contamination is through ingestion of food, especially, if it has been applied quite recently with <b>fenthion.</b> So far, ingestion {{is the most likely}} severe poisoning case on humans and animals. To avoid this, crops applied with <b>fenthion</b> should be allowed enough degradation time before harvesting. Normally, two to four weeks time is enough depending upon the type of crop.|$|E
50|$|In soil, <b>fenthion</b> {{degradation}} {{ranges from}} {{four to six weeks}} and it occurs through photodegradation as well as anaerobic or non-photolytic organisms. However, soil particles strongly adsorb <b>fenthion</b> that makes it less susceptible to percolate with water through the soil.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{its high}} {{toxicity}} on birds, <b>fenthion</b> {{has been used}} to control weaver birds and other pest-birds {{in many parts of the}} world. <b>Fenthion</b> is also used in cattle, swine, and dogs to control lice, fleas, ticks, flies, and other external parasites.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{effect of}} <b>fenthion</b> {{has not been}} reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fenthion</b> is an organothiophosphate insecticide, avicide, and acaricide. Like {{most other}} organophosphates, its {{mode of action}} is via cholinesterase inhibition. Due to its {{relatively}} low toxicity towards humans and mammals, <b>fenthion</b> is listed as moderately toxic compound in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and World Health Organization toxicity class.|$|E
50|$|Photodegradation and {{biodegradation}} {{are common}} mechanisms of <b>fenthion</b> degradation in the environment. In the atmosphere, vapor phase <b>fenthion</b> reacts rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, and its half-life is about 5 hours. In soil and water, photodegradation is again predominant mechanism {{if there is}} enough presence of sunlight. Under normal aquatic environment, half-life of <b>fenthion</b> in water is 2.9 to 21.1 days. It may be photodynamically, chemically or biologically degraded. The degradation mechanisms can be hydrolysis, oxidation, and/or alkylation-dealkylation, which are dependent {{on the presence of}} light, temperature, alkali, or enzymatic activity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fenthion</b> {{was used}} in India for more than 30 years as a {{larvicide}} for control of mosquito larvae. The compound was on the review list of Central Insecticide Board in India {{and they decided to}} ban the product due to high toxicity for usage. The product cannot be manufactured in India after January 2017. The government of India has released the Gazzetta notification with that effect of banning many toxic insecticides such as <b>fenthion</b> and DDVP.|$|E
50|$|A {{study found}} that the entomopathogenic fungus, Cephalosporium lecanii, was highly {{effective}} in controlling coffee green scale. A study examined the effect of the fungus on coffee green scale in combination with lower than normal applications of either of two insecticides, <b>fenthion</b> and phosphamidon. The use of <b>fenthion</b> resulted in the highest percentage mortality of the scales at the lowest dosages of insecticide. The results from the use of phosamidon were inconclusive, with the results differing in the laboratory and the field.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{poisoning}} of <b>fenthion</b> {{results in}} miosis (pinpoint pupils), headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, muscle weakness, drowsiness, lethargy, agitation, or anxiety. If the poisoning is moderate or severe, {{it results in}} chest tightness, breathing difficulty, hypertension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, heavy salivation, profuse sweating, or fasciculation.|$|E
50|$|Because the louse {{have neither}} {{free-living}} stages nor vectors for infection of H. suis, control is difficult when using insecticides and quarantines. Sows {{can be treated}} with avermectin, a common therapy treating arthropods and nematodes, prior to farrowing to keep lice from moving to younger hogs. Pesticides such as amitraz, coumaphos, and <b>fenthion</b> {{can be used in}} hay bedding for prevention.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fenthion</b> is {{a contact}} and stomach {{insecticide}} used against many biting insects. It is particularly effective against fruit flies, leaf hoppers, cereal bugs, stem borers, mosquitoes, animal parasites, mites, aphids, codling moths, and weaver birds. It {{has been widely}} used in sugar cane, rice, field corn, beets, pome and stone fruit, citrus fruits, pistachio, cotton, olives, coffee, cocoa, vegetables, and vines.|$|E
50|$|The fly {{has been}} the subject of {{extensive}} control regimes including a Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone where it is forbidden to take fruit, and post-harvest dipping of fruit in dimethoate and <b>fenthion.</b> As of October 2011, the use of these chemicals was under review by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), with dimethoate suspended from use. In May 2012, January 2013 and February 2015 the fly was found in Auckland, posing a risk to horticulture and leading to a quarantine.|$|E
50|$|Deltamethrin plays {{key role}} in {{controlling}} malaria vectors, and {{is used in the}} manufacture of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets. It is used as one of a battery of pyrethroid insecticides in control of malarial vectors, particularly Anopheles gambiae, and whilst being the most employed pyrethroid insecticide, can be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, permethrin, cypermethrin and organophosphate-based insecticides, such as malathion and <b>fenthion.</b> Resistance to deltamethrin (and its counterparts) is now extremely widespread and threatens the success of worldwide vector control programmes.|$|E
50|$|The {{governments of}} Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe have made {{regularly}} attempts to manage quelea populations. The most common method to control raiding swarms was by spraying the organophosphate avicide <b>fenthion</b> {{from the air}} on breeding colonies and roosts. In Botswana and Zimbabwe, spraying was also executed from vehicles and manually. Kenya and South Africa regularly used fire-bombs. Attempts during the 1950s and '60s to eradicate populations, at least regionally, failed. Consequently, management is at present directed at removing those congregations {{that are likely to}} attack vulnerable fields.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{controlling}} using {{hand picking}} and pheromone traps are used. Cultural practices like crop rotation mechanisms, reducing water levels {{are also used}} in controlling. Natural enemies such as parasitoides are very effective and nature loving controlling measures. Techinid fly Sturmiopsis inferens also once used, but now non-effective due to their low abundance. In chemical control, BHC, DDT, <b>fenthion,</b> fenitrothion, quinalphos, phosphamidon sprays and granules of lindane are used. Eggs can eliminate by introducing Trichogramma minutum and Telenomeus species. Apanteles flavipes, Bracon chinensis and Sturmiopsis inferens are effective against caterpillars, whereas Xanthopinpla species and Tetrastichus aygari are used in pupal stages.|$|E
40|$|After {{treatment}} lipophilic pesticides tend {{to diffuse}} by penetrating the epicuticular wax of fruits. In this way, solar radiation only acts on pesticide molecules after {{passing through the}} waxes. The effect of epicuticular waxes of three fruits (orange, nectarine, and olive) on the photodegradation of <b>fenthion</b> was studied. The waxes affected the photodegradation process of <b>fenthion.</b> The decay rate of <b>fenthion</b> increased {{in the presence of}} orange and nectarine waxes, while it decreased when olive wax was used. In all waxes, the transformation of <b>fenthion</b> produced mainly <b>fenthion</b> sulfoxide and low amounts of <b>fenthion</b> sulfone. In orange wax, 50 % of the initial <b>fenthion</b> was transformed into unknown compounds. In nectarine wax, <b>fenthion</b> was degraded stoichiometrically into <b>fenthion</b> sulfoxide and <b>fenthion</b> sulfone. In olive wax, the photodegradation of <b>fenthion</b> yielded about 80 % of <b>fenthion</b> sulfoxide...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} and metabolism of <b>fenthion</b> in orange fruit were studied in field conditions. The <b>fenthion</b> was transformed to <b>fenthion</b> sulfoxide and <b>fenthion</b> sulfone. Sunlight photodegradation experiments showed that this transformation {{is due to}} the action of sunlight. Residues were found only in the fruit peel. <b>Fenthion</b> showed a rapid degradation rate with a half-life of ca. 6 days. <b>Fenthion</b> sulfoxide was degraded more slowly with a half-life of ca. 14 days and represented the major residue. <b>Fenthion</b> sulfone was Present in low quantities...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the endocrine-disrupting {{actions of the}} organophosphorus pesticide <b>fenthion</b> and related compounds {{and the influence of}} metabolic transformation on the activities of these compounds. <b>Fenthion</b> acted as an antagonist of the androgenic activity of dihydrotestosterone (10 – 7 M) in the concentration range of 10 – 6 – 10 – 4 M in an androgen-responsive element–luciferase reporterresponsive assay using NIH 3 T 3 cells. The antiandrogenic activity of <b>fenthion</b> was similar in magnitude to that of flutamide. <b>Fenthion</b> also tested positive in the Hershberger assay using castrated male rats. Marked estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of <b>fenthion</b> and related compounds were not observed in MCF- 7 cells. When <b>fenthion</b> was incubated with rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH, the antiandrogenic activity markedly decreased, and <b>fenthion</b> sulfoxide was detected as a major metabolite. The oxidase activity toward <b>fenthion</b> was exhibited by cytochrome P 450 and flavincontaining monooxygenase. <b>Fenthion</b> sulfoxide was negative in the screening test for antiandrogens, as was <b>fenthion</b> sulfone. However, when <b>fenthion</b> sulfoxide was incubated with liver cytosol in the presence of 2 -hydroxypyrimidine, an electron donor of aldehyde oxidase, the extract of the incubation mixture exhibited antiandrogenic activity. In this case, <b>fenthion</b> was detected as a major metabolite of the sulfoxide. Metabolic interconversion between <b>fenthion</b> and <b>fenthion</b> sulfoxide in the body seems to maintain the antiandrogenic activity.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the dose-related effects of <b>fenthion</b> on the liver and kidney and the correlation between severity of organ damage and serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzyme levels. Materials and Methods: Ninety rats were randomly subdivided into control group and 4 study groups. Control group was administered 1 ml of saline intraperitoneally. Study groups received 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg of <b>fenthion,</b> intraperitoneally. Blood samples and renal and hepatic tissues were collected 24 h after dosing and survival was monitored for 7 days. Results: Mortality was observed in 2 rats receiving 75 mg/kg <b>fenthion</b> and in 3 rats receiving 100 mg/kg <b>fenthion</b> within 2 days of the experiment. There was a correlation between the <b>fenthion</b> dosage and increase in the blood levels of liver enzyme, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Plasma BChE enzyme levels in rats receiving 75 and 100 mg/kg <b>fenthion</b> were statistically lower compared to rats receiving 25 - 50 mg/kg <b>fenthion</b> at 24 h. Histopathologic examination of the liver and kidney indicated a significant injury only in rats receiving 100 mg/kg <b>fenthion.</b> Conclusion: The organophosphate <b>fenthion,</b> particularly at high dosage, has a toxic effect on the liver and kidney and its toxicity is correlated with BChE enzyme levels...|$|E
40|$|Two field {{experiments}} were carried out-with three and five treatments, respectively-to study the persistence and metabolism of <b>fenthion</b> in olives. <b>Fenthion</b> showed a low degradation rate, with a half-life of ca. 38 days.

Besides the active ingredient, five metabolites were detected in olives; among these, <b>fenthion</b> sulfoxide and fenoxon sulfoxide were quantitatively the most important. Olives were also processed into oil, and the partitioning of <b>fenthion</b> among oil, cake, and vegetation water was evaluated. <b>Fenthion</b> residues in oil were ca. 3 times higher than in olives, while its metabolites showed analogous residues in olives and oil or were totally absent...|$|E
40|$|EPA has {{assessed}} {{the risks of}} <b>fenthion</b> and reached an Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision (IRED) for this organophosphate (OP) pesticide.

40|$|<b>Fenthion</b> was metabolised by the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium {{in liquid}} culture {{when applied to}} the limit of its {{solubility}} in aqueous media (7. 2 µM). Using GC-NPD, no evidence for either adsorption to or accumulation in intra-cellular compartments was obtained and after 5 days culture, less than 1 % of <b>fenthion</b> remained in the extra-cellular medium. <b>Fenthion</b> did not inhibit spore germination at the concentrations sup-plied, but appeared to inhibit the rate of spread of the fungus on solid media. <b>Fenthion</b> was oxidised by lignin peroxidase (LiP), but enzyme turnover was dependent on the con-centration of H 2 O 2 supplied, with inhibition accompanying {{the formation of the}} inactive intermediate Compound III at an H 2 O 2 concentration equal to the km of LiP for H 2 O 2 (c. 0. 4 mM).

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{photodegradation}} {{extent of the}} organophosphorus pesticides, <b>fenthion</b> and disulfoton in the envi-ronment, degradation rates of their chemicals under irradiation by visible light and each region of the ultraviolet (UV) sources, UVA (320 – 400 nm radiation), UVB (280 – 320 nm radiation) and UVC (250 – 260 nm radiation) in liquid- and solid-phases were determined and their photolysis products identified. Although visible light did not cause photodegradation of either <b>fenthion</b> or disulfoton even after the maximal irradiation of 8 hr in both phases, all the ranges of UV sources resulted in the photolysis of both pesticides, despite the solid-phase. The photolysis rates of <b>fenthion</b> under UVB and UVC irradiation in both phases were higher than that under UVA irradiation and also exceeded all of the degradation rates of disulfoton. This confirms that <b>fenthion</b> is more readily degraded than disul-foton in the UVB range. <b>Fenthion</b> sulfoxide and disulfoton sulfoxide were identified as oxidative photolysis prod-ucts whose photolysis rates were considerably slower than parent compounds, and the oxidation reaction of both pesticides in the liquid-phase was superior to those on the solid-phase, indicating that dissolved oxygen in water {{is an important factor}} affecting the photolysis. These results suggest that <b>fenthion</b> in the environment is more rapidly degraded by UVB irradiation in natural sunlight than disulfoton, and sulfoxides of both pesticides remain stable as a photolysis product in the environment.

40|$|International audienceA {{combination}} of molecular modelling and {{a screening of}} the library of non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) was used to identify acrylamide as a functional monomer with high affinity towards <b>fenthion,</b> organophosphate insecticide, which is frequently used {{in the treatment of}} olives. A good correlation was found between the screening tests and modelling of monomer–template interactions performed using a computational approach. Acrylamide-based molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and non-imprinted polymer (NIP) were thermally synthesised in dimethyl formamide (porogen) using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a cross-linker and 1, 1 -azo-bis (isobutyronitrile) as an initiator. The chemical and physical properties of the prepared polymers were characterised. The binding of <b>fenthion</b> by the polymers was studied using solvents with different polarities. The developed MIP showed a high selectivity towards <b>fenthion,</b> compared to other organophosphates (dimethoate, methidathion malalthion), and allowed extraction of <b>fenthion</b> from olive oil samples with a recovery rate of about 96 %.
