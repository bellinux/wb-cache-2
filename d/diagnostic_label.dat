2500|$|Developmental {{screening}} {{during a}} routine check-up by a general practitioner or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation. This {{will require a}} comprehensive team evaluation to either confirm or exclude a diagnosis of AS. This team usually includes a psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, speech and language pathologist, occupational therapist and other professionals with expertise in diagnosing children with AS. [...] Observation occurs across multiple settings; the social disability in AS may be more evident during periods when social expectations are unclear and children are free of adult direction. A comprehensive evaluation includes neurological and genetic assessment, with in-depth cognitive and language testing to establish IQ and evaluate psychomotor function, verbal and nonverbal strengths and weaknesses, style of learning, and skills for independent living. An assessment of communication strengths and weaknesses includes the evaluation of nonverbal forms of communication (gaze and gestures); the use of non-literal language (metaphor, irony, absurdities and humor); patterns of speech inflection, stress and volume; pragmatics (turn-taking and sensitivity to verbal cues); and the content, clarity and coherence of conversation. [...] Testing may include an audiological referral to exclude hearing impairment. The determination of {{whether there is a}} family history of autism spectrum conditions is important. [...] A medical practitioner will diagnose {{on the basis of the}} test results and the person's developmental history and current symptoms. Because multiple domains of functioning are involved, a multidisciplinary team approach is critical; an accurate assessment of the individual's strengths and weaknesses is more useful than a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>label.</b> Delayed or mistaken diagnosis is a serious problem that can be traumatic for individuals and families; diagnosis based solely on a neurological, speech and language, or educational attainment may yield only a partial diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Next {{to other}} GP characteristics, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>labelling</b> (the {{proportion}} of acute respiratory tract (RT) episodes to be labelled as infections) probably {{contributes to a}} higher volume of antibiotic prescriptions for acute RT episodes. However, it is unknown {{whether there is an}} independent association between <b>diagnostic</b> <b>labelling</b> and the volume of prescribed antibiotics, or whether <b>diagnostic</b> <b>labelling</b> is associated with the number of presented acute RT episodes and consequently with the number of antibiotics prescribed per patient per year. Methods Data were used from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP- 2) with 163 GPs from 85 Dutch practices, serving a population of 359, 625 patients. Data over a 12 month period were analysed by means of multiple linear regression analysis. Main outcome measure was the volume of antibiotic prescriptions for acute RT episodes per 1, 000 patients. Results The incidence was 236. 9 acute RT episodes/ 1, 000 patients. GPs labelled about 70 % of acute RT episodes as infections, and antibiotics were prescribed in 41 % of all acute RT episodes. A higher incidence of acute RT episodes (beta 0. 67), a stronger inclination to label episodes as infections (beta 0. 24), a stronger endorsement of the need of antibiotics in case of white spots in the throat (beta 0. 11) and being male (beta 0. 11) were independent determinants of the prescribed volume of antibiotics for acute RT episodes, whereas <b>diagnostic</b> <b>labelling</b> was not correlated with the incidence of acute RT episodes. Conclusion <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>labelling</b> is a relevant factor in GPs' antibiotic prescribing independent from the incidence of acute RT episodes. Therefore, quality assurance programs and postgraduate courses should emphasise to use evidence based prognostic criteria (e. g. chronic respiratory co-morbidity and old age) as an indication to prescribe antibiotics in stead of single inflammation signs or <b>diagnostic</b> <b>labels.</b> </p...|$|R

In service of this aim, a social constructionist epistemology was adopted and discourse analysis was used to analyse the results from three participants’ interview data.

40|$|The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>labels</b> used to characterise common airway {{diseases}} {{have always}} been a problem.

Conversely, the term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) implies largely irreversible airflow obstruction, yet clinicians may attempt to confirm the presence of reversibility, and having done so, label the disease as having an “asthmatic” component.

Consequently, the developers of DSM-5 created a new <b>diagnostic</b> <b>label,</b> DMDD, to describe children with persistent irritability and angry outbursts.

Method: The academic literature was searched, via PsycINFO and MEDLINE, to identify peer-reviewed studies addressing whether public espousal of a biogenetic paradigm has increased over time, and whether biogenetic causal beliefs and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>labelling</b> are associated with less negative attitudes. Results: The public, internationally, continues to prefer psychosocial to biogenetic explanations and treatments for schizophrenia.

40|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that adults show negative biases towards children labelled with a mental health disorder. However, {{the extent to which}} this label leads to negative biases over and above the presence of the disorder symptoms is relatively unknown. The aim of this research is to investigate whether there is an effect of labelling bias that parents in the community direct towards children with depression. Parents were chosen as target participants as they have the most contact and influence over the social lives of their own children, and hence their attitudes may influence the lives of children diagnosed with a mental health disorder. This research compared the levels of stigma (defined as stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination; Corrigan, 2000) in response to three vignettes describing primary-school-aged children. One vignette displayed the symptoms of depression alone, one included symptoms as well as a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>label</b> of major depressive disorder, and a third depicted normal childhood behaviours. The results suggested that the presence of the symptoms of depression led to a significant increase in stigma. The results also suggest that, over and above the effect of the symptoms, the presence of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>label</b> was related to a significant increase in stigma. The effects of labelling bias on causal attributions for childhood depression were also examined. The results suggested that the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>label</b> was associated with an increase in the endorsement of genetics as a cause for childhood depression. Conversely, the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>label</b> was associated with a significant decrease in the endorsement of environmental attributions.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{assumption}} in our medicalized society that <b>diagnostic</b> <b>labels</b> simply describe facts, rather than express the diagnostician's own concepts of anomaly and dysfunction. Variability among physicians in diagnosing reactive hypoglycemia illustrates some fundamental problems of reifying the concept of disease. Although most physicians consider the same three variables in this diagnosis, their interpretations of them may vary widely. The disagreement centers around the credibility given standardized, technological measures versus the individual patient's experiences. Most physicians consider lab tests definitive in diagnosing hypoglycemia, while bypassing patients' subjective reports. Some, however, rely more heavily on patient-generated criteria to diagnose the condition. This lack of agreement about the criteria for diagnosing hypoglycemia, coupled with the psychological nature {{of many of the}} symptoms, make hypoglycemia and psychological disorder reasonable alternative diagnoses.
