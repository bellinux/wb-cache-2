5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, {{and the power of the}} State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E
5|$|With Protestant {{reinforcements}} {{arriving from}} neighbouring counties, the Queen Regent retreated to Dunbar. By now, the mob fury had spilled over central Scotland. Her own troops {{were on the}} verge of mutiny. On 30 June, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation occupied Edinburgh, though they were able to hold it for only a month. But even before their arrival, the mob had already sacked the churches and the friaries. On 1 July, Knox preached from the pulpit of St Giles', the most influential in the capital. The Lords of the Congregation negotiated their withdrawal from Edinburgh by the Articles of Leith signed 25 July 1559, and Mary of Guise promised <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Franklin {{participated in}} an {{organized}} campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was {{to be part of}} an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.|$|E

5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of Russia proper the {{situation}} was similar.

25|$|Vladimir Lukin {{noted in}} 2005, that {{citizens}} of Russia rarely experience violation of <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> (guaranteed by the article 28 of the Constitution).

They {{combined}} the democratic form of government that had been developed by the Separatist Congregationalists in Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers) with unlimited <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> Like Martin Luther, Hooker argued that as faith in Jesus Christ was the free gift of the Holy Spirit it could not be forced on a person.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms {{received}} royal assent. Section 2 of {{the charter}} guaranteeing <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> and freedom of religion trumped Section 167 of the Public Schools Act (1872). Sixteen years later in 1996, based on precedent that would be established in Ontario (1989), required recitation of the Lord’s Prayer as outlined in the Public Schools Act would be held to violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2010–11 Tunisian Revolution, a Constituent Assembly {{worked for}} 2.5 years to {{written a new}} Constitution, {{approved}} in January 2014, contained a provision in Article 6 granting <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> It also stipulates that 'ccusations of apostasy and incitement to violence are prohibited'. With it, Tunisia became the first Arab-majority country to protect its citizens from prosecution for renouncing Islam. Critics have pointed out alleged flaws of this formulation, namely that it violates the freedom of expression.|$|E

50|$|Rawls derives two {{principles}} of justice {{from the original}} position. The first {{of these is the}} Liberty Principle, which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens.
