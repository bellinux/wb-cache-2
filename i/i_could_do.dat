5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E

25|$|As the President of India, I {{had lots}} of {{experiences}} that were full of pain and helplessness. There were occasions when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing for people and for the nation. These experiences have pained me a lot. They have depressed me a lot. I have agonised because {{of the limitations of}} power. Power and the helplessness surrounding it are a peculiar tragedy, in fact.|$|E

25|$|It {{became a}} burden. Some {{people say it}} helped me invent {{the kind of music}} I play, but I don’t know whether it did. It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn to live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it, and I did.|$|E
25|$|After playing all 16 games {{during the}} 1998 and 1999 seasons, {{he spent the}} 2000 season out of {{football}} after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, “If I didn’t think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this anymore, I wouldn't be here".|$|E

25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to}} the twenty-six or twenty-seven {{minutes the}} program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E

The best <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would be to describe it like this— they plowed a dirt road, flew over it with a helicopter, and then just dropped a bunch of rocks out of the helicopter!

South African stage actor Vosloo understood the approach that Sommers was going for in his screenplay, but only agreed {{to take on the}} role of Imhotep [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it absolutely straight.

Asked if her pregnancy affected her role, Berry replied, [...] "I wasn't in as much as I was meant to be. My ever-growing belly was posing a constant challenge! What <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was getting more limited so the role that I play is so different from what it could have been, due to my surprise pregnancy". According to Kinberg, Berry had another scene in the film that was cut because of Berry's limited schedule.|$|E
