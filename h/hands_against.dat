5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E
25|$|In the bible, David {{refuses to}} harm King Saul, {{because he is}} the Lord's anointed, even when Saul is seeking his life. And when Saul {{eventually}} is killed in battle and a person comes to David to tell him that he helped kill Saul, David puts the man to death, even though Saul had been his enemy, because he had raised his <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> the Lord's anointed. Christian concepts of the inviolability of the person of the monarch have great influence from this story. Diarmait mac Cerbaill, King of Tara (mentioned above), was killed by Áed Dub mac Suibni in 565. According to Adomnan of Iona's Life of St Columba, Áed Dub mac Suibni received God's punishment for this crime by being impaled by a treacherous spear many years later and then falling from his ship into a lake and drowning.|$|E
25|$|Gloves {{protect and}} comfort <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> cold or heat, damage by friction, {{abrasion}} or chemicals, and disease; or {{in turn to}} provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch. Latex, nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence. In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.|$|E

25|$|In the 5th century, {{control of}} Valentia {{passed from the}} Romans to the Alans and other barbarians: in 413, the Goths under Ataulf besieged and {{captured}} {{the brother of the}} usurper Jovinus, Sebastianus, at Valentia on behalf of the emperor Honorius. In 440, Alans led by Sambida were given deserted lands in Valentia by the Romans. Three years later, Aetius settled the Burgundians in the region, which became part of their kingdom until 534. The city then fell successively under the power of the Franks, the Arabs of Spain, the sovereigns of Arles, the emperors of Germany, the counts of Valentinois, the counts of Toulouse, as well as its own bishops, who struggled to retain the control of the city they had won in the fifth century. These bishops were often in conflict with the citizens and the counts of Valentinois and to strengthen their <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> the latter the pope in 1275 united their bishopric with that of Die.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

He expressed his concern that disappointed followers of Trump will [...] "end up joining fascist or far-right groups" [...] and take {{matters into their own}} <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> the eight million Muslims in the United States".|$|E

2500|$|According to many Christians, {{the coming}} of Muhammad was foretold in the Holy Bible. According to the monk Bede this is in Genesis 16:12, which {{describes}} Ishmael as [...] "a wild man" [...] whose [...] "hand will be against every man". Bede says about Muhammad: [...] "Now how great is his hand against all and all <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> him; as they impose his authority upon the whole length of Africa and hold both {{the greater part of}} Asia and some of Europe, hating and opposing all." ...|$|E

It was the cause of controversy after Middlesbrough's consequent appeal was deemed as [...] "frivolous" [...] by The Football Association (FA) and extended by one more game, with the club's chairman and chief executive, and Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, deeming this unfair and criticising The FA, contrasting it with a recent appeal by Chelsea's Michael Essien.|$|E
2500|$|Each of Mickey's hands {{has only}} three fingers and a thumb. Disney {{said that this}} was both an artistic and {{financial}} decision, explaining [...] "Artistically five digits are too many for a mouse. His hand would look like a bunch of bananas. Financially, not having an extra finger in each of 45,000 drawings that make up a six and one-half minute short has saved the Studio millions." [...] In the film The Opry House (1929), Mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> his black body. The use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters, particularly with later Disney characters, but also with non-Disney characters such as Bugs Bunny, Woody Woodpecker, Mighty Mouse, and Mario.|$|E

Recollecting his friend in an interview, Bellow said [...] "Allan inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air...People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled.

2500|$|Onstage, Big Black {{presented}} an intense spectacle {{to match their}} music. Albini would set off a brick of firecrackers onstage before the band played, a tradition he carried on from their earliest performances through their dissolution and revived for their 2006 reunion set, and would count in most songs by yelling [...] "One, two, fuck you!" [...] While playing, the band members would slam their <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> their steel guitar strings so hard that they would draw blood, often needing to put adhesive bandages on their fingers. Albini used a specially-made hip-slung guitar strap worn around his waist like a belt, and would [...] "prowl the stage like a spindly gunslinger", according to Azerrad. Gerard Cosloy recalls that [...] "It looked like someone had plugged Steve into the amp [...] he was pretty scary to watch onstage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Israeli {{historian}} Benny Morris {{reviewed the}} Tantura controversy. He suggests that, while controversy remains {{as to whether}} a ‘massacre’ actually occurred, {{there is no doubt}} that war crimes were committed by the Jewish forces (Haganah) and that the village was forcibly cleansed of its Arab inhabitants. Morris underlines the fact that in interviews conducted by himself and by the whistle-blower Amil Gilat, all refugees confirmed that a massacre had taken place, while all IDF veterans denied it. Regarding the latter, Morris describes what he calls “troubling hints”, such as a diary by an Alexandroni soldier, Tulik Makovsky, in which he wrote “… that our boys know the craft of murder quite well, especially boys whose relatives the Arabs had murdered... or those harmed by Hitler [...] They took their private revenge, and avenged our comrades who had died at their <b>hands,</b> <b>against</b> the snipers”. Morris defended the value of oral testimony and tradition. He additionally pointed out issues with the scoring of the second version of Katz’s thesis in that the two referees who gave anomalously low scores had been co-authors of an IDF book in which it was argued that ”… the Israeli Army had carried out only a ‘partial expulsion’ of the populations of the Arab towns of Lydda and Ramlah and dismissed the charge that the troops had massacred Lydda townspeople, some of them inside a mosque, on July 12, 1948”, whereas IDF records from the IDF archive show that a full-scale expulsion had been carried out and that Yiftah Brigade troops killed some 250 townspeople.|$|E
