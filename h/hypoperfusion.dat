25|$|In {{patients}} with KLS, MRI and CT scans show normal brain morphology. When SPECT is performed, <b>hypoperfusion</b> {{can often be}} observed in the brain, particularly in the thalamic and frontotemporal areas. The <b>hypoperfusion</b> is significantly diminished between episodes. Serum biology, c-reactive proteins and leptins, the hormonal pituitary axis, and protein in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) are normal in KLS patients.|$|E
25|$|Class III Hemorrhage {{involves}} loss of 30-40% of {{circulating blood}} volume. The patient's blood pressure drops, {{the heart rate}} increases, peripheral <b>hypoperfusion</b> (shock), such as capillary refill worsens, and the mental status worsens. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and blood transfusion are usually necessary.|$|E
25|$|Neuroimaging {{has been}} used to {{investigate}} ORS. Hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT) demonstrated <b>hypoperfusion</b> of the frontotemporal lobe in one case. That is to say, part of the brain was receiving insufficient blood flow. In another, functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out while the person with ORS listened to both neutral words and emotive words. Compared to an age and sex matched healthy control subject under the same conditions, the individual with ORS showed more activation areas in the brain when listening to emotionally loaded words. This difference was described as abnormal, but less pronounced as would be observed in the brain of a person with a psychotic disorder.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} is a {{cause of}} cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from {{the apex of the}} heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body - because of this, it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing, which to the layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, but it is in fact a sign of <b>hypoperfusion</b> of the brainstem.|$|E
25|$|Kleine–Levin {{syndrome}} (KLS), {{also known}} as Sleeping Beauty syndrome, is a rare sleep disorder characterized by persistent episodic hypersomnia and cognitive or mood changes. Many patients also experience hyperphagia, hypersexuality and other symptoms. Patients generally experience recurrent episodes of the condition {{for more than a}} decade and may return at a later age. Individual episodes generally last more than a week. Some times lasting for months. The condition greatly affects the personal, professional, and social lives of sufferers. The severity of symptoms and the course of the syndrome vary between sufferers. Patients commonly have about 20 episodes over about a decade. Several months generally elapse between episodes. The onset of the condition usually follows a viral infection; several different viruses have been observed to trigger KLS. It is generally only diagnosed after similar conditions have been excluded; MRI, CT scans, lumbar puncture, and toxicology tests are used to rule out other possibilities. The syndrome's mechanism is not known, but the thalamus is thought to possibly play a role. Tomography has shown <b>hypoperfusion</b> in the brains of patients during episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Cerebral <b>hypoperfusion</b> is the {{reduction}} of blood flow to {{all parts of the}} brain. The reduction could be to a particular part of the brain depending on the cause. It is most commonly due to heart failure from cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, or from reduced cardiac output as a result of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or bleeding. Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the <b>hypoperfusion.</b> Because {{the reduction}} in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially vulnerable [...] "watershed" [...] areas - border zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A watershed stroke refers to the condition when the blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur.|$|E
2500|$|Neuropathies {{tend to be}} {{associated}} with late-onset celiac disease. Dementia and ataxia appear to be more common. A recent study of children with neuropathies revealed no increase of CD in early-onset neuropathies. Although many studies link CD to various neuropathies such as migraine, encephalopathy, chorea, brain stem dysfunction, myelopathy, mononeuritis multiplex, Guillain–Barré-like syndrome, and antiganglioside-positive neuropathy with antibodies, strong associations remain largely unconfirmed in epidemiologic studies. A recent study looking for changes in the physiology of the brain found regional cerebral <b>hypoperfusion</b> in 73% of untreated CD. [...] The calcification of channels at the surface of the brain appears to be a leading phenomenon associated with migraine, visual, auditory, schizophrenia, epilepsy, dementia. The problem is that while these are found increased in GSE, the cause of these calcifications is unclear and this may extend beyond GSE to other immunological or allergic phenomena.|$|E
50|$|Overperfuson and underperfusion {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>hypoperfusion</b> and hyperperfusion, which relate to the perfusion level relative to a tissue's current need to meet its metabolic needs. For example, <b>hypoperfusion</b> can be caused when an artery or arteriole that supplies blood to a volume of tissue becomes blocked by an embolus, causing either no blood or at least not enough blood to reach the tissue. Hyperperfusion can be caused by inflammation, producing hyperemia of a body part. Malperfusion, also called poor perfusion, is any type of incorrect perfusion—but most often <b>hypoperfusion,</b> in most uses of the word. There is no official/formal dividing line between <b>hypoperfusion</b> and ischemia; sometimes the latter term refers to zero perfusion, but often it refers to any <b>hypoperfusion</b> that is bad enough to cause necrosis.|$|E
50|$|Cardiogenic shock {{is defined}} by {{sustained}} low blood pressure with tissue <b>hypoperfusion</b> despite adequate left ventricular filling pressure. Signs of tissue <b>hypoperfusion</b> include low urine production (<30 mL/hour), cool extremities, and altered level of consciousness.|$|E

5000|$|The broad term, [...] "stroke" [...] can {{be divided}} into three categories: brain ischemia, subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} and intracerebral hemorrhage. Brain ischemia can be further subdivided, by cause, into thrombotic, embolic, and <b>hypoperfusion.</b> [...] Thrombotic and embolic are generally focal or multifocal in nature while <b>hypoperfusion</b> affects the brain globally.|$|E

5000|$|Severe sepsis {{is defined}} as sepsis with sepsis-induced organ {{dysfunction}} or tissue <b>hypoperfusion</b> (manifesting as hypotension, elevated lactate, or decreased urine output).|$|E
50|$|Erroneously low {{readings}} may {{be caused}} by <b>hypoperfusion</b> of the extremity being used for monitoring (often due to a limb being cold, or from vasoconstriction secondary to the use of vasopressor agents); incorrect sensor application; highly calloused skin; or movement (such as shivering), especially during <b>hypoperfusion.</b> To ensure accuracy, the sensor should return a steady pulse and/or pulse waveform. Pulse oximetry technologies differ in their abilities to provide accurate data during conditions of motion and low perfusion.|$|E

50|$|A common {{assumption}} is that the ratio is elevated because of amino acid digestion, since blood, (excluding water) consists largely of the protein hemoglobin, is broken down by digestive enzymes of the upper GI tract into amino acids, which are then reabsorbed in the GI tract and broken down into urea. However, elevated BUN:Cr ratios are not observed when other high protein loads (e.g., steak) are consumed. Renal <b>hypoperfusion</b> secondary to the blood lost from the GI bleed has been postulated to explain the elevated BUN:Cr ratio. However, other {{research has found that}} renal <b>hypoperfusion</b> cannot fully explain the elevation.|$|E
50|$|The {{neurological}} complications per {{central nervous}} system lesions are increasingly reported. The neurological complications found are meningoencephalitis, subdural effusion, cerebral <b>hypoperfusion,</b> cerebral ischemia and infarct, cerebellar infarction, manifesting with seizures, chorea, hemiplegia, mental confusion, lethargy and coma, or even a cerebral infarction with no neurological manifestations. Other neurological complications from cranial nerve involvement are reported as ataxia, facial palsy, and sensorineural hearing loss. Behavioral changes {{are thought to be}} caused by localised cerebral <b>hypoperfusion,</b> can include attention deficits, learning deficits, emotional disorders (emotional lability, fear of night, and night terrors), and internalization problems (anxious, depressive or aggressive behavior).|$|E
50|$|Hemothorax can put {{pressure}} on the lung and force it to collapse. It also can cause shock, a state of <b>hypoperfusion</b> in which an insufficient amount of blood is able to reach the organs.|$|E
50|$|SPECT {{studies of}} {{individuals}} diagnosed with CBD involve perfusion analysis throughout {{the parts of}} the brain. SPECT evaluation through perfusion observation consists of monitoring blood release into different locations in tissue or organ regions, which, in the case of CBD, pertains to localized areas within the brain. Tissue can be characterized as experiencing overperfusion, underperfusion, <b>hypoperfusion,</b> or hyperperfusion. Overperfusion and underperfusion relate to a comparison with the overall perfusion levels within the entire body, whereas <b>hypoperfusion</b> and hyperperfusion are calculated in comparison to the blood flow requirements of the tissue in question. In general, the measurements taken for CBD using SPECT are referred to as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).|$|E
