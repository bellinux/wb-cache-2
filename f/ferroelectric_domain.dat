2500|$|The {{ferroelectric}} memristor {{is based}} on a thin ferroelectric barrier sandwiched between two metallic electrodes. Switching the polarization of the ferroelectric material by applying a positive or negative voltage across the junction can lead to a two order of magnitude resistance variation: [...] (an effect called Tunnel Electro-Resistance). In general, the polarization does not switch abruptly. The reversal occurs gradually through the nucleation and growth of ferroelectric domains with opposite polarization. During this process, the resistance is neither RON or ROFF, but in between. When the voltage is cycled, the <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>domain</b> configuration evolves, allowing a fine tuning of the resistance value. The ferroelectric memristor's main advantages are that <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>domain</b> dynamics can be tuned, offering a way to engineer the memristor response, and that the resistance variations are due to purely electronic phenomena, aiding device reliability, as no deep change to the material structure is involved.|$|E
