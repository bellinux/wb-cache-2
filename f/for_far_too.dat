Prior to the elections Nitiwul had {{announced that he}} would win {{due to the fact that}} his opponent was not a native of the constituency and was not abreast with what was happening in the constituency; he also cited the numerous developmental projects he had undertaken. His opponent opined that Nitiwul had served <b>for</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> long and believed the constituents needed a new face.|$|E
25|$|In May, 2010, the new Coalition {{government}} {{said that the}} 'Labour's 13-year war on the motorist is over' and that the new government 'pledged to scrap public funding for speed cameras' In July Mike Penning, the Road safety minister reduced the Road Safety Grant for the current year to Local Authorities from £95 million to £57 million, saying that local authorities had relied too heavily on safety cameras <b>for</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> long {{and that he was}} pleased that some councils were now focusing on other road safety measures. It is estimated that as a result the Treasury is now distributing £40 million less in Road Safety Grant than is raised from fines in the year. Dorset and Essex announced plans to review camera provision with a view to possibly ending the scheme in their counties, however Dorset strongly affirmed its support for the scheme, albeit reducing financial contributions in line with the reduction in government grant. Seven counties also announced plans to turn off some or all of their cameras, amidst warnings from the country's most senior traffic policeman that this would result in an increase in deaths and injuries. Gloucestershire cancelled plans to update cameras and has reduced or cancelled maintenance contracts.|$|E

He felt {{that several of the}} tracks went on <b>for</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> long without any change, and that the music did not fit the game due to Square not providing feedback to Arai about how the tracks were to be used.

The witnesses for the case, who included ten police officers and two civilians, were bound over. Senior Puisne Judge Gloria Smith stated that no further adjournments of the case would be permitted, ordering the Director of Public Prosecutions to make full disclosure to the defence, and insisting that the trial must start on May 19.

500|$|Knowing Marlborough's destination, Tallard and Villeroi met at Landau in the Palatinate on 13 June {{to rapidly}} {{construct}} {{a plan to}} save Bavaria but the rigidity of the French command system was such that any variations from the original plan had to be sanctioned by Versailles.

[...] Approval from Louis arrived on 27 June: Tallard was to reinforce Marsin and the Elector on the Danube via the Black Forest, with 40 battalions and 50 squadrons; Villeroi was to pin down the Allies defending the Lines of Stollhofen, or, if the Allies should move all their forces to the Danube, he was to join with Marshal Tallard; and General de Coignies with 8,000 men, would protect Alsace. On 1 July Tallard's army of 35,000 re-crossed the Rhine at Kehl and began its march.|$|E
500|$|West {{has been}} an outspoken and {{controversial}} celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents. On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC (A Concert for Hurricane Relief), he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of, and the federal response to, black hurricane victims. He criticized President George W. Bush for not [...] "car about black people". Bush stated {{in an interview that}} the comment was [...] "one of the most disgusting moments" [...] of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with Matt Lauer for the Today show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize.

[...] Eric Harvey of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.5 out of 10 and wrote [...] "Reznor's unique capacity to commingle raging industrial bangers with ballads and ambient instrumental passages appears in its best form since The Downward Spiral, and here gains much of the focus and restraint that many remember used to be his calling card." [...] Daphne Carr of LA Weekly said, [...] "Musically, it's his most adventurous work since The Fragile, and his business model is inspired—if unsustainable."

Club wrote: [...] "Lee really can sing, and the opener 'What You Want' shows she has the pipes (and even the submerged spunk) to become the new Pat Benatar this generation desperately needs." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the song five out of five stars praising the hook as one of the best in the band's career adding that it managed to make the song [...] "instantly unforgettable".

We gathered evidence at massacre sites—wooden clubs covered in dried blood, rubber strips from bicycle tires used to tie up the victims, and freshly dug graves—and spoke to hundreds {{of boys and girls}} forced to fight for his army or held captive as sex slaves. And we’re elated that #stopKony is a trending topic on Twitter—if anyone deserves global notoriety it’s Kony." [...] She added: [...] "Arresting Kony and other senior LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice. It will also help end the scourge {{of one of the most}} brutal rebel groups in Africa." [...] HRW's LRA researcher Ida Sawyer reaffirmed, [...] "we definitely support the message of the film and we think it's great that they're bringing so much attention to the film with Kony's crimes and the phenomena of the LRA." [...] Amnesty International, which had documented what it described as the LRA's [...] "horrific impact on the lives of thousands of civilians in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Uganda" [...] and for years had been calling for the LRA leaders to be arrested, welcomed the massive public response to the Kony 2012 campaign. Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: [...] "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest <b>for</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," [...] but added: [...] "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights", especially because [...] "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.|$|E

500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on <b>for</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
