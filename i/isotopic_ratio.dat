25|$|Isotope ratio mass {{spectrometry}} {{can be used}} to detect addition of corn syrup and cane sugar by the carbon isotopic signature. Addition of sugars originating from corn or sugar cane (C4 plants, unlike the plants used by bees, and also sugar beet, which are predominantly C3 plants) skews the <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratio</b> of sugars present in honey, but does not influence the <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratio</b> of proteins. In an unadulterated honey, the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match. Levels as low as 7% of addition can be detected.|$|E

The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with lithium metal in a small specialized research furnace to form lithium carbide (also known as lithium acetylide).

25|$|Anomalies in {{chromium}} <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> {{found within}} the K-T boundary layer strongly support the impact theory. Chromium <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> are homogeneous within the earth, and therefore these isotopic anomalies exclude a volcanic origin, which has also been proposed as a cause for the iridium enrichment. Further, the chromium <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> measured in the K-T boundary {{are similar to the}} chromium <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> found in carbonaceous chondrites. Thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a carbonaceous asteroid, but also a comet is possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to carbonaceous chondrites.|$|R

The contribution of successive generations of stars to the metal enrichment of the Universe is imprinted {{on the evolution of}} <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> over time. We investigate the <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur through millimeter molecular absorption lines arising in the z = 0. 68 absorber toward the blazar B 0218 + 357. We find that these ratios differ from those observed in the Galactic interstellar medium, but are remarkably close to those in the only other source at intermediate redshift for which <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> have been measured to date, the z = 0. 89 absorber in front of PKS 1830 - 211. The <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> in these two absorbers should reflect enrichment mostly from massive stars, and they are indeed close to the values observed toward local starburst galaxies.

50|$|Various {{isotopes}} of lead {{can be used}} {{to study}} circulation on a global scale. Different oceans (i.e. the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, etc.) have different isotopic signatures. This results from differences in <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> of sediments and rocks within the different oceans. Because the different isotopes of lead have half-lives of 50-200 years, there is not enough time for the <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> to be homogenized throughout the whole ocean. Therefore, precise analysis of Pb <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratios</b> {{can be used to}} study the circulation of the different oceans.|$|R
25|$|Tentative {{constraints}} are available, {{with the}} current loss mostly due to low gravity and solar wind aided by photolysis. The loss of Titan's early atmosphere can be estimated with the 14N–15N <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratio,</b> because the lighter 14N is preferentially lost from the upper atmosphere under photolysis and heating. Because Titan's original 14N–15N ratio is poorly constrained, the early atmosphere may have had more N2 by factors ranging from 1.5 to 100 with certainty only in the lower factor. Because N2 is the primary component (98%) of Titan's atmosphere, the <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratio</b> suggests {{that much of the}} atmosphere has been lost over geologic time. Nevertheless, atmospheric pressure on its surface remains nearly 1.5 times that of Earth as it began with a proportionally greater volatile budget than Earth or Mars. It is possible that most of the atmospheric loss was within 50million years of accretion, from a highly energetic escape of light atoms carrying away {{a large portion of the}} atmosphere (hydrodynamic blow off event). Such an event could be driven by heating and photolysis effects of the early Sun's higher output of X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) photons.|$|E

2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in analytical instruments enable direct measurement of natural abundance D/H ratios in organic molecules. The new instruments {{have the same}} framework as any conventional gas source IRMS, but incorporate new features such as larger magnetic sector, double focusing sectors, quadrupole mass filter and multi-collectors. Two commercial examples are the Nu Panorama and the Thermo Scientific 253 Ultra. These instruments generally have good sensitivity and precision. Using only tens of nanomoles of methane, the Ultra can achieve a stable high precision of around 0.1‰ error in δD. One of the first examples {{of this type of}} measurement has been the clumped isotopes of methane.(See section of [...] "natural gas" [...] in Fossil fuels) Another strength of this kind of instruments is the capability of doing site-specific <b>isotopic</b> <b>ratio</b> measurements.
