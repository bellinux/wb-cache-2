Juvenile fulvous whistling <b>ducks</b> are very like young lesser whistling <b>ducks,</b> but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb <b>ducks</b> are bulkier than whistling <b>ducks</b> and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling <b>ducks</b> are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E

5|$|Aylesbury <b>ducks,</b> meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the <b>ducks</b> were {{more susceptible to}} disease.

Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin <b>ducks</b> with the pure Aylesbury strain.

5|$|Stock <b>ducks</b> {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock <b>ducks</b> were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their <b>ducks</b> with markings on the neck or head. The stock <b>ducks</b> would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat).

Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after {{the close of the}} game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen <b>ducks,</b> whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay eggs from early February and take six months to grow large enough to eat. As a consequence, Aylesbury <b>ducks</b> were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen <b>ducks</b> in the autumn and winter.|$|E

5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition <b>ducks</b> from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, {{and they would}} be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the <b>ducks</b> a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the <b>ducks</b> with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger <b>ducks,</b> with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ducks</b> are {{medium-sized}} aquatic {{birds with}} broad bills, {{eyes on the}} side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as <b>ducks)</b> and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic <b>ducks</b> are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic <b>ducks</b> are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. They keep their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.|$|E

5|$|Mallard {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Almost all domestic duck breeds derive from the mallard, {{with the exception of}} a few Muscovy breeds. Mallards are generally monogamous while domestic <b>ducks</b> are mostly polygamous. Domestic <b>ducks</b> have no territorial behaviour and are less aggressive than mallards. Domestic <b>ducks</b> are mostly kept for meat, as their eggs have a strong flavor. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. It is also common for mallards to mate with domestic <b>ducks</b> and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile.
