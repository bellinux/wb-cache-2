40|$|As <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> supply from {{tropical}} forests is declining due to deforestation and forest degradation, much effort {{is essential to}} sustain <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> supply from tropical forested landscapes, because {{tropical forests}} provide the largest flow of multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> among the terrestrial ecosystems. In order to sustain multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> understanding <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> capacity across heterogeneous forest types and identifying certain <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> that could be managed to leverage positive effects across the wider bundle of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> are required. We sampled three forest types, tropical rainforests, sclerophyll forests, and rehabilitated plantation forests, over an area of 32, 000 m 2 from Wet Tropics bioregion, Australia, aiming to compare supply and evaluate interactions and patterns of eight <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> (global climate regulation, air quality regulation, erosion regulation, nutrient regulation, cyclone protection, habitat provision, energy provision, and timber provision). On average, multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> were highest in the rainforests, lowest in sclerophyll forests, and intermediate in rehabilitated plantation forests. However, a wide variation was apparent among the plots across the three forest types. Global climate regulation service had a synergistic impact on the supply of multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> while nutrient regulation service {{was found to have}} a trade-off impact. Considering multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> most of the rehabilitated plantation forest plots shared the same ordination space with rainforest plots in the ordination analysis, indicating that rehabilitated plantation forests may supply certain <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> nearly equivalent to rainforests. Two synergy groups and one trade-off group were identified. Apart from conserving rainforests and sclerophyll forests, our findings suggest two additional integrated pathways to sustain the supply of multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> from a heterogeneous tropical forest landscape: (i) rehabilitation of degraded forests aiming to provide global climate regulation and habitat provision <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> and (ii) management intervention to sustain global climate regulation and habitat provision <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{aiming to}} halt global {{biodiversity}} loss, {{it is essential}} to address underlying societal processes. The concept of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> claims to bridge between biodiversity and society.

This article is a critical reflection on the current research of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> supply and demand. We argue that there is a functional relation between the supply and demand for <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> with the two influencing each other.

Despite these known benefits, there is still limited understanding on how shade trees affect the provision of multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> {{at the same time}} and the potential trade-offs or synergies among them. To fill this knowledge gap, we quantified four major <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> (regulation of pests and diseases; provisioning of agroforestry products; maintenance of soil fertility; and carbon sequestration) in 69 coffee agroecosystems belonging to smallholder farmers under a range of altitudes (as representative of environmental conditions) and management conditions, in the region of Turrialba, Costa Rica. We first analyzed the individual effects of altitude, types of shade and management intensity and their interactions on the provision of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services.</b> In order to identify potential trade-offs and synergies, we then analyzed bivariate relationships between different <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> and between individual <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> and plant biodiversity. We also explored which types of shade provided better levels of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services.</b> The effectiveness of different types of shade in providing <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> depended on their interactions with altitude and coffee management, with different <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> responding differently to these factors. No trade-offs were found among the different <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> studied or between <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> and biodiversity, suggesting that it is possible to increase the provision of multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> at the same time. Overall, both low and highly diversified coffee agroforestry systems had better ability to provide <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> than coffee monocultures in full sun. Based on our findings, we suggest that coffee agroforestry systems should be designed with diversified, productive shade canopies and managed with a medium intensity of cropping practices, with the aim of ensuring the continued provision of multiple <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> is {{increasingly}} {{being used by}} scientists and policy makers.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify in three European mountain regions the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> of grassland that different stakeholders identify (which <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> for whom), the relative rankings of these <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> and how stakeholders perceive the provision of these <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> to be related to agricultural activities. We found differences: (1) between farmers’ perceptions of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> across regions and (2) within regions, between knowledge of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> gained by regional experts through education and farmers’ local field-based knowledge. Nevertheless, we identified a common set of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> that were considered important by stakeholders across the three regions, including soil stability, water quantity and quality, forage quality, conservation of botanical diversity, aesthetics and recreation (for regional experts), and forage quantity and aesthetic (for local farmers). We observed two contrasting stakeholder representations of the effects of agricultural management on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> delivery, one negative and the other positive (considering low to medium management intensity). These representations were determined by stakeholders’ perceptions of the relationships between soil fertility and biodiversity.

40|$|<b>Ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> are the <b>ecosystems</b> {{direct and}} {{indirect}} contributions of ecosystems to human well-being. ” In order to reach the generation target and the environmental objectives {{it is important to}} increase the awareness of biodiversity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> and it’s importance to human welfare and simultaneously highlighting the value of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services.</b> The value of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> should be integrated into economic standpoints, political considerations and other decisions in the society. In today’s society there is a problem concerning that the value of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> are not considered in economic terms, which can result in solutions that are unfavorable for our welfare (Ministry of Environment, 2012). According to Nilsson et al (2007) sustainable development can only be achieved by strategically involving all sectors, economic and environmental policies together, so-called environmental policy integration. In January 2013 the Swedish Government established a government commission (M 2013 : 01) to highlight the value of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services.</b> This is a step in achieving the milestone of the importance of biodiversity and the value of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services.</b> This report aims to contribute as groundwork for the government commission with the purpose to illustrate 1) how the municipality of Kristianstad and Eskilstuna, deemed to be in the forefront of integration of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> have succeeded in integrating <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> in various planning processes and the underlying success factors, 2) the level of knowledge and management of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> in four randomly selected municipalities and what obstacles they perceive and what measures are required in order for a municipality to integrate <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> in various planning processes. The three main obstacles for a municipality to integrate <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> in their work is lack of knowledge of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services,</b> absence of a clear link between <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> and spatial planning, and absence of national goals and state coordination. The municipalities of Kristianstad and Eskilstuna have managed to integrate <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> through different projects, for example an <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> analysis and a Resilience Assessment. The possible underlying success factors are key figures that possess knowledge of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> and who has the authority and desire to operate a change in the municipality. The municipality involves different stakeholders and there is a political will to work with this matter. There is an overall lack of knowledge of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> in the observed municipalities. None of the interviewed respondents in the four municipalities addresses <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> explicitly in their work or work with <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> on a strategic level. But the respondents agree that integrating <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> in the municipality’s work would be a positive opportunity. There seems to be a lack of insight of the link between nature’s contribution to the society and it’s importance and impact on the economy and quality of life. This combined with a lack of sectorial integration are reasons why municipalities may {{have a long way to}} go in integrating <b>ecosystem</b> <b>services</b> in various planning processes.
