40|$|Central {{recording}} system for monitoring crustal deformations and seismic activities in thewestern Chubu region, Japan, {{by the use}} of <b>digital</b> <b>telemetering</b> device with time-division PCMmultiplex, has started into operation in May 1977 at the Kamitakara Crustal Movement Ob-servatory. Twenty signals of crustal strains and tilts (DC) observed with extensometers and tiltmetersand of some other geophysical data, and ten signals of short-period (SP) and long-period (LP) seismic waves observed at three satellite stations are telemetered to the Observatory by a telephoneline with the data signalling rate of 4800 bits/sec. The dynamic range of the signals is 78 db forthe SP and LP data, and 66 db for the DC data, respectively. The output signals are recordedin both analog and digital forms. Seven DC signals and three SP data are also transmitted in the same way to the DisasterPrevention Research Institute, which is about 200 km distant from the Observatory. Some of the recent observational results obtained from the telemetering system are presentedin this paper...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the history and}} results of microearthquake observation in the Izu Peninsula region by the Earthquake Research Institute (ERI). ERI started microearthquake observation at Okuno in November 1971. In September 1975, two stations, Kawazu and Yugashima were added and routine hypocenter determination by this local network was started from the next month. As the seismic activities continued, spread and developed, the network has been intensified to monitor it more precisely by adding new stations and improving observation and data processing facilities; from ink writing drum recording system to <b>digital</b> <b>telemetering</b> and interactive computer processing system. The results of observation for 17 years, October 1975 -April 1992, are given here as yearly epicenter maps and brief descriptions about major seismic activities in each year. Major events in this period are : the 1976 Kawazu earthquake (M 5. 4), the 1978 Izu-Oshima-Kinkai earthquake (M 7. 0), the 1980 Izu-Hanto-Oki earthquake (M 6. 7), the 1986 Izu-Oshima eruption with a M 6. 1 earthquake, and the 1990 Izu-Oshima-Kinkai earthquake (M 6. 5). Since November 1978, active earthquake swarm have occurred repeatedly off {{the east coast of}} the peninsula and submarine eruption occurred there during one of such earthquake swarms in 1989. ＜論説...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1982 / Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{quantity}} of measurements and broad frequency spectrum {{of interest for}} dynamic measurements required to support the development phase of the MX Missile, {{in conjunction with a}} limited downlink telemetry bandwidth, necessitated a unique vibration measurement system. This was accomplished by on-board vibration data processing comprising a sensor system (transducer/ low noise cable/charge amplifier) and a multichannel digital Vibration Data Processor (VDP). The processor is a 1 / 3 octave frequency band analyzer, employing digital filter circuitry covering 22 bands over a frequency range from 14 Hz to 2245 Hz, providing an output that represents the energy(G²) per band/time interval. A Master Data Control Unit (MU) controls the VDP operation via a full duplex data bus. This paper will describe the sensor system, with its designed in-post installation test/verification features and the capabilities and design features of the VDP. Processor characteristics such as the self-test operation whereby all 1 / 3 octave analysis bands are verified, the ability to meet a 60 dB dynamic range, the indivudual instructions code capability along with other features will be presented. The most important facet of this onboard processing allows a downlink data bandwidth conservation ranging up to 184 : 1 which is compatible with the <b>digital</b> <b>telemetering</b> system...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1976 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThis paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of digital data transmission in a pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) communication system. A PAM communication system was simulated and equipment was developed to obtain experimental results indicative of PAM's effectiveness in transmission of digital data. The results consist of word, channel, and bit error probability curves for different numbers of digital bits per PAM channel. The digital bits were converted to analog voltage levels which amplitude-modulated selected PAM channels. After decommutation the digital bits were recovered from the analog voltage levels by an analog to digital conversion. The data indicates that the number of bits per channel should be 4 or less depending upon the digital data quality requirements. The error probability curves can be used {{to determine whether or not}} a PAM communication system can <b>telemeter</b> <b>digital</b> data within given constraints. In addition, the results provide guidelines for the implementation of digital data in a PAM system...|$|R
