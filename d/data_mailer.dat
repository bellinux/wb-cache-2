40|$|Complexity of {{distributed}} real-time {{applications such}} as automotive electronics has increased dramatically {{over the last couple}} of years. As a result, developing communication protocols to address real-time requirements of these {{applications such as}} reliability, intime delivery of messages, priority support, and faulttolerance needs more sophisticated techniques. To satisfy these requirements, special communication architectures have been designed. The most important methods presented are TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), Token Ring and CAN (Controller Area Network). Recently, a new algorithm called RDM (Round <b>Data</b> <b>Mailer)</b> has been presented. The focus of this paper is on the studying of the Round <b>Data</b> <b>Mailer</b> technique and evaluating its message delivery performance by making a comparison of the result of simulated RDM and CAN. 1...|$|E
40|$|Many {{real-time}} {{communication protocols}} {{have been studied}} to guarantee the communication requirements of distributed real-time systems. But, current techniques lack {{all or most of}} these requirements specially bounded message delivery time. In this paper we have proposed a Mac layer protocol called RDM+ with concepts similar to Round <b>Data</b> <b>Mailer</b> multi layer protocol [1]. Our simulation results show that this new protocol {{has the potential to be}} used in today’s automotive systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{distributed}} real-time systems, every node {{is usually}} responsible for performing pre-assigned local {{activities that are}} required for its physical environment. Nodes arc connected via high-speed communication links and information flow is made possible by using message-passing techniques. Reliability, in-time delivery of messages, priority support, and fault-tolerance are amongst the requirements for such systems. Current techniques lack {{all or most of}} these requirements. This is because they are general-purpose techniques and not tailored to match specific requirements needed by small-scale distributed real-time systems. In this paper, the round <b>data</b> <b>mailer</b> technique is further studied and a layered protocol is proposed...|$|E

More recently, the USPS National Change of Address (NCOA) Service provided <b>data</b> to <b>mailers</b> with scoring on how close a match the name and address are to something actually forwardable or deliverable, which were {{referred to a}}s [...] "Nixie Codes".|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{systems are}} being used {{increasingly}} in control applications such as in automobiles, aircraft and process control. Real-time communication protocols are designed {{in order to satisfy}} basic requirements of these systems such as reliability, safety and in time message delivery. One of the most important requirements of such critical systems is in time update of real-time data which has to be facilitated by these protocols. CAN (Controller Area Network) [1] is one of the important and common protocols which is widely used in such an environment. RDM (Round <b>Data</b> <b>Mailer)</b> [2] and RDM+ [3] are two new protocols that have been designed to fulfill the requirements of distributed real-time systems. In this paper, we are trying to compare RDM+ and CAN protocols based on data lifetime which is the time interval between two consecutive updates of a real-time datum. The obtained results show that RDM+ performs better and provides fresher data to the consumers. Index Terms — RDM+, Datalife time analysis, Realtime communication protoco...|$|E
