40|$|The {{role of the}} {{abdominal}} muscles in human function {{as well as their}} physiological mechanisms for these {{has been the subject of}} an increasing volume of reported research for more than 20 years. The abdominal muscles participate in a wide range of diverse functional tasks. These include breathing, postural stability, expulsive maneuvers and speech control.   To perform these functions effectively and often concurrently, based on demand, the muscles are anatomically, physiologically and biochemical suited. The idea that {{the abdominal}} muscles function as a unit  has been dispelled by many scientific reports. It is now known that they function differentially as individual muscles and also differentially at the motor unit level. Regional differences in the activation patterns of these muscles are also known. In addition the motor units within muscles are functionally organized to either subserve a specific function or more than one function. Knowledge of the functional organization of the abdominal muscles is critical to any rehabilitation process especially since rehabilitation is holistic and strives to achieve functional goals.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 158 - 162) This paper {{presents a}} systems {{approach to the}} proper selection of a microprocessor CPU (central processing unit). This selection process is addressed {{in the context of}} incorporating the microprocessor as the general purpose, stored program, digital computer element in a ground support equipment controller. Addressing the problem in this manner allows quantitative illustration of the methodology involved. However, the basic approach is applicable wherever it is desired to incorporate microprocessor technology into a controller design. The approach taken in this paper consists of two phases, termed the <b>functional</b> capability <b>review</b> phase, and the cost effectiveness evaluation phase. The <b>functional</b> capability <b>review</b> phase addresses the important functions and features of the CPU integrated circuit, and the required support circuitry to enable it to function as a digital computer. Also discussed are the hardware/software development aids which are required and most often desired, to develop the microcomputer (CPU plus support circuitry) hardware and its associated software. Having gained a detailed understanding of the functional capabilities and interrelationships of the CPU, support circuitry, and hardware/software development aids, the systems designer evaluates this capability in relation to the design problem requirements through a cost effectiveness evaluation. The cost effectiveness evaluation, developed using utility theory and sensitivity analysis, enhances the knowledge gained from the <b>functional</b> capability <b>review</b> by projecting the impacts of the capabilities into the probability of success of the system design. This two-phase approach extends the system designer's decision making ability by allowing him to couple the technical intricacies of microprocessor technology with insights into the ultimate cost effectiveness resulting from the alternative courses of action available to him for implementing the microprocessor based design...|$|R

This paper {{deals with the}} local feedback boundary stabilization of the Navier-Stokes equation around an unstable stationary solution. After constructing a feedback law stabilizing the linearized (around the unstable stationary solution) Navier-Stokes equation, the author proves that the linear feedback law also stabilizes the original Navier-Stokes system.

40|$|The mid eighties {{has seen}} {{remarkable}} {{change to the}} policies of the State education system in Western Australia. The election of the State Labor government in early 1983 saw to the build up of a political agenda for system level change in education. The expectation of the Government was that public schools would raise their standards of achievement, be more responsive and be more accountable. Following a comprehensive review of educational policy and practice (Beazley 1984) it was announced that a <b>Functional</b> <b>Review</b> Committee would investigate the structure and operation of the educational bureaucracy. In January 1987 the newly established Ministry of Education (Western Australia) released 2 ̆ 7 Better Schools in Western Australia: A Programme for Improvement. 2 ̆ 7 The document is a blue print for a new style of school operations. The determination of the Ministry of Education to commence implementation of the proposals according to a timeline brought criticism from the teachers 2 ̆ 7 union and the principals 2 ̆ 7 associations. The main contentious issue was the speed at which the proposals would be implemented. In the period of political brinkmanship which followed side issues emerged concerning the rights of groups to be consulted as well as concerns about staffing, workloads and career structures. Clearly there was a need to scrutinize the document. A period of review was agreed to between the Mil 1 istry of Education and the State School Teachers 2 ̆ 7 Union of Western Australia.

MÉTODOS: Em 24 pacientes estudados com indicação de cirurgia de revascularização do miocárdio, fração de ejeção OBJECTIVE: Patients with ischemic {{heart failure}} {{may benefit from}} {{coronary}} artery bypass grafting. The histopathological variables associated with improvement in ejection fraction 6 months after surgery were assessed. METHODS: This study comprised 24 patients indicated for coronary artery bypass grafting, ejection fraction < 35 %, functional class II-IV heart failure, and mean age 59 ± 9 years. Endomyocardial biopsies were performed during and 6 months after surgery. Extension of the fibrosis, number of cells with myocytolysis, and hypertrophy of the muscle fiber were quantified by using a system of image analysis. Clinical and <b>functional</b> <b>review</b> was repeated within 6 months. RESULTS: A significant improvement in heart failure functional class was observed in 16 patients after 6 months of follow-up (from NYHA functional class 2. 8 ± 0. 7 to 1. 7 ± 0. 6; P < 0. 001), but the ejection fraction did not change (25 ± 6 % vs. 26 ± 10 %). Hypertrophy of the muscle fiber was similar in the specimens biopsied in the pre- and postoperative periods (21 ± 4 vs. 22 ± 4 µm), but the extension of fibrosis (8 ± 8 vs. 21 ± 15 % area) {{and the number of}} cells with myocytolysis (9 ± 11 vs. 21 ± 15 % cell) significantly increased.

Ugoditi je bilo treba željam stranke, a vendar ostati v zakonsko predpisanih okvirih, da je gasilni sistem ustrezen za uporabo. Po prejemu povpraševanja sem se problema lotil sistematično, najprej z vizualno predstavitvijo prostora (ogledom), nato pa s skrbnim načrtovanjem v programu AutoCAD s pomočjo strojnega projektanta. Ko sva imela vse potrebne izračune o strojnem delu in določen položaj vseh elementov aktivne požarne zaščite, smo se podali na teren z vsem potrebnim materialom. Ker je bila montaža deloma otežena zaradi zahtevnosti terena, sva s projektantom nekoliko prilagodila načrte, da sva jo olajšala. Po montaži je sledil funkcionalni pregled v izvedbi neodvisne inštitucije, ki pa je pokazal nekaj pomanjkljivosti. Tako smo morali urediti samozapiranje vrat in odpiranje vrat z notranje strani ob gašenju in tudi v običajnem stanju, prav tako pa smo na dodatno željo stranke dogradili GSM-vmesnik za sporočanje stanja {{centrale}}. Gasilni sistem je bil nato uspešno pregledan, vendar sem pri projektu spoznal, da lahko še tako skrbno projektiranje pripelje do sprememb, potrebnih za precej lažjo montažo, ki jo opaziš šele kot monter. Ugotovil sem tudi, da gasilni sistem ni le postavitev centrale in priklop alarmiranja, ampak je sestavljen iz strojnega dela, gradbenih del in tudi ključavničarskih del, za kar je potrebno precej splošnega znanja in pomoč oseb iz vseh strokIn {{the graduation}} thesis I presented {{the installation of}} a fire extinguishing system, from customer demand 2 ̆ 7 s to design and to the final manufacture.

After I received the request, I tackled the problem systematically, first with visual presentation of space, where system were to be mounted, and then with careful planning in the AutoCAD program with help of machine designer. When we had all the necessary calculations about the machine work and a certain position of all element of the active fire protection, we went to the facility with all the necessary material for assembly. Since the assembly was partly hampered by complexity of terrain, we were slightly modifying the design to make assembly easier. At the end of assembly, a <b>functional</b> <b>review</b> of an independent institution was followed, but then he found some shortcomings.

The fire extinguishing system was then successfully inspected, but I realized, that the projects that are carefully planed, can lead to the changes, needed for much easier assembly, which you see only as an installer. I also found that the fire extinguishing system in not only the installation of a fire control panel and alarming, but it consists of machine parts, construction work and locksmithing, which requires a lot of general knowledge and help from people from all disciplines...|$|E
