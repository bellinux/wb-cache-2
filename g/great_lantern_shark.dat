40|$|Many {{species of}} deep-water shark {{are present in}} the Rockall Trough and are {{vulnerable}} to the impacts of deep-sea fisheries. Shark numbers are declining and commercially important prey items are being fished out of the ecosystem, affecting a number of aquatic food-webs. This paper describes the dietary composition of the birdbeak dogfish (Deania calceus) and the <b>greater</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> (Etmopterus princeps) collected from the Rockall Trough between 55 - 57. 6 °N and 9 - 14 °W. D. calceus was collected from 650 - 1050 m at different locations and fed mainly on teleosts and cephalopods. Diet composition varied with depth but was not influenced by site, gender or maturity as immature specimens were largely absent from the sample. Comparisons of diet composition with previous fmdings demonstrate a shift in prey assemblage which may be as a result of fishing. E. princeps was sampled at 1500 m along the continental slope and diet composition was dominated by crustaceans, cephalopods and some fish. Diet composition was very different to that of D. calceus and did not vary between genders or maturity level. Both species exhibit generalist diets which counteract the effects of competition with other deep-water sharks and also the impacts of fisheries.

40|$|This survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in November and December 1999 on the western slope of the Porcupine Bank and the western and eastern slopes of the Porcupine Seabight. Fishing was carried out in five {{separate}} areas, in depths between 400 and 2, 000 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagase National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on a commercial long-liner, using commercial deep-water autoline gear. In total 18 species of chondricthyan, 24 species of teleost fish and 1 species of cephalopod were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were bird beak dogfish, leafscale gulper shark, Portuguese dogfish and mora. Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 42 % of the total catch.

The first leg of the present survey took place {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 2000 on the Western slope of the Porcupine Bank and the western slopes of Rockall Bank and Hatton Bank. The second leg took place on the slopes and shelves of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in depths between 150 and 1, 800 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain biological samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagase National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the commercial long-liner "An Capall Bán," using commercial deepwater autoline gear. In total 26 species of chondricthyan and 24 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were birdbeak dogfish (22 %), leafscale gulpershark (14 %), Portuguese dogfish (8 %), tusk (17 %) and mora (8 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated at 43 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and <b>greater</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark.</b> Catch per unit effort showed that highest abundances were found in the northwestern slope of the Porcupine Bank at 600 - 700 metres and in the western slopes of Rockall Bank and Hatton Bank at 1, 000 to 1, 200 metres depths...|$|R
40|$|The present survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 1997 along the eastern slope of Rockall Trough between 53 and 58 ºN {{including}} the Northern slope of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in six separate areas, in depths between 300 and 2, 925 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the Norwegian commercial long-liner "Skarheim," using commercial deep-water autoline gear. In total over 70, 000 hooks were set during the trip and on average 80 % of these were baited. In total 20 species of chondricthyan and 18 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (36 %), bird beak dogfish Deania calcea (21 %), Portuguese dogfish Centrascyflium coefofepis (13 %), tusk, Brosme brosme (11 %) and mora, Mora mora (6 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 30 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and <b>greater</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> Etmopterus princeps. Catch per 1, 000 hooks showed that highest abundances were found at 600 - 1, 100 metres throughout the whole fishing area. Three settings were made at depths between 2, 000 and 3, 000 meters.

50|$|While {{these tools}} may be {{effective}} as predator avoidance mechanisms, they {{also serve as}} equally effective tools for the predators themselves. For example, the deepwater velvet belly <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> uses counter-illumination to hide from its prey.|$|R
5000|$|The Etmopteridae are {{a family}} of sharks in the order Squaliformes, {{commonly}} known as <b>lantern</b> <b>sharks.</b> Their name comes from the presence of light-producing photophores on their bodies. The members of this family are small, under 90 cm long, and are found in deep waters worldwide. The 45 species are placed in five genera. Three-quarters of the species are in the genus Etmopterus.|$|R
40|$|Bioluminescence is {{a common}} feature in the {{permanent}} darkness of the deep-sea. In fishes, light is emitted by organs containing either photogenic cells (intrinsic photophores), which are under direct nervous control, or symbiotic luminous bacteria (symbiotic photophores), whose light is controlled by secondary means such as mechanical occlusion or physiological suppression. The intrinsic photophores of the <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> Etmopterus spinax were recently shown as an exception to this rule since {{they appear to be}} under hormonal control. Here, we show that hormones operate what amounts to a unique light switch, by acting on a chromatophore iris, which regulates light emission by pigment translocation. This result strongly suggests that this shark's luminescence control originates from the mechanism for physiological colour change found in shallow water sharks that also involves hormonally controlled chromatophores: the <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> would have turned the initial shallow water crypsis mechanism into a midwater luminous camouflage, more efficient in the deep-sea environment...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn his {{monograph}} on Cirripedia from 1851 [1], Darwin {{pointed to}} a highly unusual, plateless, and most likely parasitic barnacle of uncertain phylogenetic affinity. Darwin’s barnacle was Anelasma squalicola, found on deep-water sharks of the family Etmopteridae, or <b>lantern</b> <b>sharks</b> [2]. The barnacle is uncommon and is therefore rarely studied. Recent observations by us have shown that they occur at an unusually high prevalence on the velvet belly <b>lantern</b> <b>shark,</b> Etmopterus spinax, in restricted fjord areas of western Norway. A phylogenetic analysis based on ribosomal DNA data (16 S, 18 S, and 28 S) from 99 selected barnacle species, including all available pedunculate barnacle sequences from GenBank, shows that A.  squalicola is most closely related (sister taxon) to the pedunculate barnacle Capitulum mitella. Both C.  mitella and species of Pollicipes, situated one node higher in the tree, are conventional suspension feeders from the rocky intertidal. Our phylogenetic analysis now {{makes it possible to}} establish morphological homologies between A.  squalicola and its sister taxon and provides the evolutionary framework to explain the unprecedented transition from a filter-feeding barnacle to a parasitic mode of life...|$|R
50|$|Besides its {{effectiveness}} as a predator avoidance mechanism, counter-illumination {{also serves as}} an essential tool to predators themselves. Some shark species, such as the deepwater velvet belly lanternshark, use counter-illumination to remain hidden from their prey. as does the Hawaiian bobtail squid. Other well-studied examples include the cookiecutter shark, the marine hatchetfish, and the Hawaiian bobtail squid. More than 10% of shark species may be bioluminescent, though some such as <b>lantern</b> <b>sharks</b> may use the light for signalling {{as well as for}} camouflage.|$|R
40|$|The {{velvet belly}} <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> (Etmopterus spinax) {{is a common}} deep-sea shark that has been used, in the recent years, {{as a model for}} {{experimental}} studies on physiological control of shark luminescence.

This paper, by making a short review of histological and pharmacological results from these studies, aims to propose a first model of luminescence control in E. spinax...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the smooth lanternshark, as Acanthidium pusillum, was published by British biologist Richard Thomas Lowe, in an 1839 issue of the scientific journal Transactions of the Zoological Society of London.

40|$|Etmopterus pusillus is a {{deep water}} <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> with a {{widespread}} global distribution that is caught in large quantities in some areas, but is usually discarded due to the low commercial value. In this work, the population biology was studied and life history parameters determined {{for the first time}} in this species. Age was estimated from sections of the second dorsal spine and validated by marginal increment analysis. Males attained a maximum age of 13 years, while 17 -year-old females were found. Several growth models were fitted and compared for both size and weight at age data, showing that even though this is a small sized species, it has a relatively slow growth rate. This species matures late and at a relatively large size: at 86. 81 % and 79. 40 % of the maximum observed sizes and at 58. 02 % and 54. 40 % of the maximum observed ages for males and females, respectively. It has a low fecundity, with a mean ovarian fecundity of 10. 44 oocytes per reproductive cycle. The estimated parameters indicate that this species has a vulnerable life cycle, typical of deep water squalid sharks. Given the high fishing pressures that it is suffering in the NE Atlantic, the smooth <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> may be in danger of severe declines in the near future. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The shark genus Etmopterus {{encompasses}} numerous {{deep-sea species}} that are widely distributed throughout the world's oceans and share the capability to emit light thanks to numerous tiny epidermal photogenic organs called photophores. Despite the potential wide ecological interest of this light emission, {{it is still a}} poorly studied aspect of shark biology, mostly due to the challenges inherent to the study of uncommon deep-sea animals. During a collection trip in waters around Okinawa Island, we had the opportunity to collect, maintain and study specimens of Etmopterus splendidus, a small pelagic <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> that was not previously known from this area. Analyses show that (i) the photophore density of this species varies according to the different parts of the body, which led to a heterogeneous photogenic pattern; (ii) photophore harbour the classical structure found in other etmopterid sharks, i. e. a cluster of photocytes enclosed in a pigmented sheath and surmounted by pigmented and lens cells; (iii) the physiological control of these photophores appears similar to what was found in the distantly related Etmopterus spinax, i. e. including hormonal and neural inputs as well as the action of pigmented cells overlying the photocytes. These results indicate that E. splendidus luminescence is probably used for more than one purpose, and support the idea that the physiological control of <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> photophores was selected early in the evolution of these sharks...|$|R
