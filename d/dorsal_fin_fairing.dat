25|$|In 1963, BAC Warton {{was working}} on the {{preliminary}} design of a two-seat Lightning development with a variable-geometry wing, based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the variable-sweep wing, which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> <b>fairing,</b> an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the Royal Navy's existing aircraft carriers carrier-based aircraft, the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year. Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer Rolls-Royce Spey engine; it is also likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.|$|E

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is to {{stabilize}} the animal against rolling and to assist in sudden turns. Some species have further adapted their <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> to other uses. The sunfish uses the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> (and the anal fin) for propulsion. In anglerfish, the anterior of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is modified into a biological equivalent to a fishing pole and a lure known as illicium or esca. Many catfish can lock the leading ray of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in an extended position to discourage predation or to wedge themselves into a crevice. Some animals have developed <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> with protective functions, such as spines or venom. For example, both the spiny dogfish and the Port Jackson shark have spines in their <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> which are capable of secreting venom.|$|R

40|$|The present paper aims {{to provide}} {{aerodynamic}} design guidelines for an aircraft <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> obtained using CFD RANS technique. A parametric aerodynamic investigation about <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> length, height, sweep angle, and planform {{area has been}} performed in order to evaluate the effects of geometric variations on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> and vertical tail aerodynamic behavior in sideslip conditions. More than 30 <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> geometries have been investigated, mounted on a typical large turbopropeller fuselage with a vertical tail.

At higher angles, the vertical tail stalls and the flow field around the empennage is strongly influenced by two vortices generated by the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> intersection with the fuselage (primary vortex) and with the vertical tail (secondary vortex). The stall phenomenon appears around 35 ° of sideslip angle. Moreover, <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> slightly reduced fuselage instability. Finally, some wind tunnel tests have been performed on two <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> geometries to validate the numerical analyses.

40|$|A {{key feature}} of {{locomotor}} anatomy in fishes is the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> {{which is one}} of three median fins, together with the anal and caudal fin, present in most species (Helfman et al., 1997; Lauder et al., 2002; Standen and Lauder, 2005). The <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> displays considerable diversity in structure among ray-finned fishes. The plesiomorphic condition consists of a single ‘soft’ fin supported by flexible, segmented fin rays, while the derived <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in the spiny-finned acanthomorph fishes is composed of an anterior <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> with stiff fin spines as supports and a posterior soft-rayed <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> homologous to that in basal clades (Fig. · 1; Lauder and Drucker, 2004; Mabee et al., 2002). While anatomical differences between spiny and soft <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> have been well documented and a number of hypothesized locomotor functions of <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> have been presented (Gosline, 1971; Lauder, 2005), as yet the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> of fishes {{has been the subject of}} limited experimental study compared with other propulsor systems such as the caudal fin and the paired pectoral fins. Previous work examining the role of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in fish swimming has been concerned primarily with documentation of patterns of fin motion and theoretical modeling of fin forces. This research has focused on several relatively small teleostean clades exhibiting specialized swimming modes in which the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is employed as a key propulsor. Particular attention has been given to fishes of the orders Tetraodontiformes (e. g. triggerfishes and boxfishes) and Gasterosteiformes (e. g. seahorses). These fishes swim steadily by undulating or oscillating the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> usually in concert with other media...|$|R
50|$|Body {{is rather}} long, slender, {{moderately}} flattened. Eyes are large. Head and body are scaly. Mouth is protractible, upwardly directed, with small teeth. Lower jaw has an upper expansion within mouth (high dentary bone). There are two separate <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins,</b> with all rays of first and 1-2 anterior rays of second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> being unsegmented. The anal fin {{is similar to}} the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> while the caudal fin is forked. The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> has 6-10 flexible spines.|$|R
40|$|<b>Dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> have diverse morphologies across shark species. However, {{little is}} known about the ability of sharks to control fin {{movements}} and the nature of the balance of forces during swimming. White-spotted bamboo sharks, Chiloscyllium plagiosum, and spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, are two unrelated species that inhabit different habitats and have strikingly different <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> morphologies. Previous studies that have used a shark model in a wind tunnel have hypothesized that median fins function in stabilization during steady swimming. ^ The <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> anatomy of benthic white-spotted bamboo sharks and benthopelagic spiny dogfish reflects their different swimming habits. White-spotted bamboo sharks live in complex reef habitats and thus have requirements for high maneuverability. Spiny dogfish occupy a variety of coastal and continental shelf habitats and are known to form schools, spending more time in open water environments. Principal component analysis separates these two species in morphospace. Bamboo sharks are characterized by a second dorsal with larger area and proportionally more muscle inserting onto first and second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> in comparison to spiny dogfish. The two species also differ in the morphology of the skeletal support of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> Basals and radials in spiny dogfish are almost indistinguishable, while radials in bamboo sharks are more numerous and are arranged in two rows of elongate, plate-like elements that articulate with one another. The muscle of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in spiny dogfish is composed of one large muscle mass that extends to all of the proximal radials in spiny dogfish, while in bamboo sharks distinct individual muscle bundles insert onto the ceratotrichia overlying the distal and proximal skeletal elements. ^ During steady swimming, the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in spiny dogfish move independently of the body with larger amplitudes at lower speeds, indicating a stabilizing function. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> in bamboo sharks move in synchrony with the trunk, with a larger range of motion than dogfish at both speeds. The first and second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> of bamboo sharks move laterally in phase with the axial portion of the body, although with larger lateral displacement. ^ Electromyography data shows simultaneous muscle activity on both sides of the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in spiny dogfish which is independent of speed, indicating active stiffening of this <b>fin.</b> The second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in spiny dogfish and both <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> in bamboos show alternating muscle activity on each side of the fin, indicating active flapping. Flow acceleration and vortex shedding were identified at the wake of the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in spiny dogfish and both <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> in bamboo sharks using particle image velocimetry. Flow in the wake of the second dorsal was considerably decelerated. These data demonstrate that contrary to the traditional hypothesis, not all <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> function as stabilizers; the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> in spiny dogfish contributes to stability while the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> as well as both <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> in bamboo sharks, contribute to thrust production. ^ During maneuvers, the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> muscles are active on both sides in spiny dogfish and white-spotted bamboo sharks. Spiny dogfish have longer burst duration on the contralateral side, consistent with opposing resistance to the medium. In bamboo sharks, activation might be insufficient to counteract water resistance. The function of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> is more flexible and diverse than first thought and might explain the morphological diversity in <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> found among sharks. ...|$|R
50|$|Billfish have {{prominent}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins.</b> Like tuna, mackerel {{and other}} scombroids, billfish streamline themselves by retracting their <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> into a groove in their body when they swim.
