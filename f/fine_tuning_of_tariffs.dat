40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Automatic Generation Control scheme for multi area power system using integrator and PID controller. The simulation results of four areas are compared using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. Automatic Generation Control {{is a very}} important process that operates constantly to balance the generation and load. PID controllers can be tuned by using many methods. In all methods an initial guess is made for PID controller parameter settings. Then these parameter settings are improved by <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> the controller. Now a days various simulation software is widely used for this purpose of parameter settings. MATLAB Simulation software can also be used for <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> the PID controller. So by using MATLAB Simulation tools a method is proposed for <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> PID controller...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> {{associated}} to a `Natural Supersymmetry' spectrum with stops, after RG running, significantly {{lighter than the}} first two generation sfermions and the gluino. In particular, we emphasise that this tuning should be measured {{with respect to the}} parameters taken to be independent at the assumed UV boundary of the renormalisation group flow, and improve the accuracy of previous approximate expressions. It is found that, if running begins at 10 ^ 16 GeV (10 ^ 5 GeV), decreasing the UV stop mass below 0. 75 (0. 4) of the weak scale Majorana gluino mass does not improve the overall <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> the theory. In contrast, it is possible to raise the first two generation sfermion masses out of LHC reach without introducing additional tuning. After running, regions of parameter space favoured by naturalness and consistent with LHC bounds typically have IR stop masses of order 1. 5 TeV (0. 75 TeV), and <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> at least 400 (50) for high (low) scale mediation. We also study the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> theories with Dirac gluinos. These allow for substantial separation of the gluino and sfermion masses and, regardless of the scale of mediation, lead to relatively low <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> order 50. Hence viable models can still favour light stops, but this requires extra structure beyond the MSSM field content. Comment: 26 pages, 8 figures, V 3 : JHEP versio...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of using {{parallel}} implementations as a mean for efficient experimenting and <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> parameters for metaheuristics [...] a very difficult and especially time consuming process. This is particularly of great impact to the metaheuristics, at least for two reasons: (a) measuring the performance of a metaheuristic implementation requires testing on a large set of instances and on real world instances usually of big and very big size [...] a considerable amount of time is needed to accomplish it; (b) the finding of right values for the search parameters of the metaheuristic is almost indispensable for the success of the metaheuristic implementation. Due to this, considerable efforts have been done by researchers and practitioners to provide, on the one hand, a methodology and rigorous basis for experimental evaluation of heuristics (e. g. Rardin and Uzsoy 2001, Barr et al. 1995) and, on the other, to find efficient approaches for <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> parameters such as developing specific software (e. g. Adenso-Diaz and Laguna 2002), use of experimental design (e. g. Coy et al. 2000) and self-adaptive procedures (e. g. Kivijarvi et al. 2003). In this paper we show that parallel implementations of metaheuristics based on simple parallel models are efficient tools for both experimenting and <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> parameters. Our proposal is based on two parallel models: the Independent Runs (IR) and the Independent Runs with Autonomous Strategies (IRAS). To illustrate our proposal, we implement the Tabu Search for the 0 - 1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem in both models. We use the two implementations for experimenting and <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> parameters obtaining high quality solutions as compared with best known up-to-date results for the problem.
