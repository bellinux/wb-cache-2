All urine and fecal samples were analyzed for iron, magnesium, manganese, and chromium using a DCP-Spectraspan V emission spectrophotometer. After eating oat bran products, a significant decrease (p<. 05) in mean chromium and manganese intake and a significant (pc. Ol) increase in mean magnesium intake was observed. Mean iron intake also increased but not significantly. Fecal manganese excretion increased significantly in the oat bran group (p<. 005) significantly lowering the apparent manganese balance. Iron balance was not significantly affected but became more negative from week 1 to week 4. Apparent chromium balance also decreased significantly (p<. 025) and magnesium balance improved significantly (p<. 05) after oat bran consumption.

40|$|Mini-matrix {{multiple}} unit dosage forms (MUDFs) of diclofenac sodium and S(+) ibuprofen have been prepared. Normal tabletting techniques {{were used to}} form the mini-matrices prior to their enclosure in hard gelatin capsules. Four natural hydrophilic <b>gums,</b> namely xanthan, <b>karaya,</b> locust bean and carrageenan gums as well as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were used as the principle release-retarding agents. Various excipients - lactose, Encompress®, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Veegum F® and Avicel PH 101 ® - were added in different proportions to further modify drug release. The diclofenac sodium mini-matrices (4. 5 mm in diameter) were produced by the wet granulation method. The release profiles from several encapsulated minimatrices in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7. 0) showed that xanthan, karaya and locust bean gums could sustain the release of diclofenac sodium while the carrageenan gum did not produce a satisfactory sustaining effect. The rank order of decreasing swelling rate in both axial and radial dimensions was xanthan > karaya > locust bean gum and each of these gums showed almost Fickian swelling behaviour. The solvent penetration rates {{were consistent with the}} swelling rates. However, the order of decreasing drug release and erosion rates was locust bean> xanthan > <b>karaya</b> <b>gum.</b> For each of these gums, the release behaviour was anomalous indicating that both Fickian drug diffusion and polymer relaxation were involved in the release process. The dominant mechanism depended on the nature and content of the gum, as well as the stage in the dissolution period. The study involving xanthan gum showed that the diclofenac sodium release rate declined linearly with a progressive increase in the gumcontent, without changing the release behaviour. However, for high drug: xanthan gum ratio (2 : 1), the release kinetics changed to Super Case II. Solubility differences between the excipients did not affect the release rate, but increasing proportions of each excipient produced a faster release rate with the release mechanism changing from anomalous to Case II and then to Super Case II transport. Mini-matrices containing HPMC produced faster drug release than those containing the three natural gums. There was no synergistic effect between xanthan and locust bean gums on the release of diclofenac sodium from mini-matrices. Variation in the stirring speed (used in the dissolution apparatus) and matrix volume had little effect on drug release, whereas the pH of the dissolution medium greatly affected the release of diclofenac sodium. Following on from the studies involving diclofenac sodium, xanthan and <b>karaya</b> <b>gums</b> were used to produce mini-matrices of S(+) ibuprofen. Excipients with good compressibility characteristics such as lactose, Encompress® and Avicel PH 101 ® were needed in the formulations. At pH 7, higher drug release rates were obtained with <b>karaya</b> <b>gum</b> (Super Case II mechanism) compared with xanthan gum (anomalous behaviour). Solubility differences between the excipients slightly affected the release rate. Compression forces (11 - 26 kN) slightly affected the crushing strength. The minimatrices were relatively stable to variation in temperature (5 - 37 °C) and relative humidity (10 - 75 %) over a 2 month time period. These studies have shown that near zero-order release of diclofenac sodium and S(+) ibuprofen can be achieved using encapsulated mini-matrices formulations. The release mechanisms and release rates can be adjusted by variation of the type and content of gums and/or excipients. Robert Gordon University; Knoll Pharmaceuticals (formerly Boots) ...|$|R

The in vivo study revealed that the bioavailability of NM from pure drug was significantly lower when compared to the cogrinding mixtures. The oral bioavailability was found to be NM powder < cogrinding mixtures of NM and GK < cogrinding mixtures of NM and MGK < NM solution. It can be inferred from the above results that MGK, an economical carrier, could be used for the dissolution enhancement of NM...|$|E
40|$|Received on: 19 - 08 - 2008; Accepted on: 23 - 12 - 2008 Mucoadhisive microcapsules are {{proposed}} for the antidiabetic drug glipizide, to obtain controlled release. Glipizide microcapsules with a coat consisting of alginate and <b>gum</b> <b>karaya</b> were prepared by employing ionic gelation process and emulsification ionotropic gelation process. The microcapsules were evaluated for flow properties, Carr’s index, hausner ratio, microencapsulation efficiency, drug release characteristics, surface characteristics; compatibility studies mucoadhesive properties and in-vivo hypoglycemic activity. As hausner ratio was less than 1. 25 and Carr’s index values were less than 15 from both the methods, hence they {{were found to be}} free flowing. Sharp endothermic peaks were noticed from the microcapsules formulated with two different techniques at 215 oC indicating the compatibility between the drug and the polymer <b>gum</b> <b>karaya.</b> Glipizide release from the microcapsules was slow and followed zero order kinetics (r> 0. 98) and followed non–fickian (n value 0. 5 to 1) release and depended on the coat: core ratio and the method employed in the preparation of microcapsules. Among the two methods emulsification ionotropic gelation method was found to be more suitable for slow and complete release of glipizide {{over a long period of}} time. These microcapsules exhibited good mucoadhesive property in the in-vitro wash-off test. In vivo testing into rabbits demonstrated significant hypoglycemic effect of glipizide...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical GC-MS procedure {{to study the}} chemical composition of plant gums, determining aldoses and uronic acids in one step. The procedure {{is based on the}} silylation of aldoses and uronic acids, released from plant gums by microwave assisted hydrolysis, and previously converted into the corresponding diethyl-dithioacetals and diethyl-dithioacetal lactones. Using this method only one peak for each compound is obtained, thus providing simple and highly reproducible chromatograms. The analytical procedure was optimised using reference samples of raw plant <b>gums</b> (arabic, <b>karaya,</b> ghatti, guar, locust bean and tragacanth, cherry, plum and peach gums), commercial watercolours and paint layers prepared according to ancient recipes at the Opificio delle Pietre Dure of Florence (Italy). To identify gum media in samples of unknown composition, a decisional schema for the gum identification and the principal component analysis of the relative sugar percentage contents were employed. The procedure was used to study samples collected from wall paintings from Macedonian tombs (4 th- 3 rd centuries Bc) and from the Mycenaean "Palace of Nestor" (13 th century BC) in Pylos, Greece. The presence of carbohydrates was ascertained and plant gum binders (fruit and a mixture of tragacanth and fruit tree gums) were identified in some of the samples. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, an {{attempt was made}} to {{formulate}} floating tablets of Levofloxacin hemihydrates using with gum kondagogu, xanthum gum and HPMC K 100 M as release modifier. Eight batches of floating tablets of Levofloxacin hemihydrates were prepared by using different drug: polymer (Levofloxacin hemihydrates, HPMC K 100 M + <b>karaya</b> <b>gum)</b> ratios viz. F 1,F 2,F 3,F 4 and drug: polymer (Levofloxacin hemihydrates, HPMC K 100 M + xantham gum) ratios viz. F 5,F 6,F 7,F 8. The compressed tablets were evaluated for hardness, uniformity of weight, friability, drug content. All the readings are within the prescribed limits. There was no interaction between the drug, polymer and excipients it was found out by IR studies. Swelling index studies were also carried out. The in vitro release data were fitted to different order of reactions such as zero order and Korsmeyer-Peppas reaction. It was found that, the drug release follows Korsmeyer-Peppas reaction...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain and {{characterize}} microcapsules with Ellagic Acid (EA) from pomegranate as core material and <b>Karaya</b> <b>Gum</b> (KG) as wall material. Methods: EA was obtained from dry pomegranate peel powder via methanolysis and quantified by HPLC. Microcapsules were obtained preparing a dispersion containing KG and EA in phosphate buffer pH 8. The dispersion was processed in a spray dryer under specific conditions (inlet temperature at 150 °C, feed flow at 30 % and aspirator at 100 %) for obtaining of microcapsules. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for characterization. Results: Obtained material contains 98. 03 ± 2. 82 mg EA/g of pomegranate peel. FTIR showed that there were changes in the molecular structure of microcapsules referred to raw materials. SEM confirmed that particles obtained had micron-size (1 - 5 µm). DSC analysis showed that raw materials had glass transition temperatures of 79. 58 and 83. 41 °C and for microcapsules the value was 67. 25 °C. Conclusion: Methanolysis is a viable technique for the obtaining of EA from the peel of pomegranate. KG shows good potential for be used as wall material for EA microencapsulation...|$|R
