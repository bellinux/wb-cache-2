25|$|De Gaulle {{landed at}} Heston Airport soon after 12.30pm on 17 June. He visited Churchill at 10 Downing Street at around 3pm and {{discussed}} making a radio broadcast, {{although it was}} agreed to postpone such a speech until after Pétain's imminent broadcast had been made. Pétain’s broadcast later that day stated openly that “the fighting must end” {{and that he had}} approached the Germans for terms; that evening de Gaulle dined with Jean Monnet and denounced Pétain’s “treason”. The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of his “Finest Hour” speech) were reluctant to agree to de Gaulle giving a radio address via the BBC Radio service, as Britain was still interceding with the Pétain government about the fate of the French fleet. Contrary to de Gaulle’s later claims, several eyewitnesses agree that Duff Cooper (Minister of Information) had an advance copy of the text, to which there were no objections. The Cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the Cabinet minutes.|$|E

25|$|To {{serve the}} need for {{activities}} with Philips employees, the company founded its own football team in 1910: the Philips Elftal. Its ground was the Philips Sportpark, located on the same location as the present day stadium. Financial turmoil and worker strikes led to a quick demise of the team and in 1913, its successor emerged, Philips Sport Vereniging, founded on 31 August. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> that Philips organized celebrations and sports competitions {{in light of the}} centennial defeat of the French in the Napoleonic Wars. It was not until 1916, however, that the football department switched its name from Philips Elftal to PSV. Because of World War I, the first possibility to enter a league was in the 1915–16 season. The club's first ever match was a 3–2 defeat against Willem II Reserves on 19 September 1915. The team did achieve promotion that season to a newly created Third Division of the Brabantian FA. Under the guidance of coach Wout Buitenweg, PSV were promoted in 1918 and 1921 as well, eventually reaching the Eerste Klasse. The team was relegated in 1925, but its stint in the Second Division only lasted one year when PSV were promoted again. Since 1926, PSV has always played in the highest possible domestic league.|$|E
500|$|The Prince Albert {{sapphire}} brooch {{was given}} by Prince Albert to Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace on 9 February 1840. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before their wedding, and Victoria wrote in her diary that Albert came to her sitting room and gave her [...] "a beautiful sapphire and diamond brooch". The centre stone is a large oblong sapphire surrounded by 12 round diamonds. It passed from Victoria to the queen consorts, Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary and the Queen Mother, then passed to Elizabeth on her accession to the throne.|$|E
500|$|Considering the {{literary}} impact of Malcolm X's Autobiography, we may note the tremendous {{influence of the}} book, {{as well as its}} subject generally, {{on the development of the}} Black Arts Movement. Indeed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> after Malcolm's assassination that the poet and playwright, Amiri Baraka, established the Black Arts Repertory Theater, which would serve to catalyze the aesthetic progression of the movement. Writers and thinkers associated with the Black Arts movement found in the Autobiography an aesthetic embodiment of his profoundly influential qualities, namely, [...] "the vibrancy of his public voice, the clarity of his analyses of oppression's hidden history and inner logic, the fearlessness of his opposition to white supremacy, and the unconstrained ardor of his advocacy for revolution 'by any means necessary.'" ...|$|E

500|$|McGregor chose 23 March as {{the date}} of his {{proposed}} meeting because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before the FA Cup final {{and representatives of the}} country's top clubs would be in London. Representatives from ten clubs attended, including the FA Cup finalists West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End, but it quickly became clear that clubs from the South of England were not interested in McGregor's proposal and none attended. A second meeting was held in Manchester on , and details concerning the new competition were finalised. McGregor's suggested name for the competition, [...] "The Association Football Union" [...] was rejected as too {{similar to that of the}} Rugby Football Union and [...] "The Football League" [...] was chosen, despite McGregor's opposition on the grounds that he felt it might invoke associations with the unpopular Irish Land League. The term English League was avoided, to leave the possibility of future applications from Scottish clubs. McGregor also proposed a rule that only one club from each town should be included. The other founders agreed to this rule, which caused controversy, as it meant Birmingham team Mitchell St. George's were denied membership in favour of McGregor's Aston Villa. Twelve clubs kicked off the first season of League football in September 1888.|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 303, Diocletian {{ordered that}} the newly built Christian church at Nicomedia be razed, its scriptures burned, and its treasures seized. February 23 was {{the feast of}} the Terminalia, for Terminus, the god of boundaries. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> they would {{terminate}} Christianity. The next day, Diocletian's first [...] "Edict against the Christians" [...] was published. The key targets of this piece of legislation were, as they had been during Valerian's persecution, Christian property and senior clerics. The edict prohibited Christians from assembling for worship, and ordered the destruction of their scriptures, liturgical books, and places of worship across the empire. But Christians tried to retain the scriptures as far as possible, though, according to de Ste Croix, [...] "it appears that giving them up...was not regarded as a sin" [...] in the East; sufficient numbers of them must have been successfully saved, as is evident from the representative findings of [...] "early biblical papyri" [...] in the stream of the transmission of the text during this period. Christians might have given up apocryphal or pseudepigraphal works, or even refused to surrender their scriptures at the cost of their own lives, and there were some cases where the scriptures were not in the end destroyed. Christians were also deprived of the right to petition the courts, making them potential subjects for judicial torture; Christians could not respond to actions brought against them in court; Christian senators, equestrians, decurions, veterans, and soldiers were deprived of their ranks; and Christian imperial freedmen were re-enslaved.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{observed}} as <b>the</b> Fast of the Firstborn (תענית בכורות).

This fast is overridden by a seudat mitzvah, a meal celebrating {{the fulfillment of}} a commandment; accordingly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> almost universal for firstborn Jews to attend such a meal on this day so as to obviate their need to fast.|$|R

2500|$|The {{concert was}} given on 9 August 1942.

Loudspeakers broadcast the performance throughout the city {{as well as to}} the German forces in a move of psychological warfare. The Soviet commander of the Leningrad front, General Govorov, ordered a bombardment of German artillery positions in advance to ensure their silence during the performance of the symphony; a special operation, code-named [...] "Squall," [...] was executed for precisely this purpose. Three thousand high-caliber shells were lobbed onto the enemy.|$|E

The coup was also strategically planned for this date because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before Friday, the Muslim day of worship, and most military commanders and government workers were off duty. Tanks were even utilized in the coup d'état, with Major Aslam Watanjar commanding the tank units. With the help of the Afghan air force led by Colonel Abdul Qadir, the insurgent troops overcame the stubborn resistance of the Presidential Guard and killed Daoud and most members of his family. Qadir assumed the control of the country from April 27–30, 1978 as the Head of the Military Revolutionary Council ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1991, Anderson and Frischmann {{had broken}} up. Frischmann started dating Blur {{frontman}} Damon Albarn. She believed the band could accommodate the new situation.

That was when it ended, really. I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> after she said that that Brett phoned me up and said, 'I've kicked her out.'" [...] After Frischmann's departure, the character of the group changed. [...] "If Justine hadn't left the band," [...] Anderson said, [...] "I don't think we'd have got anywhere. It was a combination of being personally motivated, and the chemistry being right once she'd left." [...] Anderson and Butler became close friends and began writing several new songs together. However, the band's music was out-of-step with the music of its London contemporaries as well as the American grunge bands. Anderson said, [...] "For the whole of 1991, A men wouldn't give us a second look." ...|$|E
40|$|Have {{you noticed}} {{that in recent}} years it seems that we now have two major {{mainstream}} religious holidays in Australia?

The other holiday, though, which is really overtaking Easter as a “religious” holiday, is Anzac Day.

2500|$|Immigration to Israel is a {{recognized}} religious value of Judaism. The date chosen for Yom HaAliyah, 10 Nisan, has religious significance: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> on which Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan River at Gilgal into <b>the</b> Promised Land. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> thus <b>the</b> first documented [...] "mass Aliyah".

2500|$|Dionysius' method had {{actually}} {{been used by the}} Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during {{the first decade of the}} 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the Alexandrian calendar. Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the Julian calendar. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the XII Kalendas Aprilis (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, Nisan 14, was the date that paschal lambs were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for Passover (...) [...] Alexandria may have chosen it because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> that Christ was crucified according to the Gospel of John (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the Synoptic Gospels ( [...] , Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the Seder, his Last Supper. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all Orthodox churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.|$|E
