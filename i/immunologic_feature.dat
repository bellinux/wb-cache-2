40|$|In {{contrast}} to lentiviral infections {{of humans and}} macaques, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of natural hosts is nonpathogenic despite high levels of viral replication. However, the mechanisms underlying this absence of disease are unknown. Here we report that natural hosts for SIV infection express remarkably low levels of CCR 5 on CD 4 + T cells isolated from blood, lymph nodes, and mucosal tissues. Given that this <b>immunologic</b> <b>feature</b> is found in 5 different species of natural SIV hosts (sooty mangabeys, African green monkeys, mandrills, sun-tailed monkeys, and chimpanzees) but is absent in 5 nonnatural/recent hosts (humans, rhesus, pigtail, cynomolgus macaques, and baboons), it may represent a key feature of the coevolution between the virus and its natural hosts {{that led to a}} nonpathogenic infection. Beneficial effects of low CCR 5 expression on CD 4 + T cells may include the reduction of target cells for viral replication and a decreased homing of activated CD 4 + T cells to inflamed tissue...|$|E

40|$|Langerhans {{cells are}} {{generally}} regarded as members of an Ia+ dendritic cell system capable of potent accessory cell function in immune responses. While {{it has been shown}} that murine Langerhans cells are bone marrow-derived, the ontogenic relationships among human Langerhans cells, other dendritic cells, macrophages, and leukocytes in general have yet to be fully clarified. Recently, several pan-leukocyte monoclonal antibodies have been produced which react with the human leukocyte common antigen. This antigen resembles the murine T 200 antigen and is expressed by all leukocyte subtypes but not by nonhematopoietic cells. Using an immunoperoxidase technique for staining suspensions of live skin cells, we have documented Langerhans cell reactivity with pan-leukocyte monoclonal antibody L 3 B 12 at the ultrastructural level. Reactivity with this highly sensitive and specific pan-leukocyte marker supports the concept of the human Langerhans cell as a specialized form of bone marrow-derived mononuclear leukocyte and defines an <b>immunologic</b> <b>feature</b> common to dendritic cells, macrophages, and leukocytes that is not shared by other cell types.

The combination of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and ribavirin, which is currently considered the standard antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C, could be difficult to carry out in cryoglobulinemic patients who are frequently anemic, {{even in the absence}} of renal failure. Clinical and histologic long-term results of this therapeutic regimen have not been so far reported {{in patients with}} CGN. MethodsThree patients with HCV-related CGN and slightly impaired kidney function were treated with IFN-α and ribavirin for 12 months, and subsequently were followed up for 24 to 36 months. Two of these patients who were anemic were pretreated with erythropoietin (EPO). In each patient renal biopsy was performed before starting therapy and repeated 14 to 26 months after the end of treatment. ResultsIn all three patients, antiviral therapy induced sustained virologic response, which was followed by clear improvement in clinical, biochemical, <b>immunologic,</b> and histologic <b>features.</b> Clinical and biochemical improvement steadily progressed in all three patients, achieving normal or nearly normal results at the end of follow-up.

The recent discovery of mutations in the common gamma chain (gamma c) gene, a constituent of several cytokine receptors, in XSCID provided an opportunity to test directly whether a previously unrecognized mutation in this same gene was responsible for XCID. The status of X chromosome inactivation in blood leukocytes from obligate carriers of XCID was determined from the polymorphic, short tandem repeats (CAG), in the androgen receptor gene, which also contains a methylation-sensitive HpaII site. As in XSCID, X-chromosome inactivation in obligate carriers of XCID was nonrandom in T and B lymphocytes. In addition, X chromosome inactivation in PMNs was variable. Findings from this analysis prompted sequencing of the gamma c gene in this pedigree. A missense mutation in the region coding for the cytoplasmic portion of the gamma c gene was found in three affected males {{but not in a}} normal brother.

To further characterize IgE-mediated reaction, SDS-PAGE and electroblot studies were performed. Our survey revealed that 15 (34. 9 %) subjects had work-related skin response (> or = 2 + of A/H ratio) to GD, thirteen (30. 2 %) had high specific IgE antibody against GD. The specific IgE antibody was detected more frequently in symptomatic workers (40 %) than in asymptomatic workers (11 %). Significant association was found between specific IgE antibody and atopy or smoking (p< 0. 05). The ELISA inhibition test of GD revealed significant inhibitions by GD extract and minimal inhibitions by the house dust mite, storage mite and corn dust. Immunoblot analysis showed 8 IgE binding components within GD ranging from 13. 5 to 142. 5 kDa. Two bands (13. 5, 33 kDa) were bound to the IgE from more than 50 % of the 14 sera tested. In conclusion, {{these findings suggest that}} GD inhalation could induce IgE-mediated bronchoconstriction in exposed workers...|$|R
40|$|The paper studies <b>immunologic</b> <b>features</b> of speleotherapy in patientsduring the {{restorative}} period. One {{hundred and}} twenty-eight patientssuffering from {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) at thestage of an incomplete remission were examined. The patient groupsof 74 men and 54 women {{were divided into}} 2 representative groupsby a method of randomization. Studies showed a pronounced reliable positive dynamics in indices ofcellular and humoral links of immune status in patients with COPDafter speleotherapy: an increase in concentrations of subpopulationsin all the studying of lymphocytes; normalization in correlationbetween subpopulations СД 4 + and СД 8 + lymphocytes; decrease ofABL level to tissual antigen of the lungs; an increase in PhA, anumber of В-lymphocytes and content of immunoglobulins G, A,M, as well as further activation and fixation of immune response. On the whole, indices of immune status improved after a course oftreatment in 97. 8 % patients of the main group and in 67. 5 % patientsof the control group simultaneously with positive dynamics of clinicalsymptomatic. These indices have become particularly better after 6 months in post-treatemnt period that evidences the prolongedefficacy of ST in contrast to other methods of treatment...|$|R
