500|$|In 1996, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Evita, playing the titular role. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even {{wrote a letter to}} {{director}} Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> was signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, [...] "since [...] didn't write the music and lyrics, she wanted her signature on that song... I think on her mind, {{the best way to do}} it was go in the studio and work up a remix".|$|E
500|$|Although Peggy did return {{briefly in}} 2004 to attend her {{daughter}} Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), {{it was not}} until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular. Her full return was announced in January 2005, with John Yorke, the BBC controller of continuing drama series, stating he was [...] "delighted" [...] as [...] " [...] is a hugely loved character and one we think will be stirring things up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> steps back into Walford." [...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great time when I came back to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently. It really reminded me that the square is where I feel at home." [...] BBC executives hoped that Peggy's return would help to revive EastEnders ratings. Her absence coincided with a two-year ratings slump for EastEnders, with David Liddiment in The Guardian drawing direct correlation between her return and the show's [...] "ratings rejuvenation". The episode in which she returned was watched by 10 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 47% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hammp of Billboard {{called the}} {{residency}} [...] "electrifying" [...] though {{he felt that}} [...] "If SXSW served as a statement about how brands should fund artists' creative expression, Gaga's Roseland residency was about giving the people what they wanted..... night ended rather abruptly after almost exactly 60 minutes". A writer for The Courier called the show [...] "short but sweet" [...] and praised her for never showing [...] "signs of slowing down" [...] throughout the show. James Montgomery of MTV News praised the overall show, calling it [...] "heavy on the hits, sublimely sexual, suitably sentimental—both for her glory days and the iconic venue she's closing with this seven-night stand—and ridiculous {{in all the right}} ways". He noted that the abrupt ending of the show was compensated by Gaga's dancing and singing, which inturn helped counteract the negative press she had been receiving since the release of Artpop. Glenn Gamboa from Newsday called the show [...] "fierce" [...] and [...] "brainy", saying that the singer [...] "fired up" [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> took the stage, displaying an avant-garde artistic sensibility. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the show part of the [...] "Supernova" [...] phase of her career and explained, ...|$|E
500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from her desk and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E

60|$|The landlady {{passed this}} over without notice. Though {{she had spoken}} to both of them, her cunning little eyes rested on Stone <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> when <b>she</b> {{appeared}} in the room. She knew by instinct the man who disliked her--and she waited deliberately for Stone to reply.|$|R
60|$|The self-possession which Grace had {{maintained}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> when <b>she</b> {{had entered the}} dining-room, seemed now, for the first time, {{to be on the}} point of failing her. She turned, and looked appealingly at Julian, who had thus far kept his place apart, listening attentively.|$|R
60|$|Did no suspicion, {{excited by}} my own {{knowledge}} of Anne Catherick's resemblance to her, cross my mind, when her face was first revealed to me?

2500|$|Billy Wilder and {{his wife}} Audrey were joined by Nancy Olson, who had played Betty Schaefer in the {{original}} film, at the opening night performance. Of it, Wilder observed, [...] "The best thing they did was leave the script alone," [...] and of Patti LuPone he exclaimed, [...] "She's a star <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> walks on stage".|$|E
2500|$|John's Gospel records her {{presence}} {{at the beginning and}} end of his public life. Particularly significant is Mary's {{presence at the}} Cross, when she received from her dying Son the charge to be mother to the beloved disciple and, in him, to all Christians. The Acts of the Apostles expressly numbers the Mother of Jesus among the women of the first community awaiting Pentecost. John Eudes wrote that: [...] "The Virgin Mary began to cooperate in the plan of salvation, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> gave her consent to the Incarnation of the Son of God".|$|E
2500|$|Dagmar was warmly welcomed in Kronstadt by Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaevich of Russia {{and escorted}} to St. Petersburg, {{where she was}} greeted by her future {{mother-in-law}} and sister-in-law on 24 September. On the 29th, she made her formal entry in to the Russian capital dressed in a Russian national costume in blue and gold and traveled with the Empress to the Winter Palace where she {{was introduced to the}} Russian public on a balcony. Catherine Radziwill described the occasion: ”rarely has a foreign princess been greeted with such enthusiasm… <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> set foot on Russian soil, succeeded in winning to herself all hearts. Her smile, the delightful way she had of bowing to the crowds…, laid immediately the foundation of …popularity” ...|$|E

In the summer of 2005 her debut album Away from Here was released. The album {{contains}} twelve tracks, all written by Ann.|$|R
60|$|She {{said those}} words {{without looking at}} him; her eyes were resting on Iris now. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> when <b>she</b> had seen the two together, she {{knew that it was}} all over; further denial in the face of plain proofs would be useless indeed! Submission was the one {{alternative}} left.|$|R

If the cliffs rise as here sheer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> strikes will be the last for all of us; but if the rocks are, as in some places, piled high {{at the foot of the}} cliffs, a few may {{possibly}} manage to leap from her forecastle as she strikes and to clamber up." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> {{arrived in}} Sweden, Louisa Ulrika engaged in {{political}} activity. Her political ideal was absolute monarchy, and she disliked the Swedish constitutional monarchy {{from the moment}} it was explained to her. She also disliked the system of legal justice. When she, at one point, thought herself exposed to a plot, she wrote: [...] "The laws are so strange, and one does not dare to arrest someone on mere suspicion without proof, which benefit the individual more than the Kingdom." [...] She respected the political ability of Carl Gustaf Tessin, and identified him as an ally in her wish to increase royal power. At Christmas 1744, she visited Tessin {{and gave him a}} lantern in the guise of the goddess Diana with the inscription: [...] "Made only to shed light on the political system of the day".|$|E
2500|$|Ernestine Rose gave {{a speech}} about loss of {{identity}} in marriage that Davis later characterized as [...] "unsurpassed". Rose said of woman that [...] "At marriage she loses her entire identity, and her being {{is said to have}} become merged in her husband. Has nature thus merged it? Has she ceased to exist and feel pleasure and pain? When she violates the laws of her being, does her husband pay the penalty? When she breaks the moral law does he suffer the punishment? When he satisfies his wants, is it enough to satisfy her nature?...What an inconsistency that <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> enters the compact in which she assumes the high responsibility of wife and mother, she ceases legally to exist and becomes a purely submissive being. Blind submission in women is considered a virtue, while submission to wrong is itself wrong, and resistance to wrong is virtue alike in women as in man." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameZone's Ben PerLee {{wrote that}} GLaDOS was the [...] "much {{brighter}} {{star of the}} franchise" [...] compared to Chell due to her role in Portal. He also wrote [...] "the player’s interaction with her is absolutely amazing to watch. She is as vindictive and bitchy as ever, coating pure unadulterated hatred with a veneer of cool science" [...] and that [...] "for fans of GLaDOS, her return from her unfortunate death in the previous Portal is fabulous, and her literal transformation within the game will shock, wow, and humor even jaded gamers tired of cake quotes". PC Gamers Dan Stapleton wrote that [...] "evil robot GLaDOS is in top politely murderous form right <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> appears on screen" [...] and that [...] "Portals show-stealing monotone antagonist is challenged for the spotlight by Wheatley". He compared her to Cave Johnson, who has a similar [...] "comically sociopathic approach to science". Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis wrote [...] "it would be charitable to characterize GlaDOS as indignantly sociopathic, and her lust for punishing you for your past transgressions is riper than ever".|$|E
60|$|And therefore, {{everything}} went charmingly at the Town Hall. The medical board were charming to her--charming.

60|$|The {{woman in}} the poor black {{garments}} changed her position for the first time. She moved slowly {{across the room to}} the place at which Lady Janet was sitting, and addressed her respectfully with perfect self-possession of manner.

6000|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> {{thus began}} to {{question}} her, however, Isabel drew back; she disengaged her hand, which the Countess had affectionately taken.

Out {{of the corner of her}} eye she inspected these two men.|$|R
