5|$|Republican leaders {{struggled}} {{to come to}} terms with popular sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist Tan Malaka, spread the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by the Indonesian pemuda. Sukarno and Hatta, in contrast, were more interested in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy. Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.|$|E
5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the move}} to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, the menu and wine list were {{expanded}} once more. White sought to have a far wider range of wine than at other three Michelin star restaurants; one example given was that while a different restaurant might have four or five bottles of Pétrus, the Oak Room list had more than 70 different vintages. There was a collection of Château d'Yquem listed over five pages going back to 1850. By November 1997, the wine cellar was valued at £1.5 million, with an average weekly taking on wine alone between £25,000 and £30,000. The menu was changed to include more table service, such as meat carvings. The other courses and side dishes were carried from the kitchen on silver platters. The <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would provide entertainment for all diners, {{even if they did}} not order a course with table service.|$|E
5|$|Investigation on this {{reaction}} was continued; {{the research was}} aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 ms and 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity could come from a transfer reaction and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} yield ratio for {{this reaction}} was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction. The <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> synthesis reaction was indeed a (22Ne,xn) reaction was supported by research on reactions of the 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because {{he was trying to}} show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} once called the golden honeyeater {{as it was}} {{considered}} to be a honeyeater (Meliphagidae). It was placed within the genus Ptilotis by French naturalist Émile Oustalet when he described the species in 1889; that genus is now considered defunct and is no longer used. It was subsequently moved into the genus Cleptornis, which had been provisionally established by Oustalet in case the species proved to be distinct. Behavioural and morphological characteristics led American ornithologist Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr., to suggest in 1987 that it was related to the white-eyes. Subsequent studies have supported the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> species was a white-eye. It is possibly most closely related to the Micronesian white-eyes of the genus Rukia, or the monotypic Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron), another species once placed with the honeyeaters and subsequently moved to the white-eyes. The golden white-eye has a long 10th primary feather (one of the flight feathers), unlike other white-eyes where that primary is reduced or absent, which has led to the alternative suggestion that it is basal (an early offshoot) among the white-eyes.|$|E
25|$|At Astoria a {{peaceful}} celebration of Fidesz started. Despite their readiness (during the previous few days, hundreds of policemen {{were called in}} from {{the country to the}} city), police did little to defend the crush of radical anti-government protests that took place only 300–500 metres away and pressed nearer and nearer by police's gas attacks in the wide Erzsébet Boulevard. That night and the next day many political analysts and congressmen brought up the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> police behaviour was not by chance. Fidesz celebration, with a participation of thousands, ended at 18:00. That crowd could not be disbanded at all when police started a horse assault on Deák Square protesters. They used gun shells too.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{originated}} at a terminus {{near the}} Raymond Station by the Raymond Hotel {{which was the}} premier Pasadena winter residence for many eastern magnates. The rails roughly paralleled Fair Oaks Avenue, then crossed Lincoln Avenue to the east then again {{to the west and}} headed toward the Arroyo Seco. It turned northward to an area called Las Casitas (the little houses) then swung wide to the east to an alignment with today's Harriet Street in Altadena and ran between Mendocino and Calaveras streets to a terminus on Lake Avenue which would align with the present-day Altadena Post Office building. This right-of-way agrees with the original plan of a railroad on Woodbury's 1887 plot map, and lends support to the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> railroad had greater purpose than that of appeasing a couple of millionaires, even though they were often the only riders.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} is a very rare example of a complete small medieval country house, an oblong structure on two floors, the upper floor containing a hall, solar and bedroom, while the lower floor for servants had no internal means of reaching the upper floor, to which access was only obtained by a newel staircase in a turret with only an external entrance. The house, obviously designed for a person of refinement, had unusually good sanitation {{in the form of}} two garderobes; the wooden chutes were still in existence in the early 20th century. The siting of the garderobes here facing the church reinforces the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was considered the rear of the house; an arrangement such as this would not have been made if this were in fact the Priest's house. In the 17th century the Priest's house's principal room, on the upper storey, was given a decorative plaster ceiling.|$|E
