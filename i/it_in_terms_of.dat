5|$|In 1027, the Persian naturalist, Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in Europe), {{proposed}} {{an explanation of}} how the stoniness of fossils was caused in The Book of Healing. He modified an idea of Aristotle's, which explained <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> vaporous exhalations. Ibn Sina modified this into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus), which was elaborated on by Albert of Saxony in the 14th century and was accepted in some form by most naturalists by the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, even {{cars and}} {{motorcycles}} {{were allowed to}} open the road for the competitors. In 1900, the race was within a hair's breadth of disappearing, with only 19 riders at the start. The following year, the organisation therefore decided to allow help only from pacers on bicycles. And in 1910, help from pacers were stopped for good. An option which lifted Paris–Roubaix out of the background and pushed <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> interest, ahead of the prestigious Bordeaux–Paris.|$|E
5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

However the congress was held as scheduled, and was addressed by Sukarno himself. In 1960 Sukarno launched the slogan Nasakom, an abbreviation of Nasionalisme (Nationalism), Agama (Religion), Komunisme (Communism). Thus the role of PKI as a junior partner in the Sukarno polity was institutionalized.

25|$|Internet {{linguistics}} is {{a domain}} of linguistics {{advocated by the}} English linguist David Crystal.

25|$|Another {{strand of}} {{opposition}} to Malthus's ideas started {{in the middle of}} the 19th century with the writings of Friedrich Engels (Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy, 1844) and Karl Marx (Capital, 1867). Engels and Marx argued that what Malthus saw as the problem of the pressure of population on the means of production actually represented the pressure of the means of production on population. They thus viewed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> their concept of the reserve army of labour. In other words, the seeming excess of population that Malthus attributed to the seemingly innate disposition of the poor to reproduce beyond their means actually emerged as a product of the very dynamic of capitalist economy.|$|E
25|$|Brazil generates nearly three-quarters (73%) of its {{electricity}} from hydropower. This contribution was {{as high as}} four-fifths in 2010 but the share of hydropower has been eroded {{by a combination of}} declining rainfall and ageing hydroelectric plants, many of which date back to the 1960s and 1970s. Intensive use of thermoelectric power plants operating on fossil fuels has compensated for much of the loss, since the share of new sources of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, in the energy mix remains small. Moreover, although Brazil has made great strides in the use of bioethanol in transportation, there has been little focus on research and innovation in energy generation, be <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> developing new sources of energy or improving energy efficiency. In light of the foregoing, there is little reason to expect public investment in energy R to rebound to the levels seen {{at the turn of the}} century that would rebuild Brazil’s international competitiveness in this field.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, {{city council}} {{approved}} converting one-way arteries {{through the city}} centre to allow for two-way traffic, {{to make it easier}} for people to make their way around the city to explore <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> urban planning and use, two-way traffic improves circulation within the area. The city wanted to improve downtown as a destination, rather than a place to pass through. The council also want to have downtown St. Catharines on the Wine Route, a driving tour of Niagara wineries and an Ontario Wine Council initiative to boost the number of visitors to the region's many wineries. The Wine Route was modified to officially redirect winery goers through the downtown starting in 2012. The first phase of two-way traffic was completed in 2009, with St. Paul and King streets being converted. The cost of the conversion was $3.5million and was shared with Niagara Region. In 2012, most observers concluded that the change had achieved its goals; it garnered national media attention.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama Number 96, a {{nighttime}} series produced by Cash Harmon Television for Network Ten, which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with {{such topics as}} homosexuality, adultery, drug use, rape-within-marriage and racism, which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, Number 96 had become Australia's highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of Number 96 prompted the creation of The Box, which rivaled <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by Crawford Productions, many critics considered The Box {{to be a more}} slickly produced and better written show than Number 96. The Box also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to run right after Number 96. For 1974 Number 96 was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year The Box occupied the number two spot.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong {{attended}} the day's meetings. The Program of Seminars ends {{on this day}} and delegates discussed {{about the future of}} global economy, poverty and the future of Asia. Ministers {{of the members of the}} International Monetary Fund approved a plan to give more powers and voting rights to People's Republic of China, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. This vote had 90.6% of the members supporting the move. However, the IMF remains dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan. China has less power in the IMF, although its economy is larger than Belgium and Netherlands combined. The IMF and World Bank have been criticised by Brazil, Argentina, Asian and African nations for prescribing severe belt-tightening measures during their economic crisis. The American government sees the reform of the IMF to redress global economic imbalances, which were cited as one of the biggest menaces to world growth. The IMF is stepping up in its financial surveillance through multilateral consultations to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank see the need to combat corruption in developing countries. The World Bank will work with developing countries by working with countries or offered through projects on the countries itself. Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most important thing is to take the principles in the paper, applying <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> budget allocation. Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations. African nations also called for more voting rights in the IMF for countries in their continent, at forums held in Africa itself.|$|E
