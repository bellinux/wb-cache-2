5|$|The basal ganglia, {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen and <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|A pallidotomy {{involves}} {{the destruction of}} the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> in particular the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> interna, in patients with Parkinson's who suffer from rigidity and akinesia.|$|E
25|$|The names {{given to}} the various nuclei of the basal ganglia are {{different}} in different species. In cats and rodents the internal <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> {{is known as the}} entopeduncular nucleus. In birds the striatum is called the paleostriatum augmentatum and the external <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> is called the paleostriatum primitivum.|$|E
25|$|Target {{areas for}} DBS or lesions include the thalamus, the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> (the lesion {{technique}} being called pallidotomy), or the subthalamic nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} {{and frequency}} of outbursts can also be decreased by surgically disabling nuclei in the thalamus, the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> and the cingulate cortex.|$|E
25|$|Fast spiking. Some neurons are {{notable for}} their high firing rates, for example {{some types of}} {{cortical}} inhibitory interneurons, cells in <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> retinal ganglion cells.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds {{to other}} molecules such as myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Exposures to carbon monoxide may cause significant {{damage to the}} heart and central nervous system, especially to the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> often with long-term chronic pathological conditions. Carbon monoxide may have severe adverse effects on the fetus of a pregnant woman.|$|E
25|$|Expression of QSER1 is seen {{at levels}} lower than 50% in many tissues. However, notable {{expression}} {{is seen in}} skeletal muscle, the appendix, trigeminal ganglia, cerebellum peduncles, pons, spinal cord, ciliary ganglion, <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> subthalamic nucleus, dorsal root ganglion, fetal liver, adrenal gland, ovary, uterus corpus, cardiac myocytes, the atrioventricular node, skin, pituitary gland, tongue, early erythroid progenitors, and tonsil.|$|E
25|$|The {{subthalamic nucleus}} is a diencephalic gray matter {{portion of the}} basal ganglia, and the only portion of the ganglia that {{produces}} an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. The role of the subthalamic nucleus is to stimulate the SNr-GPi complex and {{it is part of}} the indirect pathway. The subthalamic nucleus receives inhibitory input from the external part of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> and sends excitatory input to the GPi.|$|E
25|$|The {{nomenclature}} of the {{basal ganglia}} {{system and its}} components has always been problematic. Early anatomists, seeing the macroscopic anatomical structure but knowing nothing of the cellular architecture or neurochemistry, grouped together components that are now believed to have distinct functions (such as {{the internal and external}} segments of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus),</b> and gave distinct names to components that are now thought to be functionally parts of a single structure (such as the caudate nucleus and putamen).|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both {{of which}} originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). These projections are inhibitory and {{have been found to}} utilize both GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway, which projects to the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> external (GPe), is also inhibitory and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the inhibitory striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes disinhibition of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr inhibitory projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb motor output, hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{executive}} dysfunction, deficits {{are attributed to}} either frontal lobe damage or dysfunction, or to disruption in fronto-subcortical connectivity. Neuroimaging with PET and fMRI has confirmed the relationship between executive function and functional frontal pathology. Neuroimaging studies have also suggested that some constituent functions are not discretely localized in prefrontal regions. Functional imaging studies using different tests of executive function have implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex {{to be the primary}} site of cortical activation during these tasks. In addition, PET studies of patients with Parkinson’s disease have suggested that tests of executive function are associated with abnormal function in the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> and appear to be the genuine result of basal ganglia damage.|$|E
25|$|Staining and {{labeling}} {{techniques are}} often used in microscopy to help identify specific structures in a cell. Staining usually {{involves the use of}} dyes that are absorbed by various cell structures at different rates. Labeling involves the use of fluorescence to identify specific molecules. Fluorophores, fluorescent molecules, may be directly attached or attached to an antibody in order to detect a specific target. In the case of dendritic spikes, staining and labeling are used to identify and quantify the presence of certain voltage-gated channels. For example, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptide sequences have been used to identify the presence of Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 sodium channels in dendrites of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> neuron.|$|E
25|$|Forward {{propagation}} of dendritic spikes is initiated due to synaptic activity. Forward propagation serves to amplify signals {{that may not}} reach the soma through normal passive transmission. The strength of synaptic stimulation required to generate a dendritic spike varies among neuronal types. Neurons which receive relatively few inputs cannot rely on spatial summation and therefore must rely on stronger synaptic inputs. Some relatively unbranched neurons, such as the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> neuron, bypass the need of strong synaptic input by increased concentrations of voltage-gated sodium channels at the synapse. Other more branched neurons, such as the pyramidal neurons, rely on spatial summation of multiple inputs to generate forward propagating dendritic spikes. Forward propagation is not well understood and much research {{is devoted to the}} subject. It is thought by most experts that this phenomenon does not occur in neurons outside of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Distribution of {{voltage-gated}} sodium channels {{along the}} dendritic membrane plays {{a crucial role}} in a dendrites ability to propagate a signal. High dendritic membrane thresholds often make it harder for initiation of dendritic spikes. However, increased density of voltage-gated sodium channels may reduce the amplitude of a signal needed to initiate a spike. Clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels have been observed at the synapses of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> neuron. It has also been demonstrated through dendritic computational models that the threshold amplitude of a synaptic conductance needed to generate a dendritic spike is significantly less if the voltage-gated sodium channels are clustered at the synapse. The same type of voltage-gated channels may differ in distribution between the soma and dendrite within the same neuron. There seems to be no general pattern of distribution for voltage-gated channels within dendrites. Different neuronal dendrites exhibit different density patterns which are subject to change during development and can be modulated by neurotransmitters.|$|E
25|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} is {{the other}} chief complication {{that leads to the}} basal ganglia damage associated with this condition. Jaundice is caused by hyperbilirubinemia, or abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is usually bound to albumin immediately and sent to the liver. However, in neonatal jaundice, the concentration of bilirubin overwhelms that of albumin and some of the bilirubin remains unconjugated and can enter the brain through the blood–brain barrier. Normally bilirubin {{would not be able to}} diffuse across the blood–brain barrier, but in infants, the barrier is immature and has higher permeability. Bilirubin is toxic as it prevents the phosphorylation of many proteins, including synapsin I which binds vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, it directly inhibits the exocytosis of neurotransmitters and severely hinders the synapses it affects. In autopsies of children who suffered from neonatal jaundice, chronic changes of neuronal loss, gliosis and demyelination were observed in the basal ganglia and more specifically within the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus.</b>|$|E
500|$|Treating motor {{symptoms}} with {{surgery was}} once a common practice, but since the discovery of levodopa, the number of operations has declined. Studies {{in the past few}} decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient. Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups: lesional and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Target areas for DBS or lesions include the thalamus, the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> [...] or the subthalamic nucleus. [...] Deep brain stimulation is the most commonly used surgical treatment, developed in the 1980s by Alim Louis Benabid and others. It involves the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication, as long as they do not have severe [...] problems. Other, less common, surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific [...] areas. For example, pallidotomy involves surgical destruction of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> to control dyskinesia.|$|E
500|$|MRI {{studies have}} found a smaller brain volume and larger ventricles in people with schizophreniahowever {{researchers}} {{do not know if}} the shrinkage is from the schizophrenia or from the medication. The hippocampus and thalamus {{have been shown to be}} reduced in volume; and the volume of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> is increased. Cortical [...] patterns are altered, and a reduction in the volume and thickness of the cortex particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes has been noted. It has further been proposed that many of the changes seen are present at the start of the disorder which gives weight to the theory that there is abnormal neurodevelopment.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{components}} of the basal ganglia– as defined functionally– are the striatum; both dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and [...] ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle), <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> ventral pallidum, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. Each of these components has a complex internal anatomical and neurochemical organization. The largest component, the striatum (dorsal and ventral), receives input from many brain areas beyond the basal ganglia, but only sends output to other {{components of the}} basal ganglia. The pallidum receives input from the striatum, and sends inhibitory output {{to a number of}} motor-related areas. The substantia nigra {{is the source of the}} striatal input of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays an important role in basal ganglia function. The subthalamic nucleus receives input mainly from the striatum and cerebral cortex, and projects to the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{anatomical}} link of the striatum {{with its}} primary targets, the pallidum and the substantia nigra, was discovered later. The name <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> was attributed by Déjerine to Burdach (1822). For this, the Vogts proposed the simpler [...] "pallidum". [...] The term [...] "locus niger" [...] {{was introduced by}} Félix Vicq-d'Azyr as tache noire in (1786), though that structure has since {{become known as the}} substantia nigra, due to contributions by Von Sömmering in 1788. The structural similarity between the substantia nigra and <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> was noted by Mirto in 1896. Together, the two are known as the pallidonigral ensemble, which represents the core of the basal ganglia. Altogether, the main structures of the basal ganglia are linked to each other by the striato-pallido-nigral bundle, which passes through the pallidum, crosses the internal capsule as the [...] "comb bundle of Edinger", then finally reaches the substantia nigra.|$|E
2500|$|The {{striatum}} {{is composed}} mostly of medium spiny neurons. [...] These GABAergic projection neurons project {{to the external}} (lateral) <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> and internal (medial) <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> {{as well as the}} substantia nigra pars reticulata. [...] The projections into the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> and substantia nigra are primarily dopaminergic, although enkephalin, dynorphin and substance P are expressed. [...] The striatum also contains interneurons that are classified into nitrergic neurons (due to use of nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter), tonically active [...] cholinergic interneurons, parvalbumin-expressing neurons and calretinin-expressing neurons. [...] The dorsal striatum receives significant glutamatergic inputs from the cortex, as well as dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra pars compacta. [...] The dorsal striatum is generally considered to be involved in sensorimotor activities. [...] The ventral striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from the limbic areas as well as dopaminergic inputs from the VTA, via the mesolimbic pathway. The ventral striatum is believed {{to play a role in}} reward and other limbic functions. [...] The dorsal striatum is divided into the caudate and putamen by the internal capsule while the ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The caudate has three primary regions of connectivity, with the head of the caudate demonstrating connectivity to the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and amygdala. [...] The body and tail show differentiation between the dorsolateral rim and ventral caudate, projecting to the sensorimotor and limbic regions of the striatum respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex, <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> thalamus, and cerebellum show higher activation during recall {{than during}} recognition {{which suggests that}} these components of the cerebello-frontal pathway {{play a role in}} recall processes that they do not in recognition. Although recall and recognition are considered separate processes, {{it should be noted that}} they are both most likely constitute components of distributed networks of brain regions.|$|E
2500|$|The pallidum {{consists}} of a large structure called the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> ("pale globe") together with a smaller ventral extension called the ventral pallidum. [...] The <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> appears as a single neural mass, but {{can be divided into}} two functionally distinct parts, called the internal (or medial) and external (lateral) segments, abbreviated GPi and GPe. Both segments contain primarily GABAergic neurons, which therefore have inhibitory effects on their targets. The two segments participate in distinct neural circuits. The GPe, receives input mainly from the striatum, and projects to the subthalamic nucleus. The GPi, receives signals from the striatum via the [...] "direct" [...] and [...] "indirect" [...] pathways. Pallidal neurons operate using a disinhibition principle. These neurons fire at steady high rates in the absence of input, and signals from the striatum cause them to pause or reduce their rate of firing. Because pallidal neurons themselves have inhibitory effects on their targets, the net effect of striatal input to the pallidum is a reduction of the tonic inhibition exerted by pallidal cells on their targets (disinhibition) with an increased rate of firing in the targets.|$|E
2500|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is {{a technique}} that uses electrodes placed in the brain to modify brain activity by sending a constant electrical signal to the nearby nuclei. Treatment of muscle tone issues via deep brain stimulation typically targets the global pallidus and has shown to significantly improve symptoms associated with ADCP. The specific mechanism by which DBS affects ADCP is unclear. [...] DBS of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> interna improves dystonia in people with dyskinetic CP in 40% of cases, perhaps due to variation in basal ganglia injuries.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{models of}} basal ganglia {{circuits}} and function have been proposed, however {{there have been}} questions raised about the strict divisions of the direct and indirect pathways, their possible overlap and regulation. [...] The circuitry models has evolved since the first proposed model in the 1990s by DeLong in the parallel processing model, in which the cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta project into the dorsal striatum giving rise to an inhibitory indirect and excitatory direct pathway. [...] The inhibitory indirect pathway involved the inhibition of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> externus, allowing for the disinhibition of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> internus allowing it to inhibit the thalamus. [...] The direct or excitatory pathway involved the disinhibition of the thalamus through the inhibition of the GPe/SNr. [...] However {{the speed of the}} direct pathway would not be concordant with the indirect pathway in this model leading to problems with it. [...] To get over this, a hyperdirect pathway where the cortex sends glutamatergic projections through the subthalamic nucleus exciting the inhibitory GPe under the center surround model, as well as a shorter indirect pathway have been proposed. [...] Generally, the basal ganglia circuitry is divided into a limbic, two associative(prefrontal), an oculomotor and one motor pathway. [...] The motor and oculomotor are sometimes grouped into one motor pathway. [...] The 5 general pathways go as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|A clear {{emergent}} {{issue in}} comparative {{anatomy of the}} basal ganglia {{is the development of}} this system through phylogeny as a convergent cortically re-entrant loop in conjunction with the development and expansion of the cortical mantle. There is controversy, however, regarding the extent to which convergent selective processing occurs versus segregated parallel processing within re-entrant closed loops of the basal ganglia. Regardless, the transformation of the basal ganglia into a cortically re-entrant system in mammalian evolution occurs through a re-direction of pallidal (or [...] "paleostriatum primitivum") output from midbrain targets such as the superior colliculus, as occurs in sauropsid brain, to specific regions of the ventral thalamus and from there back to specified regions of the cerebral cortex that form a subset of those cortical regions projecting into the striatum. The abrupt rostral re-direction of the pathway from the internal segment of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> into the ventral thalamus—via the path of the ansa lenticularis—could be viewed as a footprint of this evolutionary transformation of basal ganglia outflow and targeted influence.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of tics {{present in}} {{conditions}} such as Tourette’s syndrome begins with patient, relative, teacher and peer education about {{the presentation of the}} tics. [...] Sometimes, pharmacological treatment is unnecessary and tics can be reduced by behavioral therapy such as habit-reversal therapy and/or counseling. [...] Often this route of treatment is difficult because it depends most heavily on patient compliance. [...] Once pharmacological treatment is deemed most appropriate, lowest effective doses should be given first with gradual increases. [...] The most effective drugs belong to the neuroleptic variety such as monoamine-depleting drugs and dopamine receptor-blocking drugs. [...] Of the monoamine-depleting drugs, tetrabenazine is most powerful against tics and results in fewest side effects. [...] A non-neuroleptic drug found to be safe and effective in treating tics is topiramate. Botulinum toxin injection in affected muscles can successfully treat tics; involuntary movements and vocalizations can be reduced, as well as life-threatening tics that have the potential of causing compressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. Surgical treatment for disabling Tourette’s syndrome has been proven effective in cases presenting with self-injury. [...] Deep Brain Stimulation surgery targeting the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> thalamus and other areas of the brain may be effective in treating involuntary and possibly life-threatening tics.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{dystonia}} {{is aimed at}} reducing symptoms such as involuntary movements, pain, contracture, embarrassment, and to restore normal posture and improve the patient’s function. [...] This treatment is therefore not neuroprotective. [...] According to the European Federation of Neurological Sciences and Movement Disorder Society, there is no evidence-based recommendation for treating primary dystonia with antidopaminergic or anticholinergic drugs although recommendations {{have been based on}} empirical evidence. [...] Anticholinergic drugs prove to be most effective in treating generalized and segmental dystonia, especially if dose starts out low and increases gradually. [...] Generalized dystonia has also been treated with such muscle relaxants as the benzodiazepines. [...] Another muscle relaxant, baclofen, can help reduce spasticity seen in cerebral palsy such as dystonia in the leg and trunk. [...] Treatment of secondary dystonia by administering levodopa in dopamine-responsive dystonia, copper chelation in Wilson’s disease, or stopping the administration of drugs that may induce dystonia have been proven effective in a small number of cases. [...] Physical therapy has been used to improve posture and prevent contractures via braces and casting, although in some cases, immobilization of limbs can induce dystonia, which is by definition known as peripherally induced dystonia. [...] There are not many clinical trials that show significant efficacy for particular drugs, so medical of dystonia must be planned on a case-by-case basis. Botulinum toxin B, or Myobloc, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat cervical dystonia due to level A evidential support by the scientific community. Surgery known as GPi DBS (<b>Globus</b> <b>Pallidus</b> Pars Interna Deep Brain Stimulation) has come to be popular in treating phasic forms of dystonia, although cases involving posturing and tonic contractions have improved to a lesser extent with this surgery. [...] A follow-up study has found that movement score improvements observed one year after the surgery was maintained after three years in 58% of the cases. [...] It has also been proven effective in treating cervical and cranial-cervical dystonia.|$|E
5000|$|The lateral <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> (or {{external}} <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> GPe) combines {{with the}} medial <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> {{to form the}} <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> an anatomical subset of the basal ganglia. <b>Globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> means [...] "pale globe" [...] in Latin, indicating its appearance. The lateral <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> is the segment of the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> that is relatively further (lateral) from the midline of the brain.|$|E
50|$|The {{projections}} of the external <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> to the subthalamic nuclei causes these neurons to increase their firing rate, since the <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> neurons are inhibited by medium spiny neurons. The subthalamic nuclei have excitatory projections to the internal <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> thus causing the internal <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> neurons to increase their inhibititory influence on SNr and VTh.|$|E
50|$|The lateral <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> {{contains}} GABAergic neurons, {{which allow}} for its inhibitory function. The lateral <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> GABAergic neurons extend axons to the subthalamic nucleus (in the dicencephalon), the striatum, medial <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus</b> and substantia nigra pars reticulata.|$|E
5000|$|In primates, the dorsal pallidum, or <b>globus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> {{is divided}} into two parts by the medial {{medullary}} lamina.
