He was one of eleven workers in the developing department, but only three of them actually worked, the others being members of the company baseball team.

His job involved drying 200-foot lengths of film on a roller three metres long and two metres high, and he learned the relationship between the pieces of film he was drying and the scripts he read.|$|E

500|$|To {{voice the}} central {{character}} of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character. Initially, Hillenburg {{wanted to use the}} name SpongeBoy— the character would have had no last name, and the series would have been called SpongeBoy Ahoy! However, the Nickelodeon legal department discovered— after voice acting had been completed for the original seven-minute pilot episode— that the name [...] "SpongeBoy" [...] was already in use for a mop product. A {{character of the}} same name was also already trademarked by Flaming Carrot Comics creator Bob Burden. In choosing a replacement name, Hillenburg felt that he still had to use the word [...] "Sponge", so that viewers would not mistake the character for a [...] "Cheese Man". He settled on the name [...] "SpongeBob". [...] "SquarePants" [...] was then chosen as a family name after Kenny saw a picture of the character and remarked, [...] "Boy, look at this sponge in square pants, thinking he can <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> a fast food place." [...] Hillenburg loved the phrase upon hearing Kenny say it and felt that it would reinforce the character's nerdiness.|$|E

They have a good time until Artie tricks Marge into making out with him against her will in a re-enactement of their prom during the 1970s made to mirror the one they attended in [...] "The Way We Was" [...] (with even its original attendants who were paid by Artie to show up disguised as they were at that time).

2500|$|Bowie Kuhn {{replaced}} William Eckert as the Commissioner of Baseball in 1969. In {{the wake}} of Ted Williams' 1966 Hall of Fame induction speech urging the induction of Negro leaguers, and {{on the recommendation of}} the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Kuhn empowered a ten-man committee to sift through hundreds of names and nominate the first group of four Negro league players to go to the Hall of Fame. Because Paige pitched in Greensboro in 1966, he would not have been eligible for enshrinement until 1971, as players have to be out of professional baseball {{for at least five years}} before they can be elected. All of the men on the committee agreed that Paige had to be the first Negro league player to get elected, so this gave Kuhn plenty of time to create some sort of Negro league branch in the Hall of Fame. On February 9, 1971, Kuhn announced that Paige would be the first member of the Negro wing of the Hall of Fame. Because many in the press saw the suggestion of a [...] "Negro wing" [...] as separate-but-equal and denounced major league baseball for the idea, by the time that Paige's induction came around on August 9, Kuhn convinced the owners and the private trust of the Hall of Fame that there should be no separate wing after all. It was decided that all who had been chosen and all who would be chosen would get their plaques in the [...] "regular" [...] section of the Hall of Fame. Paige could not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the major leagues after part of his HOF induction speech was misinterpreted as bitter anger, instead of grateful, by the still largely white baseball elite. Satchel enjoyed a brief run of renewed popularity after his HOF induction appearing on a few TV shows and making the rounds of the Major Leagues Old Timers Games Circuit. After the buzz died down he took a job with the Tulsa Oilers minor league team in the early 1970s as their pitching coach. During the mid-to-late 1970s he finally slowed down his traveling ways making only occasional personal appearances at mostly minor league stadiums and banquets. In 1980 Satchel was named vice-president of the Triple-A Springfield Cardinals, although it was mostly an honorary position.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Phineas Taylor (P.T.) Barnum {{introduces}} his circus acts as he stands in front of a tent, proclaiming [...] "There Is a Sucker Born Ev'ry Minute". He loves spectacle and excitement, using hype and [...] "humbug" [...] to promote his exhibits. His wife Charity disagrees with his use of [...] "humbug" [...] but loves him and aims to keep him grounded. Barnum then introduces the oldest woman alive, Joice Heth, and thanks to some Barnum humbug she becomes a success ("Thank God I'm Old"). His wife Charity ("Chairy") urges him to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> a factory, but Barnum refuses ("The Colors of My Life [...] ") and Charity wryly admits and accepts the disparity between their views ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum enlists clowns to help in building a museum to house his attractions (with expected comical results) and it's up to Charity to encourage him to keep going ("One Brick at a Time"), with the result that [...] "everything about [...] museum was spectacular" [...] ("Museum Song"); however, the museum burns down accidentally. Barnum finds two new star attractions, Tom Thumb, who appears to advise that [...] "Bigger Isn't Better", and Jumbo the elephant. Barnum then becomes manager of the famous Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All"). Barnum becomes enamored of her and sees the attraction of going on tour with her ("Out There"). He accompanies Jenny on tour, leaving Charity behind, as a marching band greets them ("Come Follow the Band"). Although all seems to be going well for Barnum, he finds that without Charity in his life he is miserable, and he decides to break ties with Jenny and return home to the woman he loves ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All [...] "). Upon his return to Charity, he promises to live the more sedate life she desires for him, in [...] "Black and White." [...] After a failed stint running a clockworks factory and a failed attempt to build his own city, he turns to politics; when his campaign looks doomed to fail due to lack of interest, Charity realizes how important his talents and passion are in his life and allows him to inject color and life into his campaign. He is elected Mayor of Bridgeport, {{and the two of them}} recognize the value in each other's approach to life and how they complement one another ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum is prepared to run for President, but his beloved Charity dies suddenly, leaving Barnum bereft and alone. When Barnum finds himself cheated of the Presidential nomination by his political party, he laments his position, realizes that his talent for Humbug will never leave him and wishes to [...] "make it right, shoot a rocket, shine a light" [...] ("Prince of Humbug"). James Anthony Bailey arrives and offers him the chance to [...] "Join the Circus". Initially resisting, he relents (thanks in part to Charity's two-headed coin, which she has used to humbug him throughout the show) and joins Bailey, and they form the famous circus Barnum and Bailey.|$|E
