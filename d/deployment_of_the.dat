Reagan ordered a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces and implemented new policies towards the Soviet Union: reviving the B-1 Lancer program that had been canceled by the Carter administration, and producing the MX missile. In response to Soviet <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS-20, Reagan oversaw NATO's <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pershing missile in West Germany.|$|E

The plan envisioned the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole force in waves, as divisions completed their training, with the final divisions not being deployed until a year had elapsed from the outbreak of war. As a result, the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from France during May and June 1940.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{twenty years}} after the battle, President Ivo Josipović {{presented}} the Charter of the Republic of Croatia to the commanders and units involved in the battle, commending their military achievements.

5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their course of action.

The race was neutralised by the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safety car after Kamui Kobayashi and Bruno Senna crashed on lap 31. Hamilton retired after a collision with Webber shortly after the race restarted on lap 36. Alonso maintained his lead throughout the remainder of the race despite pressure from Vettel.|$|E
5|$|Even though several special police {{units were}} {{transformed}} into the Croatian National Guard (later renamed the Croatian Army) in 1991, the special police continued to operate throughout the war as special forces units supporting virtually all army operations. The last large <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special police in the war occurred in Operation Storm in August 1995, when the force contributed 3,100 troops to the offensive. During the war, the special police units lost 179 troops killed, 790 wounded and 14 missing.|$|E
5|$|In all, Ferraro served three two-year terms, being re-elected in 1980 and 1982.

While Ferraro's pro-choice views conflicted with those of many of her constituents {{as well as the}} Catholic Church to which she belonged, her positions on other social and foreign policy issues were in alignment with the district. She broke with her party in favoring an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution. She supported <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PershingII missile and the Trident submarine, although she opposed funding for the MX missile, the B-1B bomber, and the Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1995 Split Agreement and the {{large-scale}} <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HV to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the HV General Staff planned to attack and capture a large part of eastern Herzegovina. The attackcodenamed Operation Burinwas formally ordered on 3 September 1995, and the HVO and the ARBiH were scheduled to join the attack. The operation was postponed on 17 September, but on 7 November was again ordered to be carried out should the Dayton peace talks fail. The plan was cancelled in early December 1995.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July, the RSK and the VRS militaries started Operation Sword-95, a push {{to capture}} Bihać by {{expanding}} on gains made during Operation Spider. The move provided the HV {{with a chance}} to extend their territorial gains from Operation Winter '94 by advancing from the Livno Valley. On 22 July, President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman and President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović signed the Split Agreement on mutual defence, permitting the large-scale <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April, {{given the}} {{deterioration}} in the defences around Phnom Penh, Ambassador John Gunther Dean requested the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10-man Operation Eagle Pull command element which landed at Pochentong on a BirdAir C-130 plane. The command element supervised the ongoing fixed-wing evacuation of more than 750 Cambodians {{over the next seven}} days in the face of 80–90 rounds of 105mm artillery and 107mm rocket fire each day.
