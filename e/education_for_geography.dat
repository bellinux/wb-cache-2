40|$|GeoComputation which {{attempts}} {{to integrate the}} quantitative geography and spatial visualization technology, has been very popular among GIS communities {{since the beginning of}} the 1990 s. Especially the construction of platform for spatial analysis is one of the important research topics in the advanced countries. Luc Anselin who made SpaceStat, a spatial analysis software, has played a significant role in the development of GIS, and recently the Centre for Computational Geography at the University of Leeds, GeoVISTA Center at the University of Pennsylvania and Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science in the University of California, Santa Barbara have given a great impact on the development of spatial and regional analysis using GIS. Given this background, this study tries to construct the system of integrated spatial analysis which is useful for the GIS <b>education</b> <b>for</b> <b>geography</b> majors in the university. The functions of this system that was built by using only open sources, include the mapping, spatial search, TIN, overlay, point pattern analysis, spatial autocorrelation, multivariate analysis such as regression analysis, factor analysis and cluster analysis, neural network, tessellation, and so on. This system works at Windows 98 /Me/NT/ 2000 /XP. This software is now available through the following Interne...|$|E

Still, globalization created new territories and new “borders” {{not always easy}} to cross—but they all exist and coexist giving new meanings to the idea of space appropriation.

40|$|This article studies processes, {{policies}} and practices <b>for</b> <b>geography</b> and history <b>education</b> in Estonia. The analysis covers the societal transformation period in an ethnically divided society from the 1980 s to the early 2000 s characterized by Estonia’s disintegration from the Soviet Union towards the integration to the European Union and NATO. Geography and history education curricula, textbooks and related {{policies and}} practices promoted a particular national time-space by supporting the belongingness of Estonia into Europe, rejecting connections towards Russia and suggesting a division between ethnic Estonians and ethnically non-Estonian residents of Estonia. In geography and history textbooks, the Russian-speaking population, comprising then {{almost a third of}} the entire population of Estonia, was divided into non-loyal, semi-loyal and loyal groups of whom only the latter could be integrated in the Estonian time-space. The formal <b>education</b> policies <b>for</b> <b>geography</b> and history supported Estonia’s disintegration from the Soviet past and pawed way to integration to the western political and economic structures. However, challenging market and sensitive cultural contexts created peculiar, alternative and sometimes opposing local practices in geography and history education...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} some {{pathways}} of geographical analysis will be illustrated and discussed, {{seen from a}} didactic point of view. The geographical theme chosen is that of migration. Migratory phenomena and {{the problems associated with}} it have always been a classic theme of geography; today however, they are of a particular interest and will allow us to promote a shared ethic. In this way there is <b>education</b> <b>for</b> citizenship. <b>Geography,</b> as a form of knowledge which helps us in interpreting the world, is able to educate us in an understanding of the social-economic processes that occur {{as well as in the}} construction of a sense of ‘multi-belonging. ’These issues must be dealt with and developed according to method of research and discovery in such a way that both emigration and immigration are focused on through an educational itinerary based upon theoretical reflection and on the spot experience. In fact, it illustrates the path of educational research carried out training courses for teachers who have been the laboratory to develop educational activities described. In this way the process of analysis will have both a valid formative educational and scientific value...|$|R

40|$|<b>Education</b> of <b>geography</b> <b>for</b> SLTA {{students}} (secondary school) {{is aimed}} at teaching students to behave {{as members of a}} modern Indonesian society with self-confidence and capable of solving a variety of daily-life problems both at pesent and in the. future. Some problems which arise in the Indonesian society are both of a social and physical nature. For that reason, attention should be paid to these problems in the reaching and learning materials for the SLTA, especially during the geography lessons. Moreover, geography based on the study of social and physical phenomena on a national and international level, should widen the scope of perception of the students. Concerning the criteria for lesson materials, on the one hand the geography subject should comply with the SLTA. curriculum and on the other hand, the physical and human aspects of the subject should reflect daily life realities. The materials should be taught as a whole package, not as separated fragments of physical and human aspects, to satisfy the geographical paradigm. Another aspect which should be given due consideration, is the continuation of the geography education from nursery school up to the university, with the teaching materials adjusted to the respective school levels. A well-designed balance of geography education in the school curricula and lesson materials is thought to intensify logical deductive thinking and stimulates character development of the students. It is therefore the right moment <b>for</b> <b>geography</b> teachers to reconsider the geography education in the SLTA curriculum, to improve the teaching package whenever necessary and publish books on geography topics...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{us would}} believe that changes in {{education}} filter down from influential academics or at least professional educators who from lofty motives purvey improved remedies to forge educational progress. However, educational innovation is probably, more often than not, also the result of influences stemming from social, cultural and economic changes. Specifically this {{seems to have been}} the case with the Wyndham Scheme <b>for</b> <b>education</b> in <b>Geography.</b> Rapid developments in Australian society {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century culminated in escalating retention rates for students in secondary and university education, and an explosion in the popularity of Geography as both a high school and university subject. This explosion was increasingly apparent in the decades of the 1950 's and 1960 's. The increasing popular demand, in the state of New South Wales (NSW), for secondary and higher education also primed enrolments in Geography. This increasing demand arose from a rapidly growing population, professionalism in occupations, and a general prosperity across society, and these coupled with a high spirit in society for scientific pursuits, all helped growing enrolments generally in education, and specifically in geography education...|$|R
