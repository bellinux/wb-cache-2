5|$|Once Tamar {{succeeded in}} {{consolidating}} her power {{and found a}} reliable support in David Soslan, the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli, Toreli, and other noble families, she revived the expansionist foreign policy of her predecessors. Repeated occasions of dynastic strife in Georgia combined with the efforts of regional successors of the Great Seljuq Empire, such as the Ildenizid atabegs of Azerbaijan, Shirvanshahs, and the Ahlatshahs, had slowed down the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Georgians achieved during the reigns of Tamar's great-grandfather, David IV, and her father, George III. However, the Georgians became again active under Tamar, more prominently in the second decade of her rule.|$|E

Clement IV's crowning of Charles of Anjou as King of Naples and Sicily, previously a papal fief, had cemented {{the influence of the}} French monarchy in the Italian peninsula and created an intense division within the College of Cardinals between those who opposed and supported French influence, and by extension, ultramontanism. Conradin, the last ruler of the House of Hohenstaufen, had been beheaded in Naples just a month before the death of Clement IV.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

40|$|A {{spool valve}} as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spool valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know <b>dynamic</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spool. To analyze <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spool valve, it is necessary to consider <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spool. Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the spool. <b>The</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spool is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spool, and therefore, any commercial code to calculate <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spool valve dose not exist at present. Final target {{of this study is to}} develop numerical code to predict precisely <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spool valve. As the first step, <b>dynamic</b> characteristics <b>of</b> a spool valve coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical effects have been conducted in the present paper...|$|R

25|$|Olfactory cues are {{widespread}} within {{parental care}} {{to assist in}} the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother-infant relationship, and later development of the offspring. In support of fetal olfactory learning, newborn infants display behavioral attraction to the odor of amniotic fluid. For example, babies would more often suck from a breast treated with an amount of their own amniotic fluid, rather than the alternative untreated breast. Newborns are initially attracted to their own amniotic fluid because that odor is familiar. Although exposure to amniotic fluid is eliminated after birth, breast fed babies have continued contact with cues from the mother’s nipple and areola area. This causes breast odors to become more familiar and attractive, while amniotic fluid loses its positive value. Maternal breast odors are individually distinctive, and provide a basis for recognition of the mother by her offspring.|$|E
25|$|Bucket : This {{pattern is}} similar to the bowl except that one of the planets is in the {{opposite}} hemisphere to all the others. This lone planet, or Singleton, serves as a handle, thus creating a 'bucket' form. The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong. However, what this often means is that the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them trying to fit in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. The person will probably behave according {{to the nature of the}} Singleton planet that forms the handle of the pattern. This planet will exercise a greater influence than normal in the chart, and will be an important part of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person's activities and basic energy.|$|E

40|$|Motor-driven {{flexible}} manipulator systems (MDFMSs) {{are widely}} used in industry robot fields. During the dynamic modeling, the separate investigation method which neglects <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving motor will cause an error in <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flexible manipulator, especially with high-speed operations. This paper proposes a coupled <b>dynamic</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MDFMS in which the driving motor and flexible manipulator are considered as an integrated system, which can clearly reflect <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving motor. Based on the proposed dynamic model, <b>the</b> vibration responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flexible manipulator under different velocities, accelerations and structure parameters, as well as <b>the</b> effect mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving motor on the vibration responses, are investigated.

25|$|It {{was hoped}} by {{the leaders in}} Parliament that such a {{political}} challenge would generate useful publicity ahead of the elections, with previous polls producing a low turn out with a perception of the body being powerless. In this respect the affair did generate extensive media attention with the Parliament now seeming 'dramatic'. The committee report also was written in an unusually accessible manner, filled with soundbites. Further more it also drew greater attention from the Council to a Parliament willing to exercise its powers. Hence when the Council came in {{to agree on a}} new president, {{it was clear that the}} candidate had to be acceptable to parliament. The crisis also displayed the increasing party competition within the Parliament, leading to the development of a Parliamentary system between the executive and legislative branches. Indeed, it can be seen that the government-opposition <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two main parties in Parliament aggravated the development of the crisis and contributed to the downfall of the Commission.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, the {{presence}} of a group can influence one’s perception of these two factors in a number of ways. For instance, working in a group may reduce or increase one’s expectancy of attaining a goal. That is, depending on the qualities of the group members, an individual may find themselves in a group of high achievers who work hard and are guaranteed success, whereas another may equally find themselves in a group of lazy or distracted people, making success seem unattainable. Therefore, the link between one’s personal efforts and success is not direct, as our success is influenced by the work of others. Similarly, the value of the goal may be contingent on the group members. For instance, if we must share the reaping of success with all other group members, then the value of the goal is reduced compared to the value of the goal from an individual perspective. Hence, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group is an important key in determining a person’s motivation and the likelihood of social loafing. Additional factors which have been found to influence the likelihood of social loafing include one’s gender, one’s cultural background and the complexity of the task.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the charge}} of {{vandalism}} in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent bolts and other anchors. Although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in {{the difference between life}} and death. But the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure for long periods of time, changing the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure itself. Due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the Wilderness Act. However, in 1990, there was a movement by the Forest Service and the Task Group to change the regulations to where fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. These improvements lead to protection for both the climbers and the Wilderness Act. Typically in the USA, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices. This can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route is perceived to be dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore don't require as much protection. Failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form. Even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like Yosemite National Park, many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.|$|E
