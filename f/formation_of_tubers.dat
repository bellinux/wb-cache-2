40|$|Premature <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubers</b> ('submarines') is a {{disturbance}} {{in the normal}} growth of a planted seed potato, resulting {{in the formation of}} some small daughter tubers without any aerial growth. In certain years losses may be heavy. The main cause is the formation of sprouts during storage which have to be removed. All factors preventing or reducing such sprout formation favour normal development: especially low temperature (above freezing-point) and light during storage, also late lifting of the seed tubers, large tubers, planting at higher temperature and in moist soil. The underlying process of premature tuber formation was assumed to be loss of water by removal of sprouts during storage, resulting in an increase in the concentration of solutes. Essentially the same occurs with normal tuber formation but there by an increase in assimilates. This concept was supported by plasmolysis studies in the hairs of the sprouts...|$|E

40|$|Prepared forABSTRACT: A {{simulation}} model for biomass {{dynamics of the}} submersed macrophyte Potamogeton pectinatus L. is presented. The model (POTAM) is based on carbon flow through the vegetation in meter-squared (m 2) water columns. It includes descriptions of several factors that affect biomass dynamics, such as site characteristic changes in climate, temperature, water transparency, water level, pH, and oxygen effects on CO 2 assimilation rate at light saturation, wintering strategies, mechanical control (removal of shoot biomass), and grazing. The characteristics of community and site can be easily modified by the user. POTAM incorporates insight into the processes affecting the dynamics of a sago pondweed community in relatively shallow, hard water (0. 1 - to 6 -m depth; dissolved inorganic carbon concentration> 0. 8 mmol and pH> 6), under ample supply of nitrogen and phosphorus in a pest-, disease-, and competitor-free environment under the prevailing weather conditions. It has been calibrated on data pertaining to a sago pondweed community in the Western Canal near Zandvoort, The Netherlands. At this site, growth starts from the subterranean tubers alone. Plant biomass usually peaks once a year, in July, and intensive downward transport of soluble carbohydrates occurs after anthesis, used for the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubers</b> that grow into the sediment.

To investigate the roles of FRKs in cassava tuber root development, seven FRK genes (MeFRK 1 – 7) were identified, and MeFRK 1 – 6 were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the MeFRK family genes can be divided into α (MeFRK 1, 2, 6, 7) and β (MeFRK 3, 4, 5) groups. All the MeFRK proteins have typical conserved regions and substrate binding residues {{similar to those of the}} FRKs. The overall predicted three-dimensional structures of MeFRK 1 – 6 were similar, folding into a catalytic domain and a β-sheet ‘‘lid” region, forming a substrate binding cleft, which contains many residues involved in the binding to fructose. The gene and the predicted three-dimensional structures of MeFRK 3 and MeFRK 4 were the most similar. MeFRK 1 – 6 displayed different expression patterns across different tissues, including leaves, stems, tuber roots, flowers, and fruits. In tuber roots, the expressions of MeFRK 3 and MeFRK 4 were much higher compared to those of the other genes. Notably, the expression of MeFRK 3 and MeFRK 4 as well as the enzymatic activity of FRK were higher at the initial and early expanding tuber stages and were lower at the later expanding and mature tuber stages. The FRK activity of MeFRK 3 and MeFRK 4 was identified by the functional complementation of triple mutant yeast cells that were unable to phosphorylate either glucose or fructose. The gene expression and enzymatic activity of MeFRK 3 and MeFRK 4 suggest that they might be the main enzymes in fructose phosphorylation for regulating the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tuber</b> roots and starch accumulation at the tuber root initial and expanding stages...|$|R

40|$|A {{process for}} making a {{substance}} that regulates the growth of potatoes and some other economically important plants has been developed. The process also yields an economically important by-product: potatoes. The particular growth-regulating substance, denoted tuber-inducing factor (TIF), is made naturally by, and acts naturally on, potato plants. The primary effects of TIF on potato plants are reducing the lengths of the main shoots, reducing the numbers of nodes on the main stems, reducing the total biomass, accelerating the initiation of potatoes, and increasing the edible fraction (potatoes) of the overall biomass. To some extent, these effects of TIF can override environmental effects that typically inhibit the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubers.</b> TIF {{can be used in}} the potato industry to reduce growth time and increase harvest efficiency. Other plants that have been observed to be affected by TIF include tomatoes, peppers, radishes, eggplants, marigolds, and morning glories. In the present process, potatoes are grown with their roots and stolons immersed in a nutrient solution in a recirculating hydroponic system. From time to time, a nutrient replenishment solution is added to the recirculating nutrient solution to maintain the required nutrient concentration, water is added to replace water lost from the recirculating solution through transpiration, and an acid or base is added, as needed, to maintain the recirculating solution at a desired pH level. The growing potato plants secrete TIF into the recirculating solution. The concentration of TIF in the solution gradually increases to a range in which the TIF regulates the growth of the plants...|$|E

Cultivation dates back from c. 3000 BC, {{but in recent years}} its acreage and production have declined. Renewed interest to conserve the crop and increase its production is limited by absence of accurate information on growth, development and cultural practices of P. edulis. This project aimed at providing the basic knowledge needed to direct further applied research. A standard production technique was developed after interviewing farmers in Chencha and Wolaita in southern Ethiopia, and was used in later experiments. The standard planting material chosen were de-sprouted tuber pieces, prepared from a medium (12 – 15 cm) sized mother tuber broken into three pieces. Three pieces were planted per hole, at a hole spacing of 75  90 cm. Shoot tipping (pinching; the removal of the apices with 1  2 leaf pairs) was carried out when the crop was 10 – 15 cm high. The general structure of the crop was similar to that of Irish potato. Plant components were: the seed tuber pieces, sprouts, main stems, branches, leaves, inflorescences, fruits, seeds, roots, stolons and tubers. The crop had a long growing period. In two growth studies, maximum fresh tuber yields were attained c. 34 weeks after planting (WAP). Above-ground development was characterised by a late emergence (c. 4 weeks), a slow development of the canopy after emergence until full ground cover was attained (c. 20 weeks), a very short period during which ground cover was full (c. 2 weeks) and a relative fast decline in ground cover thereafter (6 − 8 weeks). Primary and secondary branches constituted the major part of the canopy. The first stolons were formed c. 10  12 WAP on below-ground nodes of main stems and primary branches. Tubers were first recorded at 18 WAP as a swelling on the tip of the stolon and sometimes as a swelling of the middle part of stolons. Tubers attained a maximum length of 20  25 cm, and a maximum diameter of c. 2 cm. Aerial stolons were initiated 12  16 weeks later than below-ground stolons and could be up to 2. 5 m long. The increase in tuber fresh weight with time was realized by an increase in both number of tubers and in average weight per tuber over the entire tuber formation period. Fresh tuber yields at 34 WAP were 45  49 Mg ha 1. Yield levels in other sets of experiments in which the harvest date was chosen arbitrarily were c. 21 Mg ha 1 (29. 7 WAP) and c. 30 Mg ha 1 (34. 7 WAP). Experimental yields were very high compared to those reported by farmers. Nevertheless, in growth studies, the average daily dry matter production of the crop over the whole growing period was only 4. 2 − 4. 6 g m 2 day 1. The dry matter production was limited by a poor radiation interception by the canopy – only one third of the incident radiation was intercepted − and a low radiation use efficiency (RUE) – on average only 1. 59 g MJ 1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). RUE gradually increased after emergence to about 2. 7 g MJ 1 PAR when tuber formation was still in an early stage (24 − 26 WAP), but then declined because of a stagnation or decline in total crop dry weight, that lasted several weeks. Dry matter production decreased in that period because the decrease in canopy dry matter – especially stem dry matter − was not yet compensated for by the increase in tuber dry matter. This was attributed partly to a still limited capacity of the tubers to convert and / or store assimilates in this stage. Later this changed and total dry weight and RUE increased again. Harvest index was 81  99 % at the moment when tuber yield was maximum. Shoot tipping significantly increased ground cover and delayed canopy senescence. Tipping also had a positive – though not always significant – effect on tuber yield. Tipping enhanced early stolon formation, but did not consistently affect the number of stolons later in the growing season Because differences among tipped treatments were not large, limiting the tipping frequency to one will help to save time, labour and money. Across experiments in which the number and size of the tuber pieces planted per hole were varied, the tuber fresh weight increased when the number of main stems per m 2 increased up to 2. 5  3 main stems per m 2. This sufficiently high stem number could usually be achieved by planting sufficient seed tuber material (equalling at least one medium-sized mother tuber per hole) and breaking it into two or three pieces. This confers with the farmers practice. Over all treatments, an increase in fresh tuber yield was never realized by merely increasing the individual tuber weight, but either by combined effects on number of tubers and individual tuber fresh weight or by an effect on number of tubers alone. A further increase in radiation interception by advancing and improving canopy development could likely be achieved by planting larger seed pieces, pre-sprouting the seed tuber pieces and using a higher plant density. However, the below ground development should be geared to that. At present the late initiation and <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubers</b> already seems to limit production, and this should be improved when an enhanced canopy cover should result also in higher tuber yield. On short term notice, however, the major constraints to concentrate on will be the shortage of seed tubers and the poor storability of the progeny tubers. Shortage of seed tubers was mentioned by the interviewed P. edulis farmers as a major constraint and the principle reason for the decline in production of P. edulis. The present practice by farmers of storing tubers in situ in the ground was shown to reduce tuber fresh weights by 36  59 % and the number of tubers by 18  48 % in 6 weeks...|$|E

Plants propagated by seeds maintained a significantly higher water potential, stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis under decreasing soil water availability. However, plants propagated by stem cuttings were unable to maintain a favorable internal water balance, reflecting negatively on stomatal conductance and leaf gas exchange. This fact is probably because umbu plants propagated by stem cuttings are not prone to <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> root <b>tubers</b> which are reservoirs for water and solutes.

The average activity of the storage related promoters (AGPaseS and λPat 21) was up-regulated prior to visible swelling, while the average activity of both cell cycle genes (cycB 1; 1 and CDC 2 a) showed an up-regulation after the onset of swelling.

Each of 60, 1 x 1 m plots (in the Oregon House Canal) were randomly assigned to one treatment. Two weeks after treatment, we collected three samples from each plot.

Recent findings suggest that carotenoid pool size is determined, at least in part, by the activity of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase 4 (CCD 4) activity affects potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber carotenoid content. Microarray analysis revealed elevated expression of the potato CCD 4 gene in mature tubers from white-fleshed cultivars compared with higher carotenoid yellow-fleshed tubers. The expression level of the potato CCD 4 gene was down-regulated using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach in stable transgenic lines. Down-regulation in tubers resulted in an increased carotenoid content, 2 - to 5 -fold higher than in control plants. The increase in carotenoid content was mainly due to elevated violaxanthin content, implying that this carotenoid may act as the in vivo substrate. Although transcript level was also reduced in plant organs other than tubers, such as leaves, stems, and roots, there was no change in carotenoid content in these organs. However, carotenoid levels were elevated in flower petals from RNAi lines. As well as changes in tuber carotenoid content, tubers from RNAi lines exhibited phenotypes such as heat sprouting, <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> chain <b>tubers,</b> and an elongated shape.

The results indicate that with the use of physiologically older seed tubers (by pre-sprouting) the field resistance to late blight is generally lower than with younger seed tubers. With physiologically older seed tubers, however, yields are generally higher at the time the crop has to be defoliated because of late blight. It is concluded that especially when the growing period of a potato crop is short, for example as a consequence of an early late blight epidemic, or when a late variety is grown, early tuber growth by the use of older (pre-sprouted) seed tubers is highly important to assure an acceptable yield level {{at the end of the}} growing season. Even in years with a long growing season, a late variety like Agria may yield up to 12 t/ha more when physiologically older seed tubers are used. ...|$|R

40|$|The potato crop {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food crops in the world and in order to understand how in potato plants the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> potato <b>tubers</b> and the determination <b>of</b> different <b>tuber</b> quality traits are regulated, we need to identify and characterize the genes that are involved in regulating these processes. The aim of the research described in this PhD thesis was to implement a relatively new genomic tool (i. e. microarray technology) in an ongoing study to understand the process <b>of</b> potato <b>tuber</b> development and the mechanisms underlying differences in tuber quality traits through the identification and analysis of candidate genes. The induction and <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a potato <b>tuber</b> from underground stem-like structures, the stolons, follows a developmental program that requires the coordinated regulation of many metabolic pathways. We have developed a dedicated potato cDNA-microarray specifically designed to study the different aspects <b>of</b> the potato <b>tuber</b> life cycle. Genes selected for representation on the dedicated array were retrieved from EST databases using a text mining approach based on functional homology with genes thought to be linked to the process <b>of</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>formation</b> or determining tuber quality traits. In a large scale in vivo tuberization experiment we have analyzed the expression profiles of genes during the transition of a stolon into a tuber and subsequent tuber growth stages using the dedicated potato cDNA-microarray. Expression analysis <b>of</b> eight <b>tuber</b> developmental stages revealed both unique as well as more common gene expression profiles including, up-regulation, down-regulation and transiently up- or down regulation at tuber organogenesis. Based on the observed expression profiles during tuber development, tissue specificity studies and functional homology, promising candidate genes were identified and selected for further analysis. Reverse genetic approaches were implemented to identify functional roles for candidate genes in relation to the process <b>of</b> <b>tuber</b> development or quality traits. One of the most intriguing candidate genes that we identified showed homology to a GA 2 -oxidase gene involved in the breakdown of bioactive gibberellins (GA) and was named StGA 2 ox 1. GA is a plant hormone that has been shown to be an important regulator <b>of</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>formation.</b> When potato plants are induced to tuberize, stolon growth ceases and a reduction in the levels of GA is thought to result in the longitudinal reorientation of the cell micro tubules and micro fibrils, allowing lateral cell expansion and division. StGA 2 ox 1 is up-regulated during the early stages <b>of</b> potato <b>tuber</b> development prior to visible swelling. Transgenic clones over-expressing StGA 2 ox 1 exhibit a dwarfed phenotype, reduced stolon length and earlier in vitro tuberization. Transgenic plants with reduced expression levels of StGA 2 ox 1 showed normal plant growth, an altered stolon swelling phenotype and delayed in vitro tuberization. Furthermore, <b>tubers</b> <b>of</b> silencing clones contain increased levels of GA 20, a precursor of bioactive GAs, indicating altered gibberellin metabolism. Based on these results we propose a role for StGA 2 ox 1 in tuber development through the action of regulating GA levels in the subapical stolon region during early tuberization events. Another candidate gene that was selected for gene function assessment showed homology to an Aux/IAA protein and was named StIAA 2. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived transcription factors that can promote or repress auxin induced gene expression under the control of the plant hormone auxin. Auxins have long been implicated to play a regulatory role in potato tuber development. However, a precise function for this plant hormone in tuber development has never been established. During the early stages <b>of</b> potato <b>tuber</b> development StIAA 2 transcript levels are dramatically reduced indicating strong transcriptional control. Targeted down-regulation of StIAA 2 transcript levels, through post-transcriptional-gene-silencing (PTGS), results in distinctive phenotypes that include increased plant height, petiole hyponasty and extreme curvature of growing leaf primordia in the shoot apex. Due to lack of a visible potato tuber phenotype in the StIAA 2 transgenic clones, no direct role for StIAA 2 in controlling potato tuber development could be assigned. However, additional gene expression analysis of transgenic plants with reduced StIAA 2 transcript levels resulted in the identification of a number of genes with altered expression profiles including another member of the Aux/IAA gene family (StIAA), providing new leads in auxin regulated gene expression in potato. Besides the identification and analysis of candidate genes for a role in potato tuber development, we have used the dedicated cDNA microarray in a novel screening method for the identification of candidate genes related to tuber quality in a segregating diploid potato population (C x E). Isolated mRNA from potato <b>tubers</b> <b>of</b> individuals were pooled based on the observed difference in potato tuber cooking type. Transcript profiling of the contrasting bulks, consisting of individuals with either a mealy or non-mealy texture character, led to the identification of a candidate gene involved in determining potato tuber texture after cooking. The candidate gene exhibits strong homology to a t yrosine and l ysine r ich p rotein family and was named StTLRP. TLRP proteins are extra cellular cell wall proteins thought to be involved in cross-linking other proteins to the cell wall making them insoluble, thereby potentially modifying cell wall characteristics. It has been well documented that potato tuber cooking type is largely dependent on cell wall characteristics such as rigidity, permeability and level of cell adhesion. Variation in the level of gene expression of the candidate gene was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for a subset of individuals of the C x E population. Through the identification of an allelic variant of StTLRP and treating the expression levels of StTLRP as a quantitative trait, the identified potato StTLRP gene was mapped, both as a PCR marker and expression QTL, to the same chromosomal location as the QTL identified for tuber cooking type, strengthening its status as a candidate gene. The combination of transcript profiling with population genetics is often referred to as genetical genomics and is likely to greatly enhance candidate gene identification and subsequent cloning steps. Furthermore, we show that the use of a pooling strategy in a segregating population is a powerful and more cost-effective alternative to hybridizing individuals, and can be easily copied for other potato tuber quality traits or transcript profiling techniques. Identification of the key regulatory genes for potato tuber development or tuber quality traits will greatly enhance the capabilities for potato tuber crop improvement through marker assisted breeding methods or genetic engineering. The work described in this thesis shows the successful application of a dedicated potato cDNA-microarray for the study <b>of</b> potato <b>tuber</b> development and quality traits and has resulted in the identification of candidate genes that have provided new insights into the complex biology of the potato crop...|$|R
