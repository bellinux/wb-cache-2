5|$|Along {{with items}} and money earned from battles, winning battles earns {{experience}} points which increases <b>each</b> <b>party</b> member's level and {{allows them to}} learn skills from their weapons. Performing well in battles, such as achieving quick victories or successful Session Attacks, increases party members' Stage Level, which unlock Performa for Radiant Skills and opens up new side stories. The game ends, sending the player back to the title screen, if all party members are knocked unconscious by running out of HP.|$|E
5|$|Harkin realizes what {{happened}} to the power and rushes to find London, while Benson and Secretary Abbott gather energy from a multitude of other companies to get around the breakdown at Lexer. Unaware of what <b>each</b> <b>party</b> is doing, London quickly reverses the hacks {{at the same time as}} the energy starts flowing in from other companies. This overloads the system, knocking out the entire Midwest power grid as the storm hits the city and London is killed in the process.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 2007, Apple Inc. and Apple Corps {{announced}} another {{settlement of}} their trademark dispute, agreeing that Apple Inc. would own {{all of the}} trademarks related to 'Apple' and would license certain of those trademarks back to Apple Corps for its continued use. The settlement ended the ongoing trademark lawsuit between the companies, with <b>each</b> <b>party</b> bearing its own legal costs, and Apple Inc. continuing to use the Apple name and logos on iTunes.

5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to <b>each</b> <b>party</b> that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election to sit in the Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the Franco-African Community {{constitutional}} referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. Legislative elections were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de Liste voting system, a form of bloc voting in which <b>each</b> <b>party</b> offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the months that followed, the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M'ba, now President of Gabon, decided to dissolve the Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.|$|E
5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>party</b> in a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective {{pressures on}} the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E

5|$|In {{the race}} for city commissioners, <b>each</b> <b>party</b> nominates two {{candidates}} and the top three are elected. The office was a county office, a holdover from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of the commissioners in Philadelphia was {{the conduct of the}} city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. As in the other races, the Democrats triumphed, electing both Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry. McHenry was an incumbent who had served as commissioner since 1945, while Osser was new to the office, having previously worked as a lawyer and {{as the leader of the}} 16th ward. The Republican spot on the county commission went to Walter I. Davidson, a sales executive.|$|E
5|$|Many {{rules and}} {{procedures}} in the Maryland Senate are set by the state constitution. Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee. The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor. The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby, the latter being mandated by the state constitution. Seating in the Senate is by party, {{with the leaders of}} <b>each</b> <b>party</b> choosing the exact seating assignments. Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller Senate Office Building.|$|E
5|$|Outside of battle, {{the game}} {{contains}} some strong role-playing video game traditions. For example, Mario's strength {{is determined by}} multiple statistical fields and status-boosting items {{that can be used}} in and outside of combat. The effects of these items range from healing Mario or his partner to damaging the opponent. Mario can also purchase badges from non-player characters or occasionally obtain them from defeated enemies; when equipped, these badges can permanently enhance a particular skill or aspect, or, in some cases, give Mario new moves, including Power Jump and Quake Hammer. Throughout the game, Mario is permanently assisted by a party member. <b>Each</b> <b>party</b> member has a specialised skill, some of which are required to solve puzzles to advance progression in the game. More party members are gained as the player advances through the game.|$|E

5|$|The Prince of Wales's debts {{continued}} to climb, {{and his father}} refused to aid him unless he married his cousin Princess Caroline of Brunswick. In 1795, the prince acquiesced; and they were married on 8 April 1795 at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. The marriage, however, was disastrous; <b>each</b> <b>party</b> was unsuited to the other. The two were formally separated {{after the birth of}} their only child, Princess Charlotte, in 1796, and remained separated thereafter. The Prince remained attached to Maria Fitzherbert {{for the rest of his}} life, despite several periods of estrangement.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a turn-based combat {{system in which}} party members and enemy Mirages take turns to perform actions such as attacking, casting spells, and using items. The player's party consists of three main characters which, {{with the exception of}} main character Itsuki, can be swapped out both inside and outside of battle. Similar to both Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tenseis battle systems, party members and enemies each have strengths and weaknesses against certain types of physical attacks, such as swords and arrows, and elemental attacks, such as fire and ice. The affinities of <b>each</b> <b>party</b> member change depending on the weapon they have equipped.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of seats in the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties proportionally {{to the number of}} votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for <b>each</b> <b>party</b> is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E

5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with <b>each</b> <b>party</b> having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha and {{his entire}} {{administration}} campaigned {{on behalf of}} New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825, Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters. Desha's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary, but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question. Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire for a compromise, albeit one that would save face for the New Court Party. He promised that, if the legislature would again authorize appointment of {{a new set of}} judges, he would appoint them equally from both parties. Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges, with three appointed from <b>each</b> <b>party.</b> One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign, along with Desha, lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee, and all the legislators in the General Assembly, essentially allowing the state government to reset itself. This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. The House passed a measure to restore the Old Court, but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee, the presiding officer in the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to defeat it.|$|E
5|$|By {{utilizing}} {{a place called}} the Bloom Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual; Carnage Unity and Radiant Unity, to strengthen their party. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained in battle by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four skills which a party member can inherit by earning experience in battle. These include Command Skills, which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive Skills, which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session Skills, which are used to chain together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six skills of each type, but if they inherit a skill they already have, it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. Radiant Unity uses Performa that is born from within <b>each</b> <b>party</b> member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories; or by increasing a character's Star Ranking in battle to grant them Radiant Skills, permanent skills separate from those inherited from weapons. These include passive effects, such as increased health or extended Session Attacks, as well as skills that can be performed in battle.|$|E
