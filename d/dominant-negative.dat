25|$|Missense {{mutations}} in the lamin A/C rod and tail domains are {{the cause for}} {{a wide array of}} genetic disorders, suggesting that lamin A/C protein contains distinct functional domains that are essential for the maintenance and integrity of different cell lineages. Interaction between lamin A and the nuclear envelope protein emerin appears to be crucial in muscle cells, with certain {{mutations in}} lamin mimicking mutations in emerin and causing Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Different mutations lead to <b>dominant-negative</b> and recessive alleles. Mutations in the lamin rod domain leading to mislocalization of both lamin A and emerin occur in patients with autosomal dominant forms of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy.|$|E
500|$|A {{cause for}} concern {{in the use of}} Morpholinos is the {{potential}} for [...] "off-target" [...] effects. [...] Whether an observed morphant phenotype is due to the intended knockdown or an interaction with an off-target RNA can often be addressed by running another experiment to confirm that the observed morphant phenotype results from the knockdown of the expected target. This can be done by recapitulating the morphant phenotype with a second, non-overlapping Morpholino targeting the same mRNA or by confirmation of the observed phenotypes by use of a mutant strain or <b>dominant-negative</b> methods. As mentioned above, rescue of observed phenotypes by coinjecting a rescue mRNA is, when feasible, a reliable test of specificity of a Morpholino.|$|E
500|$|NEDD9 {{is present}} {{throughout}} cell cycle, but most abundant in G2/M phase cells. [...] NEDD9 {{is subject to}} both caspase cleavage and proteasomal degradation. In conditions of cell detachment, and particularly in early stages of anoikis or apoptosis, NEDD9 is rapidly cleaved by caspases 3 and/or 7 at a DLVD site [...] (residue 363), and at a DDYD site (residue 630) [...] to form N-terminal 55 KDa and C-terminal 28 KDa fragments forms. This cleavage is prevented by focal adhesion formation, which suggests NEDD9 as a sensor of altered adhesion states. Overexpression of p28 in cells causes cellular rounding and detachment, and induces apoptosis, probably because of a <b>dominant-negative</b> effect on survival-promoting signaling complexes at focal adhesions. [...] Together this data suggests that production of different NEDD9 posttranslational modifications is regulated by cell de/attachment, which, in turn, allows regulation of NEDD9 turnover and participation in distinct cellular processes.|$|E
2500|$|Type-6 episodic ataxia (EA6) {{is a rare}} form of episodic ataxia, {{identified}} initially in a 10-year-old boy {{who first}} presented with 30 minute bouts of decreased muscle tone during infancy. He required [...] "balance therapy" [...] {{as a young child}} to aid in walking and has a number of ataxic attacks, each separated by months to years. These attacks were precipitated by fever. He has cerebellar atrophy and subclinical seizures. During later attacks, he also presented with distortions of the left hemifield, ataxia, slurred speech, followed by headache. After enrolling in school, he developed bouts of rhythmic arm jerking with concomitant confusion, also lasting approximately 30 minutes. He also has presented, at various times, with migraines. This patient carries a proline to arginine substitution in the fifth transmembrane-spanning segment of the gene SLC1A3. This gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) protein, which is responsible for glutamate uptake. In cell culture assays, this mutation results in drastically decreased glutamate uptake in a <b>dominant-negative</b> manner. This is likely due to decreased synthesis or protein stability. As this protein is expressed heavily in the brainstem and cerebellum, it is likely that this mutation results in excitotoxicity and/or hyperexcitability leading to ataxia and seizures. Mutations in EAAT1 (GLAST) have subsequently been identified in a family with episodic ataxia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dominant-negative</b> {{mutations}} {{also occur}} in other tumor suppressor genes. For instance two <b>dominant-negative</b> germ line mutations {{were identified in}} the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene which increases susceptibility to breast cancer. Dominant negative mutations of the transcription factor C/EBPα can cause acute myeloid leukemia. [...] Inherited dominant negative mutations can also {{increase the risk of}} diseases other than cancer. <b>Dominant-negative</b> mutations in Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) are associated with severe insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and hypertension.|$|E
50|$|A <b>dominant-negative</b> {{mutation}} {{may arise}} {{in a human}} somatic cell and provide a proliferative advantage to the mutant cell, leading to its clonal expansion. For instance, a <b>dominant-negative</b> mutation in a gene necessary for the normal process of programmed cell death (Apoptosis) in response to DNA damage can make the cell resistant to apoptosis. This will allow proliferation of the clone even when excessive DNA damage is present. Such <b>dominant-negative</b> mutations occur in the tumor suppressor gene p53. The P53 wild-type protein is normally present as a four-protein multimer (oligotetramer). <b>Dominant-negative</b> p53 mutations occur {{in a number of}} different types of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions (e.g. brain tumors, breast cancer, oral pre-cancerous lesions and oral cancer).|$|E
5000|$|Pseudo-ICE:Caspase-1 <b>dominant-negative</b> {{inhibitor}} Pseudo-ICE, {{also known}} as COP1 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=protein&val=62953113 ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dominant-negative</b> {{mutations}} {{have also}} been described in organisms other than humans. In fact, the first study reporting a mutant protein inhibiting the normal function of a wild-type protein in a mixed multimer was with the bacteriophage T4 tail fiber protein GP37. [...] Mutations that produce a truncated protein rather than a full-length mutant protein {{seem to have the}} strongest <b>dominant-negative</b> effect in the studies of P53, ATM, C/EBPα, and bacteriophage T4 GP37.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of PDGFR signalling, {{overexpression}} of a <b>dominant-negative</b> PDGFR or application of the cancer drug STI571 are both approaches being explored to therapeutically interference with metastasis in mice.|$|E
50|$|CycΔ {{mutation}} is a <b>dominant-negative</b> mutation which {{blocks the}} ability of CYCLE-CLOCK complexes from activating E-box dependent transcription of timeless. The mutation {{is the result of}} a 15 to 17 base pair deletion from the cyc gene.|$|E
50|$|Sac3 {{phosphatase}} {{activity in the}} PAS complex also {{plays an important role}} in regulating PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels and maintaining endomembrane homeostasis. Thus, cytoplasmic vacuolation induced by the <b>dominant-negative</b> PIKfyveK1831E mutant is suppressed upon co-expression of a Sac3 phosphatase-inactive point-mutant along with ArPIKfyve.|$|E
5000|$|Three RLR helicases have so {{far been}} described: RIG-I and MDA5 (recognizing 5'triphosphate-RNA and dsRNA, respectively), which {{activate}} antiviral signaling, and LGP2, which appears {{to act as a}} <b>dominant-negative</b> inhibitor. RLRs initiate the release of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN I).|$|E
50|$|Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a {{surveillance}} pathway {{that exists in}} all eukaryotes. Its main function is to reduce errors in gene expression by eliminating mRNA transcripts that contain premature stop codons. Translation of these aberrant mRNAs could, in some cases, lead to deleterious gain-of-function or <b>dominant-negative</b> activity of the resulting proteins.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that when NFAT5 is {{inhibited}} in renal and immune cells, these cells become significantly more susceptible to osmotic stress. NFAT5 deficient mice were found to suffer from massive cell loss in the renal medulla. [...] Additionally, mice expressing a <b>dominant-negative</b> form of NFAT5 in their eyes exhibited decreased viability under hypertonic extracellular environment.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a protein}} that lacks the normal DNA-binding domain {{contained}} in other nuclear receptors. The encoded protein {{acts as a}} <b>dominant-negative</b> regulator of transcription of other nuclear receptors including steroidogenic factor 1. This protein also functions as an anti-testis gene by acting antagonistically to SRY. Mutations in this gene result in both X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.|$|E
5000|$|One {{example of}} a {{buffering}} mechanism is protein sequestration, which is a common mechanism found in signalling and regulatory networks. In 2009, Buchler and Cross constructed a synthetic genetic network that was regulated by protein sequestration of a transcriptional activator by a <b>dominant-negative</b> inhibitor. They showed that this system results in a flexibile ultrasensitive response in gene expression. It is flexible in {{that the degree of}} ultrasensitivity can be altered by changing expression levels of the <b>dominant-negative</b> inhibitor. Figure 1 in their article illustrates how an active transcription factor can be sequestered by an inhibitor into the inactive complex AB that is unable to bind DNA. This type of mechanism results in an [...] "all-or-none" [...] response, or ultransensitivy, when the concentration of the regulatory protein increases to the point of depleting the inhibitor. Robust buffering against a response exists below this concentration threshold, and when it is reached any small increase in input is amplified into a large change in output.|$|E
50|$|Hydra polyps {{are small}} and {{transparent}} which {{makes it possible to}} trace single cells in vivo. In addition, transgenic Hydra provide a ready system for generating gain-of-function phenotypes. With the use of transgenes producing <b>dominant-negative</b> versions of proteins, one should be able to obtain loss-of-function phenotypes as well. Current technology allows generation of reporter constructs using promoters of various Hydra genes fused to fluorescent proteins.|$|E
50|$|Zeste white 10 (ZW10) was {{initially}} {{identified as a}} mitotic checkpoint protein involved in chromosome segregation, and then implicated in targeting cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin to mitotic kinetochores, {{but it is also}} important in non-dividing cells. These include cytoplasmic dynein targeting to Golgi and other membranes, and SNARE-mediated ER-Golgi trafficking. <b>Dominant-negative</b> ZW10, anti-ZW10 antibody, and ZW10 RNA interference (RNAi) cause Golgi dispersal. ZW10 RNAi also disperse endosomes and lysosomes.|$|E
50|$|Takahashi et al. {{reported}} {{a case of}} a boy with short stature who was heterozygous for a mutation in the GH1 gene. In this child, growth hormone not only could not activate the GH receptor (GHR) but also inhibited the action of wild type GH because of its greater affinity for GHR and GH-binding protein (GHBP) that is derived from the extracellular domain of the GHR. Thus, a <b>dominant-negative</b> effect was observed.|$|E
50|$|Transcription factors {{containing}} a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif regulate expression of tissue-specific genes {{in a number}} of mammalian and insect systems. DNA-binding activity of the bHLH proteins is dependent on formation of homo- and/or heterodimers. <b>Dominant-negative</b> (antimorph) HLH proteins encoded by Id-related genes, such as ID4, also contain the HLH-dimerization domain but lack the DNA-binding basic domain. Consequently, Id proteins inhibit binding to DNA and transcriptional transactivation by heterodimerization with bHLH proteins.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in Prickle genes {{can cause}} {{epilepsy}} in humans by perturbing Prickle function. One mutation in Prickle1 gene {{can result in}} Prickle1-Related Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy-Ataxia Syndrome. This mutation disrupts the interaction between prickle-like 1 and REST, which results in the inability to suppress REST. Gene knockdown of Prickle1 by shRNA or <b>dominant-negative</b> constructs results in decreased axonal and dendritic extension in neurons in the hippocampus. Prickle1 gene knockdown in neonatal retina causes defects in axon terminals of photoreceptors and in inner and outer segments.|$|E
50|$|The mouse homolog to the Jrk mutant is the ClockΔ19 mutant that {{possesses}} a deletion in exon 19 of the Clock gene. This <b>dominant-negative</b> mutation {{results in a}} defective CLOCK-BMAL dimer, which causes mice to have a decreased ability to activate per transcription. In constant darkness, ClockΔ19 mice heterozygous for the Clock mutant allele exhibit lengthened circadian periods, while ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice homozygous for the allele become arrhythmic. In both heterozygotes and homozygotes, this mutation also produces lengthened periods and arrhythmicity at the single-cell level.|$|E
50|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are normally}} {{active in the}} form of a multimer, an aggregate of multiple copies of the same protein, otherwise known as a homomultimeric protein or homooligomeric protein. In fact, a majority of the 83,000 different enzymes from 9800 different organisms in the BRENDA Enzyme Database represent homooligomers. When the wild-type version of the protein is present along with a mutant version, a mixed multimer can be formed. A mutation that leads to a mutant protein that disrupts the activity of the wild-type protein in the multimer is a <b>dominant-negative</b> mutation.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the {{mechanism}} of disease in FHS is suspected to be <b>dominant-negative</b> (or antimorphic) due to the mutation in the final exon that results {{in the loss of}} the major transactivation function of SRCAP (or loss of one or more critical domains). All of the patients that carried the mutation also had obvious physical symptoms (i.e., prominent nose, delayed bone age, and short stature). Those who tested negative for the mutation often had dysmorphic facial features distinct from classical FHS, as well as a formal diagnosis of autism.|$|E
5000|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase has been shown to {{specifically}} activate MAPK8/JNK. The activation of MAPK8 by this kinase is found to be inhibited by the <b>dominant-negative</b> mutants of MAP3K7/TAK1, MAP2K4/MKK4, and MAP2K7/MKK7, which suggests that this kinase may function through the MAP3K7-MAP2K4-MAP2K7 kinase cascade, and mediate the TNF-alpha signaling pathway. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. A recent study showed that MAP4K4 is a direct kinase of LATS1/2 and thus regulates the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ.|$|E
50|$|Inhibition of Aurora B {{function}} by RNA interference or microinjection of blocking antibodies impairs {{the alignment}} of chromosomes at the equator of the mitotic spindle. This {{process of alignment}} {{is referred to as}} chromosome congression. The reason for this defect is a subject of ongoing study. Aurora B inhibition may lead to {{an increase in the number}} of syntelic attachments (sister chromatid pairs in which both sister kinetochores are attached to microtubules radiating from the same spindle pole). Intriguingly, expression of a <b>dominant-negative</b> and catalytically inactive form of Aurora B disrupted microtuble attachment to the kinetochore and prevented the association of dynein and centromere protein E (CENP-E) with kinetochores.|$|E

50|$|The {{negative}} signaling by FcγRIIB {{is mainly}} important for regulation of activated B cells. The positive B cell signaling is initiated by binding of foreign antigen to surface immunoglobulin. The same antigen-specific antibody is secreted {{and it can}} feedback-suppress, or promote negative signaling. This negative signaling is being provided by FcγRIIB.: Experiments using B cell deletion mutants and <b>dominant-negative</b> enzymes have firmly established an important role for SH2-domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) in negative signaling. Negative signaling through SHIP appears to inhibit the Ras pathway through SH2 domain competition with Grb2 and Shc and may involve consumption of intracellular lipid mediators that act as allosteric enzyme activators or that promote entry of extracellular Ca2+.|$|E
5000|$|Nonsense-mediated decay is {{involved}} in detection and decay of mRNA transcripts which contain premature termination codons (PTCs). PTCs can arise in cells through various mechanisms: germline mutations in DNA; somatic mutations in DNA; errors in transcription; or errors in post transcriptional mRNA processing. Failure to recognize and decay these mRNA transcripts can result {{in the production of}} truncated proteins which may be harmful to the organism. By causing decay of C-terminally truncated polypeptides, the NMD mechanism can protect cells against deleterious <b>dominant-negative,</b> and gain of function effects. PTCs have been implicated in approximately 30% of all inherited diseases; as such, the NMD pathway plays a vital role in assuring overall survival and fitness of an organism ...|$|E
5000|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{belongs to the}} {{inhibitor}} of DNA binding (ID) family, members of which are transcriptional regulators that contain a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain but not a basic domain. Members of the ID family inhibit the functions of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors in a <b>dominant-negative</b> manner by suppressing their heterodimerization partners through the HLH domains. This protein {{may play a role}} in negatively regulating cell differentiation. A pseudogene has been identified for this gene.A research published by [...] "Nature" [...] in 01/2016, authored by italian researchers Antonio Iavarone and Anna Lasorella, from Columbia University, states that ID2 protein has a relevant role in the development and resistance to therapies of glioblastoma, the most aggressive of brain cancers.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} was {{identified}} as a regulator of the MAP kinase kinase kinase MAP3K7/TAK1, which is known to mediate various intracellular signaling pathways, such as those induced by TGF beta, interleukin 1, and WNT-1. This protein interacts and thus activates TAK1 kinase. It has been shown that the C-terminal portion of this protein is sufficient for binding and activation of TAK1, while a portion of the N-terminus acts as a <b>dominant-negative</b> inhibitor of TGF beta, suggesting that this protein may function as a mediator between TGF beta receptors and TAK1. This protein can also interact with and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14/p38alpha), and thus represents an alternative activation pathway, in addition to the MAPKK pathways, which contributes to the biological responses of MAPK14 to various stimuli. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.|$|E
5000|$|Considering {{that both}} Drp1 and MAP1B are {{substrates}} for MITOL, MITOL {{is thought to}} play a protective role against nitrosative stress-mediated disruption of mitochondrial dynamics such as morphological stability and transport of mitochondria. As significantly decreased expression of MITOL occurs in response to ageing in normal tissues, MITOL may control ageing by regulating the production of ROS in mitochondria. [...] From a pathological perspective, in a neuronal cell model, <b>dominant-negative</b> MARCH5 prevents mitochondrial fragmentation during neurodegenerative stress induced by the neuron-specific reactive oxygen generator 6-hydroxydopamine, the complex I inhibitor rotenone or Alzheimer's-related amyloid beta peptide. MARCH5 is also involved in the removal of proteins associated with specific neurodegenerative disorders such as ataxin-3 in Machado-Joseph disease or mSOD1 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis likely supporting mitochondrial function. MARCH5 has also been linked to toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns and {{play a critical role}} in the innate immune response.|$|E

In conditions of cell detachment, and particularly in early stages of anoikis or apoptosis, NEDD9 is rapidly cleaved by caspases 3 and/or 7 at a DLVD site (residue 363), and at a DDYD site (residue 630) [...] to form N-terminal 55 KDa and C-terminal 28 KDa fragments forms. This cleavage is prevented by focal adhesion formation, which suggests NEDD9 as a sensor of altered adhesion states. Overexpression of p28 in cells causes cellular rounding and detachment, and induces apoptosis, probably because of a <b>dominant-negative</b> effect on survival-promoting signaling complexes at focal adhesions. Together this data suggests that production of different NEDD9 posttranslational modifications is regulated by cell de/attachment, which, in turn, allows regulation of NEDD9 turnover and participation in distinct cellular processes.|$|E
50|$|P53 {{functions}} as a tumor suppressor that is involved in preventing cancer and occurs naturally in apoptotic pathways. P53 causes cells to enter apoptosis and disrupt further cell division therefore preventing that cell from becoming cancerous (16). In the majority of cancers it is the p53 pathway that has become mutated resulting in lack of ability to terminate dysfunctional cells. P53 function can also be responsible for a limited life span where mutations of the p53 gene causes expression of <b>dominant-negative</b> forms producing long lived animals. For example in an experiment using C. elegans, the increased life span of p53 mutants was found to depend on increased autophagy. In another experiment using Drosophilia the p53 mutation had {{both positive and negative}} effects on the adult life span, which concluded a link between sexual differentiation, PCD and aging. Determining how p53 are affecting life span will be an important area for future research.|$|E
5000|$|Understanding the {{signaling}} pathways, and {{the role}} of Tbx2 in tumorigenesis, can aid in developing gene-targeted cancer treatments. Because Tbx2 is up-regulated in various types of cancer cells in multiple organ systems, the potential for gene therapy is optimistic. Scientists are interested in targeting a small domain of Tbx2 and Tbx3 to reduce its expression, and utilize small peptides known to suppress tumor genes to inhibit proliferation. An in vitro study using a cell line of human prostate cancer blocked endogenous Tbx2 using Tbx2 <b>dominant-negative</b> retroviral vectors found reduced tumor cell proliferation. [...] Further, the same study suggests targeting WNT3A because of its role in cell-signaling with Tbx2, by utilizing a WNT antagonist such as SFRP-2. Because somatic cells have low expression of Tbx2, a targeted Tbx2 gene treatment would leave healthy somatic cells unharmed, thereby providing a treatment with low toxicity and negative side effects. [...] Much research is still required to determine the efficacy of these specific gene targets to anti-cancer treatments.|$|E
