25|$|John Gray of the London and Brighton Railway disbelieved the {{necessity}} for a low centre of gravity and produced a series of locomotives that were much admired by David Joy who developed the design at the firm of E. B. Wilson and Company to produce the 2-2-2 Jenny Lind locomotive, {{one of the most}} successful passenger locomotives of its day. Meanwhile, the Stephenson 0-6-0 Long Boiler locomotive with inside cylinders became the archetypal <b>goods</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The early {{locomotives}} of {{the constituent}} companies were to assorted designs {{from a number}} of manufacturers. The first locomotives for the Belfast and Ballymena Railway were purchased from Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy. These were four 2-2-2 singles and one 0-4-2 <b>goods</b> <b>engine.</b> Later, four more 2-2-2s were ordered but this time from Sharp Brothers. Fairbairn 2-2-2s were to be found on the Ballymena Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway but this company also favoured Sharp locomotives which were double framed 2-4-0s. These latter engines proved to be a sound investment, of those ordered in 1856, four were still in service in 1924. These locomotives were inherited by the BNCR.|$|E

During the raid he successfully bombed a <b>goods</b> <b>engine</b> and a troop train, and put several anti-aircraft batteries out of action, before leading his formation back to base at low level.

5000|$|All LNWR {{locomotives}} {{were painted}} black from 1873; {{for many years}} the <b>goods</b> <b>engines</b> were plain black, but passenger engines were given red, white and blue-grey lining, and most <b>goods</b> <b>engines</b> were similarly lined from the 1890s. Before 1873 locomotives had been green with black lines, and this {{seems to have been}} the normal livery from London & Birmingham and Grand Junction times.|$|R

500|$|After {{modification}} by Maunsell, the S15 {{class was}} regarded by locomotive crews as an excellent <b>goods</b> <b>engine</b> {{best known for}} working heavy night express goods trains between Exeter, Southampton and Nine Elms. The S15s were also very capable passenger engines, being able to deputise in situations {{where there was a}} shortage of passenger locomotives during peak holiday periods. Both Urie and Maunsell S15s spent most of their working lives on the Southern Railway's Western section, although they were sometimes used on inter-regional freights. In order to increase maintenance efficiency, all Urie S15 locomotives (which had the lower boiler pressure) were concentrated at the Southern Railway's London freight depot at Feltham. This yard also featured the Maunsell S15s, which were allocated to Exmouth Junction, Hither Green and Salisbury, demonstrating the [...] "go anywhere" [...] nature of the class. Despite the design being only a year newer, the S15s outlasted their N15 King Arthur class counterparts because of their dual freight/passenger abilities, though they were retired between 1962 and 1966 as part of the British Railways Modernisation Plan. Maunsell S15 number 30837 became the final member of the class in operation, returning to Feltham in January 1966 to work a farewell rail tour.|$|E

Letters 'I' and 'U' to 'W' were left unused at the time, but the latter three were later applied when new wheel arrangements were introduced; I was never used.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives {{in revenue}} service were small four-wheeled ones {{similar to the}} Rocket. However, the inclined cylinders caused the engine to rock, so they first became horizontal and then, in his [...] "Planet" [...] design, were mounted inside the frames. While this improved stability, the [...] "crank axles" [...] were extremely prone to breakage. Greater speed was achieved by larger driving wheels at expense of a tendency for wheel slip when starting. Greater tractive effort was obtained by smaller wheels coupled together, but speed was limited by {{the fragility of the}} cast iron connecting rods. Hence, from the beginning, there was a distinction between the light fast passenger locomotive and the slower more powerful <b>goods</b> <b>engine.</b> Edward Bury, in particular, refined this design and the so-called [...] "Bury Pattern" [...] was popular for a number of years, particularly on the London and Birmingham.|$|E
60|$|We {{have already}} hinted {{that the weather}} was not fine. Mrs Durby's {{umbrella}} being up, hid the approaching train. As for screaming steam-whistles, the worthy woman had come to regard intermittent whistling as a normal condition of railways, which, like the crying of cross babies, meant little or nothing, and had only to be endured. She {{paid no attention to}} the alarm. In despair the driver reversed his engine; fire flew from the wheels, and the engine was brought to a stand, but not until the buffers were within three feet of the nurse's shoulder. At that moment she became aware of her danger, uttered a shriek, as we have said, that would have done credit to the whistle of a small engine, and, bending her head with her umbrella before her, rushed frantically away on another line of rails. She did not observe, poor soul, that a goods train was coming straight down that line towards her,--partly because her mental vision was turned in terror to the rear, and partly because the umbrella obscured all in advance. In vain the driver of the <b>goods</b> <b>engine</b> repeated the warnings and actions of the passenger engine. His had more speed on and was heavier; besides, Mrs Durby charged it at the rate of full five miles an hour, with the umbrella steadily in front, and a brown paper parcel swinging wildly on her arm, as if her sole desire on earth was to meet that <b>goods</b> <b>engine</b> in single combat and beat out its brains at the first blow. Certain it is that Mrs Durby's career would have been cut short then and there, if tall Joe Turner, the guard, had not been standing at the tail of his own train and observed her danger. In the twinkling of an eye he dropped his slow dignified air, leaped like a panther in front of the <b>goods</b> <b>engine,</b> caught Mrs Durby with both hands--any how--and hurled her and himself off the line,--not a moment too soon, for the buffer of the engine touched his shoulder as they fell together to the ground.|$|E
60|$|Outside on the {{platform}} a few people lounged, waiting {{the arrival of the}} expected train. Among them was one whose bulky frame and firm strongly-lined countenance spoke of much power to dare and do. He was considerably above the middle height and somewhere about middle age. His costume was of that quiet unobtrusive kind which seems to court retirement, and the sharp glance of his eyes seemed to possess something of the gimblet in their penetrating power. This was no less a personage than Mr Sharp, the inspector of police on the Grand National Trunk Railway. Mr Inspector Sharp had evidently an eye for the beautiful, for he stood at the farther extremity of {{the platform}} gazing in rapt attention at the sun, which just then was setting in a flood of golden light. But Mr Sharp had also a peculiar faculty for observing several things at once. Indeed, some of his friends, referring to this, were wont to remark that he was a perfect Argus, with eyes in his elbows and calves and back of his head. It would seem, indeed, that this, or something like it, must really have been the case, for he not only observed and enjoyed the sunset but also paid particular attention to the conversation of two men who stood not far from him, {{and at the same time}} was cognisant of the fact that behind him, a couple of hundred yards or more up the line, a <b>goods</b> <b>engine</b> was engaged in shunting trucks.|$|E

50|$|Until the {{appointment}} of Dugald Drummond, unlike most other British railways, almost all engines had outside cylinders, and the 0-6-0 arrangement was quite rare, <b>goods</b> <b>engines</b> being of type 2-4-0 or 0-4-2. Passenger engines were normally 2-2-2.|$|R

50|$|The first {{locomotive}} superintendent was John Dixon, {{followed by}} John Melling, then in 1840 by John Dawrance. In 1841 four 2-2-2 were built, followed by six more the following year, which {{also saw the}} production of 2-4-0 <b>goods</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Built in February 1846 and ceasing work in August 1865, Avalanche was {{not part}} of the Swindon-built Standard Goods {{locomotive}} build, but instead it was built by the Stothert and Slaughter and was similar to the Caesar class tender <b>goods</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

50|$|When {{originally}} built {{they were}} numbered 516-520. On passing to the Southern Railway, {{they had their}} LSWR numbers prefixed with an ‘E’.

5|$|Once the contractors' {{locomotives}} ceased {{working on}} the line, locomotives were supplied from Goole shed, and were usually Barton Wright 0-6-2 side tanks or Barton Wright 0-6-0 <b>goods</b> <b>engines</b> with tenders. The locomotives took their name from William Barton Wright, who was the chief mechanical engineer for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway {{at the time they}} were introduced. They were designed and built by Kitson and Company in Leeds. Although classified as <b>goods</b> <b>engines,</b> the 0-6-0 locomotives were employed on both goods and passenger services. They continued to work on the line until the early 1960s. Most of the 0-6-2s had been withdrawn by 1914, and their duties were performed by Aspinall 2-4-2 side tanks.|$|R
6000|$|Although we have {{somewhat}} exalted our pet locomotive of the [...] "Flying Dutchman," [...] justice {{requires us}} to state that <b>goods</b> <b>engines</b> are more gigantic and powerful, though they {{are not required to}} run so fast. These engines are the heavy dray-horses of the line, express engines being the racers. The latter can carry a light load of some seventy or ninety tons on a good roadway at the rate of fifty miles an hour or upwards. <b>Goods</b> <b>engines</b> of the most powerful class, on the other hand, run at a much slower pace, but they drag with ease a load of from 300 to 350 tons, with which they can ascend steep gradients.|$|R

50|$|To these {{compound}} rebuilds {{was added}} the prototype eight-coupled <b>goods</b> <b>engine</b> No. 2524 which was rebuilt {{with a larger}} boiler in 1906. Previously it had been similar to the Class C with a smaller boiler; though was not classified as such since the letter classification was introduced in 1911.|$|E

They all had inside cylinders and dome-topped fireboxes, and were mounted on inside bar-frames; they were manufactured by seven different firms, including Bury's own.|$|E
50|$|The C {{class of}} 0-6-0 <b>goods</b> <b>engines</b> {{comprised}} 109 locomotives built between 1900 and 1908, of which 15 each were {{built by the}} contractors Neilson, Reid and Sharp, Stewart; the remainder were built by the SECR, 60 at Ashford and 9 at Longhedge.|$|R
