500|$|Christianity Today writer Russ Breimeier was {{positive}} about Katy Hudson, highlighting Hudson's songwriting style for being [...] "insightful and well matched {{to the emotional}} power" [...] of Hudson's music. He further deemed Hudson a [...] "young talent" [...] and <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more from her in the next year. Similarly, Tony Cummings from Cross Rhythms also considered Hudson to be a [...] "vocal talent", recommending readers {{to listen to the}} album. The Phantom Tollbooth's Andy Argyrakis stated that Hudson having been reared in church had [...] "paid off", and noted that [...] "Although a mere pop lightweight, it's hard to ignore Hudson's sincerity and lyrical maturity." [...] DEP from Billboard, also calling Hudson a talent, classified the record as [...] "textured modern-rock collection that is equal parts grit and vulnerability" [...] and [...] "impressive". The album was a commercial failure for bankrupted Red Hill Records, only selling between 100 and 200 copies.|$|E
500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] was {{conceived}} during recording sessions for Lewis' debut studio album, Spirit, which {{was released in}} November 2007. It was written by Jordon Omley, Michael Mani, Wayne Wilkins, Louis Biancaniello and Ryan Tedder, and was produced by The Runaways, Sam Watters, Wilkins, Biancaniello and Tedder. The music production, keyboards and programming were carried out by Wilkins, Biancaniello and Tedder, while vocal production was helmed by Watters. Lewis performs the lead vocals, and ReVaughn Brown performs background vocals. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was recorded and mixed by Biancaniello, Mani, Watters and Omley at The Record Plant, Hollywood, California. As reported by Digital Spy, Tedder revealed that the types of songs that people <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> on Spirit, such as powerful vocal performance ballads, needed to be different and stand out rather than conventional, [...] "if you're going to push that kind of music [...] - big ballads and big songs - {{you have to be}} edgier; they can't be clean and polished." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Denis Arnold, {{although}} Monteverdi's late operas retain {{elements of}} the earlier Renaissance intermezzo and pastoral forms, they may be fairly considered as the first modern operas. In the 1960s, however, David Johnson {{found it necessary to}} warn prospective Il ritorno listeners that if they <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> opera akin to Verdi, Puccini or Mozart, they would be disappointed: [...] "You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first or second hearing merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence." [...] A few years later, Jeremy Noble in a Gramophone review wrote that Il ritorno was the least known and least performed of Monteverdi's operas, [...] "quite frankly, because its music is not so consistently full of character and imagination as that of Orfeo or Poppea." [...] Arnold called the work an [...] "ugly duckling". Later analysts have been more positive; to Mark Ringer Il ritorno is [...] "the most tender and moving of Monteverdi's operas", while in Ellen Rosand's view the composer's ability to portray real human beings through music finds its fullest realisation here, and in Poppea a few years later.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to a crowd estimated at 200,000, a group of 300 American journalists descended on the Isle of Wight, adding unwelcome pressure on Dylan. In {{the days leading up}} to his performance on Sunday, 31 August, the British press dubbed the event [...] "D Day", in reference to the Allies' invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944; in the words of music journalist John Harris, [...] "Dylan's show had by now been inflated into the gig of the decade." [...] As a further impediment to Dylan's planned comeback, audiences in 1969 <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the rock music associated with his and the Hawks' 1965–66 tours, a style that he had abandoned with his recent country album, Nashville Skyline. This contrast was encouraged by the organisers' promotional campaign for the event, particularly in the design for the official festival posters. Referring to Dylan's more conservative 1969 image, author Clinton Heylin writes: [...] "There was little doubt that this was a different Dylan, even if the graphic on the fluttering posters advertising the festival was a stark black-and-white shot of a beshaded Dylan in classic '66 pose." [...] The arrival of Harrison's fellow Beatles John Lennon and Ringo Starr, on Saturday, 30 August, added to the heightened speculation that one or more members of the band might make a guest appearance with Dylan the following evening.|$|E
500|$|On Phật Đản, {{thousands}} of Buddhists defied {{the ban on}} flag flying. More than 500 people marched across the Perfume River, carrying signs and placards, congregating at the Từ Đàm Pagoda before a 3,000-strong demonstration, calling for religious equality, {{took place in the}} city centre as government security officials surrounded the area with armoured personnel carriers and civil guardsmen. The signs were in both Vietnamese and English to convey the message to western observers. Despite the ban on religious flags, Vatican flags hoisted on the bridge from the Catholic celebration were never taken down. The leading Buddhist activist monk Thích Trí Quang addressed the crowd and exhorted them to rise up against Catholic discrimination against Buddhism. [...] He called the Buddhists to congregate outside the government radio station in the evening for a rally. Tension increased throughout the day with demonstrators chanting and displaying anti-government slogans as the crowd grew. They <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> another speech from Thích Trí Quang, but the speech was withdrawn from broadcast by the government censor. The Armed Forces were called in to disperse the discontented crowd. After two explosions shook the ground, the crowd thought that the troops had resorted to using bombs. Major Sy reportedly fired into the air and his men responded by launching grenades into the crowd as fire hoses were unleashed on the demonstrators. His troops fired directly into the crowd. In the end nine were killed and four severely injured. Two of the dead, both children, had been crushed underneath armored personnel carriers. Some people of nine had been mutilated and decapitated.|$|E

2500|$|Rachmaninoff {{sought the}} company of fellow Russian musicians and befriended pianist Vladimir Horowitz in 1928. For Horowitz, the {{opportunity}} represented {{a dream come true}} as Rachmaninoff was [...] "the musical god of my youth ... the most unforgettable impression of my life!" [...] About the pianist's interpretation of Rachmaninoff's own third concerto, the composer said to Abram Chasins that Horowitz [...] "swallowed it whole ... he had the courage, the intensity, the daring." [...] The men remained supportive of each other's work, each making a point of attending concerts given by the other. Horowitz remained a champion of Rachmaninoff's solo works and his Piano Concerto No. 3, about which Rachmaninoff remarked publicly after 7 August 1942 performance at the Hollywood Bowl: [...] "This is the way I always dreamed my concerto should be played, but I never <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it that way on Earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|With [...] "The Truth About Heaven", {{the group}} were {{initially}} unsure {{of how to}} go into the first verse. According to Decicco, Jorgensen came up with a part [...] "and he was like, 'I think this would be really cool over the verses." [...] I played it and I was like, [...] "That actually is really cool." [...] Decicco called it a riff [...] "that I never <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> over it". Decicco said the group wanted [...] "Remember to Feel Real" [...] to [...] "just have it start and ... kick your ass". The pre-chorus riff was written by Jorgensen and Decicco while on tour. The bridge in [...] "Stay on the Ground" [...] features a flange effect, which was written by Decicco and played through a Line 6 Pedal. Jorgensen came up with a keyboard part, which he wrote a song around that became [...] "A Quick Little Flight".|$|E
2500|$|Ferdinand, the entourage and {{the four}} knights left Tangier on 22 October and made their way under Moroccan guard to Asilah (Arzila), thirty miles down the coast from Tangier. [...] The Portuguese hostages were jeered by Moroccan crowds {{as they made their}} way. [...] Upon arrival, Ferdinand and his entourage were kept in {{relatively}} comfortable quarters in Asilah, as would befit a royal hostage. He was allowed to write and receive correspondence from Portugal, interact with the local Christian community and had dealings with local Genoese merchants. The entourage was also allowed to celebrate Christian mass daily. Fellow-prisoner Frei João Álvares reports Ferdinand expected that the treaty would be promptly fulfilled – that Ceuta would be evacuated and handed over and that they would soon be released. [...] Salah ibn Salah also <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of the evacuation of Ceuta in a matter of days.|$|E

He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury is still out on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Loudest Engine {{received}} mostly favourable {{reviews from}} music critics, {{but there were}} a certain amount of music critics who felt otherwise and consequently panned it. Upon its release, Chris Phillips from the Live at the Vault show on BRfm 97.3 called it one of the best albums of the year. Luke McNaney of The Music Fix rated it 8/10 and praised the album, using terms like [...] "swooning melodies", [...] "beguilingly sexy rock", and [...] "prowling guitars". He appreciated the final third of the album the most, and declared [...] "the band have proved their belltower remains a den of intoxicating noise." [...] Scott Causer of Contactmusic rated it 7/10 and <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Stoermer produce an album full of indie anthem pop songs, similar to those of The Killers, but was surprised to instead hear a darker creation. He ended his review by stating that [...] "Howling Bells {{are one of the most}} interesting bands in the world right now and should be cherished as such." [...] Tom O'Donovan of V Music acknowledged that Juanita stood out from her female-fronted counterparts and praised her vocal capacity for its diverse range. He referred to The Loudest Engine as [...] "a promising record displaying a real maturity." [...] Denis Semchenko of Rave Magazine rated the album 3.5/5 and noted that the opening track [...] "Charlatan" [...] and lead single [...] "Into the Sky" [...] were among the band's most distinguished guitar riffs yet, although he thought the album would have benefited from more stylistic diversity.|$|E
