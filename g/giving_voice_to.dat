Postcolonialist writers and critics see Sycorax as <b>giving</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> peoples, particularly women, recovering from the effects of colonisation. Later versions of The Tempest, beginning with William Davenant's eighteenth-century adaptation, have given Sycorax a vocal role in the play, but maintained her image as a malevolent antagonist to Prospero.|$|E

500|$|Corresponding {{with general}} {{developments}} within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement {{began in the}} 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s. Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as [...] "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period", and Peggy Phelan says that it [...] "brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing {{over the past four}} decades". Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created The Dinner Party, a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the 1970s, said in 2009 to ARTnews, [...] "There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are trying to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's art is not an exception—it's a normal part of art history." [...] A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through Cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn, <b>giving</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> the ways [...] "contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment".|$|E

Six years after Aladdin, Salonga {{would go on to}} be cast as the singing voice of second Disney Princess, Mulan, in 1998. Salonga joked about being required to audition for the role despite having already voiced a Disney Princess: [...] "Why do I have to audition?... I was already a princess before. Wasn't that enough?" [...] Meanwhile, Larkin would return to voice Jasmine several times in subsequent media appearances, including films, video games and television series. As the two actresses responsible for <b>giving</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> the character, both Larkin and Salonga were honored with Disney Legends awards for their contributions in 2011 at a ceremony recognized for awarding several other actresses who famously voiced Disney Princesses. In addition to songwriters Menken and Tim Rice, Salonga jokingly thanked Larkin {{for not being able to}} sing and thus providing her with a job. Salonga became the award's first Filipina recipient; her hand print is also imprinted at the Walt Disney headquarters in Burbank, California.|$|E

2500|$|In any event, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{became a}} {{benchmark}} in American literature about U.S. {{society in the}} early 1970s. In Billboard magazine, Chris Morris said, [...] "Through Duke and Gonzo's drug-addled shenanigans amid the seediness of the desert pleasure palaces, it perfectly captured the zeitgeist of the post–'60s era". In Rolling Stone magazine, Mikal Gilmore wrote that the novel [...] "peers into {{the best and worst}} mysteries of the American heart" [...] and that Thompson [...] "sought to understand how the American dream had turned a gun on itself". Gilmore believes that [...] "the fear and loathing Thompson was writing about — a dread of both interior demons and the psychic landscape of the nation around him — wasn't merely his own; he was also <b>giving</b> <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> the mind-set of a generation that had held high ideals and was now crashing hard against the walls of American reality".|$|E

[...] Although Hughes seldom responded to requests to teach at colleges, in 1947 he taught at Atlanta University. In 1949, he spent three months at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools as a visiting lecturer.

And really, after all, this is not my original discovery! There is the third chapter of Genesis, for instance. And then who has not read Carlyle's gloating over a certain historical suit of leather? It gives me a queer thrill of envy, that Quaker Fox and his suit of leather. Conceive it, if you can! One would never have to quail under the scrutiny of a tailor any more. Thoreau, too, come to think of it, was, by way of being a prophet, a pioneer in this Emancipation of Man from Bothery.|$|E
