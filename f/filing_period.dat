25|$|About 219,000 {{water rights}} claims in 85 sub-basins were filed before {{the close of}} the <b>filing</b> <b>period</b> in 1982. Every year from 1979 to 1997, the Chief Water Judge's office handled between 2,000 and 3,000 water claims. Water masters handled the {{remainder}} of the claims. Although verification of water claims can be swift, resolution of objections to the preliminary decree can last a decade or more. Roughly 40 to 50 percent of water rights claims have a problem with verification, priority, or an objection. For example, the Gallatin River basin preliminary decree was issued on September 18, 1985. There were 5,699 water rights claims in the basin, and 1,600 objections to the preliminary decree. Those objections were not resolved until 1997.|$|E

While she ranked as low as twentieth in a survey published by SWS later in the year, she entered the top 12 in January 2013, where she stayed. In the last survey issued by Pulse Asia in April 2013, she was ranked third.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect, classify, and {{quantify}} high-risk compliance pat-terns {{is crucial in}} improving compliance risk assessment and formu-lating effective enforcement strategies within the IRS. A formal reasoning technique known as structured argumentation has been explored by the IRS Large and Mid-Size Business (LMSB) Research to improve compliance risk assessment.

5000|$|... (a) In General. The {{attorney}} for {{the state and the}} defendant may enter into a written filing agreement respecting a pending indictment, information or complaint. The filing agreement must establish a definite <b>filing</b> <b>period</b> of up to one year subject to the conditions, if any, set forth in the filing agreement. Upon execution of the agreement by the parties, the state shall file the agreement forthwith in the trial court and, upon such filing, the agreement will become effective. [...] (b) Court Approval Unnecessary. The approval of the court for the filing of a written filing agreement by the parties is unnecessary; however, a filing agreement is subject to the control of the court. If the agreement calls for the payment by the defendant of costs of prosecution such agreed-upon costs may be in any amount up to, but not exceeding, the maximum authorized fine amount for the particular crime based upon its sentencing class and need not reflect the actual costs of prosecution. [...] (c) Disposition During or at Expiration of <b>Filing</b> <b>Period.</b> Except where a filing agreement expressly provides otherwise as specified in subdivision (d), if the defendant has satisfied each of the filing agreement's conditions, if any, {{at the conclusion of the}} agreed upon <b>filing</b> <b>period</b> the defendant is entitled to have the filed indictment, information or complaint dismissed with prejudice. In this regard, unless the {{attorney for}} the state files a motion alleging a violation of one or more of the agreement's conditions by the defendant and seeking to have the criminal proceeding in which the indictment, information or complaint was filed reactivated by the court, at the expiration of the <b>filing</b> <b>period</b> the clerk shall enter a dismissal of the filed charging instrument with prejudice. In the event the {{attorney for the}} state files a motion during or at the end of the <b>filing</b> <b>period</b> alleging a violation of one or more of the agreement's conditions, the attorney for the state is entitled to have the criminal proceeding reactivated by the court if, following a hearing on the motion, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has violated one or more of the agreement's conditions. [...] (d) Special Reservations in the Filing Agreement. If the attorney for the state wishes to preserve the right to reinitiate a criminal proceeding after the <b>filing</b> <b>period</b> has fully run when no breach of conditions has occurred, or to preserve the right to initiate the same or additional criminal charges against the defendant arising out of the same event or conduct in a separate criminal proceeding while the <b>filing</b> <b>period</b> is running, the attorney for the state must expressly reserve such a right in the written filing agreement and the defendant must expressly agree to it.|$|E

40|$|Automatic suitable-matching area {{selection}} {{is an important}} research in visual guidance, scene matching and local non-texture target tracking. Meanwhile, it is the major research subject in computer vision and accurate guidance. In this paper, a new characteristic quantity, i. e., the edge direction dispersion was defined. Then the computation method, parameters selection and real-time realization of this characteristic quantity were investigated. Furthermore, the application of its characteristic in automatic suitable-matching area selection was studied. With a reasonable design for calculation precision, solving method for arctan(x) function in [-infin, +infin] could be simplified to linearization calculations in [0, 0. 25], then a fast algorithm for arctan(x) function was presented. Experimental {{results showed that the}} sub-image extracted by our fast algorithm had higher matching level and was suitable to be a matching template. All the calculations involved in the proposed matching algorithm could be done in one <b>filed</b> <b>period</b> and the real-time request could be satisfied. Moreover, this characteristic of edge direction could also be used to measure the comparability of template and real-time images, which could be widely used in automatic target recognition and target tracking.
