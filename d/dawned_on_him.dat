500|$|After leaving Boston, Phips {{searched the}} picked over wrecks in the Bahamas with limited success. Too many other {{treasure}} hunters {{had already gone}} before. [...] When some of his crew became mutinous, he had them put off in Jamaica. On November 18, 1684, Phips was in Port Royal, Jamaica {{the same time as}} Captain Stanley of the Bonetta. [...] There is no record of their joining forces or sharing information. [...] It seems likely they met up but we don't know if it was preordained. If Phips was unwittingly being used as a decoy to distract the other treasure hunters away from Stanley, it might have <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> at this time. Soon after Phips visited the north coast of Hispaniola and slowly cruised north exploring the banks where Stanley had been diligently searching for over a year. The decisiveness with which Phips later returned and quickly located the treasure suggests {{that he was able to}} gather valuable knowledge and begin to formulate a clear plan, though he would have to wait two years to bring it to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|My husband told me {{that when}} he was a lad of {{seventeen}} a thought struck him suddenly, which became the foundation of all his future discoveries. It was a flash of psychological insight into the conditions under which a mind most readily accumulates knowledge [...] For a few years he supposed himself to be convinced of the truth of [...] "the Bible" [...] as a whole, and even intended to take orders as a clergyman of the English Church. But by the help of a learned Jew in Lincoln he found out {{the true nature of the}} discovery which had <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> This was that man's mind works by means of some mechanism which [...] "functions normally towards Monism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conlon {{grew up in}} {{a family}} of five {{children}} on Cherry Street in Douglaston, Queens, New York City. His mother, Angeline L. Conlon, was a freelance writer. His father was an assistant to the New York City Commissioner of Labor in the Robert F. Wagner administration. His siblings were not musically inclined, nor were his parents. When he was eleven, he went to a production of La traviata by an amateur company founded by the mother of a friend (Edith Mugdan, the mother of the young Conlon's best friend, Walter Mugdan, and the founder of the North Shore Opera [...] ). He asked for music lessons and became a treble (boy soprano) in a children's chorus in an opera company in Queens. He dreamed about being a tenor, then a baritone, and even wanted to sing the role of Carmen at one point. Finally it <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> {{that the only way to}} do everything in opera was to become an operatic conductor.|$|E
60|$|His face brightened. It {{seemed as}} though light was <b>dawning</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after {{perhaps when}} it <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> Get the pull over him that way.|$|R
60|$|Ephraim {{stared at}} him for a moment in a bewildered fashion, and then a light began to <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|His {{antagonist}} {{looked as}} if a light had suddenly <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Coulthurst's eyes twinkled {{a little}} as {{comprehension}} <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> and he passed Leger the paper.|$|E
60|$|Noel Vanstone's color {{began to}} rise again, as the captain's stratagem <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> at last in its true light.|$|E
6000|$|Till {{he found}} his {{furlough}} strangely hard to win, Boanerges Blitzen didn't care to pin: Then it seemed to <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> something wasn't right-- Boanerges Blitzen put it down to [...] "spite"; ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} that the negro did not {{understand}} whom he meant, but when Jefferson, assisted by the donkey-man, supplied him with a very unflattering description of the delinquent, comprehension seemed to <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> and he once more conferred with his master.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But the rope, Kid' It's bran' new, an' sure yer bread's {{not that}} heavy it needs raisin' with the like of that?' Bettles {{by this time}} had faced around. Father Roubeau, the humor of the {{situation}} just <b>dawning</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> hid a smile behind his mittened hand.|$|R
60|$|For a moment, Tommy {{stared at}} him. Then it <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> {{that of course}} the lawyer did not know.|$|E
60|$|Jordan {{gazed at}} him a moment in amazement, and then laughed in a fashion which {{suggested}} that comprehension had <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{failed to}} {{understand}} the light touch of mocking amusement in her tone; it had not <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that this was her defense.|$|E
50|$|After {{more than}} two years inside the prison, Mateo is still troubled by his {{recurring}} dreams about Monique. It finally <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that Daniel witnessed the whole incident and it was really Fidel who fired the shot that killed his wife. He shares this latest development with Eli and Onay as well as his decision to reopen his murder case.|$|R
50|$|When {{he finally}} enters Rethrick's complex it <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> {{that there is}} a lot more going on than the {{construction}} of an illegal device that can show the future. Rethrick is building an army to support a revolution which would free the country from the oppressive government. The story concludes with Jennings successfully blackmailing Rethrick into allowing him to join the company in a partner-like capacity.|$|R
6000|$|MORE {{follows her}} to the door, but stops there. Then, as full [...] {{realization}} begins to <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> he runs to the bay window, [...] craning his head to catch sight of the front door. There is the [...] sound of a vehicle starting, and the continual hooting of its [...] horn as it makes its way among the crowd. He turns from the [...] window.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth {{felt the}} blood creep into his face, for it {{suddenly}} <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that the suggestion {{she had made}} was to some extent warranted.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's this?" [...] Cyril {{glanced up}} sharply, {{and as he}} noticed the guilty faces of the others and Gertrude's {{strained}} expression, the truth <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Jefferson, as {{comprehension}} <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Then {{the quarter}} share--that offer stands good--didn't bring you? Well, I {{was wondering if}} she would make you go." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{too much}} for James; he hid his face in his hands, and burst into tears. Such joy <b>dawning</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> without having either {{offended}} or injured his cousin, produced a revulsion of feeling which he could not control, and hearing the street-door opened, he ran out of the room, just before his grandmother came hurrying in, on the wings of the intelligence heard below.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Henry Hammond {{up at the}} Glen {{goes out}} doing jobs like that. He'll do, maybe. He's always a heap more {{interested}} in his wages than in his work, just like a man, and he's so slow in the uptake that he stands still for five minutes before it <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that he's stopped. His father threw a stump at {{him when he was}} small.|$|R
50|$|A {{young boy}} listens to his Great-aunt's stories about a magical golden key {{found at the}} end of a rainbow. One day, he sees an immense rainbow and sets out to find the end. The sun sets, but as the forest is in Fairyland where effects are reversed, the rainbow only glows more brightly. He finds the key, then it <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that he does not know where the lock is.|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't state his plans. I {{imagine he}} was rattled when I fired him out. It had {{probably}} <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> he'd been loafing about my office most {{part of the}} afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In what {{character}} shall {{you take}} me?" [...] he asked of Miss Horsman, {{when we were}} going out on the lawn, and it <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that Harry {{was to be a}} Hercules.|$|E
60|$|Brooke gasped as {{the daring}} {{simplicity}} of the scheme <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> If one had nerve enough to undertake it the thing was perfectly feasible, {{and he turned to}} Devine with a glow in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|He reads. He is {{led into}} a solitary {{mountain}} region; all round him is rude and desolate, shapeless, and almost colourless. He hears bells tinkle on the wind. Forth-riding from the formless {{folds of the}} mist <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> the brightest vision--a green-robed lady, on a snow-white palfrey. He sees her dress, her gems, and her steed. She arrests him with some mysterious question. He is spell-bound, and must follow her into fairyland.|$|R
50|$|Mallory reaches her father's {{house in}} New Mexico before Kenneth, Aaron {{and two other}} men arrive to {{interrogate}} John about his daughter's whereabouts. Aaron receives a photograph on his phone of Jiang lying dead, and it <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that Mallory might have been set up. He tries to press Kenneth for the truth, but Kenneth shoots him and escapes, as Mallory takes out Kenneth's other men. Aaron apologizes to Mallory as he dies in her arms.|$|R
50|$|After Barnier's {{talk with}} Colette {{a young woman}} named Jacqueline Bouillotte comes to see him. She tells Barnier that she's in love with Christian Martin and that she lied to {{him and told him}} that she was Barnier's {{daughter}}. Barnier realizes that this means that Martin is not in love with his daughter Colette. It also <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that he won’t be able to get his sixty million francs back from Martin or his daughter since they won’t be getting married.|$|R
6000|$|Dan {{opened his}} eyes, as {{the size and}} beauty of this joke <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Say, dad!" [...] he shouted up the fo'c'sle hatch, [...] "he says you kin slip down an' see him ef you're anxious that way. 'Hear, dad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Ah!” exclaimed Osborne; {{for a light}} <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> as {{he remembered}} his partner’s {{determined}} attempt {{to break through the}} cabin floor {{on the night of the}} wreck. “Perhaps you are right. So the insurance people paid your claim and asked no questions. Did they seem satisfied?” ...|$|E
60|$|Frank {{was too far}} {{advanced}} to retire, before the meaning <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> partly through a little explosion of Herbert behind him, and partly from the guilty consternation and colour with which the other two turned round from the erection of plants among which they were standing.|$|E
5000|$|Anthony Brian Taylor makes {{a similar}} {{argument}} concerning {{the character of}} Lucius, who he sees as [...] "a deeply flawed Roman. Stolid, unimaginative, and soldierly, it never <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> that his readiness to commit unspeakable atrocities on man, woman, and child, is utterly barbaric and totally irreconcilable with the civilised values on which his life is centred. Moreover, in being a deeply flawed Roman, Lucius is his father's son, and as such, a fascinating extension of the play's central theme." ...|$|R
60|$|The lapse of {{time had}} {{asserted}} itself upon {{his upper lip}} in an inaggressive but indisputable moustache, in an added inch or so of stature, and in his less conscious carriage. For he no longer felt that universal attention he believed in at eighteen; {{it was beginning to}} <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> indeed that quite a number of people were entirely indifferent to the fact of his existence. But if less conscious, his carriage was decidedly more confident--as of one with whom the world goes well.|$|R
60|$|Austen was silent, for {{the true}} {{significance}} of this apparently obscure damage case to the Northeastern Railroads was beginning to <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> The public {{was not in the}} best of humours towards railroads: there was trouble about grade crossings, and Mr. Meader's mishap and the manner of his rescue by the son of the corporation counsel had given the accident a deplorable publicity. Moreover, if it had <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> Augustus Flint that the son of Hilary Vane might prosecute the suit, it was worth while taking a little pains with Mr. Meader and Mr. Austen Vane. Certain small fires have been known to light world-wide conflagrations.|$|R
