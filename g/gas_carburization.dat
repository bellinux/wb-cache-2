50|$|Carbonitriding {{is similar}} to <b>gas</b> <b>carburization</b> with the {{addition}} of ammonia to the carburizing atmosphere, which provides a source of nitrogen. Nitrogen is absorbed at the surface and diffuses into the workpiece along with carbon. Carbonitriding (around 850 °C / 1550 °F) is carried out at temperatures substantially higher than plain nitriding (around 530 °C / 990 °F) but slightly lower than those used for carburizing (around 950 °C / 1700 °F) and for shorter times. Carbonitriding tends to be more economical than carburizing, and also reduces distortion during quenching. The lower temperature allows oil quenching, or even gas quenching with a protective atmosphere.|$|E

The ion plasma nitriding was performed at 520 ºC for four different durations. The thermochemical treatment increased the micro abrasive wear {{resistance of the}} studied material.

The most general solution does not require special mathematical functions to fit the variation in surface composition or D(C).

These solutions make use of iterative calculations that converge rapidly and are highly stable.

40|$|Effects {{of various}} {{substrate}} pretreatments such as {{exposure to a}} H 2 plasma, heating in H 2 <b>gas,</b> and <b>carburization</b> in a H 2 /CH 4 plasma on diamond nucleation were investigated at pressures {{of the order of}} mTorr. For substrate pretreatments using a plasma, positive substrate biasing resulted in higher nucleation densities than negative substrate biasing. This suggests that low-energy ion bombardment is favored prior to diamond nucleation. Also, the heating in H 2 gas greatly increased the nucleation density, probably due to an increase in surface roughness. The highest nucleation density (approximately 1 × 108 ㎝- 2) was obtained when the substrate was heated at around 1000 ℃ in H 2 ga...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of CO 2 {{emission}} reduction, the oxy-fuel technology provides a promising option applicable in centralized energy production. This technology is based on pulverized coal combustion with pure oxygen instead of air. Different from the conventional systems, metallic heat exchanging components in the oxy-fuel plants will be subjected to service environments containing high amounts of CO 2 and H 2 O. In the present study the oxidation behaviour of selected ferritic/martensitic and austenitic steels as well as Ni-base alloys, which are candidate materials for heat exchanging components, was investigated in model gas mixtures containing high amounts of CO 2 and/or H 2 O at temperatures {{in the range of}} 550 to 700 °C and times ranging from a few up to 1000 hours. The results obtained after oxidation in the simulated oxy-fuel environments were compared with the behaviour in air, Ar/CO 2 and Ar/H 2 O gases. For studying the effect of oxygen present in the real oxy-fuel atmosphere, Ar/CO 2 gas was mixed additionally with different amounts of O 2. It was found that in the CO 2 and/or H 2 O-rich gases, the ferritic/martensitic steels tended to form Fe-rich oxide scales with significantly higher growth rates than the Cr-rich surface scales formed during air exposure. The Fe-rich scales were formed {{as a result of a}} decreased flux of chromium in the bulk alloy toward the surface because of enhanced internal oxidation of chromium in the H 2 O-containing gases and carbide formation in the CO 2 -rich gases. It was observed, however, that martensitic steels with higher initial Cr concentration had a stronger tendency to form protective Cr-base oxide scales when 1 or 3 % of oxygen was added to the Ar/CO 2 gas mixture. The oxide scale formation was affected by minor alloying additions, especially silicon. The poorly protective Fe-base oxide scales formed during exposure of the ferritic/martensitic steels to simulated oxy-fuel environments appeared to be permeable to CO 2 molecules resulting in carburization of the steels whereby the extent was reduced by increasing water vapour content in the <b>gas</b> mixture. <b>Carburization</b> of 9 - 12 % Cr martensitic steels was also found to be significantly reduced when 0. 5 vol. % of SO 2 were added to oxidizing CO 2 -rich environments. The oxidation behaviour of the austenitic steels strongly depended on the detailed alloy composition. At 550 °C all austenitic steels exhibited very slow scale growth rates, however, at and above 600 °C steels with lower Cr content (17 - 20 wt. %) started to form multi-layered, Fe-rich oxide scales whereby the outer oxide layer was prone to spalling upon thermal cycling. For the 25 % Cr austenitic steel and the Ni-base alloys much lower oxidation rates were observed, however, presence of water vapour in combination with intentionally added oxygen in the test atmosphere resulted in formation of volatile chromium species. The effect of surface modification was studied in the case of the 9 - 12 % Cr and the austenitic steels with lower Cr content. At higher temperatures (650 - 700 °C) a significant improvement in oxidation resistance was observed for austenitic steels when cold work was applied to the surface prior to exposure in CO 2 /H 2 O-rich atmospheres...|$|R
40|$|Tungsten based-materials {{are used}} in many {{different}} technical fields, particularly in applications requiring good temperature and/or erosion resistance. Nanostructuring of tungsten alloys and composites {{has the potential to}} dramatically improve the materials’ properties, enhancing the performance in present applications or enabling totally new possibilities. Nanostructured WC-Co composites have been the focus of researchers and industries for over two decades. New methods for powder fabrication and powder consolidation have been developed. However, the fabrication of true nanograined WC-Co materials is still a challenge. Nanostructured tungsten composites for applications as plasma facing materials in fusion reactors have in recent years attracted a growing interest. This Thesis summarizes work on the development of chemical methods for the fabrication of two different types of nanostructured tungsten based materials; WC-Co materials mainly aimed at cutting tools applications and W-ODS composites with rare earth oxide particles, intended as plasma facing materials in future fusion reactors. The approach has been to prepare powders in two steps: a) synthesis of uniform powder precursors containing ions of tungsten and the doping elements by co-precipitation from aqueous solutions, and b) further processing of the precursors into W or WC based nano-composite powders. Highly homogenous W and Co containing powder precursors for WC-Co composites were prepared via two different routes. Keggin-based precursors ((NH 4) 8 [H 2 Co 2 W 11 O 40]) with agglomerates of sizes up to 50 μm, were made from sodium tungstate or ammonium metatungstate and cobalt acetate. The powder composition corresponded to 5. 2 % Co in the final WC-Co composites. In a second approach, paratungstate-based precursors (Cox(NH 4) 10 - 2 x[H 2 W 12 O 42]) were prepared from ammonium paratungstate (APT) and cobalt hydroxide with different compositions corresponding to 3. 7 to 9. 7 % Co in WC-Co. These particles had a plate-like morphology with sides of 5 - 20 μm and a thickness of less than 1 μm. Both precursors were processed and sintered into highly uniform microstructures with fine scale (< 1 μm). The processing of paratungstate-based precursors was also further investigated. Nanostructured WC-Co powders with grains size of less than 50 nm by decreasing processing temperatures and by applying <b>gas</b> phase <b>carburization.</b> W-ODS materials were fabricated starting from ammonium paratungstate and rare earth elements (Y or La). Paratungstate-based precursors were prepared with different homogeneity and particle sizes. The degree of the chemical uniformity varied with the particle size from ca 1 to 30 μm. Tungsten trioxide hydrate-based precursors made from APT and yttrium nitrate under acidic conditions had dramatically higher homogeneity and smaller particle size. The crystallite size was decreased to a few nanometers. These precursors were further processed to composite nanopowder and sintered to a nanostructured W- 1. 2 %Y 2 O 3 composite with 88 % relative density. In summary, APT can be converted to highly homogenous powder precursors of different compositions. The transformations are carried out in aqueous suspensions as a solvent mediated process, in which the starting material dissolves and the precursor precipitates. Powders with fine scale morphologies are obtained, e. g. plate-like particles with thickness less than 1 μm or spherical particles with size of a few nanometers. These precursors were processed further in to nano-sized composite powders and sintered to highly uniform tungsten composites with fine microstructures. QC 2011101...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of the {{production}} of thin-walled steel alloys through the reduction and subsequent <b>gas</b> <b>carburization</b> of structures made from metal oxide powders were performed. Batch compositions, {{as well as the}} heat treatment parameters necessary for the formation of structures were determined through the use of thermogravimetric analysis, dilatometric measurements, and microstructural investigation. Parameters for the high temperature carburization of thin-walled 4140 structures were determined. The research has shown that the amount of carbon in the walls of the structures can be controlled and uniform carbon contents across the cross-sections can be achieved in less than 30 minutes. Heat treatments for carburized samples were performed and subsequent microhardness testing resulted in values similar to conventionally produced 4140 steel. Studies on the decarburization behavior of similar alloys under various conditions were also performed in order to aid in the prediction of the microstructural behavior of samples during carburization and subsequent heat treatment. Low temperature <b>gas</b> <b>carburization</b> of structures with 316 steel composition has also been performed. Hardness variations present through the cross-section of the part after carburization suggest some transfer of carbon, though contents are not as high as anticipated. Suggestions for future work in this area are presented. The results of these investigations yield a novel method for {{the production}} of steel parts from metal oxide powders. The speed and low cost of the process, coupled with the proven ability of the process to yield parts with similar microstructural and mechanical characteristics as conventionally made alloys, allows for the techniques presented in this study to be used for the development of alloys which could not be previously done economically.

40|$|An {{optimized}} carburization {{treatment has}} been developed to mitigate instabilities that form in the microstructures of advanced turbine airfoil materials. Current turbine airfoils consist of a single crystal superalloy base that provides the mechanical performance of the airfoil, a thermal barrier coating (TBC) that reduces {{the temperature of the}} base superalloy, and a bondcoat between the superalloy and the TBC, that improves the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the base superalloy and the spallation resistance of the TBC. Advanced nickel-base superalloys containing high levels of refractory metals have been observed to develop an instability called secondary reaction zone (SRZ), which can form beneath diffusion aluminide bondcoats. This instability between the superalloy and the bondcoat has the potential of reducing the mechanical properties of thin-wall turbine airfoils. Controlled <b>gas</b> <b>carburization</b> treatments combined with a prior stress relief heat treatment and adequate surface preparation have been utilized effectively to minimize the formation of SRZ. These additional processing steps are employed before the aluminide bondcoat is deposited and are believed to change the local chemistry and local stresses of the surface of the superalloy. This paper presents the detailed processing steps used to reduce SRZ between platinum aluminide bondcoats and advanced single crystal superalloys...|$|E
40|$|Metal dusting {{corrosion}} is {{high temperature}} degradation of {{metals and alloys}} into dust-like fine particles. It is often encountered in petrochemical industry, where metals and alloys extensively exposed to carbon containing gases at high temperature and pressure conditions. It is a costly issue in the industry; millions of dollars have been invested annually {{in the fields of}} monitoring, controlling and prevention of metal dusting corrosion to avoid potential dangers in the environments that are considered by explosive and/or poisonous gases under high pressure and temperature conditions. Metal dusting initiates as a result of unwanted carbon formation on the inner surface of chemical engineering installations. At high temperature, solid carbon diffuses into the metal/alloy matrix to form a carburized layer {{on the surface of the}} material. Under certain conditions, this carburized region may become unstable and decompose into carbon and metal/alloy particles (coke), as well as other corrosion products. Such metal particles may further catalyze the carbon deposition and the process is hence accelerated. The initial stages of metal dusting, i. e. the first stages of carbon formation that initiate the process that we find are not well described, are analogues to carbon formation issue on the catalysts used in the same syngas technology. Improved understanding of the initial phase of metal dusting and the role of the alloy surface was obtained through a comprehensive experimental investigation, together with surface and bulk characterization. Pre-oxidized Ni-base alloy samples were subjected to different syngas atmospheres. Samples after <b>carburization</b> <b>gas</b> treatment were first analysed by visual inspection, optical imaging and light optical microscopy. The surface morphology and composition of the fresh, pre-oxidized and CO exposed alloy samples were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Auger electron spectroscopy under ion-sputtering. The resulting carbonaceous products were characterized by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and EDS. The bulk composition of the fresh alloy was determined by electron probe micro-analysis via wave length dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. As shown by Auger depth profile analysis, the increasing oxidation temperature was found to result in a surface oxide layer with better resistance to carbon formation under 10 %CO-Ar mixture at 1 bar, irrespective of the oxygen concentration of the pretreatment gas. The carbon formation appears to be associated with inclusion of Ni and Fe species in the surface oxide layer, which subsequently reduce to promote the kinetics of the process. SEM imaging confirms that the extent of the carbon formation during CO exposure is also depending on the initial surface microstructure and composition. Initial stages of metal dusting corrosion and carbon formation under syngas at industrially relevant conditions (at 20 bar) were also studied. Results show that a little or no carbon formed at low temperature, and the alloy matrix remained reasonably intact, with some smaller changes occurring within the Cr-rich surface oxide. The higher carbon formation occurring under the exposure at medium and high temperatures demonstrates that the reactions leading to carbon formation are kinetically limited. Co-current oxidation and Cr-enrichment of the near-surface layer was also observed under the mixture having low CO partial pressure, and pitting of the samples was revealed after removal of most of the carbonaceous products on the surface. The carbon formation is even higher under the high CO partial pressure at medium or high temperature conditions. Severe metal spalling of the alloy was also observed under these conditions, with complete disintegration of the Cr-rich surface oxide layer and carburization of the alloy matrix extending far into the bulk. Presence of reducible Ni and Fe phases within the Cr-rich oxide formed during the pre-oxidation were associated with the carbon formation and the TEM/EDS evidence confirms that Ni−Fe alloy particles have acted as catalysts for the formation of filamentous carbon PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Engineerin...|$|R
