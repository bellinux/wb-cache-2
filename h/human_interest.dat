5|$|Correspondent {{segments}} {{feature a}} rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people {{related to the}} featured issue. Topics have varied widely; {{during the early years}} of the show they tended toward character-driven <b>human</b> <b>interest</b> stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of The Daily Show. However, as the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} phycology {{is the history}} of the {{scientific}} study of algae. <b>Human</b> <b>interest</b> in plants as food goes back into the origins of the species and knowledge of algae can be traced back more than two thousand years.

25|$|A study {{involving}} Professor Robert Orttung at George Washington University {{states that}} RT uses <b>human</b> <b>interest</b> stories without ideological content to attract viewers to its channels.

25|$|With Harold {{running the}} {{business}} side of the operation and Alfred as Editor, the Mail from the start adopted an imperialist political stance, taking a patriotic line in the Second Boer War, leading to claims that it was not reporting the issues of the day objectively. From the beginning, the Mail also set out to entertain its readers with <b>human</b> <b>interest</b> stories, serials, features and competitions (which were also the main means by which the Harmsworths promoted the paper).|$|E
50|$|The {{narrative}} {{touches on}} a variety of themes, seeming to center around the inevitability of tomorrow and the pursuit of <b>human</b> <b>interests</b> through spirituality, creativity, and friendship.

Most national newspapers carried a photograph of two grieving schoolgirls, who were clearly identifiable from the picture; readers complained in writing that they considered this to be insensitive and an invasion of the girls' privacy.|$|E
25|$|In his {{commemorative}} speech, Alfred Brauer (PhD candidate Schur) {{spoke about}} Issai Schur as follows: As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, {{but not always}} easy and required cooperation - During the winter semester of 1930, {{the number of students}} who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his <b>human</b> <b>interest</b> in his students.|$|E
25|$|Alma-Tadema's {{works are}} {{remarkable}} {{for the way}} in which flowers, textures and hard reflecting substances, like metals, pottery, and especially marble, are painted – indeed, his realistic depiction of marble led him to be called the 'marbellous painter'. His work shows much of the fine execution and brilliant colour of the old Dutch masters. By the <b>human</b> <b>interest</b> with which he imbues all his scenes from ancient life he brings them within the scope of modern feeling, and charms us with gentle sentiment and playfulness.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} Science {{is not a}} mere record of {{isolated}} discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and <b>human</b> <b>interests</b> on the other.|$|R
