40|$|Background. In recent years, we have {{investigated}} both patients' and family doctors' communicative characteristics towards nutrition communication in general practice with several {{qualitative and quantitative}} studies. A sound comparison of the survey results between both conversation partners {{has not been made}} before. Objective. The aim {{of the present study was}} to put together data obtained by earlier studies for the first time in order to make comparisons of patients' and family doctors' communicative characteristics regarding nutrition communication. Methods. In The Netherlands, 603 patients completed a face-to-face interview-assisted questionnaire (65 % response rate) and 267 <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> completed a questionnaire (45 % response rate). Results. When comparing communicative characteristics, patients stronger believed that nutrition was an influence on health than <b>family</b> <b>doctors.</b> They also attributed a greater role to personal hygiene, stress and heredity, while <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> were more convinced of the role of alcohol use and smoking on health. Patients more often rated their own nutrition knowledge as good than <b>family</b> <b>doctors.</b> In contrast, <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> showed higher interest in nutrition and nutrition information than patients. As a result, a collinear model for <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> and nutrition communication towards patients was provided. Conclusions. Significant differences between patients and <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> were found for several communicative characteristics towards nutrition communication. It is important that <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> become convinced that patients perceive them as a reliable and expert source of nutrition information. It is recommended that <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> raise nutrition awareness among patients. Finally, we advise <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> to pay attention to nutrition communication styles...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{administrative}} data from Norway, {{we examine the}} extent to which <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> influence their clients' propensity to claim sick pay and disability benefits. The analysis is based on exogenous shifts of <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> occurring when physicians quit, retire, or for other reasons sell their patient lists to other doctors. Our key finding is that <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> have significant influence on their clients' benefit claims. We conclude that it is possible for <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> to contain social insurance costs to some extent, {{and that there is a}} significant variation across doctors in the way they do so...|$|R
5|$|On April 14, 1960, Cooper {{underwent}} surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for an aggressive form {{of prostate cancer}} which had metastasized to his colon.

5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the <b>family</b> <b>doctor</b> that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away.

5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara <b>family</b> <b>doctor,</b> Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E

40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>doctors</b> {{are often}} devalued in our complex and {{specialised}} world. Generalism is often discounted whilst specialisation is highlyvalued.

5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a <b>family</b> <b>doctor.</b> Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs and {{his wife}} lived in rented {{property}} for {{the first years of}} their marriage. His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of lower middle class according to McKinstry: although more prosperous than he had been during his childhood, the family were not initially financially comfortable. Hobbs' wages increased with his reputation so that by 1913, he was earning £375 each year, placing his family within the bracket of the London middle class. After several years of moving from one property to another, he was able to buy his own house in 1913, in Clapham Common, a prosperous area of London. By the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the players were famous. Hobbs was the biggest attraction and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around £780 each year), the income from his business, product endorsement—he {{was one of the first}} cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products—and ghostwritten books and articles made him relatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached £1,500 a year by 1925, more than a <b>family</b> <b>doctor</b> at the time. Consequently, in 1928 the family moved to a large house in private grounds and Hobbs was able to send his children to private schools. He had greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers, but was always first concerned to give his family the security lacking from his childhood.|$|E

Interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Most of the interviewed specialists have a positive view on <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> although a certain depreciative assumption is resonated in a number of statements. According to the specialists, <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> enjoy a high status in public, even if social processes of change may have a negative influence on their rather old-fashioned image.

Altogether the majority of the interviewed specialists certify <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> in Germany a positive image.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{nutrition}} communication styles of Dutch <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> {{and in particular}} to assess its psychosocial and sociodemographic correlates. Design: A cross-sectional study in which {{a representative sample of}} 600 Dutch <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> completed a questionnaire. Setting: The survey was conducted in October and November 2004 in the Netherlands. Subjects: A total of 267 <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> completed the questionnaire (response rate 45 %). Methods: Principal component factor analyses with varimax rotation were performed to construct factors. Cronbach's was used as an index of reliability. Our hypothetical model for nutrition communication style was tested using multiple regression analysis, combining the forward and backward procedures under the condition of the same results. Results: Many <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> felt at ease with a motivational nutrition communication style. The main predictor for motivational nutrition communication style was task perception of prevention (26 %). Some individual and environmental correlates had an additional influence (explained variance 49 %). Other styles showed explained variances up to 57 %. The motivational style was the best predictor for actual nutrition communication behaviour (35 %), while the confrontational style was the best predictor for actual nutrition communication behaviour towards overweight (34 %). Conclusions: In contemporary busy practice, <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> seem to rely on their predominant nutrition communication style to deal with standard situations efficiently: for the majority, this proved to be the motivational nutrition communication style. Moreover, <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> used a combination of styles. This study suggests that <b>family</b> <b>doctors</b> behave like chameleons, by adapting their style to the specific circumstances, like context, time and patient.
