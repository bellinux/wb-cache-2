30|$|Mattresses are {{classified}} by {{the type of}} support system: <b>innerspring,</b> solid foam, cotton batting, air, or water. Air and water mattresses account for less than 20 % of the U.S. market, solid foam (viscoelastic and latex) mattresses and <b>innerspring</b> mattresses account for nearly all of the remaining 80 % of the U.S. market (Mattress manufacturing in the US [2011]). Solid foam mattresses, also called all-foam mattress, do not have springs or other metallic arrangements. The use of viscoelastic or ‘memory’ foam and latex mattress is increasing in modern residential mattresses. An <b>innerspring</b> mattress is constructed from metal springs that may be separately housed in individual fabric sheaths or attached to a metal frame (Figure 4 a). <b>Innerspring</b> mattresses covered with varying combinations of layered viscoelastic and latex foam in combination with standard PUF are also available. For single-sided mattresses (also known as ‘no flip’ mattresses), the <b>innerspring</b> is covered by a comfort layer {{on one side and a}} low-cost non-woven backing material on the other. A comfort layer covers both sides for double-sided mattresses.|$|R

5000|$|Heinrich Westphal was {{credited}} with inventing the <b>innerspring</b> mattress in 1871. Heinrich lived in Germany and never profited from his invention dying in poverty.|$|R
50|$|When Zalmon G. Simmons II {{took over}} the company after his father’s death in 1910 he {{continued}} the tradition of innovation set by his predecessor. The greatest example came in 1925 {{with the introduction of}} the Beautyrest mattress. This new mass-produced <b>innerspring</b> mattress was made of individual cloth pocketed coils that contoured to the body and led to a new world of sleep comfort. While the younger Simmons did not invent the pocketed coil <b>innerspring</b> mattress he facilitated a way to mass-produce it.|$|R
30|$|Mattress {{flammability}} {{is significantly}} impacted by its construction. The fuel load {{of a solid}} PUF core mattress is significantly {{greater than that of}} an <b>innerspring</b> mattress with similar filling material. Intuitively, the fuel load would be expected to be an important factor in determining the fire performance of the mattress set. However, this assumption may only be partially accurate, since an <b>innerspring</b> mattress filled with melamine-type foam has been shown to result in higher heat release rates than a solid core mattress of the same size filled with similar melamine-type foam ([Damant & Nurbakhsh 1992]). This may be attributed to the reduced air flow within the more closed structure of the solid core mattress, which limits heat release and fire growth, whereas the open structure of the <b>innerspring</b> allows air to flow freely. In the latter case, pyrolysis is limited only by the types of materials used in mattress construction.|$|R
50|$|Companies often {{specialize}} {{in a particular}} type of mattress, such as <b>innerspring,</b> latex, and airbed, although as latex and airbeds have become more popular, they have become more common.|$|R
30|$|A {{mattress}} set essentially {{consists of}} three main components: a frame, foundation and mattress. Mattresses are classified by the support system, which can be an <b>innerspring,</b> solid PUF, cotton batting, air or water. A typical <b>innerspring</b> mattress, which accounts for nearly 80 % of the U.S. market, is covered by a comfort layer on one side for single-sided mattresses or on both sides for double-sided mattresses. The comfort layer {{is divided into three}} sub categories: cushioning layer, insulator and quilt. The quilt is the top layer of the mattress and is constructed of the ticking (the outer cover fabric of a mattress) and a low density PUF or fiber batting laminated or stitched to the underside of the ticking. The insulator and the cushioning layers may be stacked in varying sequences between the quilt and the <b>innerspring</b> support. The insulating layer is often a light-weight, low density nonwoven batting (or layers of nonwoven fabrics), whereas the cushioning layer may include flat or convoluted PUF, shredded pads of compressed polyester, or fiber battings.|$|R
5000|$|A {{traditional}} {{box spring}} {{consists of a}} rigid frame containing extra heavy duty springs. This foundation is often paired with an <b>innerspring</b> mattress, as it extends {{the life of the}} spring unit at the mattress's core.|$|R
50|$|Early {{mattresses}} {{contained a}} variety of natural materials including straw, feathers or horse hair. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, a typical mattress sold in North America had an <b>innerspring</b> core and cotton batting or fiberfill. Modern mattresses usually contain either an inner spring core or materials such as latex, viscoelastic or other flexible polyurethane foams. Other fill components include insulator pads over the coils that prevent the bed's upholstery layers from cupping down into the <b>innerspring,</b> as well as polyester fiberfill in the bed's top upholstery layers. In 1899 James Marshall introduced the first individually wrapped pocketed spring coil mattress now commonly known as Marshall coils.|$|R
5000|$|Continuous coils (the Leggett & Platt {{brand name}} is [...] "Mira-coil") is an <b>innerspring</b> {{configuration}} {{in which the}} rows of coils are formed from {{a single piece of}} wire. They work in a hinging effect similar to that of offset coils.|$|R
50|$|Sleep Experts carries bedding {{products}} including mattresses, box springs, {{pillows and}} other bedding accessories. The company’s mattress selection includes <b>innerspring</b> mattresses, memory foam mattresses, and air mattresses, with brands including Tempur-Pedic, ComforPedic, Simmons, Spring Air, Beautyrest, Serta, Laura Ashley, Sleep Designs, Dr. Breus, and Comfortaire, which was recently acquired by Select Comfort.|$|R
5000|$|Bonnell coils are {{the oldest}} and most common. First adapted from buggy seat springs of the 19th century, they are still {{prevalent}} in mid-priced mattresses. Bonnell springs are a knotted, round-top, hourglass-shaped steel wire coil. When laced together with cross wire helicals, these coils form the simplest <b>innerspring</b> unit, also referred to as a Bonnell unit.|$|R
50|$|In North America {{the typical}} {{mattress}} sold today is an innerspring; however {{there is increasing}} interest in all-foam beds and so-called hybrid beds, which include both an <b>innerspring</b> and high-end foams such as visco-elastic or latex in the comfort layers. In Europe, polyurethane foam cores and latex cores have long been popular and make up a much larger proportion of the mattresses sold.|$|R
5000|$|Mattress coils, {{also known}} as {{mattress}} springs, are coil springs used in a mattress. Coils are primarily used in the core (support layer) of <b>innerspring</b> mattresses, which is their original use. In recent years small [...] "micro-coils" [...] have started {{being used in the}} upholstery (comfort layer) of mattresses, primarily with a coil core ("coil-on-coil" [...] construction), but sometimes with other core types.|$|R
5000|$|Offset coils are an {{hourglass}} type coil {{on which}} {{portions of the}} top and bottom convolutions have been flattened. In assembling the <b>innerspring</b> unit, these flat segments of wire are hinged together with helical wires. The hinging effect of the unit is designed to conform to body shape. LFK coils are an unknotted offset coil with a cylindrical or columnar shape.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to memory}} foam {{mattress}}es, a high density foam mattress uses a more compact foam typically made from polyurethane. This kind of foam is made largely from open {{cells that are}} packed together tightly. High density foam mattresses offer comfort and longevity {{because they are more}} dense than a traditional foam mattress. High density foam mattresses that have an <b>innerspring</b> system last even longer and eliminate mattress sagging.|$|R
50|$|Although {{available}} in various models and continuously improved upon, bedsprings were practically the only product Leggett & Platt offered until 1933. However, {{in that year}} the company began to manufacture springs for <b>innerspring</b> mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails.|$|R

50|$|Memory foam {{mattresses}} use conforming visco-elastic foam over firmer polyurethane base foam. Some <b>innerspring</b> mattresses have {{memory foam}} in their upholstery layer. Different feels and comfort levels are achieved by varying the thickness, weight and {{formulation of the}} visco-elastic foams and the base foams. Latex and memory foam mattresses each provide a unique feel. This type of mattress is good at relieving pressure on painful joints. Many memory foam mattresses are more expensive than standard spring mattresses.|$|R
30|$|The comfort {{layer is}} divided into three subcategories: the quilt, the {{insulating}} layer, and the cushioning layer. The quilt is the top layer of the mattress. It provides a soft surface texture and a level of firmness that can be varied by changing the material and the details of construction. The quilt consists of the ticking plus low-density foam or fiber batting that is stitched to its underside. These two layers are sewn to a tape edge that attaches to the border quilting {{around the perimeter of the}} mattress. The insulating layer is the first layer next to the <b>innerspring</b> unit. It forms a barrier between the softer foam layers to reduce the likelihood of them “pocketing” into the spring unit and causing a lumpy uncomfortable sleeping surface. The insulating layer can be a fiber batting or layers of non-woven fabrics. The cushioning layer provides an extra layer of comfort, and may include flat or convoluted PUF, shredded pads of compressed polyester, or fiber battings. The insulator and cushioning layers can be stacked in varying sequences between the quilt and the <b>innerspring</b> support. With the introduction of 16 CFR 1633 in 2007, most mattress manufacturers changed to single-sided mattresses because of the expense of complying with flammability regulations for both sides of the bedding (Taylor [2999]).|$|R
50|$|In 1901, a {{planning}} mill operator in Canada named James Marshall patented the first <b>innerspring</b> mattress with individual cloth pocketed coils. He produced the inner-springs {{with a machine}} that hand cranked a single coil that was then sewn into a cloth pocket. The process was repeated multiple times to create one mattress. Since the Marshall inner-springs were made by hand they were very expensive, appearing only in few lavish hotels and on luxury ships such as the Titanic and the Lusitania. When Marshall’s patent expired in 1917 the mattress was still unknown {{to the majority of}} the general public. Z.G. Simmons II knew the Marshall <b>innerspring</b> was a quality mattress but the price kept it from being a profitable product. In 1922 he charged a top Simmons engineer named John Franklin Gail with the task of inventing a machine that could mass-produce pocketed coil inner-springs. Gail was sent to Evanston, Illinois, away from the distractions of the Kenosha plant, with instructions to work on no other project until it was completed. After three years of dedication Gail finally returned to “the Chief” with the “Beautyrest Pocket Machine”, a piece of machinery that revolutionized the bedding manufacturing industry. The release of this new mattress, that brought comfort to the Everyman, not only changed the manufacturing industry but also the sales and marketing industries.|$|R
50|$|George Bills {{was born}} in Brighton in England in 1859. He {{migrated}} {{with his family to}} New Zealand and subsequently to Echuca, Victoria in Australia in 1873. In 1882 he opened a bird dealers shop in Brisbane, where he met and married Annis Swann who had immigrated from Sheffield in England. In 1884 the couple moved to Sydney and George Bills went into business with his brothers, manufacturing <b>innerspring</b> mattresses. In 1908, George retired to Hawthorn, Victoria and in 1910, Annis died while the couple were visiting England. George became a Life Governor of the RSPCA in 1924.|$|R
50|$|Ticking is the {{protective}} fabric cover used to encase mattresses and foundations. It is usually designed to coordinate with the foundation border fabric {{and comes in}} a wide variety of colors and styles. Mattress fabrics can be knits, damask or printed wovens, or inexpensive nonwovens. During the past decade, along with the rise in popularity of all-foam beds, stretchy knit ticking on the bed's top panel has become a standard look on both <b>innerspring</b> and foam beds. Most ticking is made with polyester yarns. More expensive mattress fabrics may contain a combination of polyester with rayon, cotton, silk, wool or other natural yarns.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2009, {{the company}} partnered with {{mattress}} manufacturer Serta {{to release a}} Trump Home mattress collection. Serta had planned to launch the collection with high pricing, however, the collection priced lower due to the 2008 recession.

40|$|ABSTRACT: California Technical Bulletin 129, a {{test method}} for {{flammability}} of mattresses {{for use in}} public occupancies, was published in 1992 and has been used voluntarily by manufacturers and procurement officials throughout the United States. In this paper, the results of 126 tests conducted on mattresses that were submitted to the Bureau’s laboratory are reviewed. The effects of cover fab-rics, filling contents and fire-blocking barriers, both in <b>innerspring</b> and non-innerspring mattresses, are discussed. It is concluded that the technology and materials exist that allow manufacturers to build mattresses that {{comply with the requirements}} of this fire test standard.

50|$|Mattresses {{deteriorate}} over time, and the lifespan of {{a mattress}} {{depends on a}} variety of factors, notably materials, manufacturing quality, care, and the vigorousness of use. A poor quality foam comfort layer can deteriorate noticeably in 1 year, while a quality latex core can last 20 years or more; <b>innerspring</b> cores typically last around 10 years. The comfort layer is almost invariably the first area to fail, which is why mattresses are often double-sided, to extend the lifespan. A separate topper may be used instead of or in addition to a comfort layer, which reduces wear and is replaceable without replacing the entire mattress.|$|R

5000|$|Mattresses {{are usually}} placed {{on top of}} a bed base which may be solid, {{as in the case of}} a {{platform}} bed, or elastic, e.g. with an upholstered wood and wire box spring or a slatted foundation. Popular in Europe, a divan incorporates both mattress and foundation in a single upholstered, footed unit. Divans have at least one <b>innerspring</b> layer as well as cushioning materials. They may be supplied with a secondary mattress and/or a removable [...] "topper." [...] Mattresses may also be filled with air or water, or a variety of natural fibers, such as in futons. Kapok is a common mattress material in Southeast Asia, and coir in South Asia.|$|R
50|$|In the 14th {{century the}} lower class slept on {{mattresses}} that were stuffed with straw. During the 16th century mattresses stuffed with feathers started to gain popularity, {{with those who}} could afford them. The common person was doing well if he could buy a mattress {{after seven years of}} marriage. In the 18th century cotton and wool started to become more common. The first coil spring mattress wasn’t invented until 1871. The most common and most purchased mattress is the <b>innerspring</b> mattress. The variety of choices range from relatively soft to a rather firm mattress. A bedroom may have bunk beds if more than one person share a room. A chamber pot kept under the bed or in a nightstand was usual in the period before modern domestic plumbing and bathrooms in dwellings.|$|R
5000|$|Memory foam is {{affected}} by temperature. In a cool bedroom, a memory foam mattress will feel firmer than it does in a warm bedroom. Memory softens and conforms to the sleeper in response to body temperature and body weight. Traditional memory foam molds to the body creating a depression the sleeper must roll out of when changing sleep positions. Mattress manufacturers have responded to this issue by using [...] "faster response" [...] memory foams. They spring back more quickly when the sleeper moves. Foam mattresses are also known to generally [...] "sleep warmer" [...] than <b>innerspring</b> mattresses. Mattress makers have addressed the issue with [...] "open-cell" [...] memory foams, pinhole cored memory foam, gel-infused memory foams, channel-cut foam cores, reticulated foam support layers and other technologies to improve air circulation through all-foam beds.|$|R
