The biodegradability, tensile and morphological properties of PLA <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites</b> were investigated using soil burial test, tensile testing machine, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical microscopy. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to observe the interactions between fillers and PLA in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites.</b> Various amounts of MCC were added to the optimum formulation which was 5 phr of MMT to produce PLA/MMT/MCC <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites.</b> The biodegradability of <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites</b> increased compared to nanocomposite with 5 phr MMT content and neat PLA.

The current studies focus {{on the effects of}} incorporation of silane treated OPMF into polylactic acid (PLA) /polycaprolactone (PCL) /nanoclay/OPMF <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites.</b> The composites were prepared by melt blending technique and characterize the composites with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FTIR spectra indicated that peak shifting occurs when silane treated OPMF was incorporated into <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites.</b> Based on mechanical properties results, incorporation of silane treated OPMF enhances the mechanical properties of unmodified OPMF <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites</b> with the enhancement of flexural and impact strength being 17. 60 % and 48. 43 %, respectively, at 10 % fiber loading. TGA thermogram shows that incorporation of silane treated OPMF did not show increment in thermal properties of <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites.</b> SEM micrographs revealed that silane treated OPMF <b>hybrid</b> <b>composites</b> show good fiber/matrix adhesion as fiber is still embedded in the matrix and no cavity is present on the surface.
