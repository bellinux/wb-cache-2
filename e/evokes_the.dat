5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} {{stimulated by the}} {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Following the restoration, {{the station}} <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> 1940s; the {{interior}} is complete with a potbelly stove, tiny Coca-Cola bottle and antique Dwight Lumber/Route 66 advertising yardsticks. Also inside are an old cash register, old 7 Up bottles and a plaid stamp saver book. The restored station {{is owned by the}} village of Dwight.|$|E
5|$|The {{statements}} {{cited by}} Universal {{recognize that the}} Donkey Kong theme loosely <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> King Kong films.

5|$|This {{magnificent}} {{and tragic}} satire criticizes {{the prototype of}} the Latin American dictator who appeared in several places {{at the beginning of}} the century and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a hell on earth. The passionate vigour with which Asturias <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.|$|E
5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge, celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the unbounded scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E
5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E

25|$|The {{narrative}} <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> first humans {{created by}} Roog {{with a female}} being the first, and the trials they had faced. It also <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> name of Roog, regarded as the Omnipotence, whom through his paternal nature, acted as a good father and moved the woman to a more comfortable place when she complained about her discomfort. It shows that he is always available to his children. The appearance of the man initially surprised the woman, whom she named Ngoor (virile), yet, they later became companions and procreated.|$|E

25|$|Eye {{symbolism}} appears {{repeatedly in}} Blade Runner and provides insight into themes and characters therein. The film opens with an extreme closeup {{of an eye}} which fills the screen reflecting the industrial landscape seen below. When reflecting one of the Tyrell Corp. pyramids it <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> all-seeing Eye of Providence.|$|E
25|$|On the Spring and Autumn equinoxes, in {{the late}} afternoon, the {{northwest}} corner of the pyramid casts a series of triangular shadows against the western balustrade on the north side that <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> appearance of a serpent wriggling down the staircase, which some scholars have suggested is a representation of the feathered-serpent god Kukulkan.|$|E

25|$|Many drum dances are {{competitive}} in nature, featuring two song cousins who humorously sing and dance, while {{pointing out the}} flaws in the other. This is generally a light-hearted, convivial event, but is also sometimes used to settle serious duels between warring families or individuals; the jokes are prepared {{ahead of time and}} the person who <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> most laughter from the audience is considered the victor.|$|E
25|$|This {{result in}} turn is proved by {{considering}} a dual diagram for D. There one defines a combinatorial notion of curvature (which, by the small cancellation assumptions, is negative at every interior vertex), and one then obtains a combinatorial version of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. Greendlinger's lemma is proved {{as a consequence of}} this analysis and in this way the proof <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> ideas of the original proof of Dehn for the case of surface groups.|$|E
25|$|So-called Deconstructivist {{architecture}} {{was developed}} by architects Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and others during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Zaha Hadid by her sketches and drawings of abstract triangles and rectangles <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> aesthetic of constructivism. Though similar formally, the socialist political connotations of Russian constructivism are deemphasized by Hadid's deconstructivism. Rem Koolhaas' projects revive another aspect of constructivism. The scaffold and crane-like structures represented by many constructivist architects are used for the finished forms of his designs and buildings.|$|E

25|$|The 2014 poetry book 'Spark In The Dark' is prefaced by Blake's epigram: “Without Contraries is no progression” - {{and this}} idea is {{implicit}} {{in many of the}} poems. The last part of the book, Spirit Songs, draws freely on British traditions like the Queen of the May at Beltane. By contrast, the final poem Queen of the Moon ('Queen of the vision revealed in the vine / And the leaves of the Shining Tree...') <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian Santo Daime tradition.|$|E
25|$|Upon defeat, the Gajapati King Purushottam Deva {{returned}} and prayed to Jagannath, the God of land of Kalinga before planning a second campaign to Kanchi. Moved by his prayers, Jagannath and Balabhadra, left their temple in Puri and started {{an expedition to}} Kanchi on horseback. It is said that Jagannath rode on a white horse and Balabhadra on a black horse. The legend has such a powerful impact on the Oriya culture that the simple mention of white horse-black horse <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> imagery of Kanchi conquest of the God in devotees minds.|$|E
25|$|Depictions {{of world}} trees, {{both in their}} {{directional}} and central aspects, {{are found in the}} art and mythological traditions of cultures such as the Maya, Aztec, Izapan, Mixtec, Olmec, and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of Mesoamerican chronology. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a ceiba tree, and is known variously as a wacah chan or yax imix che, depending on the Mayan language. The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright caiman, whose skin <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> tree's spiny trunk.|$|E
