25|$|Upon {{his return}} to ANZ in 1958, Vette served as first officer on a Douglas DC-6, {{simultaneously}} working towards his <b>Flight</b> <b>Navigator</b> Licence and Airline Transport Pilot Licence. By 1960, he was in command of his first aircraft.

25|$|Expert {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} the <b>flight</b> <b>navigator,</b> who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, {{was referring to the}} radar altimeter (which gives height above ground) rather than the pressure altimeter (which would provide the height relative {{to the level of the}} runway). Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this is exactly what happened.|$|E

25|$|Following his {{discharge}} from the military, Macpherson returned to Oregon where his father, Hector Macpherson, Sr., operated a dairy farm in rural Linn County, Oregon. The idea of farming held {{an appeal to the}} returning <b>flight</b> <b>navigator</b> and father and son entered into a business partnership in the fall of 1945. Funds accumulated during the war years were plowed into the business. At the end of a pre-arranged one-year partnership, his father sold son Huck the 180-acre homestead for a modest sum. A growing family and farm consumed the next quarter century, with the farm expanded and modernized {{during the second half of}} the 1950s.|$|E

This aircraft had been heavily modified {{compared to the}} initial prototype, now featuring engine nacelles split {{on either side of}} the fuselage, landing gear that retracted into the nacelles, and retractable canards. The pilot was Mikhail Kozlov, and the co-pilot was Valery M. Molchanov. Also on board were G. N. Bazhenov, the <b>flight</b> <b>navigator,</b> V. N. Benderov, deputy chief designer and engineer major-general, B. A. Pervukhin, senior engineer, and A. I. Dralin, flight engineer.

5000|$|Donald Bennett {{was born}} the {{youngest}} son of a grazier in Toowoomba, Queensland. He attended Brisbane Grammar School and later joined the Royal Australian Air Force in 1930 [...] and transferred to the Royal Air Force a year later, starting with the flying boats of 20 Squadron.
