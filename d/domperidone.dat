25|$|Vomiting {{is due to}} gastric stasis (large volume vomiting, brief nausea {{relieved}} by vomiting, oesophageal reflux, epigastric fullness, early satiation), besides direct action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (e.g. <b>domperidone</b> or metoclopramide). If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (e.g. subcutaneous for metoclopramide, rectally for <b>domperidone).</b>|$|E
25|$|Prolactin is {{available}} commercially {{for use in}} animals, but not in humans. It is used to stimulate lactation in animals. The biological half-life of prolactin in humans is around 15–20 minutes. The D2 receptor {{is involved in the}} regulation of prolactin secretion, and agonists of the receptor such as bromocriptine and cabergoline decrease prolactin levels while antagonists of the receptor such as <b>domperidone,</b> metoclopramide, haloperidol, risperidone, and sulpiride increase prolactin levels. D2 receptor antagonists like <b>domperidone,</b> metoclopramide, and sulpiride are used as galactogogues to increase prolatin secretion and induce lactation in humans.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, {{during which}} antiemetics (e.g. low dose {{haloperidol}} once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine {{is more often}} used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as <b>domperidone</b> and metoclopramide. <b>Domperidone</b> does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine or diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|First {{used as a}} {{treatment}} for Parkinson's disease as early as 1951, its clinical use was first reported in 1970 by Cotzias et al., although its emetic properties and short half-life made oral use impractical. A later study found that combining the drug with the antiemetic <b>domperidone</b> improved results significantly. The commercialization of apomorphine for Parkinson's disease followed its successful use in patients with refractory motor fluctuations using intermittent rescue injections and continuous infusions.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{apomorphine}} {{has been}} tried {{for a variety of}} uses including psychiatric treatment of homosexuality in the early 20th century, and more recently in treating erectile dysfunction. Currently, apomorphine is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a potent emetic (i.e., it induces vomiting) and should not be administered without an antiemetic such as <b>domperidone.</b> [...] The emetic properties of apomorphine are exploited in veterinary medicine to induce therapeutic emesis in canines that have recently ingested toxic or foreign substances.|$|E
2500|$|However, milk {{production}} can be [...] "artificially" [...] and intentionally induced {{in the absence}} of any pregnancy in the woman. This is called induced lactation, while a woman who has lactated before and restarts is said to relactate. This can be done by regularly sucking on the nipples (several times a day), massaging and squeezing the female breasts, or with additional help from temporary use of milk-inducing drugs, such as the dopamine antagonist <b>Domperidone.</b> In principle—with considerable patience and perseverance—it is possible to induce lactation by sucking on the nipples alone.|$|E
2500|$|Apomorphine, {{which is}} a {{dopamine}} agonist not orally administered, {{may be used to}} reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are not rare, patients under apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Apomorphine can be administered by subcutaneous injection using a small pump which is carried by the patient. A low dose is automatically administered throughout the day, reducing the fluctuations of motor symptoms by providing a steady dose of dopaminergic stimulation. After an initial [...] "apomorphine challenge" [...] in hospital to test its effectiveness and brief patient and primary caregiver (often a spouse or partner), the latter of whom takes over maintenance of the pump. The injection site must be changed daily and rotated around the body to avoid the formation of nodules. Apomorphine is also available in a more acute dose as an autoinjector pen for emergency doses such as after a fall or first thing in the morning. Nausea and vomiting are common, and may require <b>domperidone</b> (an antiemetic).|$|E
50|$|Itraconazole and ketoconazole, both used {{to treat}} fungal infections, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and {{increase}} the plasma concentration of <b>domperidone.</b> In healthy volunteers, ketoconazole increased the Cmax and AUC concentrations of <b>domperidone</b> by 3- to 10-fold. This {{was accompanied by a}} QT interval prolongation of about 10-20 milliseconds when <b>domperidone</b> 10 mg four times daily and ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily were administered, whereas <b>domperidone</b> by itself at the dosage assessed produced no such effect. As such, <b>domperidone</b> with ketoconazole or other CYP3A4 inhibitors is a potentially dangerous combination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Domperidone</b> (like metoclopramide, a D2 {{receptor}} antagonist) is {{not approved}} for enhanced lactation in the USA. By contrast, Australian guidelines consider <b>domperidone</b> {{to be the}} preferred galactagogue when non-pharmacological approaches have proved insufficient. Unlike metoclopramide, <b>domperidone</b> does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not tend to have adverse effects such as drowsiness or depression.|$|E
50|$|With oral administration, <b>domperidone</b> is {{extensively}} metabolized in {{the liver}} (almost exclusively by CYP3A4/5, though minor contributions by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 have also been reported) and in the intestines. Due to the marked first-pass effect via this route, the oral bioavailability of <b>domperidone</b> is low (13-17%); conversely, its bioavailability is high via intramuscular injection (90%). The terminal half-life of <b>domperidone</b> is 7.5 hours in healthy individuals, but can be prolonged to 20 hours in people with severe renal dysfunction. All of the metabolites of <b>domperidone</b> are inactive as D2 receptor ligands. The drug is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) transporter, and animal studies suggest {{that this is the}} reason for the low central nervous system penetration of <b>domperidone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Domperidone</b> {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} metabolized by CYP3A4, {{and for this}} reason, inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme may alter the metabolism and concentrations of <b>domperidone.</b> Moreover, <b>domperidone</b> {{has been identified as}} a modest mechanism-based (irreversible) inhibitor of CYP3A4 (Ki = 12 μM), and {{it has been estimated that}} it may increase the serum concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates by approximately 50%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Domperidone</b> is {{available}} over-the-counter to treat gastroesophageal reflux and functional dyspepsia in many countries, such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, South Africa, Mexico, Chile, and China. <b>Domperidone</b> is not approved {{for use in}} the United States, but is prescribable and limitedly available in this country for use in people with treatment-refractory gastrointestinal symptoms under an FDA Investigational New Drug application. In 2007, it was reported that <b>domperidone</b> was available in 58 countries.|$|E
50|$|The hormone {{prolactin}} stimulates lactation (production {{of breast}} milk). Dopamine, {{released by the}} hypothalamus stops the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. <b>Domperidone,</b> by acting as an anti-dopaminergic agent, results in increased prolactin secretion, and thus promotes lactation (that is, it is a galactogogue). In some nations, including Australia, <b>domperidone</b> is used off-label, based on uncertain and anecdotal evidence of its usefulness, as a therapy for mothers who are having difficulty breastfeeding. In the United States, <b>domperidone</b> is not approved for {{this or any other}} use. A study called the EMPOWER trial has been designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of <b>domperidone</b> in assisting mothers of preterm babies to supply breast milk for their infants.|$|E
50|$|Erythromycin {{and certain}} other {{macrolide}} antibiotics are CYP3A4 inhibitors and inhibit the metabolism of <b>domperidone</b> (in vitro), thus increasing {{the concentration of}} <b>domperidone</b> and potential side effects of the drug. This is of concern as both drugs {{may be used to}} treat gastroparesis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Domperidone</b> (Motilium) is {{associated}} with a small increased risk of serious cardiac side effects. Its use is now restricted to the relief of nausea and vomiting and the dosage and duration of use have been reduced. It should no longer be used for the treatment of bloating and heartburn. <b>Domperidone</b> is now contraindicated in those with underlying cardiac conditions and other risk factors. Patients with these conditions and patients receiving long-term treatment with <b>domperidone</b> should be reassessed at a routine appointment, in light of the new advice.|$|E

50|$|Due to D2 {{receptor}} blockade, <b>domperidone</b> causes hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia can {{suppress the}} secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, in turn suppressing the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and resulting in hypogonadism (low sex hormone (e.g., testosterone, estradiol) levels). As such, male patients may experience low libido, erectile dysfunction, and impaired spermatogenesis. Also {{in accordance with}} hyperprolactinemia, 10-15% of female patients {{have been reported to}} experience mammoplasia (breast enlargement), mastodynia (breast pain/tenderness), galactorrhea (inappropriate or excessive milk production/secretion), and amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles) with <b>domperidone</b> treatment. Gynecomastia has been reported in males treated with <b>domperidone,</b> and galactorrhea could occur in males as well.|$|E

50|$|Although these {{features}} make <b>domperidone</b> a useful drug in Parkinson's disease, caution is needed {{due to the}} cardiotoxic side effects of <b>domperidone</b> especially when given intravenously, in elderly people and in high doses (> 30 mg per day). A clinical sign of domperidone's potential toxicity to the heart is the prolongation (lengthening) of the QT interval (a segment of the heart's electrical pattern).|$|E

50|$|The uses or {{indications}} of <b>domperidone</b> vary between nations. For instance, in Italy {{it is used}} in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and in Canada, the drug is indicated in upper gastrointestinal motility disorders and to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms {{associated with the use of}} dopamine agonist antiparkinsonian agents. In the United States, <b>domperidone</b> is not currently a legally marketed human drug and it is not approved for sale in the U.S. On 7 June 2004, FDA issued a public warning that distributing any domperidone-containing products is illegal. In the United Kingdom, <b>domperidone</b> is only indicated for the treatment of nausea and vomiting and the treatment duration is usually limited to 1 week.|$|E

50|$|<b>Domperidone</b> {{can be used}} {{to relieve}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms in Parkinson's disease; it blocks peripheral D2 receptors but does not cross the blood-brain barrier in normal doses (the barrier between the blood circulation of the brain {{and the rest of the}} body) so has no effect on the extrapyramidal symptoms of the disease. In addition to this, <b>domperidone</b> may enhance the bioavailability (effect) of levodopa (one of the main treatments in Parkinson's disease).|$|E
50|$|Along with prolactin, <b>domperidone</b> has, to {{a lesser}} extent, been found to {{increase}} the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), even in patients with hypothyroidism. A single 4 mg intravenous dose of <b>domperidone</b> produced peak TSH levels of 1.9-fold above baseline and peak prolactin levels of 23-fold above baseline (which occurred at 30 minutes post-administration) in women with hypothyroidism. Levels of TSH and prolactin decreased to 1.6-fold and 17-fold above baseline, respectively, at 120 minutes post-administration.|$|E
