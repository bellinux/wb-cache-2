5|$|The Indian Act, various {{treaties}} and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and native peoples. Most notably, {{a series of}} eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between the indigenous and the reigning Monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921. These treaties are agreements with the Canadian Crown-in-Council, administered by Canadian Aboriginal law, and overseen by the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Development. The role of the {{treaties and}} the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982. These rights may include provision of services, such as health care, and <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation.</b> The legal and policy framework within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{organized}} the country under a centralized administration and in 1715 established a standing army under his command, which was entirely funded and manned by the non-noble population. This policy reduced the nobles' military obligation without abrogating their <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation.</b> Charles also banned conversion to Protestantism, required civil servants to profess Catholicism, and forbade Protestant students to study abroad.|$|E
25|$|The Knights Templar {{had owned}} {{considerable}} lands and {{properties in the}} bailiary of Cunninghame, regality of Kilwinning {{and in the early}} 17th century, Robert Montgomerie acquired the rights to these Templelands from the Sandilands family of Calder, the Lords Torphichen and thus became the feudal superior. He also had the lands of the bailiary of Kyle Stewart. The value of these lands largely lay in their near <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation.</b> In about 1720 the lands passed to the Wallaces of Carnell, at Fiveways near Kilmarnock. Later Dr. Robert Patrick of Trearne & Hessilhead purchased the superiority, although this was of little real value after the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in 1747.|$|E

25|$|The Church also {{emerged in}} the {{political}} arena as an independent force. For instance, an article of the Golden Bull of 1222 prohibited Jews and Muslims from holding public offices; this was likely at the prelates' initiative. The Church even forced Andrew II (12051235) to issue another decree in 1231 that authorized the archbishop of Esztergom to enforce the monarch's observance of the charter by means of excommunication. Subsequently, as the Golden Bull's provisions concerning non-Christians were ignored, Archbishop Róbert of Esztergom placed the kingdom under interdict in 1232. The next year the papal legate forced Andrew II to accept a treaty that established the fundamental privileges of the Church, including the clergy's <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> and the ecclesiastical courts' exclusive jurisdiction over clerics and in marriage cases.|$|E
25|$|With {{the start}} of the 22nd Legislature in January 1903, Brodie {{requested}} several changes to the territorial tax code. The first change he asked for was increasing the tax rates for mining operations which the Governor felt were not paying a fair share in comparison {{to other parts of the}} territorial economy. He also proposed an <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> of 10 years for new railroads and 9 years for hydroelectric dams to encourage additional transportation and electrical generation capabilities within the territory. Other changes to mining operations were the establishment of an eight-hour day for mine workers, with railroad workers receiving a limit of 16 consecutive hours of work, and outlawing the practice of paying miners in company scrip redeemable only at the company store. Brodie also requested the pay for the governor's secretary be increased from US$125 to US$150/year.|$|E
25|$|Innis {{writes that}} Islam which he {{sometimes}} {{refers to as}} Mohammedanism gathered strength by emphasizing the sacredness of the written word. He notes that the Caliph Iezid II ordered the destruction of pictures in Christian churches within the Umayyad empire. The banning of icons within churches was also sanctioned by Byzantine Emperor Leo III in 730 while Emperor Constantine V issued a decree in 753-54 condemning image worship Innis writes that this proscription of images was designed to strengthen the empire partly by curbing the power of monks who relied on images to sanction their authority. Monasteries, he notes, had amassed large properties through their <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> and competed with the state for labour. Byzantine emperors reacted by secularizing large monastic properties, restricting the number of monks and through persecution driving large numbers of them to Italy.|$|E
50|$|Most {{treaties}} eliminate <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> {{income of}} certain diplomatic personnel. Most tax treaties also provide that certain entities {{exempt from tax}} in one country are also exempt from tax in the other. Entities typically exempt include charities, pension trusts, and government owned entities. Many treaties provide for other <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> that one or both countries as considered relevant under their governmental or economic system.|$|R
50|$|Under this provision, <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> may {{be granted}} only by general laws.

50|$|The {{opening of}} the Suez Canal in 1869 gave a new {{strategic}} importance to this region, stoking Ottoman interests in establishing effective control {{as a result of}} the revival of trade. In 1871, Midhat Pasha invaded al-Ahsa and restored Ottoman control. When he incorporated this desert region into the Ottoman realm, Midhat Pasha had granted the local notables complete <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation,</b> except for the zakat.|$|R
25|$|In September 1917, Patel {{had given}} a speech in Borsad, {{encouraging}} Indians nationwide to sign Gandhi's petition demanding Swarajself-rulefrom Britain. A month later, he met Gandhi {{for the first time}} at the Gujarat Political Conference in Godhra. On Gandhi's encouragement, Patel became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, a public body that would become the Gujarati arm of the Indian National Congress. Patel now energetically fought against veththe forced servitude of Indians to Europeansand organised relief efforts in the wake of plague and famine in Kheda. The Kheda peasants' plea for <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> had been turned down by British authorities. Gandhi endorsed waging a struggle there, but could not lead it himself due to his activities in Champaran. When Gandhi asked for a Gujarati activist to devote himself completely to the assignment, Patel volunteered, much to Gandhi's delight. Though his decision was made on the spot, Patel later said that his desire and commitment came after intense personal contemplation, as he realised he would have to abandon his career and material ambitions.|$|E

500|$|Chen first petitioned {{authorities}} in 1996, when {{he traveled to}} Beijing to complain about taxes that were incorrectly being levied on his family (people with disabilities, such as Chen, {{are supposed to be}} exempt from taxation and fees). The complaint was successful, and Chen began petitioning for other individuals with disabilities. With funding from a British foundation, Chen became an outspoken activist for disability rights within the China Law Society. His reputation as a disability rights advocate was solidified when agreed to advocate for an elderly blind couple whose grandchildren suffered from paralysis. [...] The family had been paying all of the regular taxes and fees, but Chen believed that, under the law, the family should have received government assistance and <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation.</b> When the case went to court, blind citizens from surrounding counties were in attendance as a show of solidarity. [...] The case was successful, and the outcome became well-known.|$|E
50|$|The Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies, {{also called}} the Scottish Darien Company, was an {{overseas}} trading company created {{by an act of}} the Parliament of Scotland in 1695.

50|$|Charitable organisations, {{including}} charitable trusts, {{are eligible}} for {{a complex set of}} reliefs and <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> in the UK.

These tax exemptions have led to criticisms that private schools are able to use charitable status as a tax avoidance technique rather than because they offer a genuine charitable good.|$|R

Section IV's role regarding state debt is spelled out in eleven different paragraphs.|$|R
2500|$|A second attempt, in 1826, {{sanctioned by}} the British [...] (but delayed until winter by a Brazilian blockade), also failed after arrival in the islands. In 1828, the Buenos Aires {{government}} granted Vernet all of East Falkland, including all its resources, with <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> for 20 years, if a colony could be established within three years. He took settlers, including British Captain Matthew Brisbane, and before leaving once again sought permission from the British Consulate in Buenos Aires. The British asked for {{a report on the}} islands for the British government, and Vernet asked for British protection should they return.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph II (1780–90), {{a dynamic}} leader {{strongly}} influenced by the Enlightenment, shook Hungary from its malaise when he inherited the throne from his mother, Maria Theresa. In the framework of Josephinism, Joseph sought to centralize control of the empire and to rule it by decree as an enlightened despot. He refused to take the Hungarian coronation oath to avoid being constrained by Hungary's constitution. In 1781–82 Joseph issued a Patent of Toleration, followed by an Edict of Tolerance which granted Protestants and Orthodox Christians full civil rights and Jews freedom of worship. He decreed that German replace Latin as the empire's official language and granted the peasants the freedom to leave their holdings, to marry, and to place their children in trades. Hungary, Slavonia, Croatia, the Military Frontier and Transylvania became a single imperial territory under one administration, called the Kingdom of Hungary or [...] "Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen". When the Hungarian nobles again refused to waive their <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation,</b> Joseph banned imports of Hungarian manufactured goods into Austria and began a survey to prepare for imposition of a general land tax.|$|E
2500|$|Charitable trusts are {{a general}} {{exception}} to the rule in English law that trusts cannot be created for an abstract purpose. The meaning of a charity has been set in statute since the Elizabethan Charitable Uses Act 1601, but the principles are now codified by the Charities Act 2011. Apart from being capable of not having any clear beneficiaries, charitable trusts usually enjoy <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> on its own capital or income, and people making gifts can deduct the gift from their taxes. Classically, a trust would be charitable if its purpose was promoting reduction of poverty, advancement of education, advancement or religion, or other purposes for the public benefit. The criterion of [...] "public benefit" [...] was the key to being a charity. Courts gradually added specific examples, today codified in the CA 2011 section 3, section 4 emphasises that all purposes must be for the [...] "public benefit". The meaning remains with the courts. In Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust the House of Lords held that an employer's trust for his employees and children was not for the public benefit because of the personal relationship between them. Generally, the trust must be for a [...] "sufficient section of the public" [...] and cannot exclude the poor. However it often unclear how these principles are applicable in practice.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{such as the}} Canadian Taxpayers Federation are {{concerned}} that such reserves are entitled to <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> that other businesses in a community do not enjoy. Furthermore, there are complications in disposing of urban reserve lands which require approval of the operating First Nation, and that reserve lands would revert to federal government control. Other critics such as the Frontier Centre for Public Policy concede that urban reserves have benefits, but wish the abolishment of the reserve system and other racially based policies as a whole.|$|R

6000|$|The {{kings and}} princes disliked this {{alienation}} of property very greatly. In the place of feudal lords capable of military support, they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns. And these lands were really under foreign dominion. Even before the time of Pope Gregory VII {{there had been a}} struggle between the princes and the papacy over the question of [...] "investitures," [...] the question that is of who should appoint the bishops. If that power rested with the Pope and not the King, then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions. For also the clergy claimed <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation.</b> They paid their taxes to Rome. And not only that, but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax of one-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes he paid his prince.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his many}} successes, {{during the last}} twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity. This was largely due to the harsh {{measures}} he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire. Conscription was introduced, causing resentment among the peasantry, despite the pressing need for new recruits to the imperial army. In order to restore the imperial treasury, Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily; he also cancelled many of the <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> that the church had previously enjoyed. In order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation, he completely reformed the coinage, issuing a new gold hyperpyron (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years.|$|R
