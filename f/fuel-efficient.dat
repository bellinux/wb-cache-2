5|$|The two battleships of the Nevada-class were {{virtually}} identical except in their propulsion. Nevada {{and her sister}} were fitted with different engines to compare the two, putting them 'head-to-head': Oklahoma received older vertical triple expansion engines, which had proven more <b>fuel-efficient</b> and reliable than the direct drive turbines of some earlier battleships, while Nevada received geared Curtis steam turbines.|$|E
5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At {{cruising}} speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less <b>fuel-efficient</b> than reciprocating engines. This was {{particularly important for}} navies which required a long range at cruising speeds—and hence for the US Navy, which was planning {{in the event of}} war to cruise across the Pacific and engage the Japanese in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|The Yermolayev Yer-2 was a {{long-range}} Soviet medium bomber used during World War II. It was {{developed from the}} Bartini Stal-7 prototype airliner before the war. It was used to bomb Berlin from airbases in Estonia after Operation Barbarossa in 1941. Production was terminated in August 1941 to allow the factory to concentrate on building higher-priority Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack aircraft, but was restarted {{at the end of}} 1943 with new, <b>fuel-efficient,</b> Charomskiy ACh-30B aircraft Diesel engines.|$|E
5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and remote control features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to loiter at slow <b>fuel-efficient</b> speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{initial safety}} concerns, DC-10 {{aircraft}} continued {{to serve with}} passenger airlines for over 30 years after the crash of Flight 191. In the end, it was newer, more <b>fuel-efficient</b> twin-engined airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and not safety concerns that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the glass cockpit from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years of service. In February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights. DC-10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations, and military variants also remain in service.|$|E
5|$|The 777 {{ranks as}} one of Boeing's best-selling models. Airlines have {{acquired}} the type as a comparatively <b>fuel-efficient</b> alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, the Airbus A350 XWB, and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The 787 Dreamliner, which entered service in 2011, shares design features and a common type rating for pilots with the 777. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8 and 777-9 variants, collectively named 777X, featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787. The new 777X series is planned to enter service by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more <b>fuel-efficient,</b> higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E
5|$|The VB series {{retained}} 96percent of {{the preceding}} HZ Kingswood's interior space, despite being 14percent smaller in overall dimensions, although fivepercent larger than the Torana. With the Commodore dropping a full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor, the smaller Commodore was predictably more <b>fuel-efficient.</b> This downsizing was first seen as a major disadvantage for Holden, as they had effectively relinquished the potential of selling Commodores to the fleet and taxi industries. These sales losses {{were thought to be}} unrecoverable; however, the 1979 energy crisis saw Australian oil prices rise by 140percent, putting substantial strain on the automotive industry to collectively downsize, a change that Holden had already done.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{flexibility}} of the new broilers, the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational costs. A more efficient design of the burners in the Nieco units produces a 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. The Duke units produce a $4,000 -$5,000 annual savings on energy compared to the original units, which ran approximately at full capacity all day. The units are so <b>fuel-efficient</b> that in many US states, the company and its franchises qualify for energy-efficiency rebates. However, and issue arose in September 2011 when the state of Washington department of health warned Burger King of issues with the Duke units. In multiple incidents in seven counties throughout the state, the Duke units were found to have cracked heat spreaders which resulted in under cooked products. Additionally, there was foreign material contamination caused by loose insulation resulting from the cracks as well as other issues. Upon notification, Burger King released a statement that the company has notified franchisees and corporate-owned stores operating the Duke units with orders to repair the problem immediately. Additional training for operators was also ordered.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the VH series, Commodore sales were {{beginning}} to decline. Holden's six-cylinder engine, which was carried over from the Kingswood, could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive. Continual improvements made to Commodore's Ford Falcon rival meant the VH was not significantly more <b>fuel-efficient</b> or better performing despite the smaller size. This was curtailed by the absence of any major powertrain revisions by {{the time of}} the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB. Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid-size Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the Commodore pricing point. Camira sales were strong initially, but as fuel prices had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the Commodore as Australia's bestselling car for the first time in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In May 1948, AMC asked Boeing to {{incorporate}} the previously discarded, but now more <b>fuel-efficient,</b> jet engine into the design. That resulted {{in the development of}} yet another revision—in July 1948, Model 464-40 substituted Westinghouse J40 turbojets for the turboprops. The Air Force project officer who reviewed the Model 464-40 was favorably impressed, especially since he had already been thinking along similar lines. Nevertheless, the government was concerned about the high fuel consumption rate of the jet engines of the day, and directed that Boeing still use the turboprop-powered Model 464-35 {{as the basis for the}} XB-52. Although he agreed that turbojet propulsion was the future, General Howard A. Craig, Deputy Chief of Staff for Material, was not very keen on a jet-powered B-52, since he felt that the jet engine had not yet progressed sufficiently to permit skipping an intermediate turboprop stage. However, Boeing was encouraged to continue turbojet studies even without any expected commitment to jet propulsion.|$|E
25|$|He pursued {{policies}} to make {{greater use of}} carpooling and public transit, and sought tax credits to stimulate purchases of hybrid and other more <b>fuel-efficient</b> vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{sales in}} the U.S. is below expectation, mainly due to the {{economic}} recession in 2008–09, stiff competition and a drop in gasoline prices of over one-third over the past year, eroded demand for <b>fuel-efficient</b> cars.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s {{brought a}} {{worldwide}} energy crisis with high gasoline prices. For the first time, the American industry faced serious competition from imported automobiles, which were {{smaller and more}} <b>fuel-efficient.</b> German Volkswagens and Japanese Toyotas posed a growing threat.|$|E
25|$|At the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda {{introduced}} the concept car Honda IMAS, an extremely <b>fuel-efficient</b> and lightweight hybrid car made of aluminum and carbon fiber, which was perceived by most observers {{to be the}} future direction where the Insight was heading.|$|E
25|$|Holden gambled {{that the}} {{predicted}} increase of oil prices during this era would drive consumers to choose smaller, more <b>fuel-efficient</b> cars, but {{the oil price}} rise never materialised, whilst Ford dealers aggressively pitched the Cortina 6 against the Commodore alternative until the XD Falcon arrived in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Chinese battery {{manufacturer}} and automaker BYD Auto released the F3DM PHEV-62 (PHEV-100km) hatchback to the Chinese fleet market on December 15, 2008, for 149,800 yuan (US $22,000). General Motors launched the 2011 Chevrolet Volt series plug-in in December 2010. At the time, the Volt displaced the Toyota Prius {{as the most}} <b>fuel-efficient</b> car sold in the United States.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2008 {{budget on}} February 26, 2008, $500 million was {{announced}} for public transit, $250 million for research in developing more <b>fuel-efficient</b> vehicles and $300 million for the development a more advanced nuclear reactor and to improve safety at the Chalk River, Ontario Nuclear facility which shut down during the fall of 2007 after there were safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|The McDonnell Douglas MD-90 is a twin-engine, short- to medium-range, single-aisle {{commercial}} jet airliner. The MD-90 {{was developed}} from the MD-80 series. Differences from the MD-80 include more <b>fuel-efficient</b> International Aero Engines V2500 engines and a longer fuselage. The MD-90 has a seating capacity of up to 172 passengers and was introduced into service with Delta Air Lines in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{received}} {{the award for}} its innovative construction and sustainable design. Notable achievements during the stadium's construction process included diverting 86.85% of on-site generated construction waste to landfills, reducing water use by 41% from the installation of high-energy toilets, reducing energy use by 20.41%, using 98.42% of the wood-based building materials from certified forests and providing preferred parking spaces for <b>fuel-efficient</b> low-emissions vehicles.|$|E
25|$|SUV sales {{peaked in}} 1999 {{but have not}} {{returned}} to that level ever since, due to high gas prices. The Big Three have suffered from perceived inferior initial quality and reliability compared to their Japanese counterparts, which {{has been difficult to}} overcome. They have also been slow to bring new vehicles to the market, while the Japanese are also considered the leader at producing smaller, <b>fuel-efficient</b> cars.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, Progressive {{announced}} its title {{sponsorship of the}} Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE is an international competition designed to inspire {{a new generation of}} viable, super <b>fuel-efficient</b> vehicles. The competition is open to teams from around the world that can design, build and bring to market 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent) vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Obama also {{planned to}} push for a program to spend $150 billion over 10 years to develop new {{renewable}} energy sources. This money would also be used to encourage energy conservation and help the auto industry develop <b>fuel-efficient</b> vehicles. However, Mother Jones reported that the Windfall Profits Tax on oil companies, which he frequently cited during the campaign, had been dropped from the agenda early in the transition.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} in 1976, Micuta continued his activities {{on behalf of}} developing countries. He was also a pioneer in, and tireless promoter of, renewable energy {{and founder of the}} Renewable Energies Development Institute in Geneva. While working for the institute, he developed a low-cost <b>fuel-efficient</b> stove which could be easily constructed and used in poor countries. This stove design was published by the HEDON Household Energy Network in their journal, Boiling Point.|$|E
25|$|Honda first {{introduced}} passenger cars to the North American market in 1970 {{with sales of}} the Honda N600 sedan through 32 dealers in the Western U.S.; however, sales of the vehicle and subsequent model, the Z600 coupe, only reached 20,000 units in 1972. During the 1970s energy crisis, however, lightweight, <b>fuel-efficient</b> cars experienced a surge in demand. The Honda Civic, introduced in 1973, became popular in the U.S., leading a significant expansion of Honda into the U.S. market.|$|E
25|$|English {{inventor}} Thomas Parker, who {{was responsible}} for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries. Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more <b>fuel-efficient</b> vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.|$|E
25|$|In early 2014, the {{director}} general of the International Air Transport Association noted that slower economic growth, following the Great Recession, had led to lower demand for air freighters. The world's air cargo fleet in 2012 was smaller than it was in 2003. However, the proportion of very large freighters in that fleet has increased, and Boeing's dominant position in large, <b>fuel-efficient</b> freighters has offered the company an opportunity to protect its market share and its product line despite the market weakness.|$|E
25|$|In the end, most {{airlines}} favored lower {{operating costs}} over a marginal increase in speed, {{and the project}} did not attract the interest for which Boeing had been hoping. The Sonic Cruiser project was finally abandoned by December 2002 {{in favor of the}} slower but more <b>fuel-efficient</b> 7E7 (later renamed Boeing 787 Dreamliner). Much of the research from the Sonic Cruiser was applied to the 787, including carbon fiber reinforced plastic for the fuselage and wings, bleedless engines, cockpit and avionics design.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} Diamond-Star Motors {{can be traced}} back to 1970 when Chrysler Corporation took a 15 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors, as part of MMC's {{strategy}} of expansion through alliances with foreign partners. The U.S. company began distributing Mitsubishis as Chrysler-, Dodge- and Plymouth-branded captive imports (e.g. Dodge Colt), a successful venture as the compact cars met consumer demand for smaller and more <b>fuel-efficient</b> vehicles in the 1970s, filling a gap at the bottom of the Chrysler group's range.|$|E
25|$|The Routemaster was {{developed}} between 1947 and 1956 {{by a team}} directed by AAM Durrant and Colin Curtis, with vehicle styling by Douglas Scott. The design brief was to produce a vehicle that was lighter (hence more <b>fuel-efficient),</b> easier to operate {{and that could be}} maintained by the existing maintenance practices at the recently opened Aldenham Works, but with easier and lower-cost servicing procedures. The resulting vehicle seated 64 passengers, despite being three-quarters of a ton lighter than buses in the RT family, which seated 56.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{proposed}} agreement would entitle Fiat {{to receive a}} further 15% (without cash consideration) through the achievement of specific product and commercial objectives. No cash or financial support was required from Fiat under the agreement. Instead it would obtain its stake mainly in exchange for covering the cost of retooling a Chrysler plant to produce one or more Fiat models for in the US. Fiat would also provide engine and transmission technology to enable Chrysler to introduce smaller, <b>fuel-efficient</b> models in the NAFTA market.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2007 {{budget on}} March 19, 2007, Flaherty {{announced}} a rebate of up to $2,000 for people who purchase <b>fuel-efficient</b> vehicles. He also announced a new levy to penalize consumers who purchase vehicles with a high-fuel consumption rate: $1,000 for every litre consumed per 100 kilometres would be imposed (up {{to a total of}} $4,000) if the vehicle consumes over 13 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres in the city. However, in the 2008 budget, the clean-car rebate will be scrapped in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Sales {{slowed to}} a trickle {{in the wake of}} the {{introduction}} of the Renault Alliance. These were more modern, space-efficient, <b>fuel-efficient</b> 4-cylinder, front-wheel-drive cars compared to the rear-drive Concord with its aging platform. The imported Renault 18-based 18i sedan Sportwagon sold by AMC/Jeep/Renault dealers were also more efficient replacements. All Concord and Spirit models were quietly dropped by the end of the 1983 model year. The future for AMC's Concord and Spirit series was sealed for the 1980s as rear-drive cars were replaced by front-drive models.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2006, the Mayor of London {{proposed}} {{the introduction of a}} variable congestion charge. Similarly to vehicle excise duty (VED), it would be based on emissions of carbon dioxide in grams/km. This would reduce or eliminate the charge for small and <b>fuel-efficient</b> vehicles, and increase it to up to £25 a day for large, inefficient vehicles such as SUVs, large saloons and compact MPVs with a Band G VED rating, that is, emissions of > 225 g/km of CO2. Electric zero-emissions vehicles are already exempt from the charge.|$|E
25|$|The {{gasoline}} {{crises of}} 1973 and 1979 also affected Detroit and the U.S. auto industry. Buyers chose smaller, more <b>fuel-efficient</b> cars made by foreign makers {{as the price}} of gas rose. Efforts to revive the city were stymied by the struggles of the auto industry, as their sales and market share declined. Automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants in the city, further eroding the tax base. To counteract this, the city used eminent domain to build two large new auto assembly plants in the city.|$|E
25|$|In addition, objects {{travelling}} upwards (i.e., out) or downwards (i.e., in) are deflected to {{the west}} or east respectively. This effect is also the greatest near the equator. Since vertical movement is usually of limited extent and duration, {{the size of the}} effect is smaller and requires precise instruments to detect. However, in the case of large changes of momentum, such as a spacecraft being launched into orbit, the effect becomes significant. The fastest and most <b>fuel-efficient</b> path to orbit is a launch from the equator that curves to a directly eastward heading.|$|E
