40|$|This master thesis {{researches}} {{the necessity}} and possibilities of new/innovative lock gate technologies for future large & high <b>head</b> <b>locks,</b> like the Panama Canal Expansion Project. A historical data analysis has been performed, contemplates over 220 {{of the worlds}} largest locks throughout time, analyzing the development and application of conventional lock gate technologies. From this, the conclusions have been drawn that the required lock gate dimensions {{of a number of}} future projects, fall far outside the application area of current technologies, and that it may not be assumed that conventional technologies will lead to optimal solutions at this scale. In addition, a number of aspects will be highlighted for future large & high <b>head</b> <b>lock</b> gate design, especially reliability, water consumption and its effects on the locks accessibility. A new lock gate technology has been developed specifically attuned to the future dimensions and highlighted requirements resulting into the design of: ‘The Sliding Arch Gate’, an extremely slender gate design, using (tension) arch action to transfer loads to the <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> structure, minimizing recess dimensions and water consumption. In addition, the absence of submerged moving / mechanical parts, minimizes maintenance requirements and the modular design of the gate enhances ease of maintenance, transport and manufacture. The Sliding Arch Gate has been worked out to an operational design level, using the Panama Canal Expansion Project as reference, in order to evaluate its potential performance and to make comparison with conventional technologies. From the evaluation it has been concluded that Sliding Arch Gate will require higher initial investments but that major benefits are achieved by reduced water consumption and low maintenance. The first of which can result into over $ 2, 000 mln. in added revenues for the Panama Canal, during the commercial lifetime of the gate, due to increased lockage capacity. It has thus been concluded that new/innovative technologies, like the Sliding Arch Gate, can outperform up-scaled conventional technologies. However as the design of the Sliding Arch Gate is still in a pioneering stage, there are many optimizations to be found and uncertainties to be investigated.

50|$|The Warwick and Napton Canal and the Birmingham and Warwick Canal both faced stiff {{competition}} from the railways, and declared themselves bankrupt in the early 1850s. The companies were reconstituted by the receiver, and continued to trade. From 1917, they were managed jointly, and on 1 January 1929, were sold to the Regent's Canal, and with the Grand Junction Canal, {{became part of the}} Grand Union Canal. In order to effectively compete, the new company wanted to upgrade the canals so that wide barges could be used between London and Birmingham. Their aim was to accommodate barges 12.5 ft wide immediately, and ultimately to make the route suitable for 14 ft barges. 52 locks on the two Warwick canals were converted into weirs, and 51 new locks, each 83.5 by 15 ft were built. There was one less because the flight of six at Knowle was replaced by five. In order to give a depth of 5.5 ft, the height of weirs were raised or <b>lock</b> <b>sills</b> were lowered. As part of the work, the top two locks at Bascote were made into a staircase pair. Although the Duke of Kent performed an opening ceremony on 30 October 1934 at the top lock of the Hatton flight, to mark the completion of the project, work continued until 1937. One 12.5 ft boat was built, but without widening the bottom of the canal, there were many places where two such boats could not pass, and the new locks were used by pairs of narrow boats.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Evaluate the {{relationship}} between the postural alignment of the head and possible interference in the view of children. Methods: We evaluated 11 children between 2 and 7 years of age of both sexes, with the visually impaired, who had nystagmus and <b>head</b> <b>lock</b> position. The test Lea Grating Acuity Test&# 174; was used to collect measurements of visual acuity. This applied on two occasions: with and without postural alignment of the head. For reliability of the postural alignment of the head, the slopes were measured by Fisiologic&# 174; software. Results: The children had a poorer performance after physiological postural alignment. This poor performance is possible due to loss of position lock nystagmus to gain postural alignment, said to be ideal. Postural compensations were observed, and sharply increased eyestrain. Conclusion: The pursuit of traditional postural alignment affect the visual response of children with visual impairments...|$|R
