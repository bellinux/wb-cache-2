40|$|Baffle Former Bolts {{are vital}} joint {{elements}} of the reactor core internal structure. Since 1989, successive UT inspections in various European plants have revealed a trend of progressive indications. Different bolt and locking designs have been used during the initial design and building phase of the plants. Lock-bar style bolts are one type of bolts which are used in numerous plants in Europe and the US. Lock-bar style bolts pose a challenge due to limited ultrasonic probe access availability. Furthermore, the inspection approach has to capture indications in the bolt threaded region {{as well as in}} the bolt head to shank interface. During recently performed qualifications in Europe the ultrasonic inspection of lock-bar style bolts has been improved by using advanced probe design and an an alysis approach. Based on blind test qualification testing performed on sample bolts a high degree of confidence could be achieved. Inner <b>hexagon</b> (hex) <b>bolts</b> <b>with</b> a locking washer represent another design used in several plants in Europe and the US. This bolt design poses another challenge based on varying cone dimensions and limited access through the inner hex. Ultrasonic beam field simulations have been performed to support and verify laboratory and qualification testing. This paper describes the qualification process in more detail. Furthermore, field experiences will be presented. These inspections were performed employing a variety of delivery platforms including robotic manipulators and submarines. This will provide a basis for the comparison of the respective benefits of these d ifferent approaches...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{a gasket}} made in soft {{material}} is not recommended for large size centrifugal compressor case flange. The two case halves are assembled <b>with</b> <b>bolted</b> <b>flanges</b> and leakage is prevented by the metal–to–metal contact under pressure. The prediction of the leakage condition is an important engineering issue for this technology. In the paper an original model able to predict the leakage condition, based on a Fracture Mechanics approach, is presented. The flange surfaces interface {{is regarded as a}} crack which can be partially open. As the flanges can not transfer tensile traction, the extension of the open zone, i. e. the crack length, is obtained by the condition that the Stress Intensity Factor K is zero. An analytical model, based on the Weight Function technique, was applied to find the stress intensity K, and then to predict the leakage condition. The paper illustrates a validation of the proposed model by the comparison with a nonlinear Finite Element analysis and the results of a full scale experimental test series obtained by a research collaboration between industry and academia. The leakage pressure predicted by the model is in good agreement with the numerical prediction and the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of light}} steel frames in rapid {{construction}} has grown significantly, especially concerning low and medium-rise buildings.

This paper presents {{a study on the}} lateral sway behaviour for light steel frames <b>with</b> <b>bolted</b> top-seat <b>flange</b> cleat connections comprising slender cold-formed steel sections. Two different sections, flexibility of beam-to-column joint and base conditions are the investigated variables. The result recorded showed that geometrics, joint flexibility and base conditions affect the sway stiffness of light steel frame. The increase rate is ranged from 29. 2 % to 47. 5 % for the identical tests for the effect of section depth. The ratio lies between 1. 10 and 3. 04 for the effect of connector thickness. In addition, beam-to-column bolted connections can contribute 34 – 88 % of the overall frame elastic lateral stiffness for pinned bases and 17 – 33 % for rigid base connections. Frame stability analysis with respect to global frame and column design were performed for the test specimens. Appropriate frame design analysis should be determined to provide a safe and reliable design for light steel frame considering bolted flexible joints and slender cold-formed steel sections...|$|R

The concentrated load was applied by a bearing plate at the top flange of the channels, and the reaction force applied by an identical bearing plate at the bottom flange of the channels. The bearing plates acted across the full flange widths of the channels. The flanges of the channels were bolted to the bearing plates for the specimens <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> restrained. The web crippling test strengths are compared with the current design strengths obtained using the AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI Specification.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{high-rise}} latticed tower structures {{are made of}} steel tubular members. To facilitate the construction, the tower legs are constructed by connecting the steel tubular members <b>with</b> <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints. Under the wind load, the bolts of the flange joints may loosen; and this may endanger {{the safety of the}} tower if the bolt looseness and its locations cannot be detected and repaired timely. This paper proposes a new method for identifying the damage locations of bolt looseness of bolted flange joints at tower legs based on the abrupt changes of the structural responses of the towers to the wind load. The bolt looseness is reflected by the reduction of the bending rigidity of elements in the stiffness matrix of the beam element model which is equivalent to the refined solid finite element model of the flange joints. A vector composed of the standardized mean square deviations of the wind-induced longitudinal strain responses at flange joints in a damaged state of the tower related to those in its undamaged state is used as a damage index. It has been shown that the damage index is sensitive to the damage locations but independent of the wind load. Hence. the damage index can be used to identify the damage locations of the bolt looseness at the flange joints. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a latticed steel tubular tower, which shows that the proposed method can accurately identify the damage locations of bolt looseness.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{deep drawing}} process {{is one of the}} {{important}} sheet metal forming process. In this paper, different methods of analysis such as analytical, numerical and experimental techniques are employed to determine sheet blank size, formability and thickness distribution. The traditional sheet plate forming techniques used in industry is experimental, expansive and time consuming methods. Prediction of the formability, thickness distribution in {{deep drawing process}} will decrease the production cost and time of material to be formed. With this regard, the numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element method for cup shaped components <b>with</b> <b>flange.</b> Thickness distribution is obtained for entire cup along <b>with</b> <b>flange.</b> The results obtained from this numerical analysis are compared with experimental findings and results of other researchers. Experimentally thickness distribution is obtained by measurement at various locations in half cut cup along <b>with</b> <b>flange</b> region. Also analytical relationship is suggested to obtain correct initial blank size for cup shaped components <b>with</b> <b>flange</b> on the basis of principal of constancy of volume. As a result of this, 90 - 95 % consistency is obtained between the finite element result and experimental, analytical findings for initial blank size, formability and thickness distribution. Analytical models are extensive and experimentation is time consuming and expensive. Thus one can rely on FEA and simulations can be carried out to control IBS, formability, thickness distribution for component of same family by taking initial guess of IBS from analytical formula to avoid time and cost in field trials by controlling parameters of tooling and press machine...|$|R
