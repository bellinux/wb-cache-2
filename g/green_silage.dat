40|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} fungal species that have harmful effects on mammals. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the content of mycotoxins in fresh-cut material of selected forage grass species both during and at the end of the growing season. We further assessed mycotoxin content in subsequently produced first-cutting silages with respect to the species used in this study: Lolium perenne (cv. Kentaur), Festulolium pabulare (cv.

Sudangrass produces well on all soil types, however best yields are obtained on well-drained, deep loam soils that have a high capacity to absorb and hold water. Sufficient nitrogen should be applied at planting to ensure establishment of the crop and hasten development.

The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the effectiveness of an early catch crop in reducing nitrogen leaching from coarse sandy soil. Barley as a <b>green</b> crop for <b>silage</b> was undersown with Italian ryegrass in spring and harvested at the beginning of early heading, and the Italian ryegrass was subsequently used for roughage production in autumn. Material and methods Experiments were established in spring 2003 on a commercial organic farm with a coarse sandy soil. Two fields with grass-clover were ploughed. One field, a 3 -year-old grass-clover, had formed part of a crop rotation dominated by cereals, and the other, a 5 -year-old grass-clover, was part of a grass-intensive rotation grazed by dairy cows. After ploughing the grass-clover, the following treatments were established in each of the two fields: 1) spring barley, harvested at maturity and subjected to mechanical weed control in autumn (“Mature”) and 2) spring barley harvested early as a <b>green</b> crop for <b>silage</b> with an undersown catch crop of Italian ryegrass (“Green”), which was mowed twice in autumn. The treatments were fertilized with 0, 60 or 120 kg ammonium-N ha- 1 in cattle slurry, injected in the spring following ploughing. The resultant treatments are called: Mature- 0 N, Mature- 60 N, Mature- 120 N, Green- 0 N, Green- 60 N and Green- 120 N. Leaching of nitrogen (nitrate and total-N) was measured from May 2003 to May 2004 by means of ceramic suction cups installed in treatments fertilized with 0 or 120 kg ammonium-N ha- 1. Results and conclusions Nitrate leaching after Mature- 0 N was 174 and 240 kg N ha- 1 in 3 -year-old and the 5 -year-old grass-clover, respectively, when the soil was kept bare by rotovating twice during autumn. In Mature- 120 N leaching was 302 and 316 kg N ha- 1. In Green- 0 N and Green- 120 N leaching was only 7 - 9 kg N ha- 1.

The research conducted in 2010 - 2013 included studies {{on the effectiveness of}} the methods and norms of sowing the sorghum, required quantities of mineral fertilizers to increase the crop yields and nutritional value of sorghum sown in the irrigated lowland areas of Dagestan. Methods. We conducted three field researches. In experiments with grain sorghum (the middle ripening group Zernogradskiy 88) we studied drill and broad-cast methods of sowing, seeding rate, the calculated doses of mineral fertilizers on programmable levels of crop yields: 6 t/ha (N 160 P 112 K 70), 7 t/ha (N 190 P 128 K 80) and 8 t/ha (N 220 P 144 K 90). Seeding rate was 300, 350 and 400 thousand viable seeds per 1 ha; broadcast was chosen as a sowing method. A field experiment with sweet sorghum included promising hybrid crop Debut, fertilizers N 140 P 80 K 70, N 190 P 110 K 95 and N 240 P 140 K 120 to obtain 60, 70 and 80 t/ha of green mass for two mowings, respectively. Results. The use of fertilizers based on a given level of productivity at optimum plant population can significantly improve the nutritional regime of the soil during the growing season of the sweet sorghum and create optimal conditions for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium security for the crops and thus obtain the planned crop yield.

Sequencing of 109 clones from a bacterial and an archaeal 16 S-rDNA amplicon library revealed that the obtained nucleotide sequences are similar but not identical to 16 S-rDNA database sequences derived from different anaerobic environments including digestors and bioreactors. Most of the bacterial 16 S-rDNA sequences could be assigned to the phylum Firmicutes with the most abundant class Clostridia and to the class Bacteroidetes, whereas most archaeal 16 S-rDNA sequences cluster close to the methanogen Methanoculleus bourgensis. Further sequences of the archaeal library most probably represent so far non-characterised species within the genus Methanoculleus. A similar result derived from phylogenetic analysis of mcrA clone sequences. The mcrA gene product encodes the α-subunit of methyl-coenzyme-M reductase involved in the final step of methanogenesis. BLASTn analysis applying stringent settings resulted in assignment of 16 S-rDNA metagenome sequence reads to 62 16 S-rDNA amplicon sequences thus enabling frequency of abundance estimations for 16 S-rDNA clone library sequences.

Liming increased linearly the values of soil pH (from 4. 7 to 6. 6) and Ca and Mg, eliminated Al 3 + with rates of 9. 0 t ha- 1 or higher, decreased slightly Al-CuCl 2, Fe and Cu, and did not affect Zn and Mn. Maximum average corn yield for grain (7. 9 t ha- 1) and for <b>green</b> matter for <b>silage</b> (GM) (59 t ha- 1) was obtained, respectively, at soil pH of 6. 0 (12 t ha- 1 of limestone) and of 6. 1 (14 t ha- 1 of limestone); maximum economic efficiency for grain was obtained at pH 5. 6 (7. 5 t ha- 1 of limestone). Maximum yield increments due to liming were 17 % for grain and 20 % for GM...|$|R
40|$|Feather pecking {{has been}} {{controlled}} in the laying hen industry through {{methods such as}} beak trimming, breeding low feather pecking lines, providing enrichment items, and altering diets to promote satiety. Two {{recent studies have shown}} the positive impact of feeding silage (a relatively low nutrient feed item) in addition to (or as supplement) a nutritionally balanced hen ration in terms of decreased aggressive and feather pecking behaviour and improved feather score. The objectives of this thesis were to determine which specific characteristic(s) hens prefer, and if the preferred characteristics were responsible for improving hen welfare. Initial experiments consisted of a preference test, which provided a supplement in a removable insert in front of half a cage, and a balanced ration in the other half. In the first experiment, hens were shown to have a locational preference in the feed trough, not resulting from the presence of the insert, nor from intraspecific competition. Experiment two tested the preference for an ensiled or non-ensiled, and moist or dry material using barley greens, dried barley <b>greens,</b> barley <b>silage,</b> and dried barley silage. Results indicated that hens show preference for moist, non-ensiled materials, but ensiled materials are not rejected. Further investigations took place focusing on physical characteristics as experiment two results suggested a preference for unfermented products. Experiment three examined the provision of a forage-able substrate which was edible (wet or dry barley) or not (plastic lace), and found that edible materials increase the time spent at the feeder. Experiment four tested the preference for particle size of various edible materials (oats, silage and alfalfa) and found hens spend more time with smaller particles sizes of silage and oat materials. The final experiment (Experiment five) used a supplement with all preferred characteristics (wet pea fibre) to determine its impact on feather pecking in birds housed in conventional and enriched cages. Birds given supplemental material did not increase time spent at the feeder, and feathers showed no more or less wear than would be expected from the housing system. Vent scores (areas typically affected by pecking) tended to improve under the presence of pea fibre. Feather pecking decreased when hens were offered pea fibre when housed in large group and enriched cages. Decreased body weight, heavier gizzards, and improved feed efficiency (balanced feed per dozen eggs) point towards improved digestive efficiencies with consumed fibre, even though elongation of the ileum and jejunum seem to contradict this hypothesis. While highly preferred, moist, non-ensiled, low nutrient pea fibre did not impact hen welfare to the degree seen in previous studies with silage. However, similar feedstuffs are still a possible means of enrichment to reduce feather pecking and increase welfare in laying hens, and future research should continue with different bird strains and materials for enrichment, as well as examining hen digestive efficiencies and effects on production costs...|$|R
40|$|Winter forage crop-fed {{dairy cattle}} excrete the largest {{proportion}} of their annual nitrogen (N) leachate from the dairy system, {{during the winter}} period. Adjusting the supply of N to carbohydrate in the diet is suggested to enhance the use of dietary N by the reticulorumen microbial population, {{reducing the amount of}} N lost in urinary excrement. 150 pregnant, non-lactating, spring calving Friesian Jersey cross dairy cattle were randomly blocked to three wintering systems: HK, early sown kale, high allowance with barley straw (14, & 3 kg DM cow⁻¹ day⁻¹), MK, late sown kale, low allowance with <b>green</b> chop oat <b>silage</b> (11, & 5 kg DM cow⁻¹ day⁻¹), and FB, fodder beet with ryegrass balage (8, & 6 kg DM cow⁻¹ day⁻¹). Using the in sacco method, three ruminal cannulated cows blocked to each wintering system had their respective crop (leaf and stem together) incubated for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 hours intra-ruminally. On three separate occasions 5 random cows from each winter system had their grazing behaviour observed for 6 hours, including grazing activity, stance, and fecal and urination events. In the in sacco study, crops had similar organic matter (OM) degradability fractions with total rumen degradability reaching 91. 5 %. Similarly N degradability was also similar for the three crops at 98 %, where N disappearance rate was more rapid for FB compared with kale diets. The apparent disappearance rate of N to OM was lowest for FB to that of both kale diets (4. 6 to 27. 3 verse 13. 5 to 48. 4 g N kg OM⁻¹), suggesting N use by reticulorumen microbes may be more enhanced in the FB diet. In the behaviour study, FB cows spent less time grazing crop than kale feed cows (156. 7 verse 254. 7 minutes). By 6 hours from allocation due to the high digestibly of all crops intake satisfactory behaviour possible indicated the end of the grazing bout, with maximum crop utilisation achieved (98, & 88 %, FB and kale diets) by this time. FB diet could be expected to have the most influence on reducing urinary N loss in winter grazing systems, with microbial N use. Rapid crop intake allows for wintered cattle to be feed in situ while managed with a standoff pad to capture and spread nutrient output, potentially migrating environmental risk...|$|R

Includes aspects such as taxonomic classification, etymology, origin and distribution, tree features and agronomic characteristics, uses, establishment, nutritional value and antinutritional factors. It also shows the result of studies of supplementation with Acacia relating to productive behavior in cattle and sheep and the benefits obtained on soil and pasture when set in Silvopastoral systems. The quality of the soil and pasture is improved with the establishment of Acacia decurrens because it is a nitrogen-fixing leguminous plant, can also be used as food either as <b>green</b> fodder, in <b>silages</b> mixed or dehydrated in the form of Hay, decreasing the use of pelleted ration. The plant has good nutritional content, but one of their restraints are tannins, since several studies there is evidence of their presence, which may lead to decreased consumption, reduction of digestibility and malfunction of the rumen, although in invitro studies it was observed that they may be beneficial, since they reduce the protein degradation in the rumen helping bypass protein...|$|R
40|$|In India oats can {{be grown}} as fodder crops on all soils, apart from {{alkaline}} or waterlogged conditions, in all regions where wheat and barley are grown. It is mostly grown as winter crop. In addition, oats are quick growing, palatable, succulent and nutritious and acceptable to all categories of livestock. It can be fed in many forms such as <b>green</b> forage, straw, <b>silage,</b> and grains. With {{the introduction of new}} management systems (proper amounts of manure and fertilizers, multicut cultivars, better combinations such as oats + vetch and oats + peas) both commercial dairy farmers and resource-poor farmers have greatly reduced the feed shortage problem during the dry winter months as well as achieving a 30 % reduction in the cost of feed. Besides growing fodder oats as sole crop, oats + vetch is the best mixture for high yields and improved soil fertility. For resource-poor farmers, oat cultivars Canadian and Kent are recommended and a combination of oats + vetch. The general nutrient management practice is application of FYM at the rate of 5 ton/ha by broadcast uniformly and another ploughing done. 80 : 60 : 40 kg (N: P 2 O 5 : K 20) is the recommended fertilizer rate, where N was used in three split doses, applied after each cut under irrigated conditions. Otherwise it was applied as one basal dose under rainfed conditions. After sowing, a land leveler was used to ensure good seed contact with soil. To optimize the fertilizer requirement, various trials were conducted under All India Coordinate Fodder Research Project. Application of 120 kg/ha resulted higher green fodder yield of 30 t/ha. To get a maximum possible yield application of 60 kg Sulphur/ ha along with recommended dose of fertilizer can be restored. Fodder oats is also cultivated in cropping sequences like Rice-Cowpea-oats and ricesorghum- oats. Application of 75 % of recommended fertilizer along with FYM (5 t/ha) recorded maximum rice equivalent yield of 40 t/ha in the case of rice-cowpea-oats cropping sequence. So, oats has the potential to serve as an important winter fodder crop in India during winter season. With good nutrient management it can potentially provides more and better fodder from the same unit of land than the traditionally grown winter wheat. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} was to ensure quality <b>green</b> forage and <b>silage</b> early in the spring on family farms in northern Croatia, through introducing winter cereals and Winter pea mixtures. For that purpose mixtures of Winter pea (cv. Maksimirski visoki) with triticale (cv. Clercal) were cut in the beginning of May, while the mixtures of Winter pea with wheat (cv. Sana and cv. Žitarka) were cut {{in the second half of}} May at family farms: Maletić (Ferdinandovac), Mirović (Višnjevac), Bazić (M. Trojstvo), Mlinar (Kapela Podravska), Mužinić (Križevćec) i Uher (Grabovac). The mixtures were used to feed dairy cows from the beginning of flowering till the full bloom of Winterpea. The green mass yields (GMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale cut in the beginning of pea flowering varied from 24. 0 to 52. 7 t/ha, while the GMY of mixtures cut in the full bloom of Winter pea were from 46. 7 to 67. 5 t/ha. Average dry matter yields (DMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale cut in the beginning of flowering varied from 4. 05 to 12. 2 t/ha, while the DMY of mixtures cut in the full bloom of Winter pea were from 8. 98 to 18. 39 t/ha. All mixtures of Winter pea with triticale cut in the beginning of flowering had drymatter content (DMC) from 19. 41 % while the DMC of mixtures cut in the full bloom of Winter pea were from 23. 56 %. The GMY for mixtures of Winter pea with wheat cut in the beginning of pea flowering varied from 23. 2 to 50. 0 t/ha, while the GMY of mixtures cut in the full bloom of Winter pea were from 53. 3 to 62. 5 t/ha. The DMY for mixtures of Winter pea with wheat cut in the beginning of flowering varied from 4. 39 to 9. 49 t/ha, while the DMY of the same mixture cut in the full bloom were from 10. 67 to 15. 59 t/ha. All mixtures of Winter pea with wheat cut in the beginning of flowering had DMC from 17. 0 % to 20. 96 %, while the DMC of the same mixtures cut in the full bloom were from 20. 00 % to 27. 31 %...|$|R

Elle peut aussi être valorisée sous forme d'engrais vert ou d'ensilage. Mais quel est son impact sur la {{production}} de la luzerne semée au printemps ? On a étudié l'effet de 2 cultures intermédiaires (seigle et ray-grass d'Italie) sur l'implantation de la luzerne. Les cultures intermédiaires ont été détruites à 3 dates différentes au printemps suivant, correspondant à 3 dates de semis de luzerne. En conditions climatiques normales, la réserve hydrique du sol n'est pas affectée par leur présence. Une date tardive de semis de la luzerne a un impact négatif significatif sur sa production l'année d'implantation mais cet impact est compensé par la production de la culture intermédiaire, laquelle contribue à faire diminuer la teneur en nitrate de l'eau drainée pendant l'interculture. La production de matière sèche de la luzerne au cours de l'année suivante n'est affectée ni par la date de semis, ni par le précédent. Sowing a {{catch crop}} between two main crops {{at the end}} of summer, in this case between a cereal crop and a spring-sown lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), gives the possibility of putting to good use the soil, which otherwise would generally remain bare, and to reduce the leaching of nitrate. In addition, the catch crop can be used on the farm itself as <b>green</b> manure or <b>silage.</b> The object of this work was to compare the effects of two catch crops, rye (Secale cereale L.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), and of the bare soil, on the establishment and growth of spring-sown lucerne. The two catch crops tested were harvested and/or incorporated into the soil at three different dates during March and April (D 1, D 2, and D 3). These dates were in agreement with those usually practiced for the sowing of lucerne in spring. They had an effect on the yield of the lucerne crop in the sowing year, which was depressed for the two later dates (D 2, D 3), as compared to the first date. However, for these dates D 2 and D 3, the total dry matter yield of the catch crop and the lucerne crop was equivalent to the dry matter yield of the lucerne crop alone, sown at D 1. In the first year after sowing, there was no effect of the catch crops on the yield of lucerne, as compared to the bare soil...|$|R
40|$|Nautakarjatiloilla rehuviljan tuotanto tapahtuu suhteellisen pienissä yksiköissä eikä se nykyisillä viljan hinnoilla ole kovin taloudellista. Lisäksi eräät viimeaikojen tukiratkaisut ovat hieman parantaneet nurmirehun asemaa viljaan verrattuna. Nautakarjatilojen puimuri-investoinneista päätellen omaa rehuviljaa tuotetaan jatkossa yhä harvemmalla tilalla. Aktiivitiloille tehdyn kyselyn perusteella vain yksi maitotila sadasta aikoo hankkia ajopuimurin lähivuosina. Myös yhä useampi viljelijä vähentää rehuviljan suhteellista alaa, luopuu rehuviljan viljelystä tai on epävarma koko tilan tulevaisuuden suhteen. Koska useilla nautakarjatiloilla tukiehtojen mukainen lannankäyttö koetaan ongelmaksi jo nyt, viljan jääminen pois viljelykierrosta vaikeuttaa tilannetta yhä enemmän. Nurmirehuntuotannossa keskeisimpiä ongelmia ovat nurmen uudistamisen, viljelykasvivalinnan ja lannankäytön yhteensovittaminen. Rehuviljaa korvaavaksi vaihtoehdoksi viljelykierrossa on esitetty kokoviljasäilörehua, jossa on mukana koko kasvusto eli jyvät, lehdet ja korsi. Tällä menetelmällä päästäisiin yhteen peltoviljelyn koneketjuun ja vältettäisiin rehuviljan puintiin ja kuivatukseen liittyvät työ- ja pääomakustannukset. Kokoviljasäilörehun viljelyä, tuotantotekniikkaa, ruokintavaikutuksia ja taloudellista kannattavuutta selvitetään usean tutkimuslaitoksen yhteistyönä. Selvitettävänä on, voidaanko nautakarjatiloilla perinteinen rehuviljanviljely korvata ja nurmet uudistaa viljakasvustolla, josta tietyssä kehitysvaiheessa tehdään säilörehua. Tyypillisillä maitotiloilla siirtyminen viherlinjaan muuttaa viljelykiertoa ja karjalannan käyttömahdollisuuksia. Kun rehuvilja ostetaan tilan ulkopuolelta, eläinmäärien ja nurmi- ja kokoviljarehun tuotannon sekä lannankäytön välille joudutaan hakemaan uusi ympäristönormit huomioon ottava tasapaino. This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the current state, problems and plans for the near future related to the cereal and grass production on cattle farms. Production has been examined {{on the basis of the}} proportional shares of cereal and grass fodder area as well as farmers intentions concerning changes in fodder production. The study also covers the current state and future prospects of farming, and it is based on mailed questionnaires directed at the farms participating in the profitability bookkeeping of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute in spring 1999 as well as DataLaari farm panel made by the Food Facts Ltd. in 1998. Both inquiries concern the situation after autumn 1998, i. e. following an exceptionally bad crop year. About half of the cattle farms plan to continue fodder production in the current extent and with the same proportional shares of grass and cereal fodder. The willingness to continue production is the highest on bookkeeping farms practising cattle husbandry, while farms that participated in the farm panel expressed more intentions related to changes in fodder production due to uncertainty or plans to quit production. In terms of the different parts of the country as well as active farms and the farm panel, the intentions to change fodder production deviate mainly for the part of Ostrobothnia, where uncertainty was more common and many farms refused to participate in the study. The planning of the fodder production is particularly difficult due to the uncertainty related to the EU membership as well as the Agenda 2000 process, which was underway when the inquiry was made. About half of the farms consider that Agenda 2000 will have no effect on their fodder production, but almost a fifth of all cattle farms were unable to estimate the future of their fodder production or did not answer the questions. About half of the bookkeeping farms practising cattle husbandry expects the efficiency of arable crop production to continue to decrease, and according to about a quarter the cereal area is going to fall as a result of Agenda 2000. Whole cereal, i. e. cereals where part of the straw and the whole ear is used as fodder, was cultivated for either <b>green</b> fodder or <b>silage</b> on about a quarter of dairy farms participating in the bookkeeping in 1999. On other cattle farms whole cereal was not produced at all. On dairy farms producing whole cereal the average area under this was a little over four hectares. The farms expressed no intentions to increase the area of whole cereal, and the introduction of whole cereal fodder was considered on very few of the farms where cattle husbandry was based on grass fodder only. The use of whole cereal fodder is examined in a joint project, primarily between the Agricultural Research Centre and Agricultural Economics Research Institute. An economic study will be published in the beginning of 2000 concerning the comparison of the milk production cost at the farm level between whole cereal and grass feeding. vokMTT Taloustutkimus MTT...|$|R
