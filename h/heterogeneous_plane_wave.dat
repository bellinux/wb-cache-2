40|$|Theoretically {{obtained}} three-dimensional plots {{showing the}} behavior of the reflection coefficient for <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> upon arbitrary layered media as function of incidence angle and heterogeneity, supply valuable information for the investigation of the reflector when using bounded ultrasonic beams. The presence of leaky interface modes and their angular positions for a specific sample are determined by the fd products (frequency times thickness) of the constituent layers. Deformations of the reflected and transmitted bounded beam profiles and the contribution of surface wave radiation (leaking energy) at vibrational mode angles are governed by the f W product (frequency times beamwidth). For a given layered medium, optimum conditions for observing particular mode vibrations and large deformations of reflected ultrasonic profiles can be predicted theoretically. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the open}} structures, {{which are used}} in {{millimeter}} and submillimeter (MSM) wave engineering, diffraction gratings (DG) made in different modifications (periodic metal and metal-dielectric structures (MDS)) are of primary importance along with open cavities and open waveguides. Such systems are basic {{in the design of}} electromagnetic oscillation sources and electronic components of different instrumentation of such wavelength range. If there is a diffraction of electromagnetic fields by DG, “two-act” wave transformation usually takes place. When homogeneous <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> falls on the plane one-dimensionally periodic grating, scattered field can be considered as a spectrum of homo- and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves.</b> In this case body (incident) <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> is transformed into body (scattered) homogeneous <b>plane</b> and <b>heterogeneous</b> (surface) <b>waves</b> and, thus, “two-act” transformation occurs. This type of the boundary-value problems has been thoroughly studied in the work and partly realized in the experiment. In addition, processes of surface wave transformation of distributed sources into body waves by periodic heterogeneities are of special interest. Such phenomenon can be watched when an electron beam (EB) moves uniformly near the metal DG or periodic MDS. In this case self-surface field of the EB is scattered by DG and at least one of its harmonics is transformed into body wave of the diffraction radiation or Cherenkov radiation. It should be noted, that transformation of the surface wave of EB by DG into the diffraction radiation is also an example of the “two-act” diffraction process. In addition, phenomena, connected with the transformation of DG of the surface waves of a dielectric waveguide (DW), play a great role in MSM engineering. In this case surface waves of a DW are transformed by the DG into surface waves of the DW or into body waves separated from them. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|R
