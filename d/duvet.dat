Candace Dempsey writes that in rummaging around, looking for anything that might be missing, Romanelli inadvertently disturbed the crime scene. On discovering that the two phones Kercher typically carried with her had been found in a nearby garden, Romanelli became concerned and requested that the police force open the door to Kercher's bedroom, but the police declined. Instead, Romanelli's male friend forced the door open at around 1:15p.m., and the body of Kercher was found inside, lying on the floor, covered by a <b>duvet.</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—The use of <b>duvets</b> {{in infancy}} is not {{recommended}} in the UK and Australia because of a reported association with {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS).  AIMS—To examine the association between the use of <b>duvets</b> and the risk of SIDS.  METHODS—A nationwide case control study (393 cases, 1592 controls). The use of <b>duvets</b> was assessed by interview with the parent or guardian.  RESULTS—The use of <b>duvets</b> was associated with an increased risk of SIDS (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 65; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 31 to 2. 08); however, after adjustment for potential confounders there was no increased risk of SIDS (OR = 1. 04; 95 % CI, 0. 77 to 1. 38). Furthermore, subgroup analysis did not identify any group in which the use of <b>duvets</b> was associated with an increased risk of SIDS.  CONCLUSIONS—This study does not support the recommendation to avoid <b>duvets.</b> ...|$|R

500|$|Since {{the release}} of Return of the Jedi, the name Jabba the Hutt has become synonymous in American mass media with repulsive obesity. The name is {{utilized}} as a literary device—either as a simile or metaphor—to illustrate character flaws. For example, in Under the <b>Duvet</b> (2001), Marian Keyes references a problem with gluttony when she writes, [...] "wheel out the birthday cake, I feel a Jabba the Hutt moment coming on." [...] Likewise, in the novel Steps and Exes: A Novel of Family (2000), Laura Kalpakian uses Jabba the Hutt to emphasize {{the weight of a}} character's father: [...] "The girls used to call Janice's parents Jabba the Hutt and the Wookiee. But then Jabba (Janice's father) died, and it didn't seem right to speak of the dead on those terms." [...] In Dan Brown's first novel Digital Fortress, an NSA technician is affectionately nicknamed Jabba the Hutt.|$|E
50|$|<b>Duvet's</b> work {{contrasts}} {{strongly with}} the sophisticated art produced {{at the court}} of Fontainebleau. In its religious mysticism and quasi-Gothic sensibility, it partly harks back to the Middle Ages. <b>Duvet's</b> engraving known as Moses Surrounded by the Patriarchs (1540-50), for example, draws on a common medieval theme, the ancestors and antetypes of Christ. The driving force of <b>Duvet's</b> composition is the visionary nature of his material, which inspires him to place symbolic expression ahead of considerations of proportion, scale, or space. He also illustrates his texts literally.|$|R

2500|$|The famous late Gothic {{series of}} seven {{tapestry}} hangings The Hunt of the Unicorn are {{a high point}} in European tapestry manufacture, combining both secular and religious themes. The tapestries now hang in the Cloisters division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In the series, richly dressed noblemen, accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against mille-fleur backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay {{with the help of}} a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, [...] "The Unicorn in Captivity", the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a pomegranate tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the Low Countries, probably Brussels or Liège, for an unknown patron. A set of six engravings on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist Jean <b>Duvet</b> in the 1540s.|$|E

50|$|Top {{sheets are}} {{standard}} in the U.S., but much of Europe prefers to use <b>duvet</b> covers. A <b>duvet</b> cover consists of two rectangles sewn together on all but one side to create a sleeve for the <b>duvet,</b> which can be taken off and washed. When no other blankets are lain atop the covered <b>duvet,</b> it can provide several advantages over a top sheet. First, respecting sanitation, with a top sheet the bed occupant could accidentally in the night remove the barrier {{between himself and the}} <b>duvet</b> (which is less washable); with a <b>duvet</b> cover this is impossible. Second, for households with children, a bed with a covered <b>duvet</b> is easier to make: the child need only tug the corners of the <b>duvet</b> back towards the corners of the bed. Tucking in a top sheet before arranging the <b>duvet</b> is an extra step. Third, switching a <b>duvet</b> cover is a cheaper way to change color schemes than buying a new comforter.|$|E
50|$|The Smart <b>Duvet</b> uses {{fabric to}} make the bed through a network of air chambers. This is a {{breathable}} layer that is made of lightweight material.

Resistance was also measured when the items were placed on a dummy infant face. Measurements were made on washed and unwashed garments, which were tested both dry and wet. Results suggest that all the bedding materials tested are safe for use even in the newborn period. The <b>duvets</b> produced slightly lower resistance to breathing than conventional blankets and sheets. In view of {{the wide variety of}} infant bedding fabrics it seems desirable for standard airflow performance requirements to be introduced...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>duvet</b> ( [...] , , or {{from the}} French <b>duvet</b> [...] "down") {{is a type of}} bedding {{consisting}} of a soft flat bag filled with down, feathers, wool, silk or a synthetic alternative, and typically protected with a removable cover, analogous to a pillow and pillow case. Sleepers often use a <b>duvet</b> without a top bed sheet, as the <b>duvet</b> cover can readily be removed and laundered as often as the bottom sheet. Duvets originated in rural Europe and were filled with the down feathers of ducks. The best quality is taken from the eider duck, often while still alive, for its down is known for its effectiveness as a thermal insulator.|$|E
