In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an <b>incidental</b> <b>characteristic</b> that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E
40|$|In the {{introduction}} to the Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty (2002 : 34) states that ‘Attention, [ [...] . ] as a general and formal activity, does not exist’. This paper examines the meaning and truth of this difficult and surprising statement, along with its implications for the account of perception given by theorists such as Dretske (1988) and Peacocke (1983). In order to elucidate Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological account of human perception, I will present two alternative models 1 of how attention might be thought to operate. The first is derived from the works of the aforementioned theorists and is, I argue, based upon a largely inaccurate computational or mechanistic understanding of the mind. The second is drawn from the works of Merleau-Ponty and cognitive scientist and philosopher, Alva Noë, and takes into account recent neurological theories concerning the role of attention in human consciousness. On the basis of these models I will argue that attention is an essential, rather than <b>incidental,</b> <b>characteristic</b> of consciousness that is constitutive of both thought and perception, and which cannot be understood in terms of the independent faculty or ‘general and unconditioned power’ (ibid. 31) that Dretske et al’s account requires. I will conclude by considering two potential counterexamples to my argument, and evaluating the threat that these pose to the phenomenological model...|$|E
40|$|We {{live in a}} time {{in which}} {{photographs}} have become extraordinarily mobile. By being digitally networked, they can be exchanged and circulated at the swipe of a finger across a screen. Images on screens are constantly refreshed, photo and video are frequently indistinguishable. The digital photographic image appears and disappears with a mere gesture of the hand. This book argues that this mobility of the image was accelerated but not inaugurated by digital media and telecommunications. Photographs, from the moment of their invention, set images loose, by making them portable, reproducible, able to be projected, miniaturised, multiplied. The fact that we do not associate analogue photography with such mobility {{has much to do with}} the limitations of existing histories and theories of photography, which have tended to view photographic mobility as either an <b>incidental</b> <b>characteristic</b> or a fault. These histories and theories have their own genealogies, emerging in specific cultural and historical contexts that predisposed them to particular understandings and values. Photography : The Unfettered Image traces the emergence of these ways of understanding photography while at the same time presenting a differently nuanced and materialist history, in which photography is understood as part of a larger development of media technologies in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, linked to telegraphy, to new print technologies and to television. It is also situated in a much broader cultural contexts: caught up in the European colonial ambition to “grasp the world” and in the development of a new, artificial “second nature” dependent on the large-scale processing of animal and mineral materials. Focussing primarily on Victorian and 1920 s- 30 s practices and theories, this book demonstrates how photography was never simply a technology for fixing a fleeting reality...|$|E

40|$|The paper starts by recalling {{selected}} anthropological classifications {{of cultural}} dimensions of globalization, focussing specially on those postulated by Professor Arjun Appadurai in 1996. Next, it jumps to 2013 {{and to the}} Universidade Lusófona’s call for a Conference named “ShoppingScapes”, concentrating on the understanding of that expression. Precedents that have possibly led to today’s typical shoppingscapes are next approached, addressing particularly two of their major manifestations, those linked to developing economies and those related to developed ones. Next the text argues about typical features of a shoppingscape, bringing to light three <b>incidental</b> <b>characteristics</b> that are usually encompassed by a shoppingscape in urban contemporaneity namely (i) metropolitan fragmentation; (ii) marketing of the metropolitan fragments through iconic architectural branding; (iii) gluing the metropolitan fragmentation through the employment of urban activities typical of the tertiary sector. Finally, it concludes by raising some points linked to shoppingscapes and to urban design guidelines in contemporaneity...|$|R
40|$|The object {{oriented}} paradigm, which advocates bottom-up program development, appears {{at first sight}} {{to run counter to}} the classical, top-down approach of structured programming. The deep requirement of structured programming, however, is that programming should be based on well-defined abstractions with clear meaning rather than on <b>incidental</b> <b>characteristics</b> of computing machinery. This requirement can be met by {{object oriented}} programming and, in fact, object oriented programs may have better structure than programs obtained by functional decomposition. The definitions of the basic components of object oriented programming, object, class, and inheritance, are still sufficiently fluid to provide many choices for the designer of an object oriented language. Full support of objects in a typed language requires a number of features, including classes, inheritance, genericity, renaming, and redefinition. Although each of these features is simple in itself, interactions between features can become complex. For example, renaming and redefinition may interact in unexpected ways. In this paper, we show that appropriate design choices can yield a language that fulfills the promise of object oriented programming without sacrificing the requirements of structured programming...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Components {{other than}} the active {{ingredients}} of treatment can have substantial effects on pain and disability. Such "non-specific" components include: the therapeutic relationship, the healthcare environment, <b>incidental</b> treatment <b>characteristics,</b> patients' beliefs, and practitioners' beliefs. This study aims to: identify the most powerful non-specific treatment components for low back pain (LBP); compare their effects on patient outcomes across orthodox (physiotherapy) and complementary (osteopathy, acupuncture) therapies; test which theoretically-derived mechanistic pathways explain the effects of non-specific components; and identify {{similarities and differences between}} the therapies on patient-practitioner interactions. Methods and analysis: This research comprises a prospective questionnaire-based cohort study with a nested mixed methods study. A minimum of 144 practitioners will be recruited from public and private sector settings (48 physiotherapists, 48 osteopaths, and 48 acupuncturists). Practitioners are asked to recruit 10 - 30 patients each, by handing out invitation packs to adult patients presenting with a new episode of LBP. The planned multilevel analysis requires a final sample size of 690 patients to detect correlations between predictors, hypothesised mediators, and the primary outcome (self-reported back-related disability on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire). Practitioners and patients complete questionnaires measuring non-specific treatment components, mediators and outcomes at: baseline (Time 1 : after the first consultation for a new episode of LBP); during treatment (Time 2 : 2 -weeks post-baseline); and short-term outcome (Time 3 : 3 -months post-baseline). A randomly-selected sub-sample of participants in the questionnaire study will be invited {{to take part in a}} nested mixed methods study of patient-practitioner interactions. In the nested study, 63 consultations (21 /therapy) will be audio-recorded and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively, to identify treatment-enhancing communication practices. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol is approved by the host institution’s ethics committee and the NHS Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated via peer review journal articles, conferences, and a stakeholder workshop. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Purpose and Background The MOCAM {{study is}} a major {{prospective}} questionnaire-based study investigating the relationship between low back pain (LBP) patient outcomes and non-specific treatment components, i. e., therapeutic relationship, healthcare environment, <b>incidental</b> treatment <b>characteristics,</b> patients' beliefs and practitioners' beliefs. Participating acupuncturists, osteopaths, and physiotherapists from the NHS and private sector {{have been asked to}} recruit at least 10 patients into the study. This paper aims to analyse current recruitment rates from MOCAM and identify barriers and facilitators to effective recruitment. Methods and Results Recruitment has taken place over 15 months. Invitation letters or emails were sent to individual practitioners identified using online search tools and professional networks. Recruitment rates were analysed descriptively. Within the private sector, response rates (number participating/number invited) are: acupuncturists 3 % (49 / 1561), osteopaths 6 % (53 / 912), physiotherapists 4 % (40 / 1048). Private sector practitioners have each recruited on average 1, 4, and 2 patients into the study respectively. Within the NHS, the response rates are: acupuncturists 100 % (2 / 2), osteopaths 8 % (1 / 13), physiotherapists 63 % (44 / 70). NHS practitioners have each recruited on average 4, 3, and 2 patients respectively. Conclusions Recruiting practitioners has been challenging. While the response rates in the NHS are higher than in the private sector the absolute number of acupuncturists and osteopaths participating from the NHS is very low. This may be due to changes in the NHS commissioning landscape. However, further investigation is required to confirm this. The higher recruitment rates of patients from NHS settings may reflect different patient populations across sectors.

40|$|Architectural design, {{like many}} other human activities, {{benefits}} more and more from the ongoing development of information and communication technologies. The traditional paper documents for the representation and communication of design are now replaced by digital media. CAD systems have replaced the drawing board and knowledge systems are used to integrate expert knowledge in the design process. Product modelling {{is one of the}} most promising approaches in the developments of the last two decades, aiming in the architectural context at the representation and communication of the information related to a building in all its aspects and during its complete life-cycle. However, after studying both the characteristics of the product modelling approach and the characteristics of architectural design, it is concluded in this research project that product modelling does not suffice for support of architectural design. Architectural design is characterised mainly as a problem solving process, involving illdefined problems that require a very dynamic way of dealing with information that concerns both the problem and emerging solutions. Furthermore, architectural design is in many ways an evolutionary process. In short term this is because of the incremental approach to problem solving in design projects, and in long term because of the stylistic development of designers and the continuous developments in the building and construction industry in general. The requirements that are posed by architectural design are concentrated in the keywords extensibility and flexibility of the design informationmodels. Extensibility means that designers can extend conceptual models with definitions that best suit the design concepts they wish to utilise. Flexibility means that information in design models can be structured in a way that accurately represents the design rationale. This includes the modelling of <b>incidental</b> <b>characteristics</b> and relationships of the entities in the model that are not necessarily predefined in a conceptual model. In general, product modelling does not adequately support this dynamic nature of design. Therefore, this research project has studied the concepts developed in the technology of Feature-based modelling, which originates from the area of mechanical engineering. These concepts include the usage of Features as the primitives for defining and reasoning about a product. Features have an autonomous function in the information model, which, as a result, constitutes a flexible network of relationships between Features that are established during the design process. The definition of Features can be specified by designers to formalise new design concepts. This allows the design tools to be adapted to the specific needs of the individual designer, enlarging the library of available resources for design. In addition to these key-concepts in Feature-based modelling as it is developed in the mechanical engineering context, the project has determined the following principles for a Feature-based approach in the architectural context. Features in mechanical engineering are used mainly to describe the lowest level of detail in a product's design, namely the characteristics of its parts. In architecture the design process does not normally follow a strictly hierarchical approach and therefore requires that the building be modelled as a whole. This implies that multiple levels of abstraction are modelled and that Features are used to describe information at the various abstraction levels. Furthermore, architectural design involves concepts that are non-physical as well as physical, Features are to be used for modelling both kinds. The term Feature is defined in this research project to reflect the above key-concepts for this modelling approach. A Feature is an autonomous, coherent collection of information, with semantic meaning to a designer and possibly emerging during design, that is defined to formalise a design concept at any level of abstraction, either physical or non-physical, as part of a building model. Feature models are built up entirely of Features and are structured in the form of a directed graph. The nodes in the graph are the Features, whereas the arcs are the relationships between the Features. Features can be of user-defined types and incidental relationships can be added that are not defined at the typological level. An inventory in this project of what kind of information is involved in the practice of modelling architectural design is based on the analysis of a selection of sources of architectural design information. This inventory is deepened by a case study and results in the proposition of a categorisation of architectural Feature types...|$|R

This qualitative descriptive study identified the incidental learning that occurred in the one-to-one teaching method utilized by the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). A two-part interview instrument was developed and administered by the investigator during December 1985 and January 1986 to 45 EFNEP graduated homemakers in three Illinois counties. The research questions were: (1) What incidental learning was attained by the subjects? (2) Is there a relationship between the incidental learning and selected characteristics of the program graduates? (3) Is there a relationship between <b>incidental</b> learning and <b>characteristics</b> of the paraprofessional program aides who deliver the program? and (4) What other factors apparently contributed to incidental learning?Four major areas of incidental learning were determined. They were money management, parenting skills, community involvement, and furthered learning. The parenting skills area evolved from open-ended questions. These four areas were related to the direct impact the EFNEP paraprofessional program aides (PAs) had on the homemaker clients. The most important characteristics of the homemaker clients that determined the occurrence of incidental learning were age and educational level. The PAs' most important criterion for fostering incidental learning was that they were indigenous to their clientele's neighborhoods. Other factors that encouraged incidental learning included meeting in the homemaker's arena, the development of a "special relationship" between the homemakers and the PAs, the development of trust between the facilitator and the learner, and the importance of family to the homemakers...|$|R
