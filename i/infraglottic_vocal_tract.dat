Electromagnetic articulography data was used as input to an inverse tracking simulation that estimates muscle activations to generate 3 D jaw and tongue postures corresponding to the target articulator positions. For acoustic simulations, the <b>vocal</b> <b>tract</b> geometry is needed, but since the <b>vocal</b> <b>tract</b> is a cavity rather than a physical object, its geometry does not explicitly exist in a biomechanical model. A fully-automatic method to extract the 3 D geometry (surface mesh) of the <b>vocal</b> <b>tract</b> by blending geometries of the relevant articulators has therefore been developed. This automatic extraction procedure is essential, since a method with manual intervention is not feasible for large numbers of simulations or for generation of dynamic sounds, such as diphthongs.
