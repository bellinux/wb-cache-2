He {{executed}} people who infringed his many rules, especially those who had smuggled in food, on the <b>inner</b> <b>square</b> of the ghetto {{in front of all}} inmates to frighten and to intimidate them. It was in Daugavpils that the liquidation of ghetto inmates started. From November 8 to 10 1941, 3,000 people were killed in Mežciems. The operation was headed by Obersturmbannführer (Lieutenant-Colonel) Günter Tabbert, who was then 25.|$|E
25|$|All {{excavated}} boards {{have the}} angular V-shaped marks {{at the corners}} and L-shaped marks {{at the center of}} the edges, as well as the central square and T-shaped protrusions, and most boards also have four marks (usually circular but sometimes a decorative pattern) between the corner mark and the central square. However, on some boards each circular mark is replaced by a straight line joining the corner mark to the corner of the <b>inner</b> <b>square,</b> and in a few cases there is no mark between the corner and the square at all.|$|E

5000|$|The tokens {{enter the}} board {{only after a}} Chamma or Ashta is thrown. Since each cowrie carry 2 points, 2 tokens for Chamma and 4 tokens for Ashta are entered on the board. The tokens travel {{anti-clockwise}} in outer <b>squares,</b> clockwise in <b>inner</b> <b>squares</b> and finally lands up in central square (home), with a throw of Ashta or Chamma. If a player’s token lands on a square occupied by opponent’s token, then the opponent’s token is [...] "killed" [...] and the player gets an extra turn to play. The killed token returns to its starting home square and has to go round all over again. In crossed boxes, killing is not possible. When a token reaches the square left of its home square, it further moves up into the <b>inner</b> <b>squares</b> and now moves in clockwise direction. However the tokens enter the <b>inner</b> <b>squares,</b> only when {{at least one of}} the opponent's tokens are killed. Otherwise they keep circling around until {{at least one of the}} tokens of opponent is killed by them. Every token need not kill an opponent. Each token finishes its race when it manages to get into the home. The first player to get all his tokens into home wins the game.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the number}} rolled, the player can move one (or more) of their pawns that many number of squares on the board. Each player has a fixed path to move pawns, which is in an {{anti-clockwise}} direction. The path for Player 1 is given in the example diagram. Each player's piece must completely traverse the outer squares before moving into the <b>inner</b> <b>squares.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{ruins of}} several of the {{missions}} still remain. They were laid out in a uniform plan. The buildings were grouped about a central square, the church and store-houses at one end, and the dwellings of the natives, in long barracks, forming the other three sides. Each family had its own separate apartment, but one veranda and one roof served for perhaps a hundred families. The churches were of stone or fine wood, with lofty towers, elaborate sculptures and richly adorned altars, with statuary imported from Italy and Spain. The priests' quarters, the commissary, the stables, the armory, the workshop, and the hospital, also usually of stone, formed an <b>inner</b> <b>square</b> adjoining the church. The plaza itself was a level grass plot kept cropped by sheep. The native houses were sometimes of stone but more often of adobe or cane, with home-made furniture and religious pictures often made by the natives themselves.|$|E

These ancients are very polite and will press you to play, but give no heed to them, for chaupur is an expensive game--expensive as quail-fighting, when you have backed the wrong bird and the people are laughing at your inexperience. The Maharaja's Palace is gay, overwhelmingly rich in candelabra, painted ceilings, gilt mirrors, and other evidences of a too hastily assimilated civilisation; but, if the evidence of the ear can be trusted, the old, old game of intrigue goes on as merrily as of yore. A figure in saffron came out of a dark arch into the sunlight, almost falling into the arms of one in pink. [...] "Where have you come from?"

The pink and saffron figures separated as though they had been shot, and disappeared into separate bolt-holes. It was a curious little incident, and might have meant a great deal or just nothing at all. It distracted the attention of the ancients bowed above the chaupur cloth.|$|E

5000|$|... 3. [...] "Double": It is {{possible}} for a player to have two of his pawns in the same square. This is called a [...] "double". If a player forms a double on the outer square, then it blocks the opponent's pawns behind him for one move; i.e. if an opponent's pawn crosses the double, then that move is voided and the opponent loses a turn. However, on the next turn for the same opponent, his pawn can go past (or [...] "cross") the double. This rule is applicable for every opponent of the player in the game.This rule is not valid once the double is formed on the <b>inner</b> <b>squares.</b> For the player forming the double, there are two choices on his subsequent moves. He can [...] "break" [...] the double by moving {{only one of the}} pawns in it, or keep the double and advance the pawns together. In case a player has got multiple turns (as he may have thrown 4s and 8s), he can treat the double as one pawn and make it move to one of the values on the dice.|$|R
40|$|Mobile Adhoc NETwork (MANET) is a multi hop {{wireless}} network {{which consists of}} mobile nodes that {{communicate with each other}} through wireless medium. Many researchers are proposed different solution to improve networks performance in terms of effective routing, transmission delay, throughput, Control overhead and stability. Existing research works are mainly focused for creating efficient collaboration between nodes of a network. In MANET, the mobility of nodes provides an opportunity to change network topology that increase control overhead of a network. Clustering mechanism is played crucial role in MANET to improve the networks performance. We proposed an Efficient Hierarchical Cluster based Routing scheme that uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique to form stable clusters. It used the various distance metrics like Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), Unweighted Pair Group Method using Centroids (UPGMC) Unweighted Pair Group Method using Centroids (WPGMC), Single linkage or Shortest distance, weighted pair group method with averaging (WPGMA) and <b>Inner</b> <b>squared</b> distance to form the efficient clusters that are close proximity.

At length they take up a more favourable position than the former one.
