40|$|In {{boys with}} {{constitutional}} delay {{of growth and}} puberty, adult <b>height</b> may be inconsistent with parental (target) <b>height.</b> We aimed at studying which period of growth was important to account for adult <b>height</b> being above or below target <b>height.</b> In this retrospective study, adult <b>height</b> measured after 20 years in 39 patients was compared with target <b>height</b> and <b>height</b> data obtained at about 6 and 12 {{years of age and}} at diagnosis of delayed puberty (mean 14. 6 years). Twenty-eight patients were untreated while 11 received testosterone enanthate (50 or 100 mg/month for 6 months). The growth data from both groups were pooled since they were not different. On average, the adult <b>height</b> standard deviation score (- 0. 6 +/- 0. 8, mean +/- SD) was similar to target <b>height</b> (- 0. 5 +/- 0. 6). There were, however, marked individual differences since adult <b>height</b> varied between 1. 7 SD (11 cm) below target <b>height</b> and 1. 4 SD (9. 5 cm) above target <b>height.</b> Multiple regression analysis showed that the most significant determinant of the difference between adult <b>height</b> and target <b>height</b> was <b>height</b> catch up during puberty (p < 0. 002). We conclude that the magnitude of <b>height</b> catch up during puberty is a significant determinant of adult <b>height</b> in boys with constitutional delay of growth and puberty. Thus, optimizing pubertal growth may be a relevant therapeutic aim for adult <b>height</b> in boys with short stature and delayed puberty. Copyrightz 1999 S. KargerAG,BaselPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Our study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} final <b>height</b> in {{a cohort of}} Dutch childhood cancer survivors (CCS) and assess possible determinants of final <b>height,</b> including <b>height</b> at diagnosis.

40|$|Background: A child's adult <b>height</b> is {{commonly}} predicted using their target <b>height,</b> based on mid-parent <b>height.</b> However, if no growth disorder is suspected, the child's current <b>height</b> {{is a far}} better predictor of their adult <b>height.</b> Aim: To develop a chart to predict a child's adult <b>height</b> from their current <b>height,</b> adjusting for regression to the mean. Subjects and methods: Data from the First Zurich Longitudinal Growth Study provided correlations between child <b>height</b> and adult <b>height</b> by age and sex, {{for use in a}} regression model predicting adult <b>height</b> centile from child <b>height</b> centile. The model was validated using data from the British 1946 and 1958 birth cohorts. Results: The chart is illustrated superimposed on the British 1990 boys <b>height</b> chart. The predicted <b>height</b> has a standard error of 4 – 5 cm for ages from 4 years to puberty in both sexes. The regression adjustment partially compensates for biased predictions in early and late developers in puberty. A simplified version of the chart for restricted age ranges is also shown, as used on the UK-WHO 0 – 4 years growth charts. Conclusion: The <b>height</b> prediction chart should be of value for parents, and indirectly professionals, to predict adult <b>height</b> in their children. </p...|$|R
