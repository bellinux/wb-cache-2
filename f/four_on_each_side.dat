5|$|The first {{match was}} {{played at the}} end of the Australian tour of England in 1884, and was held at Lord's in aid of the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society. Eight of the {{tourists}} took part; <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> The Non-Smokers batted first, and then forced their opponents to follow on, aided by a strong batting performance from George Bonnor. The Smokers, batting twice, only finished thirteen runs ahead, a total which was chased down without the need for the scheduled third day of the contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} in Merchants Street was {{designed}} {{so as to}} house eight shops, <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the main doorway. Each shop has another room above, reached by an individual spiral staircase, which space {{was intended as a}} home for the owners. These rooms above the shops have a window each, forming eight square windows on the façade, one above each entrance of a shop. The windows are decorated with the symbolic crescents of Pinto. At one point, the space of one of the shops was converted to become accessible from the main building to be used as offices for the Ministry for Health. On the same street, the first floor has the same number of windows however are larger and with conspicuous window frames.|$|E
25|$|After {{a limited}} {{production}} run of the original 2K22, an improved version designated 2K22M/2S6M entered service in 1990. The 2K22M featured several improvements with eight ready-to-fire missiles (<b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> as well as modifications to the fire control programs, missiles and the general reliability of the system.|$|E

25|$|The GTO {{underwent}} a few styling changes in 1967. The louver-covered tail lights were replaced with eight tail lights, <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> Rally II wheels with colored lug nuts were {{also available in}} 1967. The GTO emblems located on the rear part of the fenders were moved to the chrome rocker panels. Also the grill was changed from a purely split grill, to one that shared some chrome.|$|E
25|$|Eight private boxes, <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of {{the stage}} and each {{accommodating}} six people, rounded out the seating, the box seats furnishing the most elegant and expensive accommodations in the house. At the time the theatre opened in 1871, seating in the family circle cost fifty cents and the dress circle cost a dollar. In the lower auditorium, parquet seating, inconveniently close to the stage, cost seventy five cents while the parquet circle cost a dollar fifty. The box seats cost ten dollars.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{original}} plans, Mound City would have been protected by a casemate of iron 2.5inches (63mm) thick. The armor would have been pierced for 20 guns of various calibers and weights. Pook did not give specific instructions for {{the placement of the}} armor, however, so that problem had to be settled by Commander Rodgers. He insisted on greater thickness on the forward face of the casemate, and also that the pilot house, wheelhouse, and main deck be given some cover. In all, his modifications increased the weight of the armor to 122 tons, half again as much as Pook had intended. To compensate for the extra weight, the number of guns had to be reduced from 20 to only 13: three firing forward, <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> and two facing astern.|$|E

25|$|The Fahd 280-30 is an IFV {{variant of}} the Fahd, first {{announced}} in 1990. It features a BMP-2 turret {{on the roof of}} the passenger compartment near the rear. It has a 30 mm automatic cannon with a dual feed, one for HE rounds, the other for AP rounds, which can pierce 18mm armor at 60 degrees from a range of 1500m. It also has a coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun and an ATGM launcher, capable of launching AT-4 or AT-5 missiles which use SACLOS guidance, increasing the range at which the Fahd 280-30 can engage armored targets such as tanks to nearly 4000m. These turret-mounted missiles may be deployed away from the vehicle on a launching tripod. The Fahd-30 carries 500 30mm rounds for the autocannon, 2,000 rounds for the 7.62mm machine gun, and five AT-5 missiles. Smoke grenade launchers are standard on this vehicle, with <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the turret. The BMP-2 turret may use appliqué armor. In terms of design it is similar to the Fahd 240, but this variant has three firing ports on each side of the vehicle.|$|E

500|$|Cordelias main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two BL 6-inch (152mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline in the stern, with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun. Her secondary armament consisted of eight QF [...] Mk IV guns, <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> one pair forward of the bridge, another pair abaft it on the forecastle deck {{and the other two}} pairs one deck lower amidships. For anti-aircraft defence, she was fitted with one QF 6-pounder [...] Hotchkiss gun. The ship also mounted two twin, above-water, mounts for [...] torpedoes, one on each broadside. The Carolines were protected by a waterline belt amidships that ranged in thickness from [...] and a [...] deck. The walls of their conning tower were 6 inches thick.|$|E
500|$|Ark Royals {{armament}} {{was designed}} with anti-aircraft warfare in mind, as aircraft {{were expected to}} be the main threat; ships and submarines could be outrun or dealt with by escorts. Her main armament was sixteen quick-firing [...] dual purpose guns in eight double turrets, <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the hull, controlled by four Directors using the High Angle Control System. The original design placed the turrets low on the hull, but was later altered to locate them just below the flight deck, which increased each turret's field of fire. Six 8-barrelled 2-pounder (...) [...] "pom-pom" [...] guns were located on the flight deck, in front of and behind the superstructure island, while eight 4-barrelled [...] machine guns were installed on small projecting platforms to the front and rear of the flight deck.|$|E
500|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/4 {{carried the}} 2 cm FlaK 30 mount {{on a special}} {{platform}} with fold-down side and rear panels. This platform was specifically designed for the Flak 30 mount and could not readily accept a Flak 38 mount or vice versa. To accommodate the gun mount the vehicle was both wider and taller than normal, namely [...] wide and [...] and weighed [...] empty. Four folding seats were fitted on the platform for the crew. Some of these gun mounts had a gun shield fitted. The ready ammunition bins fastened {{to the side and}} rear panels (<b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> and two in the rear) contained one 20-round magazine each. It usually towed an ammunition trailer (Sd.Ah. 51 - Sonderanhängerspecial single-axle trailer) with 640 more rounds, the gun's sights and its rangefinder.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reconstruction}} {{was undertaken}} in 1878, which included installing arches with a 90 foot m span resting <b>on</b> <b>four</b> pillars <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the church. [...] A renovation and restoration {{was completed in}} 1938.|$|R

2500|$|A {{decision}} was made to replace the wooden font in 1845, apparently because the water caused a mildew odor, and possibly because the wood began to rot. The new limestone font followed the pattern of the wooden one. Twelve oxen held up the basin, <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> and two at each end. The oxen were solid stone and similarly were placed and appeared sunken into the floor. Where the oxen met the basin, the stone was carved to suggest drapery. [...] The ears of the oxen were made of tin. The stairs were moved to an East/West orientation making access to the font easier.|$|E
2500|$|The R44 was {{the first}} [...] car for the New York City Subway. The cars were {{introduced}} under {{the idea that a}} train of eight [...] cars would be more efficient than one of ten [...] cars. Despite the increase in length, the R44s had eight pairs of doors per car (<b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> like other B Division cars. As a result, eight [...] cars have only 64 (32 per side) pairs whereas ten cars have 80 (40 per side). The reduced number of doors on a train of eight 75-foot cars increased boarding and dwelling times, so recent car orders have returned to ten 60-foot (18.29 m) cars, starting with the R143.|$|E

2500|$|The most ominous of the Banquet plans was Banquet Light {{which would}} see the {{formation}} of striking forces composed of De Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes and other light aircraft of the Elementary Flight Training School. De Havilland put forward plans for converting the Tiger Moth into a bomber by equipping it with eight under-fuselage racks beneath the rear cockpit, each able to carry a [...] bomb. As an alternative, the bomb-racks could be installed <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> beneath the lower wings, which would avoid trimming difficulties. The racks had been designed for the military version of the Dragons supplied to Iraq eight years previously. Trials were conducted at Hatfield by Major Hereward de Havilland and at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down, and the machines earned a perfectly satisfactory report. Tests were also carried out with a Tiger Moth carrying a single [...] bomb. Modification of the {{relatively small number of}} Magister trainers were also attempted, but this proved troublesome, therefore Banquet Light mostly used Tiger Moths.|$|E
2500|$|The {{memorial}} {{consists of}} nine floors. The first (or [...] "ground") floor appears, from the outside, {{to be part}} of the foundation. In the center of the first floor is the Grand Masonic Hall. The Grand Masonic Hall features eight large green granite columns, <b>four</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the hall. The Grand Masonic Hall is [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. The 12 dioramas commissioned in the mid-1960s are located in this hall. At the western end of the hall are short steps which lead up to an alcove in which a bronze bust of George Washington was placed in 2008. The semicircular alcove surrounding the bust contains murals depicting Masonic events in the life of Washington. For many years, the Great Seal of the United States donated by President Truman to the memorial in 1948 was displayed in this hall, but it was removed in the late 1990s. Large, medium, and small meeting rooms are on the north and south sides of the Grand Masonic Hall. All three rooms on the north side contain exhibits which document the history and activities of the Shriners. Many of the models in these rooms depict Shriner charities, and one model is a miniature mechanical version of a Shriners' parade. The medium-sized room on the memorial's southwest corner contains an exhibit about Freemasonry in general. The medium-sized meeting room (the George Washington Room) and large-sized meeting room (the Andrew Jackson Room) on the south side are generally closed to the public but can be rented as meeting space.|$|E
