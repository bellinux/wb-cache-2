As part of the tour, Holley performed to over 4 million people, including Diana, Princess of Wales and Charles, Prince of Wales. The Bad World Tour concluded several months later in January 1989.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 the 65th Infantry {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} training program and in 1943, it {{was sent to}} Panama to protect the Pacific and the Atlantic sides of the isthmus. On 25 November 1943, Colonel Antulio Segarra, succeeded Col. John R. Menclenhall as commander of the 65th Infantry, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican Regular Army officer to command a Regular Army regiment. In January 1944, the regiment was embarked <b>for</b> <b>Jackson</b> Barracks in New Orleans and later sent to Fort Eustis in Newport News, Virginia in preparation for overseas deployment to North Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 {{he led the}} Major Leagues {{in games}} pitched, with 81, while also leading the Majors in holds, with 33. The 1994 MLB season was Shortened to 115 games for the Giants; however, over 36 games pitched, Jackson led National League {{relievers}} in ERA (1.49), opponents average (.164), and hits per 9.0 innings pitched (4.9) while finishing second in strikeouts per 9.0 innings pitched (10.84). The already shortened season was again shortened <b>for</b> <b>Jackson</b> due to tendinitis in his right elbow. This led to two stints on the disabled list: one from June 17 until July 2, and another from July 6 {{until the end of}} the season. On October 17, 1994, Jackson was granted free agency.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's next {{fight was}} {{not against the}} new UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, Rashad Evans, as the pre-fight reports suggested. UFC President Dana White {{indicated}} that the original plan was <b>for</b> <b>Jackson</b> to receive an immediate title shot, but Evans requested time off to recover from injuries he sustained from his fight against Forrest Griffin. Instead, Jackson faced Keith Jardine at UFC 96, and was victorious by unanimous decision. He was then scheduled to face Rashad Evans at UFC 98, but it was later revealed on March 11, 2009 that Jackson needed surgery to repair torn ligaments in his jaw, effectively cancelling the bout against Evans.|$|E

5|$|Despite Lyoto Machida's {{knockout}} of Thiago Silva, Dana White {{indicated that}} he was not the number one contender for a title shot. Instead, a scheduled fight between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Quinton Jackson and Keith Jardine would determine Machida's title fate. A victory <b>for</b> <b>Jackson</b> would earn him a fight with champion Rashad Evans, but a win for Jardine would mean Machida will be awarded with a title shot. Jackson won the fight via unanimous decision, but torn ligaments in his jaw forced the former champion out of the bout. Instead, Machida will challenge Evans for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 98. Jackson will retain his title shot against the winner of that match upon returning from injury. Following the loss to Machida, Thiago Silva was scheduled to return to action against former champion Forrest Griffin at UFC 101, but his opponent was later changed to Keith Jardine.|$|E
5|$|Fort Jackson was an American Civil War-era {{fortification}} in Virginia that {{defended the}} southern end of the Long Bridge, near Washington, D.C. Long Bridge connected Washington, D.C. to Northern Virginia and served as a vital transportation artery for the Union Army during the war. Fort Jackson was named <b>for</b> <b>Jackson</b> City, a seedy suburb of Washington that had been established on the south side of the Long Bridge in 1835. It was built in the days immediately following the Union Army's occupation of Northern Virginia in May 1861. The fort was initially armed with four cannon used to protect the bridge, but these were removed after the completion of the Arlington Line, a line of defenses built to the south. After 1862, the fort lacked weapons except for small arms and consisted of a wooden palisade backed by earthworks. Two cannon were restored to the fort in 1864 following the Battle of Fort Stevens. The garrison consisted of a single company of Union soldiers who inspected traffic crossing the bridge and guarded it from potential saboteurs.|$|E
5|$|Outer rainbands began {{affecting}} coastal {{sections of}} the Florida Panhandle by about 12hours prior {{to the formation of}} the depression. Coinciding with the first advisory on the depression, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola, Florida, westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Shortly thereafter, an inland tropical storm warning was issued for Pearl River, Walthall, and Pike counties in Mississippi and Washington Parish in Louisiana. Additionally, the New Orleans National Weather Service issued a coastal flood watch for four parishes in southeastern Louisiana. In Mississippi, Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state of emergency}}. Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents in shallow areas and in mobile homes <b>for</b> <b>Jackson,</b> Harrison, and Hancock counties. Officials in New Orleans opened three emergency shelters, citing the potential need of shelter for citizens in about 17,000FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina. Due to the threat of the cyclone, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco declared a state of emergency and placed the state's National Guard and other disaster services on reserve.|$|E

5|$|President James Monroe's {{first choice}} for Secretary of War was Henry Clay, who {{declined}} the office. When Johnson also declined to serve, the post ultimately went to John C. Calhoun. The {{result was that}} Johnson became chair of the Committee on Expenditures where he wielded considerable influence over defense policy in the Department of War during the Fifteenth Congress. In 1817, Congress investigated General Andrew Jackson's execution of two British subjects during the First Seminole War. Johnson chaired the inquiry committee. The majority of the committee favored a negative report and a censure <b>for</b> <b>Jackson.</b> Johnson, a Jackson supporter, drafted a counter report that was more favorable to Jackson and opposed the censure. The ensuing debate pitted Johnson against fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay. Johnson's report prevailed, and Jackson was spared censure. This disagreement between Johnson and Clay, however, {{marked the beginning of}} a political separation between the two that lasted for the duration of their careers.|$|E
5|$|The Justice Department {{filed the}} charges on February 15, 2013, and Jackson pleaded guilty on February 20, 2013 to {{one count of}} wire and mail fraud in {{connection}} with his misuse of $750,000 of campaign funds. On June 7, 2013, federal prosecutors indicated that they sought a four-year prison sentence <b>for</b> <b>Jackson.</b> On August 14, 2013, Jackson was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison, while wife Sandi was sentenced to 12 months in prison for filing false tax returns in attempt to conceal the crimes. The two sentences did not run concurrently. Rather, Jackson initially served prison time and upon his release, his wife was to begin her prison sentence shortly thereafter. The staggered sentences allowed for the Jackson children {{to have access to}} at least one parent during the time each is in prison.|$|E
5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} <b>for</b> <b>Jackson,</b> {{who spent}} several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E

25|$|Jackson's role on ABC's college {{football}} coverage occasionally interfered with his postseason baseball commitments. For instance, he was unavailable to call Game 1 of the 1976 ALCS {{because he had}} just finished calling an Oklahoma-Texas {{college football}} game for ABC. Thus, Bob Uecker filled-in <b>for</b> <b>Jackson</b> for Game 1. In 1978, Jackson called another Oklahoma-Texas football game for ABC on the afternoon October 7, then flew to New York, arriving {{just in time to}} call Game 4 of the ALCS that same night. On October 11, 1980, Jackson once again called an Oklahoma-Texas football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS.
