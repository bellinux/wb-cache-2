40|$|Abstract: An {{extension}} of equal sampling technique (EST) based {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) is presented for the single-phase inverter to reduce lower order harmonics caused by the fluctuating dc input. In the <b>EST,</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been proposed earlier for constant dc, the width of PWM pulses is determined by making {{the area of the}} PWM signal equal to the area under the sampled reference waveform. The concept of equal area criterion equally applicable for fluctuating dc input with required modifications of the governing equations. Simulation results show that EST is triumphant in reducing lower order harmonics. Potential applications of the proposed technique are in fixed and variable frequency inverters for power supplies and ac motor drives which experience voltage ripple in the dc-link either when fed from a weak ac system or when insufficient filtering is employed...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{infection is}} one of the major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV encodes an oncogenic hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), which can transactivate host cell transcriptional machinery and mediate cellular transformation. To disclose the early genetic response in HBx-mediated transformation process, we constructed a conditional HBx-expressing hepatocyte cell line, which allows us to compare the gene expression profiles under controllable HBx induction. A cDNA microarray containing more than 8700 mouse genes and ESTs was utilized to examine the gene expression profiles. We identified 260 candidate genes and 259 <b>ESTs</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> shown aberrant expression under HBx induction. Most of them are involved in signal transduction pathway, cell cycle control, metastasis, transcriptional regulation, immune response, and metabolism. These results provide additional insight into early cellular targets of HBx, which could give us a better understanding of the function of HBx and their progressive changes during HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, the interaction between lily and F. oxysporum is still poorly understood. In order to identify of genes differentially expressed in a resistant reaction to F. oxysporum in L. regale, a rare lily genetic resource with high resistance to F. oxysporum, a cDNA library of L. regale root infected by F. oxysporum was constructed using the method of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). In total, 585 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained after sequence analysis of 1101 clones, and homology analysis showed that 342 unique sequences were assigned to no significant homology. On the base of function classification established in model plant, the functional categories of the 243 <b>ESTs</b> <b>which</b> <b>had</b> significant homology with known proteins were assigned, and they were classified into 14 putative cellular functions.

Many organizations have developed review systems with guidelines for judging the quality of studies and identifying ESTs.

In this study, we used the criteria developed by Horner and colleagues (2005), Gersten and colleagues (2005), and the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC, 2008; Kratochwill et al., 2010) to evaluate the research base on repeated reading. The corpus of literature reviewed was derived from previous narrative literature reviews and meta-analyses that concluded that repeated reading was an effective intervention for improving reading fluency. However, the review systems employed in this study resulted in the conclusion that repeated reading did not have enough high quality research support to be considered an EST. The current reviews relied on strict criteria for the quality of each individual study, whereas the previous reviews and meta-analyses included studies with a wider range of quality. These results demonstrate that systematic reviews that strictly appraise the quality of studies and reject those not meeting standards can be substantially more conservative than other scientific review methods.

40|$|An {{explosion}} of genomic data {{in recent years}} has necessitated the novel application of old algorithms and the development of new algorithms in order to process and understand this information. One specific type of data {{comes in the form of}} expressed sequence tags (<b>ESTs)</b> <b>which</b> <b>have</b> significant biological importance. They do, however, require a lot of work in the dry lab once they have been created in a wet lab before anything meaningful can be made of the data. ESTs are short fragments of genomic data that represent the active genes in a sequenced sample. The sequencing process is complex and involves the copying, magnification and then splitting up of long complete sequences. The splitting of each copy is random and by looking for overlaps on the shorter sequences we can then begin to re-assemble the original long sequence. The process of finding the overlaps is called clustering and in theory it groups all the ESTs from a single gene together (where data sets in general contain ESTs from many different genes). Two new heuristics have been developed in this research that aim to speed up the time taken to do the clustering, which is traditionally an all-against-all comparison (and thus quadratic time complexity). The first heuristic uses a sorted word list of all the words in all the sequences to rapidly identify matching pairs of sequences. Further, the standard deviation between the relative position where words occur in the matching sequences is used to determine the quality of the matches – if a pair of sequences has sufficiently many words in common, and the variation in relative positions of those words is sufficiently low it is then tested by the second heuristic. The second heuristic uses a distance measure called d 1 which identifies pairs of matching sequences in a very similar way to the d 2 distance measure. d 2 is an accepted distance calculation for calculating the relatedness of ESTs, but d 1 is used as a comparison as it runs in linear time and rules out many of the potential matches from the first heuristic that would also be ruled out by the final d 2 comparison. The results show that with careful selection of clustering parameters a significant speed-up can be made over various competing clustering techniques with little significant impact on clustering quality...|$|R
