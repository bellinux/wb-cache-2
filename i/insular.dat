5|$|<b>Insular</b> art, or Hiberno-Saxon art, is {{the name}} given to the common style {{produced}} in Scotland, Britain and Anglo-Saxon England from the 7th century, with the combining of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon forms. Surviving examples of <b>Insular</b> art are found in metalwork, carving, but mainly in illuminated manuscripts. Surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession. The best examples include the Book of Kells, Lindisfarne Gospels, Book of Durrow. Carpet pages are a characteristic feature of <b>Insular</b> manuscripts, although historiated initials (an <b>Insular</b> invention), canon tables and figurative miniatures, especially Evangelist portraits, are also common. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late 8th century. The influence of <b>Insular</b> art affected all subsequent European Medieval art, especially in the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Thrinax is a genus of fan palms. Three of {{the four}} species of are endemic to the <b>insular</b> Caribbean, while the fourth occurs in the <b>insular</b> Caribbean and in Florida, Mexico and Central America. Three species are single-island {{endemics}} - two to Jamaica and one to Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Anglesey {{in modern}} Wales {{may also have}} been part of the <b>insular</b> Viking world from an early stage.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, {{due in part}} to his {{knowledge}} of the conditions in the Philippines, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and named Chief of the Division of Customs and <b>Insular</b> Affairs in the War Department. By 1902 he was promoted to colonel and named the first chief of the new Bureau of <b>Insular</b> Affairs. He retained this office until 1912, by which time he had risen to the rank of brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} {{the text of}} the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the <b>insular</b> Gospels, there {{does not seem to be}} a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various <b>insular</b> texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.|$|E
5|$|The {{illustrations}} and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that {{of other}} <b>Insular</b> Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of <b>Insular</b> art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reconversion}} of Scandinavian Scotland in {{the tenth}} century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant {{religion of the}} kingdom. The process of Christianisation was also significant {{in the development of}} Scottish national identity, the Hiberno-Scottish mission to Continental Europe, the development of <b>Insular</b> art, and the introduction of Latin and formal education.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith's reign is {{considered}} the beginning of Northumbria's Golden Age, which lasted {{until the end of}} the 8th century. The period saw the flowering of <b>Insular</b> art in Northumbria and produced the Lindisfarne Gospels, perhaps begun in Aldfrith's time, the scholarship of Bede, and the beginnings of the Anglo-Saxon missions to the continent.|$|E
5|$|Desmoncus is a genus of spiny, scrambling, pinnate-leaved palms {{which range}} from Mexico in the north to Bolivia and Brazil in the south. Ten of the twelve species in have solely {{continental}} distributions. Two species are found on both the mainland and in the <b>insular</b> Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia the {{continental}} area (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) generally practices Theravada Buddhism. Most of <b>insular</b> Southeast Asia (namely Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia) practices mostly Sunni Islam. The {{rest of the}} <b>insular</b> region (Philippines and East Timor) practices mostly Roman Catholic Christianity and Singapore practises mostly Mahayana Buddhism. Significant long-distance labor migration {{that occurred during the}} late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity. Relations between the indigenous population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group. During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities {{and there has been a}} significant amount of unity throughout history. This differs from both nearby East and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|Major General Clarence Ransom Edwards (January 1, 1859 – February 14, 1931) was {{a senior}} United States Army officer, known as the first Chief of the Bureau of <b>Insular</b> Affairs, and {{commander}} of the 26th Division in World War I.|$|E
5|$|Mauritia is a genus of fan palms {{which is}} native to {{northern}} South America. One species has a wide distribution which extends into the <b>insular</b> Caribbean, while the other M. carana is restricted to the Amazon region.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>insular</b> territories grant {{official}} {{recognition to}} their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are {{recognized by the}} Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.|$|E
5|$|Silvertip {{sharks are}} found over {{continental}} and <b>insular</b> shelves {{at a depth}} of , occupying all levels of the water column. They are most common around isolated islands, coral banks, and reef drop-offs. Juveniles frequent coastal shallows or lagoons, while adults occur in deeper water, with little overlap between the two age groups.|$|E
5|$|The Norn {{language}} formerly {{spoken in}} the islands, {{a descendant of}} the Old Norse of the Vikings, became extinct in the 18th or 19th century. The local dialects of the Scots language, collectively known as <b>Insular</b> Scots, are highly distinctive and retain strong Norn influences.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} which has survived about Óengus compared with other Pictish kings, the nature and geographical range of his activities {{and the length of}} his reign combine to make King Óengus {{one of the most significant}} rulers of the <b>insular</b> Dark Ages.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{included}} in the monument {{are all part of}} the State of Hawaii, except Midway Atoll, which is part of The United States Minor Outlying Islands <b>insular</b> area. Henderson Field, on Midway Atoll, provides aerial access to the monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of <b>Insular</b> art. The <b>Insular</b> majuscule script of the text itself {{appears to be the}} work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived {{from a wide range of}} substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} the Gospels is further {{emphasised}} by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the {{unity of the}} Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an <b>Insular</b> spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with <b>Insular</b> ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to <b>Insular</b> manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively <b>insular.</b> As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E
5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei was much smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of <b>insular</b> dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in <b>Insular</b> Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the newly}} {{restored}} Byzantine Empire, {{under the leadership}} of Michael VIII Palaiologos, sought to recover Euboea, which was the major Latin <b>insular</b> possession in the Aegean Sea and a base for piratical activity directed against his lands. Furthermore, along with the Principality of Achaea it presented the major obstacle to his complete recovery of Greece. Already in 1269/1270, a Byzantine fleet under Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos had attacked and captured many Latin nobles, the town of Oreos.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of <b>insular</b> metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major <b>insular</b> manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E
5|$|Coccothrinax is a genus of fan palms found {{throughout}} the Caribbean and in adjacent parts of southern Florida and Mexico. Most species are small to medium-sized, with maximum heights between 5 and 15 metres (17 and 49ft). Only one of the 53 species, C. readii, is absent from the <b>insular</b> Caribbean. Two species, C. argentata and C. barbadensis, are widespread, {{while most of the}} others are restricted to Cuba and Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries {{the art of}} the Picts is {{primarily}} known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality. After the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, elements of Pictish art became incorporated into the style known as <b>Insular</b> art, which was common over Britain and Ireland and became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of Romanesque styles.|$|E
5|$|Heterodox economists {{adhere to}} {{theories}} sufficiently {{outside the mainstream}} to be marginalized and treated as irrelevant by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created <b>insular</b> groups in the late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals rather {{than those of the}} mainstream and eschew formal modeling in favor of more abstract theoretical work.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Taft ruled for a {{unanimous}} court in Balzac v. Porto Rico. One of the <b>Insular</b> Cases, Balzac involved a Puerto Rico newspaper publisher who was prosecuted for libel but denied a jury trial, a Sixth Amendment {{protection under the}} constitution. Taft held that as Puerto Rico was not a territory designated for statehood, only such constitutional protections as Congress decreed would apply to its residents.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov suggested {{it was due to}} an epidemic, it was difficult to ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the <b>insular</b> nature of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Insular</b> art is {{the name}} given to the common style that {{developed}} in Britain and Ireland after {{the conversion of the}} Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate penannular brooches, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved high crosses found most frequently in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created on Iona, the key location in Scotland for <b>insular</b> art. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life by Viking raids in the late eighth century. Later elaborate metal work has survived in buried hoards such as the St Ninian's Isle Treasure and several finds from the Viking period.|$|E
5|$|Jersey milk {{being very}} rich, cream and butter {{have played a}} large part in <b>insular</b> cooking. (See Channel Island milk) However, there is no {{indigenous}} tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey fudge, mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Concord, Pierce {{resumed his}} law work; in one notable case he defended the {{religious}} liberty of the Shakers, the <b>insular</b> sect {{who were being}} threatened with legal action over accusations of child abuse. His role as a party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was stridently anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.|$|E
5|$|Roystonea is a genus of pinnate-leaved palms {{which range}} from south Florida and Mexico south to Venezuela. Seven species are endemic to the Greater Antilles and the Virgin Islands - four of these are Cuban endemics. The only species which is absent from the <b>insular</b> Caribbean, R. dunlapiana, is found on the Caribbean coast of Mexico, Honduras and Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Scottish monasticism {{also played}} a major part in the Hiberno-Scottish mission, by which Scottish and Irish clergy {{undertook}} missions to the expanding Frankish Empire. They founded monasteries, often called Schottenklöster (meaning Gaelic monasteries in German), most of which became Benedictine establishments {{in what is now}} Germany. Scottish monks, such as St. Cathróe of Metz, became local saints in the region. After the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles a common artistic style emerged in Britain and Ireland known as <b>Insular</b> art. Surviving examples are found in metalwork, carving, but mainly in illuminated manuscripts with highly decorated with intricate patterning, like the Book of Kells, which may have been wholly or partly created in Iona. <b>Insular</b> art became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. The establishment of Christianity brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small educated elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae minor) is an extinct {{subspecies}} of emu {{that was}} endemic to King Island, which {{is situated in}} the Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Its closest relative may be the extinct Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis), as they belonged to a single population until less than 14,000 years ago, when Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island emu may {{be an example of}} <b>insular</b> dwarfism.|$|E
