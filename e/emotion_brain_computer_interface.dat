In this research, {{the main focus of}} this thesis isanalysingbrain wavesthat associated with the internal emotion of human. The analysing processis achieved by reading the EEG signals from user brain. NIA deviceis used in this research to read the signals from the frontal lobe of the brain. This sturdy base on reading brain wave signals in order to be representedas an avatar facial expression. The aim of this research is to show the influence of alpha and beta <b>brain</b> waves toward <b>emotion</b> classification through EEG signal. In addition,the researchis analysing brain signals in order to represent happy and sad emotions. The classification of human <b>emotion</b> through <b>brain</b> <b>computer</b> <b>interface</b> can be interpreted through speed of brain waves signal. The velocity is used to calculate the speed of brain signals for each emotion. The results provedthat the velocity of sad emotion is faster than happy emotion. As a conclusion, this research shows the speed for each emotion which can be used to specify the internal emotion characteristic of a user. User emotion is represented as a facial expression of virtual human in 3 D environment. These results can be used to create a good classification because it specifies the average of speed for each emotion...|$|R

An challenging area in <b>Brain</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interface</b> research is the classification of EEG signals using the raw signals captured which has to undergo some preprocessing, so that the right attributes for classification are obtained.

40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interface</b> (BCI) is an {{interfacing}} {{device that}} interacts with external device or computer. The principle of <b>Brain</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>interface</b> {{is based on}} Electroencephalography. Under the influence of external stimuli, human brain generates some responses on distinctive areas of the brain. These responses appear in the EEG signals captured from corresponding electrode positions on the scalp of the human subject. The responses appear in the EEG signal as a feature in the time domain, or a feature in the frequency domain depending upon the periodic nature of the stimuli. These features are then detected classified and then control signal is generated by an external device. This enables the subject to directly control an external device from the brain using the signals generated in response to stimulation. Brain-computer Interfcae has shown promising application to aid patients with Locked-in syndrome, Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), Lock-down Syndrome and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Until now, these patients needed human assistance to communicate. Brain-computer interface also has promising application for wheelchair control. Where these patients {{would be able to}} control electric wheelchairs using <b>Brain</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>interface.</b> In this work, a working model of <b>Brain</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interface</b> has been developed using PowerLab 16 / 35 and ML- 138 bio-amplifier. The BCI is based on Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP). SSVEP response is generated from the visual cortex of the subject when the subject is exposed to a flickering light source.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, the <b>Brain</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interface</b> {{community}} {{has focused on}} evaluating accuracy of a <b>Brain</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interface</b> (BCI) system in some daily life applications, without {{considering the importance of}} the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) [1]. In many cases {{this is due to the}} hard work that is necessary to create a stable Real Time system starting from scratch. In order to use the BCI for real world application and not only for research, the availability of HCI features becomes critical. This work aimed at providing a set of tools for the development of <b>Brain</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>Interfaces</b> based on different kinds of acquisition and devices processing which could be used by both the end-user in their domestics activities (eg.
