Moreover, specific [PSI+] strains are preferentially formed in these mutants, demonstrating the importance of genetic makeup in determining de novo appearance of prion strains. Although these hsf 1 mutants preferentially support the formation of certain [PSI+] strains, they are capable of receiving and faithfully propagating nonpreferable strains, suggesting that prion initiation and propagation are distinct processes requiring different cellular components.

A proposed mechanism for paternal transmission of environmental information is via the sperm epigenome. The epigenome includes heritable information such as DNA methylation. We hypothesize that the dietary supply of methyl donors will alter epigenetic reprogramming in sperm. Here we feed male mice either a folate-deficient or folate-sufficient diet throughout life. Paternal folate deficiency is associated with increased birth defects in the offspring, which include craniofacial and musculoskeletal malformations. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and the subsequent functional analysis identify differential methylation in sperm of genes implicated in development, chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, autism and schizophrenia.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Familial {{transmission}} {{of mental illness}} is common. Recent studies in behavioral neuroscience and biological psychiatry reveal the importance of <b>epigenetic</b> mechanisms of <b>transmission</b> that center on the developmental consequences of variations in parental care. Studies with rats suggest that environmental adversity results in patterns of parent–offspring interactions that increase stress reactivity through sustained effects on gene expression in brain regions known to regulate behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic responses to stress. While such effects might be adaptive, the associated cost involves an increased risk for stress-related illness. KEYWORDS—maternal care; stress responses; epigenesis; stress hormones; individual differences To explain the relation between family function and health in adulthood, researchers have proposed stress-diathesis models (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002). These models suggest that a decreased quality of parental care alters the development of neural and endocrine systems, increasing the magnitude of emotional, autonomic, and endocrine responses to stress (collectively referred to here as defensive responses) and thus predisposing individuals to illness. The term diathesis refers to the interaction between development—including the potential influence of genetic variations—and the prevailing level of stress experienced by an individual in predicting health outcomes. Such models have considerable appeal, and could identify both the origins of illness {{and the nature of}} underlying vulnerabilities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> inheritance, the <b>transmission</b> of gene {{expression}} states from parent to daughter cells, often involves methylation of DNA. In eukaryotes, cytosine methylation {{is a frequent}} component of epigenetic mechanisms. Failure to transmit faithfully a methylated or an unmethylated state of cytosine can lead to altered phenotypes in plants and animals. A central unresolved question in epigenetics concerns the mechanisms by which a locus maintains, or changes, its state of cytosine methylation. We developed “hairpin-bisulfite PCR” to analyze these mechanisms. This method reveals the extent of methylation symmetry between the complementary strands of individual DNA molecules. Using hairpin-bisulfite PCR, we determined the fidelity of methylation transmission in the CpG island of the FMR 1 gene in human lymphocytes. For the hypermethylated CpG island of this gene, characteristic of inactive-X alleles, we estimate a maintenance methylation efficiency of ≈ 0. 96 per site per cell division. For de novo methylation efficiency (Ed), remarkably different estimates were obtained for the hypermethylated CpG island (Ed = 0. 17), compared with the hypomethylated island on the active-X chromosome (Ed < 0. 01). These results clarify the mechanisms by which the alternative hypomethylated and hypermethylated states of CpG islands are stably maintained through many cell divisions. We also analyzed a region of human L 1 transposable elements. These L 1 data provide accurate methylation patterns for the complementary strand of each repeat sequence analyzed. Hairpin-bisulfite PCR will be a powerful tool in studying other processes for which genetic or epigenetic information differs on the two complementary strands of DNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of stress responses {{has been a}} focus of plant research, breeding and biotechnology for a long time. Insight into stress perception, signaling and genetic determinants of resistance has recently been complemented by growing evidence for substantial stress-induced changes at the chromatin level. These affect specific sequences or occur genome-wide and are often correlated with transcriptional regulation. The majority of these changes only occur during stress exposure, and both expression and chromatin states typically revert to the pre-stress state shortly thereafter. Other changes result in the maintenance of new chromatin states and modified gene expression for a longer time after stress exposure, preparing an individual for developmental decisions or more effective defence. Beyond this, there are claims for stress-induced heritable chromatin modifications that are transmitted to progeny, thereby improving their characteristics. These effects resemble the concept of Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characters and represent {{a challenge to the}} uniqueness of DNA sequencebased inheritance. However, with the growing insight into <b>epigenetic</b> regulation and <b>transmission</b> of chromatin states, it is worth investigating these phenomena carefully. While genetic changes (mainly transposon mobility) in response to stress-induced interference with chromatin are well documented and heritable, in our view there is no unambiguous evidence for transmission of exclusively chromatin-controlled stress effects to progeny. We propose a set of criteria that should be applied to substantiate the data for stressinduced, chromatin-encoded new traits. Well-controlled stress treatments, thorough phenotyping and application of refined genome-wide epigenetic analysis tools should be helpful in moving from interesting observations towards robust evidence...|$|R

Although there has been a recent focus on the role of environmentally induced changes in the male germline in producing these effects, the potential mediating role of mothers has not been investigated. A role for mothers in the transmission of paternal effects has been well acknowledged in behavioral ecology, which predicts that females will dynamically adjust their reproductive investment in response to the qualities of their mate. In the current thesis offspring development was examined in response two contrasting paternal experiences. Both chronic food restriction (FR) and social enrichment induce changes in mate maternal investment. Significantly, measures of anxiety in social enriched and isolated males are correlated with mate maternal behavior. In the case of paternal FR, increases in pre- and postnatal maternal investment were observed in mates, an effect that appeared to be driven by female discrimination of FR versus control-fed (CF) males. Further, the detrimental effects of paternal FR on offspring development were only observed when offspring were sired through embryo transfer (i. e., females mated with CF but received embryo from FR father), suggesting that females may adjust reproductive investment in response to life-histories of their mate. The studies presented within this thesis describe how paternal experience can influence mate maternal investment in laboratory studies and how these paternally-induced maternal effects can be experimentally dissociated from experience-dependent germline changes to reveal the unique contributions of each parent upon offspring development.

Phenotypic and genetic analysis have shown that TSE exhibits variegation in ovaries, displays a maternal effect as well as <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission</b> through meiosis and involves heterochromatin (including HP 1) and RNA silencing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we show that mutations in squash and zucchini, which are involved in the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) silencing pathway, strongly affect TSE.

CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, our results indicate that the TSE represents a bona fide piRNA-based repression.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} that disease risk {{can be transmitted}} across generations, {{without the need for}} a direct exposure of the child to the index environmental insult, has sparked interest in transgenerational inheritance. Epigenetic describes processes that modify gene expression without a change in the nucleotide sequence. Epigenetic processes can be induced in response to environmental exposures and can influence disease risk, and may explain these multigenerational effects. In experimental models, a number of epigenetic mechanisms have been identified that could mediate vertical transmission of epigenetic inheritance. However, relevance of these findings to human disease is not yet clear. An alternative model is where transgenerational inheritance of disease risk requires the presence of exposure-related diseases in the mother during pregnancy (termed ‘induced <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission</b> model’). A number of cross-sectional studies have investigated multigenerational effects in allergy and asthma. However, given early life origins of asthma and allergy, birth cohort studies are ideal to investigate the impact of genetic predisposition, epigenetics, and environmental exposures avoiding pitfalls such as recall bias and confounding by ongoing exposures, disease and treatment. The well characterized, three generations of the Isle of Wight cohort includes two consecutive birth cohorts, providing longitudinal data that can be studied for epigenetic transfer of information, e. g., the effect of grand parental smoking or exposure to other toxic compounds.

40|$|The {{study of}} P-element {{repression}} in Drosophila melanogaster {{led to the}} discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a repression mechanism by which a transposon or a transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequence or TAS) has the capacity to repress in trans in the female germline, a homologous transposon, or transgene located in euchromatin. TSE shows variegation among egg chambers in ovaries when silencing is incomplete. Here, we report that TSE displays an <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission</b> through meiosis, which involves an extrachromosomal maternally transmitted factor. We show that this silencing is highly sensitive to mutations affecting both heterochromatin formation (Su(var) 205 encoding Heterochromatin Protein 1 and Su(var) 3 - 7) and the repeat-associated small interfering RNA (or rasiRNA) silencing pathway (aubergine, homeless, armitage, and piwi). In contrast, TSE is not sensitive to mutations affecting r 2 d 2, which is involved in the small interfering RNA (or siRNA) silencing pathway, nor is it sensitive to a mutation in loquacious, which is involved in the micro RNA (or miRNA) silencing pathway. These results, taken together with the recent discovery of TAS homologous small RNAs associated to PIWI proteins, support the proposition that TSE involves a repeat-associated small interfering RNA pathway linked to heterochromatin formation, which was co-opted by the P element to establish repression of its own transposition after its recent invasion of the D. melanogaster genome.

40|$|A central {{player in}} the {{initiation}} of X-chromosome in-activation (XCI) is the long, noncoding Xist RNA (X in-active–specific transcript), which is produced only from the inactive X chromosome. Xist expression during early embryogenesis is both necessary (Marahrens et al. 1997, 1998) and sufficient (Wutz and Jaenisch 2000) for silenc-ing to take place. A complex regulatory network ensures that Xist is up-regulated at a very precise stage of early development, exclusively in female cells, and only {{from one of the}} two X chromosomes (for review, see Nora and Heard 2009). Its ability to repress transcription strictly in cis has been linked to its unusual capacity to coat the chro-mosome from which it is produced (Fig. 1). Once Xist has been up-regulated during early development or during dif-ferentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), it continues to be expressed from the inactive X even in fully differentiated somatic cells. Nevertheless, it is actually dis-pensable for the maintenance of transcriptional repression (Wutz and Jaenisch 2000; Csankovszki et al. 2001), prob-ably because Xist expression initiates an ordered series of changes in chromatin structure and chromosomal higher-order organization (Figs. 2 and 3), which together act in synergy to ensure <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission</b> of the inactive state. The mechanism by which transcriptional silencing is established by Xist RNA remains an important open question, however. The goal of this chapter is to review what is known regarding the changes in nuclear organiza-tion and chromatin structure mediated by Xist RNA and to discuss their links with the initiation or maintenance of transcriptional repression...|$|E
40|$|Prions are protein-based {{infectious}} entities {{associated with}} fatal brain diseases in animals, but also modify {{a range of}} host-cell phenotypes in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Many questions remain about the evolution and biology of prions. Although several functionally distinct prion-forming proteins exist in S. cerevisiae, [HET-s] of Podospora anserina is the only other known fungal prion. Here we investigated prion-like, protein-based <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission</b> in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that S. pombe cells can support the formation and maintenance of the prion form of the S. cerevisiae Sup 35 translation factor [PSI+], and that the formation and propagation of these Sup 35 aggregates is inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride, indicating commonalities in prion propagation machineries in these evolutionary diverged yeasts. A proteome-wide screen identified the Ctr 4 copper transporter subunit as a putative prion with a predicted prion-like domain. Overexpression of the ctr 4 gene resulted in large Ctr 4 protein aggregates that were both detergent and proteinase-K resistant. Cells carrying such [CTR+] aggregates showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and this phenotype could be transmitted to aggregate-free [ctr–] cells by transformation with [CTR+] cell extracts. Moreover, this [CTR+] phenotype was inherited in a non-Mendelian manner following mating with naïve [ctr–] cells, but intriguingly the [CTR+] phenotype was not eliminated by guanidine-hydrochloride treatment. Thus, Ctr 4 exhibits multiple features diagnostic of other fungal prions and is the first example of a prion in fission yeast. These findings suggest that transmissible protein-based determinants of traits may be more widespread among fungi...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{study of}} P element {{repression}} in Drosophila melanogaster {{led to the}} discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences, "TAS") has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene located in euchromatin. TSE can show variegation in ovaries, displays a maternal effect as well as an <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission</b> through meiosis and involves heterochromatin and RNA silencing pathways. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we analyze phenotypic and genetic properties of TSE. We report that TSE does not occur in the soma at the adult stage, but appears restricted to the female germline. It is detectable during development at the third instar larvae where it presents the same tissue specificity and maternal effect as in adults. Transgenes located in TAS at the telomeres of the main chromosomes can be silencers which in each case show the maternal effect. Silencers located at non-homologous telomeres functionally interact since they stimulate each other via the maternally-transmitted component. All germinally-expressed euchromatic transgenes tested, located on all major chromosomes, were found to be repressed by a telomeric silencer: thus we detected no TSE escaper. The presence of the euchromatic target transgene is not necessary to establish the maternal inheritance of TSE, responsible for its epigenetic behavior. A single telomeric silencer locus can simultaneously repress two P-lacZ targets located on different chromosomal arms. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Therefore TSE appears to be a widespread phenomenon which can involve different telomeres and work across the genome. It can explain the P cytotype establishment by telomeric P elements in natural Drosophila populations...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{expression}} and/or epigenetic deregulation {{may have}} consequences for sperm and blastocysts, {{as well as}} for the placenta, together potentially contributing to problems observed in offspring. We previously demonstrated specific perturbations of fertilization, blastocyst formation, implantation, as well as aberrant glucose metabolism and adiposity in offspring using a mouse model of paternal obesity. The current investigation analyzed gene expression and methylation of specific CpG residues in F 1 placentas of pregnancies fathered by obese and normal-weight male mice, using real-time PCR and bisulfite pyrosequencing. Our aim was to determine if paternal obesity deregulated placental gene expression and DNA methylation when compared to normal-weight males. Gene methylation of sperm DNA was analyzed and compared to placentas to address <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Of the 10 paternally expressed genes (Pegs), 11 genes important for development and transport of nutrients, and the long-terminal repeat Intracisternal A particle (IAP) elements, derived from a member of the class II endogenous retroviral gene family, we observed a significant effect of paternal diet-induced obesity on deregulated expression of Peg 3, Peg 9, Peg 10, and the nutrient transporter gene Slc 38 a 2, and aberrant DNA methylation of the Peg 9 promoter in F 1 placental tissue. Epigenetic changes in Peg 9 were also found in sperm from obese fathers. We therefore propose that paternal obesity renders changes in gene expression and/or methylation throughout the placental genome, which could contribute to the reproductive problems related to fertility and to the metabolic, long-term health impact on offspring.

40|$|Maternal {{effects are}} causal {{influences}} from mother to offspring beyond genetic information, and have lifelong consequences for multiple traits. Previously, we reported that mice whose mothers did not nurse properly had {{low birth weight}} followed by rapid fat accumulation and disturbed development of some organs. That pattern resembles metabolic syndromes known collectively as the thrifty phenotype, which {{is believed to be}} an adaptation to a stressful environment which prepares offspring for reduced nutrient supply. The potential link between maternal care, stress reactivity, and the thrifty phenotype, however, has been poorly explored in the human and animal literature: only a couple of studies even mention (much less, test) these concepts under a cohesive framework. Here, we explored this link using mice of the parental inbred strains SM/J and LG/J-who differ dramatically in their maternal care-and the intercrossed generations F 1 and F 2. We measured individual differences in 15 phenotypes and used structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. We found a remarkable relationship between thrifty phenotype and lower quality of maternal behaviors, including nest building, pup retrieval, grooming/licking, and nursing. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show, in any mammal, a clear connection between the natural variation in thrifty phenotype and maternal care. Both traits in the mother also had a substantial effect on survival rate in the F 3 offspring. To our surprise, however, stress reactivity seemed to play no role in our models. Furthermore, the strain of maternal grandmother, but not of paternal grandmother, affected the variation of maternal care in F 2 mice, and this effect was mediated by thrifty phenotype in F 2. Since F 1 animals were all genetically identical, this finding suggests that maternal effects pass down both maternal care and thrifty phenotype in these mice across generations via <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} P transposable element {{repression}} in Drosophila melanogaster {{led to the}} discovery of the trans-silencing effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences) represses in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene inserted in euchromatin. TSE shows variegation in ovaries and displays a maternal effect as well as <b>epigenetic</b> <b>transmission</b> through meiosis. In addition, TSE is highly sensitive to mutations affecting heterochromatin components (including HP 1) and the Piwi-interacting RNA silencing pathway (piRNA), a homology-dependent silencing mechanism that functions in the germline. TSE appears thus to involve the piRNA-based silencing proposed {{to play a major role}} in P repression. Under this hypothesis, TSE may also be established when homology between the telomeric and target loci involves sequences other than P elements, including sequences exogenous to the D. melanogaster genome. We have tested whether TSE can be induced via lacZ sequence homology. We generated a piggyBac-otu-lacZ transgene in which lacZ is under the control of the germline ovarian tumor promoter, resulting in strong expression in nurse cells and the oocyte. We show that all piggyBac-otu-lacZ transgene insertions are strongly repressed by maternally inherited telomeric P-lacZ transgenes. This repression shows variegation between egg chambers when it is incomplete and presents a maternal effect, two of the signatures of TSE. Finally, this repression is sensitive to mutations affecting aubergine, a key player of the piRNA pathway. These data show that TSE can occur when silencer and target loci share solely a sequence exogenous to the D. melanogaster genome. This functionally supports the hypothesis that TSE represents a general repression mechanism which can be co-opted by new transposable elements to regulate their activity after a transfer to the D. melanogaster genome...|$|E
