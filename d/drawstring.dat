5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the <b>drawstring</b> from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E

50|$|In 1996 the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued {{guidelines}} for <b>drawstrings</b> on children's upper outerwear {{to help prevent}} children from strangling or getting entangled on the neck and waist <b>drawstrings</b> of upper outerwear garments, such as jackets and sweatshirts. <b>Drawstrings</b> on children’s clothing are a hidden hazard {{that can lead to}} deaths and injuries when they catch on such items as playground equipment, bus doors, or cribs. From 1985-1999, the CPSC received reports of 22 deaths and 48 non-fatal incidents involving the entanglement of children’s clothing <b>drawstrings.</b> In 2006, the CPSC issued a letter to manufacturers, retailers, and importers of children’s upper outwear garments, urging them to make certain the garments do not have hood <b>drawstrings</b> that can pose a strangulation hazard to children. Several product recalls due to possible strangulation hazards have occurred in recent years.|$|R

The authors report two deaths by asphyxiation that resulted from <b>drawstrings</b> on the children's clothing becoming entangled on slides. Although such incidents are not common, they are preventable. The authors urge physicians to counsel parents and guardians to remove <b>drawstrings</b> from children's clothing, and they call upon {{the government and the}} clothing industry to work toward improving the safety standards for the design, manufacture and importation of children's clothing and banning the sale of children's clothing with <b>drawstrings</b> in Canada. In addition, they provide several resources for readers interested in helping reduce playground hazards in their communities...|$|R

50|$|Cord {{fasteners}} {{are used}} in many different applications to retain one or more cord segments or <b>drawstrings</b> in a tightened condition and to release such cord segments when desired. For example, cord locks {{are used in}} connection with garments that include <b>drawstrings,</b> such as hooded jackets and sweatshirts. Such fasteners are also used on various types of bags such as laundry bags and other storage bags that utilize cords to temporarily close an open end. They are also used in window blinds. They vary in size depending on the particular application, from 1 - 3 in long.|$|R
25|$|In the Victorian era, despite {{contemporary}} {{ideas about}} morality, women's clothing was paradoxically designed to emphasize both the breasts and hips by tightlacing the waist. Victorian women were encumbered with {{many layers of}} clothing, including a chemise with a <b>drawstring</b> neckline, usually drawers, then the corset and corset cover, the under petticoat, the hoop skirt, the over petticoat, and finally the dress. According to the social expectations of the times, even the lowest-cut evening gown should dip no lower than three finger breadths below the clavicles.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, American tea {{merchant}} Thomas Sullivan began distributing {{samples of}} his tea in small bags of Chinese silk with a <b>drawstring.</b> Consumers noticed they could simply leave the {{tea in the}} bag and reuse it with fresh tea. However, the potential of this distribution/packaging method would not be fully realised until later on. During World War II, tea was rationed in the United Kingdom. In 1953 (after rationing in the UK ended), Tetley launched the tea bag to the UK {{and it was an}} immediate success.|$|E

25|$|Backpacks {{in general}} fall {{into one of}} four categories: frameless, {{external}} frame, internal frame, and bodypack. A pack frame, when present, serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately, by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs. Most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders, reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure (many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14kg (30lbs)), as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion. Most backpacks are capable of being closed with either a buckle mechanism, a zipper, or a dry-bag type closure though a few models use a <b>drawstring</b> fitted with a cord lock for the main compartment.|$|E
500|$|This {{construction}} {{moves from}} geometry to pure topology. The disk D2 is the region contained by a circle, {{described by the}} inequality x02 + x12 ≤ 1, and its rim (or [...] "boundary") is the circle S1, described by the equality x02 + x12 = 1. If a balloon is punctured and spread flat it produces a disk; this construction repairs the puncture, like pulling a <b>drawstring.</b> The slash, pronounced [...] "modulo", means to take the topological space on the left (the disk) and in it join together as one all the points on the right (the circle). The region is 2-dimensional, which is why topology calls the resulting topological space a 2-sphere. Generalized, D'n/S'n−1 produces S'n. For example, D1 is a line segment, and the construction joins its ends to make a circle. An equivalent description is that the boundary of an n-dimensional disk is glued to a point, producing a CW complex.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the <b>drawstring</b> tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E

2500|$|The grouch bag: This {{explanation}} {{appears in}} Harpo's biography; it was voiced by Chico in a TV appearance included on The Unknown Marx Brothers; {{and it was}} offered by George Fenneman, Groucho's sidekick on his TV game show You Bet Your Life. A grouch bag was a small <b>drawstring</b> bag worn around the neck in which a traveler could keep money and other valuables {{so that it would}} be very difficult for anyone to steal them. Most of Groucho's friends and associates stated that Groucho was extremely stingy, especially after losing all his money in the 1929 stock market crash, so naming him for the grouch bag may have been a comment on this trait. Groucho insisted that this was not the case in chapter six of his first autobiography: ...|$|E

Both the juniors and seniors wear red socks and the Padres cap is red with a stylized 'P' for Padres, very similar to the Philadelphia Phillies cap insignia.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{handrails}} in {{the entry}} way posed a potential risk to students; as they exited the bus, items such as <b>drawstrings</b> or other loose clothing could be caught if the driver was unaware and pulled away with the student caught in the door. To minimize this risk, school bus manufacturers have redesigned handrails and equipment in the stepwell area. In its School Bus Handrail Handbook, the NHTSA described a simple test procedure for identifying unsafe stepwell handrails.|$|R
50|$|The {{combat uniform}} {{consisted}} of a long-sleeve olive-drab (OD) shirt, with two voluminous cargo pockets at the hip and two slanted pockets (designed for the 20-round FNC1 rifle magazine) at the breast, and <b>drawstrings</b> at the waist and hem; OD trousers, with regular pockets at {{the front and back}} and a large cargo patch pocket on each thigh, <b>drawstrings</b> at the cuff, and buttons on the belt loops for the attachment of optional suspenders; an OD V-neck undershirt; and black combat boots, with trouser cuffs bloused over. The beret was often worn, but could be replaced by a soft OD field hat or the American M1 steel helmet as the tactical situation dictated (while the Canadian combat uniform was universally olive green, American style cloth helmet covers with two types of camouflage pattern were issued; the woodland pattern worn in Vietnam and an autumn pattern). At the time of adoption, the OD colour was a standard among NATO forces; however, as other NATO forces adopted camouflage uniforms (for example, the British DPM (Disruptive Pattern Material) uniforms, or the Americans their woodland camouflage BDUs (Battle Dress Uniforms)), the Canadian Forces quickly became one of the only first world militaries not to adopt camouflage garments.|$|R
