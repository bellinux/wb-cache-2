40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Tyre inner tubes made of butyl rubber {{have been found to}} have poor heat resistance when used in the environment of Iraq. Research investigations were undertaken to establish the causes of the problem: these consisted of examining the individual contributions of oxidative scission processes in both rubber hydrocarbon and the various processing oils. The principal method used to monitor the degradation processes was ageing in hot air using the reduction in strength for the rubber and change in chemical composition of the processing oils. This preliminary study established that the processing oil made in Iraq was found to be of different composition from the common European rubber processing oils and contributed considerably to the poor life of the butyl inner tubes. Analysis of the oil from Iraq identified the presence of trace amounts of copper (3 ppm) known, from the literature, to adversely affect the resistance of many rubbers to elevated temperatures and, as found in this work, to also degrade butyl rubber. Replacement of the butyl rubber by chlorobutyl rubber overcame the problem of inner tube degradation and an antioxidant system based on a combination of an acetone/diphenylamine (ADPA) plus mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) with MgO was found effective in minimising chlorobutyl inner tube degradation. However, unexpectedly, the research also established that trace quantities of copper were useful as stabilisers in enhancing the <b>heat</b> <b>ageing</b> properties of chlorobutyl rubber and the addition of a particular copper salt (copper sulphatel in small proportions (3 ppm) as an anti-degradant was found beneficial. Another method studied to improve the resistance of halogenated butyl rubber to heat induced oxidative degradation tried to use ZnO as the curative, as recommended by the manufacturers of chlorobutyl rubber; however it was found that with this technique higher degradation was obtained in chlorobutyl than with the standard ZnO/ sulphurless curing system (i. e. ZnO/TMTDin proportions 5 : 1 phr). It was concluded from these studies that: 1. Reducing the oil level in butyl inner tubes from 25 phr to 15 phr enhances <b>heat</b> <b>ageing</b> properties of the rubber. Factory trials confirmed this finding. 2. Adding a copper inhibitor (ZDC) in the proportions 1 - 2 phr in butyl inner tubes was found successful in minimising oxidative degradation. 3.

The latter can be of significant importance in certain applications when components with different surface textures are placed adjacent to each other.

Synthesized adhesion promoters constitute silica fillers modified with cobalt, nickel, and a combination of cobalt and nickel. They contain on the surface a reduced number (compared with industrial stearate, cobalt) ions of metals of variable valence. Tests are carried out to determine the dependency of changes of the tensile strength, the elongation at break and the density of the crosslinking of rubbers on dosages of the investigated adhesion promoters and amounts of metal ions on their surface. The effect of type and dosage of the synthesized promoters of adhesion of rubber to steel brassedcord on heat aging resistance of elastomeric compositions are established. It is established that the vulcanizates containing synthesized adhesion promoters have greater high temperatures resistance as compared with the rubber materials containing industrial cobalt stearate.

40|$|Accelerated ageing in {{damp heat}} (85 °C, 85 % {{relative}} humidity) {{can reduce the}} efficiency of un-encapsulated chalcopyrite-based solar modules. A significant contribution of the degradation {{is caused by a}} decrease in lateral conductivity of the transparent aluminium-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) front contact. This aspect of the degradation is investigated in this thesis. Using X-ray diffraction techniques, as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy, a model of the inhomogeneous ZnO:Al thin film structure was derived. In this model, the bulk film consists of compactly grown grains with grain boundaries parallel to one another, interrupted by so-called 'extended grain boundaries' which are localised and induced by substrate roughness. These extended grain boundaries consist of smaller grains which are not perpendicularly orientated to the crystallographic planes and have a higher percentage area of grain boundaries. The influence of grains, grain-boundaries and these extended grain boundaries in the ZnO:Al was investigated by measuring the intra-grain Drude conductivity and the DC conductivity on smooth substrates (which have only grains and grain boundaries) and rough substrates (which also exhibit extended grain boundaries). The modelling of transmission and reflection spectra of degraded ZnO:Al on smooth and rough quartz glass showed a reduction of the Drude conductivity by a factor of two. Approximately the same effect was seen in the DC conductivity of the ZnO:Al grown on smooth substrates, thus the degradation of the ZnO standard grain boundaries was negligible. The presence of extended grain boundaries on rough substrates, however, causes a huge reduction of DC conductivity of about two orders of magnitude. The electronic transport mechanism over the extended grain boundaries was examined by using two-dimensionally structured silicon substrates. Temperature dependent Hall and conductivity measurements reveal a much lower DC conductivity, even before damp <b>heat</b> <b>ageing,</b> of the extended grain boundaries of 10 S/cm (compared to 1000 S/cm on the smooth substrates) and reduce even further on damp heat exposure. The low conductivity is correlated to a reduced charge carrier mobility. The conductivity across the extended grain boundaries was measured to be thermally activated, but the activation energy was too small to completely explain the decrease in conductivity. From these results, an electronic transport model was derived, based on a thermally assisted tunnelling current through two rectangular potential barriers which describes the conductivity in the extended grain boundaries, its temperature dependence and its time-dependence under damp heat...|$|E
40|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used manufacturing methods for the production of polymer-based components such as car bumpers and other automotive details. The surface appearance of these products is of great importance since it is directly connected to the perceived quality. Injection-moulded thermoplastics can exhibit a number of surface defects which lower their quality impression. To a large extent, this work deals with characterisation of flow-induced surface defects called tiger stripes or flow marks. They consist in alternating glossy and dull bands which appear on the surface of injection-moulded polymers, especially when long flow lengths are involved. The flow marks are approximately perpendicular to the flow direction and they are often opposite in phase on the two sides of the moulded object. The materials typically used for injection moulding of car components, and studied in the present work, are elastomer-modified polypropylene grades containing fillers. Two main theories behind the formation of the flow marks are discussed here: a slip-stick phenomenon and a snake-like flow which can initiate an unstable flow front during the filling of the mould. Several techniques were used in order to characterise the banded regions. Stereographic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as gloss evaluation, revealed that the dull regions were rougher and less glossy than the other type of bands. SEM micrographs of the cross section of the stripes indicated differences in the filler distribution between the different bands; the dull bands seemed to contain a lower amount of filler in the proximity of their surface. A course of events leading to this difference is suggested. Rheological studies of the polymer melts suggested that a higher melt elasticity is beneficial since it reduces the propensity for the defects generation. The effect of ageing on the severity of the flow marks is discussed in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness and thermal stability. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer is another engineering polymer widely used to produce vehicle interior components as well as domestic appliances, toys, etc. ABS is known to be sensitive towards ageing especially when exposed to UV-light. The effect of ageing on the appearance of injection-moulded ABS samples was studied here, in particular colour changes were evaluated. Natural coloured and grey coloured ABS specimens, containing the same type and the same amount of stabilisers, were exposed to a <b>heat</b> <b>ageing</b> treatment and to artificial weathering.
