40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} quality concentrates, {{depletion}} of high grade reserves, increase in operating costs and environmental constraints poses challenging problems to all mineral industries. Closure of mines due to environmental problems force the industries {{to look for}} processing of mine wastes and old plant tails. It is in this context an effort is made to process some of mine wastes by nil waste technology yielding usable products for diverse industries thereby solving vexed problem of waste management and meeting the demand for raw materials. The clayey ferruginous bauxite reject sample from waste dumps of Kolli hills, Namakkaltaluk, Salem district, Tamil Nadu was subjected to characterization, process diagnostic amenability tests followed by process evolution studies comprising of of soaking, scrubbing, wet screening over 150 micron double <b>deck</b> <b>screen</b> oversize produced metallurgical grade assaying 46. 50 % Al 2 O 3, 1. 49 % reactive SiO 2 and 21. 70 % Fe 2 O 3 with 76. 8 % Al 2 O 3 distribution at weight % yield of 67. 0 and a dewatered screen under size cement / pottery grade concentrates assaying 28. 63 % Al 2 O 3, 32. 28 % Fe 2 O 3 13. 57 % SiO 2 and 20. 41 % LOI at wt% yield of 33. 0.

40|$|Opencast and {{underground}} mining operations produce large quantities of dust as well noise due to increased mechanisation to augment production and enhance productivity {{to meet the demands}} of consumer industry. Exposure of miners to high concentrations of dust and noise may cause occupational health hazards like pneumoconiosis and noise induced hearing loss and other allied health risk. Health risk to miners from dust depends on dust size, concentration and duration of exposure whereas noise induced hearing loss depends on sound pressure level, frequency and exposure level of workers. Exposure of workers to dust concentrations and sound pressure levels beyond threshold limit values as prescribed limits by statutory enactments and guidelines may adversely affect the health of mine workers. To assess the status of dust concentrations and noise levels generated by various machines and exposure levels of workers, conduct of systematic dust and noise survey in mines is essential. It will help in assessing the situation vis-a-vis dust and noise standards so that effective dust and noise control strategies can be adopted to minimize their menace. Keeping this in view, this project work was undertaken to carry out dust and noise survey in an iron ore mine of SAIL. From dust and noise survey carried out in Bolani iron ore mines, it was observed that: -> The dust level at the mine site office was minimum (0. 14 mg/m 3) whereas the maximum dust level was found at the crusher plant area (3. 1 mg/m 3). The dust concentration at lump loading station, fine loading station, mine face and mine site office was less than safe working limit(3 mg/m 3) whereas at the washing plant and crusher plant area were found more than the safe working limit. -> The noise level at the secondary cone crusher was maximum (102. 2 dBA) whereas at the control room minimum (76. 2 dBA). The noise level at dumper, drill machine, drum scrubber, double <b>deck</b> <b>screen</b> and dewatering screen was more than 90 dBA which is maximum permissible limit for 8 hrs working period. Whereas the noise level at loading station, hopper, shovel, and control room was below the permissible limit 90 dBA. Hence we can say that the worker of the Iron Ore Mine, Bolani are working under high noise level more than the acceptable level. ->From the modelling of the Noise rating from Mamdani Fuzzy System, the noise rating for different machineries were determined and compared with the field data for the Noise Rating and it was found that the results were satisfactory...|$|E

50|$|The {{research}} on high frequency screens {{has led to}} {{new developments in the}} field which enhance the operation and performance of the equipment. These new developments include the stacking of up to 5 individual <b>screen</b> <b>decks</b> placed {{on top of the other}} and operating in parallel. A divider system splits the feed slurry to each Stack Sizer® screen, then to each <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> on the machine. Each <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> has an undersize and oversize collection pan which will respectively go into their common outlet. The stacking of the machines thus allows more production while using less space. Another new development is the fabrication of Polyweb urethane screen surfaces that have openings as fine as 45 µm and open areas from 35% - 45%. This leads to the screen being able to separate finer particles. The screens can be used for both wet and dry applications and urethane formulation is still an ongoing process. Thus, research and development is still being invested in high frequency screening equipment to improve the overall separation efficiency and also to lower costs.|$|R
40|$|Large banana <b>screens</b> with {{multiple}} <b>decks</b> are used {{extensively in the}} process separation of many valuable export commodities. They are high capacity vibrating screens with a curved profile. Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling using non-spherical particles has previously provided significant insight into the operation of these dry industrial screens. Here we introduce the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the flow of slurry (water and fine material) through a double <b>deck</b> banana <b>screen.</b> This paper firstly reports on the underlying DEM model of the coarse particulate flow on a full-scale banana screen. We then use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the transport of fine particle slurry over and through the double <b>deck</b> banana <b>screen.</b> Finally, we combine the DEM with SPH models using a one-way coupling to simulate the effects of adding a slurry flow to coarse particulates on the banana screen. The key outcomes from this study are that; SPH is ideally suited for the high speeds and the high fragmented and filamentary nature of the fluid flow through the <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> openings; the fluid only (SPH) model of slurry behaves similarly to the DEM approach in that more fluid is screened as the velocity slows, except near the earlier panels on the top deck; and, use of a porous media derived from DEM in one-way coupled approach with SPH produces clear and reasonable changes in fluid structure, separation and wetting of the screens consistent with slurry behaviour. Specifically, the fluid layer was much thicker in the coupled case, with slurry being trapped inside a coarse particle bed and which is sensitive to the fluid viscosity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Banana {{screening}} is {{an important}} size classification component. The screens are characterized by a high capacity for separation. The operation of screening usually takes place after crushing operation. The shape of the banana screens causes the feed material to flow rapidly and {{the result will be}} faster screening rate. The difference between banana screens and other screens is that in banana screens the screen cut size varies with the changing slope of the decks. There are number of factors that affect screening operation like inclination of discharge, open area, thickness of deck and feed rate. The aim {{of this paper is to}} simulate the <b>screener</b> <b>deck</b> with the help of DEM Simulation and to analyze different parameters that affect screener operation efficiency and optimizing the screener so that it has the best performance during the wear life of the screen media.

An Increase of deck angle speeds particle motion with proportional relationship to particle size. This decreases residence time and size stratification along the mesh screen. However, if the angle is greater than 20°, efficiency decreases due to reduction of effective mesh area. Effect of deck angle on efficiency is also influenced by particle density.
