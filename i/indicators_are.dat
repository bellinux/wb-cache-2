25|$|The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the Federal {{authority}} for patient safety {{and quality of}} care {{and has been a}} leader in pediatric quality and safety. AHRQ has developed Pediatric Quality Indicators (PedQIs) with the goal to highlight areas of quality concern and to target areas for further analysis. Eighteen pediatric quality <b>indicators</b> <b>are</b> included in the AHRQ quality measure modules; based on expert input, risk adjustment, and other considerations. Thirteen inpatient <b>indicators</b> <b>are</b> recommended for use at the hospital level, and five are designated area indicators. Inpatient <b>indicators</b> <b>are</b> treatments or conditions with the greatest potential of an adverse event for hospitalized children.|$|E

40|$|Sustainability is now woven {{throughout}} {{forest management}} and policy. Criteria and indicators (C&I) {{provide a means}} of defining the concepts of sustainability {{in the context of}} forest management and establishing goals to gauge progress. There have been no major research initiatives to determine the implications of climate change for C&I. We evaluated the 46 indicators of the 2003 Canadian Council of Forest Ministers framework. <b>Indicators</b> <b>were</b> evaluated for their relationships with climate, relationships with other indicators, robustness and utility under climate change, and future prospects, including abandonment, improvement, or continued use. An evaluation framework was developed to analyze indicator linkages, direct and indirect climate-change influence, and potential modifications. 12 <b>indicators</b> <b>were</b> considered unaffected by climate change. The remaining 34 <b>indicators</b> <b>were</b> considered to be influenced by climate change. No modification seemed warranted for 23 of these indicators, while modifications for the remaining 11 <b>indicators</b> <b>were</b> recommended. Six new <b>indicators</b> <b>were</b> identified for monitoring forests sustainably under climate change.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} including the UN Global Compact Cities Programme, World Vision and Metropolis have since 2010 begun using the Circles of Sustainability approach that {{sets up a}} four-domain framework for choosing appropriate indicators. Rather than designating the indicators {{that have to be}} used like most other approaches, it provides a framework to guide decision-making on what <b>indicators</b> <b>are</b> most useful. The framework is arranged around four domains - economics, ecology, politics and culture - which are then subdivided into seven analytically derived sub-domains for each domain. <b>Indicators</b> <b>are</b> linked to each sub-domain. By choosing culture as one of its key domains, the approach takes into account the emphasis of the 'Anthropological' approach (above), but retains a comprehensive sense of sustainability. The approach can be used to map any other sustainability indicator set. This is foundationally different from the Global Reporting Initiative Index (below) which uses a triple-bottom-line organizing framework, and is most relevant to corporate reporting.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an expert working group of researchers from East Asian countries. The group was tasked with developing a theoretically sound and practically implementable methodology for assessing the sustainability of biomass utilisation in East Asian countries based on the needs and potential of biomass resources in this region. Building on six years of research conducted between 2007 and 2013, the working group formulated a set of main and secondary indicators for biomass utilisation under three pillars of sustainability. For the environmental pillar, the main <b>indicator</b> <b>was</b> life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and secondary <b>indicators</b> <b>were</b> water consumption and soil quality. For the economic pillar, the main <b>indicator</b> <b>was</b> total value added and secondary <b>indicators</b> <b>were</b> net profit, productivity, and net energy balance. For the social pillar, the main <b>indicators</b> <b>were</b> employment generation and access to modern energy, and the secondary <b>indicator</b> <b>was</b> the human development index. The application of the working group methodology and indicators in sustainability assessments of biomass utilisation will enable decision makers in East Asian countries to compare the sustainability of biomass utilisation options and to make decisions {{on whether or not}} to launch or sustain biomass utilisation initiatives...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To propose new Quality Indicators (QIs) for the Intensity Modulated(IMRT) /Image-Guided(IGRT) Radiotherapy techniques.
