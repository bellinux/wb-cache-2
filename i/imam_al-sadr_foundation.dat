40|$|<b>Imam</b> Musa <b>al-Sadr</b> (1347 AH, 1928 CE), is an Iranian Shi'i Imam with Lebanese ancestry. He {{became the}} leader of the Shi'i {{community}} in Lebanon in 1959 after the death of the local leader. He lived in Lebanon for about nineteen years before his sudden disappearance during an official visit to Libya in 1978. His stay in Lebanon marked a major transformation in the political, social, religious, and economic life of the Shi'i community. It also marked a major change in the history of Lebanon and the Lebanese as a whole. His work and accomplishments touched all the Lebanese no matter what religion, region, or political affiliation they belonged to. This dissertation will discuss and analyze the life of Imam Musa, as he was known by his followers; his numerous writings, speeches, and manifestos; the contributions he made to the advancement of the Shi'i community in Lebanon. It will also analyze his appeal for Muslim unity around the world and religious tolerance between the various religious communities in Lebanon. Finally this dissertation will look at the legacy he left {{and the future of the}} Shi'ah in Lebanon. This study is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is about the Shi'i community in Lebanon, its history, numbers and political and socio-economic status at the time of Imam Musa's arrival to Lebanon. The second chapter looks at the life of <b>Imam</b> Musa <b>al-Sadr,</b> his accomplishments, the changes he was able to affect for and within the Shi'i community, and his untimely disappearance in 1978. Chapter two also discusses the Imam by looking at him from three different points of view: the man, his political thought and his role as a religious reformer. "Imam Musa: The man" is a personal look at the Imam and views of people who lived and dealt with him throughout the nineteen years he spent in Lebanon. "Imam Musa: His Political Thought" discusses his dealings with the Lebanese government, the Christian parties, the Leftist Muslim parties and the Palestinians. "Imam Musa: Religious Reformer" analyzes his views on religion and relations between religions. As a reformer Imam Musa advocated unity between Muslims around the world, a more active role for women in Islamic society, and tolerance for other religions. The third chapter analyzes Imam Musa's literary output (books, speeches, and manifestos) during his tenure in Lebanon. These will be analyzed in their relation to Imam Musa's life and accomplishments in Lebanon. The fourth chapter looks at the legacy of the Imam, the fate of the Shi'i community since his disappearance, and the future of the community in Lebanon...|$|R

5000|$|Shias were {{politically}} underrepresented, {{based on}} the National Pact of 1943, which vested legislative and executive as well as military positions in rough proportion to the demographic size of the country's eighteen recognized sectarian groupings. In 1946, the Christian Maronites and the Sunni Muslims occupied 40 and 27 percent, respectively, of the highest civilian posts. The Shia occupied but 3.2 percent. By the 1980s, Shias had become Lebanon's largest single confessional community with almost 1,400,000 people, surpassing the Maronite and Sunni populations, which were each estimated at nearly 800,000 a piece (Hamzeh, 2004: 13) The Shiites believed that their representation was not commensurate with their numerical size. Economically the broader Shia community in Lebanon was very poor. Almost 85 percent lived in the rural region of South Lebanon and in one area of the Beqaa Valley, and subsisted on what they earned, mostly from selling tobacco to the state monopoly or growing vegetables. They were also exposed to the military fighting between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). To escape these conditions, many Shias migrated to the slums of eastern Beirut and shantytowns in the suburbs south of Beirut. Hamzeh writes that [...] "these two areas, known as the [...] "belt of misery," [...] became the breeding ground of Shia militancy in the 1980s. (Hamzeh, 2004: 14) Even in the 1960s and 70s, the charismatic leader <b>Imam</b> Musa <b>al-Sadr</b> began to activate the politically quiescent Shias of Lebanon.|$|R
40|$|The {{political}} process {{is being used}} to wage a civil war in Iraq, writes Derek Woolner WHY are Australian troops in Iraq? Currently the government argues, along with its coalition partners, that they are there to prevent the situation worsening. Australian Defence Force deployments are part of a presence that is building local security capability, buying time for the development of democracy and averting the prospect of civil war. This is true enough, but is increasingly irrelevant. Events in Iraq have been unfolding according to their own logic. Those events will probably deliver a representative parliament and effective security forces but these will not be institutions to build a united country. Neither will Iraqi democracy be of the liberal democratic model that the Bush Administration had thought would inspire a wave of change throughout the Middle East. Current coalition strategy aims to empower the locals to take control of Iraq, by developing Iraqi security forces to defeat the ongoing insurgency and by placing them under the control of a representative democratic government. The US military campaign against a largely Sunni insurgency in the central ‘Sunni triangle’ is a holding action, buying time until this happens. The United States cannot do otherwise. It lacks the resources to prosecute an effective counter-insurgency campaign. When the British put down a Shia insurgency in Mesopotamia in the 1920 s it had a soldier to population ratio of 1 : 23. In Iraq today the coalition ratio moves around 1 : 174. Consequently, every American claim of success is confounded as the insurgents regroup, restructure and improvise. The reality is that a civil war is already growing, fuelled by the realignment of political power. On 16 September the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, declared war against Shiite Iraqis. The declaration was probably intended to exploit resentment amongst Sunnis at their increasingly apparent exclusion from national decision-making, the draft national constitution. On 15 October Iraqis voted on a document that proposed a federal system around strongly autonomous territories amalgamating provinces on sectarian criteria. The constitution will see revenues from all new oil developments retained by these regional governments. None of this suits the Sunni living in regions with few oil reserves and with their co-religionists in oil-rich Kirkuk threatened with ejection from a Kurdish autonomous region. Unsurprisingly, when the draft constitution appeared, the response was civil unrest across Sunni communities. The subsequent acceptance of the constitution showed not a victory for secular democracy but rather how deep is the ethnic and sectarian divide in Iraq today. The total vote split roughly along the 80 : 20 proportion of Shia and Kurds to Sunni Arabs. Gaining 90 percent approval in some Shia provinces, the proposal was rejected by over 80 percent in Saddam Hussein’s home province of Salahuddin and by over two-thirds in Anbar, the seat of the Sunni insurgency. The constitutional proposal was carried when Nineveh, with large Sunni and Kurdish populations, rejected the proposal but only by 55 to 45 percent. A condition enforced by the US in launching its democratisation project was that the constitution would fail if rejected by a two-thirds majority in any three provinces. Obviously, few among the Sunni were influenced by the last minute and largely cosmetic concessions offered to Sunni politicians in the week before the vote. On the other hand, most Shia continue to follow their Grand Ayatollah who instructed his people on their religious duty to vote for the constitution. In effect, since Saddam’s defeat Iraq’s Shia leadership has been running a civil war through the medium of politics. They are fortunate that their revered leader, the Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, has acute strategic insight. At a time when the US thought implanting democracy would produce a secular, cohesive Iraq Sistani recognised that it would deliver power to the Shia. The most important force now shaping Iraq is not the mesmeric, continual violence, but the requirement of the Ayatollah that Shias support democratisation. Despite tribal and political differences, the Shia have followed their religious leadership in avoiding diversions from the democratic process. Consequently, their cohesion has captured the US occupation. America was already heavily enmeshed with the Kurds (for whom they provided the two-thirds/three provinces rule as a constitutional safeguard of Kurdish autonomy) as the Sunni insurgency grew. The last thing the US could afford was a Shia uprising. Since the entire American strategy presupposes democratic development, the US could not prevent the Shia’s demographic dominance and sectarian unity controlling the process. Even better for the Shia and Kurds, whilst Sunni tribal fighters come under US attack, political control has allowed them to retain their militias and develop them into powers within the state. Both US and British officials have conceded that the regulation of militias has passed to the Iraqi government. The 90, 000 strong Kurdish pesh merga are a guarantee of ongoing independence and Kurdish political leaders will not surrender them to a unified Iraqi security force. The newly accepted constitution legitimises this situation. Although there are many Shiite militias the major forces are Badr and the Mahdi army. The (then) Badr Brigade was the military arm of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, whose leader, Abdul Aziz Al-Hakim is a key power broker behind the Shiite majority in the National Assembly. It was re-named the Badr Organisation in June 2003 and claims to no longer have a military roll. Yet, when the Australian Army group arrived in Al Muthanna in April, the local Badr chief proclaimed his armed supporters ensured provincial security. Sunni leaders such as Adnan Pachachi, former Foreign Minister, voice concerns that Badr is taking control of the security services. With public support from President Talabani and Prime Minister Jaafari and former official Bayan Jabr, now Interior Minister, Badr is well placed for this operation. The Mahdi army, {{under the control of the}} radical <b>Imam</b> Muqtada <b>al-Sadr,</b> is active both in the south and in the slums of Baghdad’s Sadr City. It has heavily infiltrated security forces in Basra. Police chief General Hassan al-Sade claimed that the militia made up half his force, that he could trust only a quarter of his offices and that some were involved in assassinations. Other reports claim that 90 per cent of security forces in the region owe primary allegiance to Shiite militias. Together they have turned the south of Iraq into what critics claim is an Islamic republic not unlike Iran. The growing influence of these politically sponsored militias with their factional loyalties now questions the viability of the strategy to build nationally focused security forces. The significance of the recent British attack on a Basra police station and the crowds’ retaliation is that both Prime Minister Jaafari and Interior Minister Jabr, while talking-up ongoing cooperation with Britain, supported the actions of the Basra police. The path forward in Iraq is not entirely clear. Elections in December for the first full Iraqi government may not be dominated by Shia parties. Creating further uncertainty is the prospect of a power struggle amongst the Shia militias. Tension and conflict are emerging. Al-Sadr, with his power base in Baghdad, has no interest in a federated Iraq. Badr and the Mahdi army have clashed in Basra, the Mahdi succeeded in buying-out Badr’s control of the Basra internal affairs department and they recently have begun to receive assistance from Iran. As often happens in revolutions, there may soon be an attempt to purge fellow radicals, possibly exploiting any uncertainties around the December elections. Yet the most probably outcome is that the Shia religious leadership will remain in control. Events in Iraq are approaching their logical conclusion. Democracy will triumph, but not in the support of western interests. The security forces will gradually become (brutally) effective but operate for sectarian rather than national interests. The Sunni triangle will be given little but the prospect of further violence, increasingly from Shia dominated security forces. For its contribution to this outcome, Australia currently has allocated more than $ 1. 2 billion dollars for all ADF deployments to Iraq. • Derek Woolner is a visiting fellow at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, Australian National University.
