25|$|In the Daitōkan dojo in Hokkaidō, where Tokimune taught, the art {{had been}} {{organized}} differently due {{to differences in}} the way that Sōkaku had taught and changes which Tokimune had introduced into the system. Tokumine had systematized the art and given names to the techniques, resulting in a more rigidly organized curriculum. He had also pared down the wider sword system he had been taught by his father to concentrate on the Ono-ha Ittō-ryū system, albeit modified by techniques that Sōkaku had developed. Tokimune called this system Daitō-ryū 'Aiki Budō' as it emphasized a more than just jujutsu and other weapons and that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> age it was not merely not an art of fighting but a means of self-improvement or 'martial path'.|$|E

500|$|On 30 May 2004, US District judge Nancy Gertner {{ruled out}} the lawsuit {{explaining}} that stating someone is homosexual does not libel or slander them, {{particularly in light of}} new court decisions granting gays more rights. Gertner first rejected the idea that the mistake in captioning constituted a statement that Albright was gay. She added: [...] "Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly give them effect. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> age, recent rulings by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Judiciary Court of Massachusetts undermine any suggestion that a statement implying that an individual is homosexual is defamatory.|$|E

Adiós, Omayra: La catástrofe de Armero (1988), written by Eduardo Santa as a response to the eruption, depicts the girl's last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of the catastrophe. In No Morirás (1994), Germán Santa María Barragán writes that of all the horrors he saw at Armero, nothing was more painful than seeing the face of Omayra Sánchez under the ruins of her house. Isabel Allende's short story, [...] "And of Clay Are We Created" [...] ("De barro estamos hechos"), is told from the perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under the fireplace of her ruined home. Allende later wrote, [...] "Her [...] big black eyes, filled with resignation and wisdom, still pursue me in my dreams. Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost." ...|$|E
500|$|Drawing on André Maurois' Les Silences du colonel Bramble, Hergé {{presents}} Tintin as a big-game hunter, accidentally killing fifteen antelope {{as opposed}} to the one needed for the evening meal. However, concerns over the number of dead animals led Tintins Scandinavian publishers to request changes. A page of Tintin killing a rhinoceros by drilling a hole in its back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive; Hergé replaced the page with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin's rifle while he sleeps under a tree. In 2007, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be pulled from shelves after a complaint, stating, [...] "It beggars belief that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> age that any shop would think it acceptable to sell and display Tintin in the Congo." [...] In August 2007, a Congolese student filed a complaint in Brussels that the book was an insult to the Congolese people. Public prosecutors investigated, and a criminal case was initiated, although the matter was transferred to a civil court. Belgium's Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against [...] "over-reaction and hyper political correctness".|$|E

As a junior, he averaged 26 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists. [...] His coach David Weber said: [...] "I call him a combination of Larry Bird and 'Pistol' Pete (Maravich). [...] He's got the flair, the passing abilities. He's got good size. He's a rare player <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> age." [...] Scheyer rose to national fame in his senior year by scoring 21 points in 75 seconds of play during a one-man comeback effort in the last minute and a half of a high school game against Proviso West High School, {{in an effort to keep}} alive his team's 35-game winning streak.

500|$|Some legal {{scholars}} {{have criticized the}} Court's ruling in Schmerber for infringing too far upon civil liberty and privacy. E. John Wherry, Jr., former Dean of the University of Orlando School of Law, wrote that [...] "lindly following Schmerber as authorization for all non-consensual blood seizure for forensic purposes is, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> age, an outrage." [...] Writing for the Notre Dame Law Review, Blake A. Bailey, Elaine M. Martin, and Jeffrey M. Thompson observed that although the Court limited the holding in Schmerber to {{the facts of the}} case, prior to Winston v. Lee, many lower courts relied upon the ruling to order criminal defendants to undergo surgery to remove bullets that may have been evidence of a crime. Other scholars have expressed concern that the Court's decision to exclude physical evidence from protections against self-incrimination may one day lead to the use of mind reading devices when prosecuting criminal suspects. For example, the Harvard Law Review suggested that the Court's decision may be used to justify monitoring brain waves. Additionally, {{in an article in the}} journal Developments in Mental Health Law, Benjamin Holley suggested that [...] "neurotechnological lie detection" [...] could be used in criminal prosecutions, as long as a suspect's words are not [...] "linked with the physical manifestations sought to be introduced at trial." [...] Likewise, in an article in the Journal of Legal Medicine, John G. New suggested that non-testimonial evidence gathered from electroencephalography or magnetic resonance imaging may be admissible to demonstrate a suspect's thoughts.|$|E
