In this paper, a theoretical approach for misfit dislocation reduction of wurtzite InxGa 1 -xN/GaN is presented. The linear and <b>exponential</b> <b>grading</b> techniques have been modeled for {{the reduction of}} dislocation. An energy balance model has been taken into consideration and modified for wurtzite structure to evaluate the misfit dislocation density. The value of misfit dislocation has been reduced fro...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the Greenwood and Williamson contact theory for microscopically rough {{surfaces}} is generalized by considering a grading on {{the elastic modulus}} of the asperities. This situation can be representative of surfaces receiving superficial treatments or characterized by a chemical degradation. The effect of an <b>exponential</b> <b>grading</b> on the applied normal load, {{on the relationship between}} the real contact area and the load, on the plasticity index, {{as well as on the}} contact conductance is illustrated with detailed numerical examples...|$|E
40|$|We {{argue that}} supersymmetric {{transformation}} {{could be applied}} across the heterojunction formed by joining of two mixed semiconductors. A general framework is described by specifying the structure of ladder operators at the junction for making quantitative estimation of physical quantities. For a particular heterojunction device, we show that an <b>exponential</b> <b>grading</b> inside a nanoscale doped layer is amenable to exact analytical treatment for a class of potentials distorted by the junctions through the solutions of transformed Morse-Type potentials.

40|$|Silicon epitaxy {{has been}} studied for the {{fabrication}} of solar cell structures, {{with the intent of}} optimizing efficiency while maintaining suitability for space applications. SiH 2 CL 2 yielded good quality layers and junctions with reproducible impurity profiles. Diode characteristics and lifetimes in the epitaxial layers were investigated as a function of epitaxial growth conditions and doping profile, as was the effect of substrates and epitaxial post-gettering on lifetime. The pyrolytic decomposition of SiH 4 was also used in the epitaxial formation of highly doped junction layers on bulk Si wafers. The effects of junction layer thickness and bulk background doping level on cell performance, in particular, open-circuit voltage, were investigated. The most successful solar cells were fabricated with SiH 2 CL 2 to grow p/n layers on n(+) substrates. The best performance was obtained from a p(+) /p/n/n(+) structure grown with an <b>exponential</b> <b>grade</b> in the n-base layer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFGMs are {{regarded}} as one of the most promising candidates for future advanced composites in many engineering sectors, but they may suffer the problem of delamination. Delaminations in structures may significantly reduce the stiffness and strength of the structure and may affect their vibration characteristics. In the present study, an analytical solution is developed to study the free vibration of <b>exponential</b> functionally <b>graded</b> beams with a single delamination. Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis, the ‘free mode’ and ‘constrained mode’ assumption in delamination vibration are adopted. The shifting of neutral axis due to asymmetrical distribution of material property (in thickness direction) is also taken into consideration. This is the first study on the influences of delamination (its length and location) on the vibration of <b>exponential</b> functionally <b>graded</b> beams. Results show that the natural frequency increases as the Young's modulus ratio increases, but such increase is smaller when the beam suffers a longer delamination. Furthermore, the effect of delamination length and longitudinal location on reducing natural frequency is aggravated when the material property (Young's modulus and density) changes less dramatically from the bottom to the top. The difference of natural frequency between ‘free mode’ and ‘constrained mode’ becomes smaller with a decreasing Young's modulus ratio. The analytical results of this study can serve as the benchmark for FEM and other numerical solutions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{state-space}} {{method is}} employed {{to evaluate the}} modal parameters of function-ally graded, magneto-electro-elastic, and multilayered plates. Based {{on the assumption that}} the properties of the functionally <b>graded</b> material are <b>exponential,</b> the state equation of structural vi-bration which takes the displacement and stress of the structure as state variables is derived. The natural frequencies and modal shapes are calculated based on the general solutions of the state equation and boundary conditions given in this paper. The influence of the functionally <b>graded</b> <b>exponential</b> factor on the elastic displacement, electric, and magnetic fields of the structure are discussed by assuming a sandwich plate model with different stacking sequences.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} p- and n-type doping in strain relaxation of graded composition InGaAs layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that p-type Be-doping can improve material properties, resulting in smaller surface roughness and lower threading dislocation density, while n-type Si-doping has an opposite effect. The effect {{is strongly dependent on}} the grading profile, with linear grading showing small differences, while there is a significant difference when an <b>exponential</b> <b>grading</b> is used. Since doping is essential for many types of devices, these results are useful for improving the material properties and performance of metamorphic devices...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} an orbifold Landau-Ginzburg model (f,G), where f is an invertible polynomial in three variables and G a finite group of symmetries of f containing the <b>exponential</b> <b>grading</b> operator, and its Berglund-Hübsch transpose (f^T, G^T). We {{show that this}} defines a mirror symmetry between orbifold curves and cusp singularities with group action. We define Dolgachev numbers for the orbifold curves and Gabrielov numbers for the cusp singularities with group action. We show that these numbers are the same and that the stringy Euler number of the orbifold curve coincides with the G^T-equivariant Milnor number of the mirror cusp singularity.

40|$|Semi-analytical 3 -D {{elasticity}} {{solutions are}} presented for orthotropic multi-directional functionally graded plates using the differential quadrature method (DQM) {{based on the}} state-space formalism. Material properties are assumed to vary not only through the thickness {{but also in the}} in-plane directions following an <b>exponential</b> law. The <b>graded</b> in-plane domain is solved numerically via the DQM, while exact solutions are sought for the thickness domain using the state-space method. Convergence studies are performed, and the present hybrid semi-analytical method is validated by comparing numerical results with the exact solutions for a conventional unidirectional functionally graded plate. Finally, effects of material gradient indices on the displacement and stress fields of the plates are investigated and discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, the {{critical}} axial speeds of {{three types of}} sigmoid, power law and <b>exponential</b> law functionally <b>graded</b> plates for both isotropic and orthotropic cases are obtained via a completely analytic method. The plates are subjected to lateral white noise excitation and show evidence of large deformations. Due to randomness, the conventional deterministic methods fail and a statistical approach must be selected. Here, the probability density function is evaluated analytically for prescribed plates and used to investigate {{the critical}} axial velocity of them. Specifically the effect of in-plane forces, mean value of lateral load and the material property on the critical axial speed are studied and discussed for both isotropic and orthotropic functionally graded plates. Since the governing equation is transformed to a non dimensional format, {{the results can be}} used {{for a wide range of}} plate dimensions. It is shown that the material heterogeneity palys an essential and significant role in increasing or decreasing the critical speed of both isotropic and orthotropic functionally graded plates...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} uniform {{exponential growth}} in algebras. We give {{conditions for the}} uniform exponential growth of descending-filtered algebras and prove that an N-graded algebra has uniform exponential growth if it has exponential growth. We use this to prove that Golod- Shafarevich algebras and group algebras of Golod- Shafarevich groups have uniform exponential growth. We prove that the twisted Laurent extension of a free commutative polynomial algebra with respect to an endomorphism with some eigenvalue of norm not 1 must have uniform exponential growth. We prove that the group algebra of a (free abelian) -by-cyclic group has polynomially-bounded or uniform exponential group. We prove that the uniform exponential growth of the universal enveloping algebra U of a Lie algebra L implies uniform exponential growth of L, and contrariwise should L be N- graded, and prove the same result for restricted Lie algebras. We use this to give several conditions equivalent to the uniform <b>exponential</b> growth of <b>graded</b> algebra associated to a group algebra filtered by powers of its fundamental idea...|$|R
40|$|Representations in {{the cortex}} are often {{distributed}} with graded firing {{rates in the}} neuronal populations. The firing rate probability distribution of each neuron {{to a set of}} stimuli is often exponential or gamma. In processes in the brain, such as decision-making, that are influenced by the noise produced by the close to random spike timings of each neuron for a given mean rate, the noise with this graded type of representation may be larger than with the binary firing rate distribution that is usually investigated. In integrate-and-fire simulations of an attractor decision-making network, we show that the noise is indeed greater for a given sparseness of the representation for <b>graded,</b> <b>exponential,</b> than for binary firing rate distributions. The greater noise was measured by faster escaping times from the spontaneous firing rate state when the decision cues are applied, and this corresponds to faster decision or reaction times. The greater noise was also evident as less stability of the spontaneous firing state before the decision cues are applied. The implication is that spiking-related noise {{will continue to be a}} factor that influences processes such as decision-making, signal detection, short-term memory, and memory recall even with the quite large networks found in the cerebral cortex. In these networks there are several thousand recurrent collateral synapses onto each neuron. The greater noise with graded firing rate distributions has the advantage that it ca...|$|R
