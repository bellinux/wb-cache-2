5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E

To find out whether performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Vocabulary subtest <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>rising,</b> the authors searched major psychology journals for investigations involving healthy younger and older adult participants and collected the reported WAIS Vocabulary scores. The meta-analysis shows that WAIS Vocabulary scores <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> {{at the rate of}} 0. 117 /year (corresponding to 1. 52 IQ points/decade) for younger adults and 0. 367 /year (corresponding to 4. 79 IQ points/decade) for older adults.

New, fuller, and better data series permit us to discern four of these recent trends sufficiently clearly to call them "stylized facts" of the contemporary development process: (1) LDC defense expenditures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> as a fraction of GDP; (2) the capital cost component of this spending appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> relative to the operating cost component; (3) {{the portion of the}} LDC population serving in the armed forces <b>has</b> <b>been</b> increasing; and (4) LDC military wages appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> relative to civilian wages...|$|R

5|$|In 2000, {{about six}} million people lived within the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin. Of this total about 2.4million {{people lived in}} Oregon, 1.7million in Washington, 1million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4million in Montana. Population in the watershed <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the I-5 corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around Spokane, Washington, and Boise, Idaho. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly. The central Oregon county of Deschutes is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing {{just east of the}} Cascades in central Washington around the city of Yakima and the Tri-Cities area. Projections for the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior. The Canadian part of the Okanagan subbasin is also growing rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo Tower's {{two main}} revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism. It {{functions}} as a radio and television broadcasting antenna support structure and is a tourist destination that houses several different attractions. Over 150million people have visited the tower in total since its opening in late 1958. Tower attendance had been steadily declining until it bottomed out at 2.3million in 2000. Since then, attendance <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising,</b> and it has recently been attracting approximately 3million visitors per year. The first area tourists must visit upon reaching the tower is FootTown, a four-story building stationed directly under the tower. Here, visitors can eat, shop and visit several museums and galleries. Elevators that depart from {{the first floor of}} FootTown can be used to reach the first of two observation decks, the two-story Main Observatory. For the price of another ticket, visitors can board another set of elevators from {{the second floor of the}} Main Observatory to reach the final observation deckthe Special Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising.</b> High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E

High rat populations in the UK are often attributed to the mild climate, which allow them higher survival rates during the winter.|$|E

25|$|Immigrant {{segregation}} {{declined in}} the first half of the 20th century, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>rising</b> over the past few decades. This has caused questioning of the correctness of describing the United States as a melting pot. One explanation is that groups with lower socioeconomic status concentrate in more densely populated area that have access to public transit while groups with higher socioeconomic status move to suburban areas. Another is that some recent immigrant groups are more culturally and linguistically different from earlier groups and prefer to live together due to factors such as communication costs. Another explanation for increased segregation is white flight.|$|E
