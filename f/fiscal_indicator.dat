40|$|The private {{pension pillar}} {{established}} in 1998 has generated equally important short-, medium- and long-term effects. This article addresses the short- and medium-term time horizons, which differ from one another. In the short term, the government lost contribution revenues, while its pension expenditures did not decrease. However, since this shortfall in state revenues did not influence the consumption and savings decisions of households, {{in this analysis}} the short-term indicators of fiscal impact on demand disregard the impact of lost revenues. In the medium term, however, the rechanneling of contributions increased public debt and household savings. Consequently, similarly to official statistics, our household indicators and our medium-term <b>fiscal</b> <b>indicator</b> (augmented SNA deficit) {{take into account the}} effect of lost revenues. As the vast majority of members returned to the state pension pillar in 2011, for the purposes of our analysis, we could well assume that the private pension pillar never existed. Accordingly, the difference between our medium-term <b>fiscal</b> <b>indicator</b> and the short-term indicator disappears. As a result, we have changed our household indicators retroactively {{in such a way as}} if the contributions and the returns they yielded had always belonged to the state. This was necessary because the official statistics do not spread this amount over time, but account for it in full for 2011 as a capital transfer between households and the general government, which renders evaluation of the developments extremely difficult. pension reform, savings, pension funds, statistical correction, net lending, deficit. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest a new <b>fiscal</b> <b>indicator,</b> {{based on a}} {{decomposition}} {{of the change in}} the budget balance into discretionary changes (the effect of changes in fiscal policy) and induced changes (the effect of changes in the economy). In our indicator, adjustments are linked directly to the main tax bases, in contrast to other indicators where adjustments usually are linked to the GDP or to the rate of unemployment. This difference involves higher accuracy when tax bases evolve differently than do GDP and unemployment. We calculate our indicator for a number of OECD countries, and compare with existing indicators. Furthermore, we measure the cyclicality of fiscal policy based on our indicator, and explore to what extent fiscal policy can be explained by economic and institutional/political variables...|$|E
40|$|As actual budget {{balances}} reflect both cyclical {{developments and}} discretionary measures, {{they are not}} very useful when seeking to assess the orientation of underlying fiscal policy and possible structural imbalances in the budget balance. The influence of fluctuations in economic growth on the government’s budget balance can be examined by decomposing the actual budget into a cyclical and a structural or cyclically adjusted component. The former component shows {{the effect on the}} government budget of cyclical fluctuations in economic activity, the latter reflects what the budget balance would be if economic activity were at its trend level. This paper calculates the extent to which fiscal policy stabilises output fluctuations in South Africa and estimates the cyclically adjusted budget balance of the consolidated general government as an alternative <b>fiscal</b> <b>indicator</b> that can contribute to more effective fiscal policy and fiscal analysis.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a <b>fiscal</b> <b>indicator</b> {{that uses the}} fiscal situation {{of the previous year}} as a benchmark. Different revenue and expenditure items have their own of rules by which the cyclical and discretionary changes are determined. An important step in constructing the new indicator is the estimation of the tax elasticities and the elasticity of social benefits with respect to unemployment. Linking different taxes to different tax bases, and not directly to GDP, seems to be a crucial contributing factor in understanding the developments in the early 1990 s in Finland. The relevant tax bases for the main taxes responded with lag both when the recession started and when the boom started. The results obtained with the new indicator are compared with analogous results given by the OECD methodology. While the two indicators give a rather similar picture of the tightness of the fiscal policy in the 1980 s, large differences occur especially in 1991 and 1993.

40|$|We use a {{panel of}} 21 OECD {{countries}} from 1970 to 2009 to investigate the effects of different fiscal adjustment strategies on long-term interest rates – a key <b>fiscal</b> <b>indicator</b> reflecting the costs of government debt service. A government confronted with high deficits and rising debt will sooner or later need to enact fiscal adjustments {{in order to avoid}} solvency problems. Over the last four decades, such measures taken by governments in OECD countries have varied in duration, size, composition and in their success to re-establish fiscal sustainability. Controlling for various economic, fiscal and political factors, we find that the size and the composition of a fiscal adjustment significantly affect interest rates as well as yield spreads. Adjustments that are relatively large and those that primarily depend on expenditure cuts lead to substantially lower long-term interest rates. However, periods of fiscal adjustments do not generally have an influence on interest rates, even if they were successful and led to lower deficits and debt levels. Instead, financial markets only seem to value strict and decisive measures – a clear sign that the government’s pledge to cut the deficit is credible. fiscal adjustment, consolidation policy, government debt, deficit, interest rates...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of EMU’s fiscal indicators {{has been questioned}} by recent episodes of large upward deficit revisions. This paper discusses the causes of such revisions {{in order to identify}} ways to improve monitoring. The computation of EMU’s deficit indicator involves the assessment of accrued revenue and expenditure and the identification of transactions in financial assets. Both can open margins for opportunistic accounting. However, crosschecks between deficit and changes in gross nominal debt (the other <b>fiscal</b> <b>indicator</b> used in EMU) can reduce the scope for fiscal gimmickry. Simple comparison of deficit and changes in debt can readily spotlight large inconsistencies in fiscal data. Nevertheless, consistency checks must go deeper than simple comparison, since different items in the reconciliation account between deficit and change in debt can offset each other. Econometric evidence suggests that such offset may indeed have been used to reduce the visibility of deficit-specific fiscal gimmickry. Attention to the quality of statistics has increased in recent years, also {{in the context of the}} reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this context, the paper argues that detailed analysis of the reconciliation account between deficit and change in debt is crucial to the effectiveness of monitoring...|$|E
