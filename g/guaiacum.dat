5|$|While {{the other}} three grand pre-Columbian civilisations—the Maya, Aztec and Inca—are known for their grand {{architecture}} {{in the form of}} pyramids, stelae, stone cities and temples, the modest Muisca architecture has left very little traces in the present. The houses (called bohíos or malokas) and temples of the people, where spiritual gatherings took place honouring the gods and sacrificing tunjos, emeralds and children, were made of degradable materials such as wood, clay and reed. The circular structures were built on top of slightly elevated platforms to prevent them from flooding on the frequently inundated plains; small settlements of ten to one hundred houses were surrounded by wooden poles forming an enclosure, called ca in Muysccubun. Two or more gates gave entrance to the villages. The houses and temples themselves were built around a central pole of wood attached to the roof; the temples were constructed using the wood of <b>Guaiacum</b> officinale tree, giving high quality construction. The floors of the open spaced houses were covered with straw or, for the caciques, with ceramic floors. Cloths were attached to the roof and painted with red and black colours. The houses and sacred places were adorned with tunjos and emeralds, and in some cases with the remains of human sacrifices.|$|E
25|$|Independently, {{there were}} {{investigations}} into the chemical nature of creosote. A study by F.K. Völkel revealed that the smell of purified creosote resembled that of guaiacol, and later studies by Heinrich Hlasiwetz identified a substance common to <b>guaiacum</b> and creosote that he called creosol, and he determined that creosote contained a mixture of creosol and guaiacol. Later investigations by Gorup-Besanez, A.E. Hoffmann, and Siegfried Marasse showed that wood-tar creosote also contained phenols, giving it a feature in common with coal-tar creosote.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the region}} is mostly tropical but differences in topography, soil and climatic conditions increase species diversity. Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are endemic. For example, guaiac wood (<b>Guaiacum</b> officinale), the flower {{of which is the}} national flower of Jamaica and the Bayahibe rose (Pereskia quisqueyana) which is the national flower of the Dominican Republic and the ceiba which is the national tree of both Puerto Rico and Guatemala. The mahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize. The caimito (Chrysophyllum cainito) grows throughout the Caribbean. In coastal zones there are coconut palms and in lagoons and estuaries are found thick areas of black mangrove and red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle).|$|E
2500|$|Vegetation in {{the area}} is divided into land and sea. Land {{vegetation}} includes evergreen tropical forest dominated by Bravaisia integerrima, Hymenaea courbaril and Manilkara zapota, deciduous tropical forest (the most abundant) dominated by Amphypterigium adstringens, Cochlosperum vitifolium, Cordia dentada and C. elaeagnoides, semideciduous tropical forest dominated by Astronium graveolens, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Annona primigenia and Bursera arborea, areas with dry scrubland with species such as Acacia cochilacantha, <b>Guaiacum</b> coulteri, Krameria cuspidate and Crossopetalum puberulum and sandy beach areas with Ipomoea pes-caprae, Heliotropium curassavicum and Okenia hypogaea. In lagoon areas, mangroves are evident as well. Economically important are the vast tracts of forest which cover the mountain areas, with [...] of forest in the Sierra de Petatlán and Coyuca de Benitéz alone as of 2007. Economically important species include amate (a type of fig and a traditional source of paper pulp), holm oak, various pine species, especially ocote, and oyamel. In many areas, especially in Troncones and Majahua, low hills of tropical deciduous forests stand next to the sea. Fauna is extremely varied with both land and aquatic species. Land species vary by altitude.|$|E

50|$|<b>Guaiacum</b> was {{a popular}} {{treatment}} {{in the sixteenth century}} and was strongly advocated by Ulrich Von Hutten and others. Because <b>guaiacum</b> came from Hispaniola where Columbus had landed, proponents of the Columbian theory contended that God had provided a cure in the same location from which the disease originated. In 1525, the Spanish priest Francisco Delicado, who himself suffered from syphilis, wrote El modo de adoperare el legno de India discussing the use of <b>guaiacum</b> for treatment of syphilis. Although <b>guaiacum</b> did not have the unpleasant side effects of mercury, <b>guaiacum</b> was not particularly effective, at least not beyond the short term, and mercury was thought to be more effective. Some physicians continued to use both mercury and <b>guaiacum</b> on patients. After 1522, the Blatterhaus — an Augsburg municipal hospital for the syphilitic poor — would administer <b>guaiacum</b> (as a hot drink, followed by a sweating cure) as the first treatment, and use mercury as the treatment of last resort.|$|E
50|$|The wood is {{obtained}} chiefly from <b>Guaiacum</b> officinale and <b>Guaiacum</b> sanctum, both small, slow growing trees. All {{species of the}} genus <b>Guaiacum</b> are now listed in Appendix II of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) as potentially endangered species. Demand for the wood has been reduced by modern materials science, {{which has led to}} polymer, alloys and composite materials that can take lignum vitae's place.|$|E

50|$|Lignum vitae is a wood, {{also called}} guayacan or <b>guaiacum,</b> and {{in parts of}} Europe known as pockholz, from trees of the genus <b>Guaiacum.</b> The trees are {{indigenous}} to the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America and have been an important export crop to Europe {{since the beginning of}} the 16th century.

50|$|<b>Guaiacum</b> officinale {{is one of}} {{two species}} {{yielding}} the true lignum vitae, the other being <b>Guaiacum</b> sanctum. Guaiac, a natural resin extracted from the wood, is a colorless compound that turns blue when placed in contact with substances that have peroxidase activity and then are exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Guaiac cards are impregnated with the resin and are used in determining whether stool contains blood. The heme portion of hemoglobin contains peroxidase and will catalyze the oxidation of guaiaconic acid when hydrogen peroxide is placed on the Guaiac card if blood is present in the stool.|$|E
