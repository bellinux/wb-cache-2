Olonā was also used for fishing nets and carrying baskets called kōkō. The fine cordage was once sought by many people around the world, like climbers and sailors, because of its incomparable strength and durability. Olonā was typically cultivated near an upland stream area which was used to soak the newly harvested fibers between 24-72 hours before placing it on long board and using a scraper (sometimes made out of shell or turtle) to remove the excess outer bark. Once the olonā was prepared and dry, there was so much fiber in the bark that it peels off in sheets of ribbon. The outer bark of olonā was typically stripped in the uplands and hung around necks as lei.|$|R
40|$|Knitted and {{woven textile}} {{structures}} {{are examples of}} doubly periodic structures in a thickened plane made out of <b>intertwining</b> <b>strands</b> of yarn. Factoring out the group of translation symmetries of such a structure {{gives rise to a}} link diagram in a thickened torus, as in [2]. Such a diagram on a standard torus in S 3 is converted into a classical link by including two auxiliary components which form the cores of the complementary solid tori. The resulting link, called a kernel for the structure, is determined by a choice of generators u, v for the group of symmetries. A normalised form of the multi-variable Alexander polynomial of a kernel is used to provide polynomial invariants of the original structure which are essentially independent of the choice of generators u and v. It gives immediate information about the existence of closed curves and other topological features in the original textile structure. Because of its natural algebraic properties under coverings we can recover the polynomial for kernels based on a proper subgroup from the polynomial derived from the full symmetry group of the structure. This enables two structures to be compared at similar scales, even when one has a much smaller minimal repeating cell than the other. Examples of simple traditional structures are given, and their Alexander data polynomials are presented to illustrate the techniques and results. ...|$|R

We then describe in more detail the cellular mechanisms responsible for the unlinking of DNA. No single strategy on its own accounts for the complete unlinking of chromosomes required for DNA segregation to proceed. Rather, it is the combined effects of topoisomerase action, chromosome organization and DNA-condensing proteins that allow the successful partitioning of chromosomes into dividing cells. Finally, we propose a model of chromosome structure, consistent with recent findings, that explains how the problem of unlinking is alleviated by the division of chromosomal DNA into manageably sized domains...|$|E

40|$|Helical {{structures}} are {{often found in}} nature, examples of which include deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), protein α-helices, and collagen. Helices may hold their particular shape through conformational restrictions, hydrogen bonding, or metal ion coordination. The term “helicates,” coined by Lehn, J. -M. et al. in 1987, refers specifically to those formed by metal ion coordination. 1 Helicates are typically composed of one to four <b>intertwining</b> <b>strands,</b> with some highly twisted structures extending {{into the realm of}} molecular knots. The focus here will be on double and triple stranded helicates, with an overview of classic bipyridine (bipy) and terpyridine (terpy) structures and representative examples of recent work, including sensor applications. Work on helicates was occurring before the term was coined, although expansion in the field did not occur until the late 1980 ’s followed by rapid growth in the late 1990 ’s. 2 Much of the early work, and some later work, involved the use of bipyridine and terpyridine moieties in the assembled ligands. These structures readily interact with a variety of metal ions allowing multiple topologies to be generated. Building on these basic structures, four recent articles from the field will be discussed. These include works by Constable, E. C. et al. and Quinodoz, B. et al. (continuations of classical topological studies), {{as well as those of}} Bokolinis, G. et al. and Oleksi, A. et al., (showing applications of helicates in sensing). 3 - 6 Constable, E.

It derives from a project in which teacher-researcher and student-participants co-constructed a Facebook group page about the students ’ scaffolded research into dyslexia. The study investigated an apparent paradox: that although literacy demands are often cited as barriers to learning and participation for students labelled with dyslexia, social networking technologies seem to motivate at least some such students to willingly undertake significant amounts of reading and writing. Two interrelated potential explanations are investigated to attempt to resolve this paradox. Firstly, that the social and collaborative nature of Facebook literacy events and practices, which promotes a sense of shared identity amongst the participants, is itself motivating. Secondly, that identity strongly influences engagement with texts. Three <b>intertwined</b> <b>strands</b> of identity work emerged from analysis of the data.

Des Moines Independent Community School District, the {{landmark}} student speech {{case in which}} the Supreme Court held that three students were protected by the First Amendment when they wore black armbands in their Des Moines, Iowa public schools to protest the Vietnam War. Looking at Supreme Court precedent alone, it would seem as though the Tinker tests were created out of whole cloth: the substantial or material disruption, reasonable anticipation of such disruption, and rights of others tests did not have much of a basis in earlier Supreme Court decisions. But, the district court in Tinker had employed the first two of these tests. For authority, it had looked to the Fifth Circuit’s decisions six weeks prior in two cases involving high school students’ speech about civil rights: Burnside v. Byars and Blackwell v. Issaquena County. Aside from Tinker’s citations to Burnside and Blackwell, those two cases - the roots of Tinker’s disruption tests - have largely been lost to history. Accordingly, this Article scrutinizes Burnside and Blackwell, considers lower courts’ applications of - and retreat from - the Burnside/Blackwell actual disruption test in the student speech context, and analyzes the presence of Burnside and Blackwell in the Tinker district court opinion and in various drafts of the Tinker Supreme Court opinion.

Our approach covers the large variation of repetitive braid structures using a family of compact procedural braid models. From these models, we produce a database of braid patches and use a robust random sampling approach for data fitting.

40|$|In Origins of the English Novel, Michael McKeon {{distinguishes between}} assimilationist and supersessionist {{iterations}} {{of the progressive}} narrative form; while most texts remain fundamentally elitist, he writes, supersessionist texts “seek the legitimation of a humble social group in its own terms. ” The disparity signals the presence of distinct, competing social fractions within the eighteenth-century middling sort: a polite, assimilationist fraction, and a more supersessionist trade and manufacturing community, which I term the commercial fraction. I argue that commercial authors have been consistently overlooked or misread by contemporaries and modern critics; the genteel authors and audiences who dominated contemporary literary discourse read commercial texts through the distortions of a polite lens, while modern literary scholars have based their analyses upon—and thereby perpetuated—these flawed ‘translations. ’ Although scholars have studied commercial authors such as Samuel Richardson as agents of an undifferentiated ‘middling’ culture, {{there has been no}} recognition of a tradition of distinct commercial rhetoric, no sustained analysis of the commercial fraction’s engagement with polite discourse. 		My introduction unpicks the <b>intertwined</b> <b>strands</b> of middling culture to discuss the commercial sort “in its own terms,” analyzing the social and rhetorical patterns in autobiographies and conduct treatises written by members of Britain’s commercial population. In the following chapters, I analyze commercial fiction as counterdiscourse, focusing primarily on three authors: Robert Dodsley, Samuel Richardson, and Robert Bage. These authors interrogate the polite dominance of public discourse—and empower themselves—by appropriating and rewriting its linguistic signs. They redefine virtue to privilege practical, self-interested conduct, including ambition, manual labor, and time management, and their texts reinterpret power by figuring the social contract as a decentralized and situational network of bonds rather than a unified, natural hierarchy. 	My dissertation ultimately encourages further scholarly engagement with the concept of commercial authorship. I argue, for instance, that commercial rhetoric created greater space for portrayals of empowered women, and it may have shaped the late-century radical interest in subaltern independence and agency. Studying patterns of commercial rhetoric allows us to interrogate conventional misreadings and opens up new ways to assess the intersections among eighteenth-century texts...|$|E
40|$|The {{past several}} decades have seen a Copernican shift in the {{paradigm}} of armed conflict, which the traditional Law of International Armed Conflict (LOIAC) canon has not fully matched. Standing out in stark relief {{against the backdrop of}} relative inactivity in LOIAC, is the surfeit of activity in the field of international human rights law, which has become a dramatic new force in the ancient realm of international law. Human rights law, heretofore not formally part of the traditional juridico-military calculus, has gained ever increasing salience in that calculus. Indeed, human rights law has ramified in such a manner that – given the nature of contemporary conflict, it is no longer possible to address one body of law without also dealing with the other. This has been the most dramatic trend for LOIAC in the last decade. It will doubtlessly continue. This article briefly addresses this interesting and important phenomenon {{in the context of the}} history of LOIAC and modern warfare, which has changed from large-scale clashes of the military might of sovereign states to conflict characterized by long-term guerilla and asymmetric warfare, concomitant counterinsurgency, and stability operations. The nature of contemporary stability operations and counterinsurgency has broadened the scope of military operations so that commanders must now engage in a range of activities not traditionally considered combat-related. Associated with this expanded range of military responsibility is an expanded range of legal responsibility. Hence, we arrive at the necessity and value of human rights law. We briefly identify the general implications of the legal trend and illuminate some notable aspects of the legal landscape that loom before military commanders and their advisors. The issue of where, when, and how human rights protections apply is essential to understanding their functionality. The treatment of detainees is a prime example of the expanded range of legal responsibility that implicates human rights law. Thus, our discussion of jurisdiction includes analysis of variations among some countries and various regional and international organizations, which differ in their positions on the proper extraterritorial application or jurisdictional scope of their own and international human rights norms. This includes analysis of recent interesting decisions from the British House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights. Finally, we discuss the Copenhagen Process, which began with the first Copenhagen Conference held in October 2007. The Copenhagen Process is an effort to establish a common platform for the handling of detainees which illustrates how <b>intertwined</b> <b>strands</b> of international human rights law and LOIAC have become. It may also represent a way, if not to cut the Gordian knot, then to move past it with a better recognition of how both legal strands will influence future military operations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the process of {{becoming}} and being a teacher as viewed by prospective teachers themselves and aims to contribute to the understanding of how teachers’ professional development can be promoted and supported during the early stages of professional learning. Studies have shown that our beliefs affect how and what we learn in a given situation and thus attempts to provide support for teachers’ professional development need to be based on an understanding of the learners’ perspective. Besides looking into teachers’ views of teacher learning, the study also scrutinises teachers’ views of the teaching profession, as it is assumed that a person’s learning preferences are affected by how one perceives the job of the teacher. The initial phases of professional learning, including the transition from teacher education into working life, have been identified as a highly influential period in terms of learning and development. As teachers evolve and develop, different needs are likely to come into focus and it was therefore considered important to take the whole transitional period into account. Thus, a longitudinal approach was chosen, enabling a follow up on how teachers’ views evolve as they progress from university into working life. The empirical study was carried out in a Finland-Swedish context and {{focuses on the}} evolving cognitions of a cohort of prospective language teachers (N= 20) as they progress through teacher education and into the workplace. The data are in the form of narrative essays and interviews and has been gathered in three different phases: 1) when the participants were student teachers 2) after the participants had completed teacher education and 3) after they had worked one or two years as teachers. The study has a longitudinal scope, is qualitative in nature and informed by a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. The two perspectives, becoming and being a teacher, are studied through the theoretical lens of two different, but <b>intertwined</b> <b>strands</b> of research: theories of teacher learning and professional development, on the one hand, and teacher cognition research, on the other hand. The results regarding the teachers’ views of the teaching profession during the early transitional phases of professional learning show that different aspects of the job are in focus at different times. From an initial focus on aspects of the job related to the classroom arena (e. g. teaching and relations to pupils), the arenas and scope of the job gradually broaden towards heightened concerns with internal aspects of the job (e. g. building a teacher identity) along with a heightened awareness of the teacher’s role on the school and societal arenas. As the views broaden, they become more holistic and interconnected, but also more complex and diversified, leaving the teachers in an emotional and tensional turmoil, where they have to prioritise, set limits and come to terms with clashing beliefs. When it comes to the teachers’ views of teacher learning, the results show that on a group level, a broad variety of learning opportunities are recognised. Individual preferences could be noted, as well as differences in terms of how the different learning opportunities are viewed and which functions these are seen to perform. The teachers’ views gradually evolve from more vague and narrow, towards more diversified, complex and interconnected. Furthermore, the findings show that practical experiences and experiential forms of learning are considered central throughout, whereas collaborative and more autonomous forms of learning are afforded less emphasis, especially with regard to learning in teacher education. Furthermore, the role of theory is largely downplayed and views regarding the functions of theory relatively narrow, as the participants found it difficult to connect these elements with the teacher’s job. The results thus highlight a need to attend to how elements of theory and practice are connected in teacher education and to broaden prospective teachers’ views regarding different forms of learning and to heighten their awareness of the intricate processes involved. The thesis concludes with a proposal of a holistic, dynamic and interconnected model of professional development, centering around three main arenas for teacher learning: the Practice arena, the Academic arena and the Collegial arena...|$|E

In addition to the challenges created by the infinite range of styles, existing modeling and capture techniques are particularly constrained by the geometric and topological complexities. We propose a data-driven method to automatically reconstruct braided hairstyles from input data obtained from a single consumer RGB-D camera. Our approach covers the large variation of repetitive braid structures using a family of compact procedural braid models. From these models, we produce a database of braid patches and use a robust random sampling approach for data fitting. We then recover the input braid structures using a multi-label optimization algorithm and synthesize the <b>intertwining</b> hair <b>strands</b> of the braids. We demonstrate that a minimal capture equipment is sufficient to effectively capture a wide range of complex braids with distinct shapes and structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{tradition}} of nineteenth-century pirate representation demonstrates a complex <b>intertwining</b> of the <b>strands</b> of popular literature and theatre. Popular theatrical performances included the latest technological developments, and their scripts appropriated fictional narratives and scenes from contemporary painting. Equally, novelists and painters used the theatrical staging of situation and character as modes of representation. As Martin Meisel points out, 'the shared {{structures in the}} representational arts constitute not just a common style but a popular style'. At the same time, Meisel argues, nineteenth-century arts and entertainment aspired 'to a union of inward signification, moral and teleological as well as affective, with a weighty, vivid, detailed and documented rendering of reality'. It is within this context that the pirate becomes {{a key figure in}} the complex discourse of performance conventions, which themselves embody outward signification and the desire for verisimilitude...|$|R
40|$|As a key {{molecule}} of Life, Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is {{the focus}} of numbers of investigations with the help of biological, chemical and physical techniques. From a physical point of view, both experimental and theoretical works have brought quantitative insights into DNA base-pairing dynamics that we review in this Report, putting emphasis on theoretical developments. We discuss the dynamics at the base-pair scale and its pivotal coupling with the polymer one, with a polymerization index running from a few nucleotides to tens of kilo-bases. This includes opening and closure of short hairpins and oligomers as well as zipping and unwinding of long macromolecules. We review how different physical mechanisms are either used by Nature or utilized in biotechnological processes to separate the two <b>intertwined</b> DNA <b>strands,</b> by insisting on quantitative results. They go from thermally-assisted denaturation bubble nucleation to force- or torque- driven mechanisms. We show that the helical character of the molecule, possibly supercoiled, can {{play a key role in}} many denaturation and renaturation processes. We categorize the mechanisms according to the relative timescales associated with base-pairing and chain degrees of freedom such as bending and torsional elastic ones. In some specific situations, these chain degrees of freedom can be integrated out, and the quasi- static approximation is valid. The complex dynamics then reduces to the diffusion in a low-dimensional free-energy landscape. In contrast, some important cases of experimental interest necessarily appeal to far-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics. Comment: Review Article, revised versio...|$|R
40|$|Saul Kripke famously {{argued that}} there are no facts about what people mean by the words and {{sentences}} they utter. His ‘skeptical paradox’, as he called it, has generated an enormous secondary literature. Indeed, it’s not an exaggeration to say that it gave birth to a new subfield of the philosophy of mind and language. Despite the degree of attention, however, I believe that the real source and character of Kripke’s skeptical doubts have never come into clear view. Previous commentary on Kripke has failed to grasp that the doubts fundamentally concern the possibility of a person’s following a rule. That might seem an absurd charge, given that everyone knows that Kripke conceives the skeptical paradox as a development of Wittgenstein’s remarks on rule following. But the point of the charge is that previous interpretations of the paradox go astray because they miss that its central target is the idea that person’s performance might be based upon a rule—that a rule might be her reason for proceeding as she does. The skeptical paradox belongs to the philosophy of rational explanation, of explanations that account for what people do or think by citing their reasons for doing or thinking so. That this feature of the paradox has been overlooked is partly Kripke’s fault. His exposition of the skeptical argument <b>intertwines</b> two <b>strands</b> without adequately distinguishing them. The secondary literature has picked up on one of these strands. But the material constituting this strand cannot make sense of crucial steps in the discussion; thus commentators are led to findRule-Following Skepticis...|$|R
40|$|Pepstatin A, a pentapeptide aspartyl {{protease}} inhibitor, can spontaneously polymerize into filaments {{having a}} helical substructure and, after negative staining, characteristic diameters ranging from 6 to 12 nm. Optical diffraction analysis demonstrated that these filaments {{consist of a}} 6 −nm−wide strand helically wound with a periodic pitch of 25 nm. Selected images suggest that these filaments may actually be composed of two, <b>intertwined</b> 6 −nm−wide <b>strands,</b> an hypothesis not at variance with the diffraction data. These filaments may extend over several micrometers. At low ionic strength and neutral pH, the critical concentration for pepstatin A filament assembly is 0. 1 mM. At higher pepstatin A concentrations or in physiological salt solutions, a variety of higher order structures were observed, including ribbons, sheets, and cylinders with both regular and twisted or irregular geometries. Pepstatin A polymerized into these higher order structures loses its ability to inhibit the aspartyl protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1. These results have implications not only for model studies on the polymerization of small peptides into higher order structures, {{but also for the}} practical development of soluble protease inhibitor...|$|R
