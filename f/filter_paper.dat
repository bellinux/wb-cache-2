5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

The analytical sensitivity of real-time UPL PCR on <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> was similar to conventional testing (virus isolation or conventional PCR) on organs or blood. In addition, blood-dried <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> were tested in ELISA for antibody detection and the observed sensitivity was very close to conventional detection on serum samples and gave comparable results. <b>Filter</b> <b>papers</b> were stored up to 9 months at 20 – 25 °C and for 2 months at 37 °C without significant loss of sensitivity for virus genome detection.

25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} by many different methods, including newborn screening, sweat testing, and genetic testing. As of 2006 in the United States, 10% of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth {{as part of}} newborn screening programs. The newborn screen initially measures for raised blood concentration of immunoreactive trypsinogen. Infants with an abnormal newborn screen need a sweat test to confirm the CF diagnosis. In many cases, a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty. Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the CFTR gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, in individuals with two normal copies of the CFTR gene. Due to these false positives, CF screening in newborns can be controversial. Most U.S. states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms (e.g. sinopulmonary disease and GI manifestations) prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating (pilocarpine). To deliver the medication through the skin, iontophoresis is used, whereby one electrode is placed onto the applied medication and an electric current is passed to a separate electrode on the skin. The resultant sweat is then collected on <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of sodium and chloride. People with CF have increased amounts {{of them in their}} sweat. In contrast, people with CF have less thiocyanate and hypothiocyanite in their saliva and mucus (Banfi et al.). In the case of milder forms of CF, transepithelial potential difference measurements can be helpful. CF can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{the source}} of {{mosquito}} blood meals is an important component for disease control and surveillance. Recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling has emerged as an effective tool for mosquito blood meal identification, using the abdomens of freshly engorged mosquitoes. In the field, mosquito abdomens are crushed on Whatman <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> to determine the host feeding patterns by identifying the origin of their blood meals. The aim {{of this study was to}} test whether crushing engorged mosquito abdomens on Whatman <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> was compatible with MALDI-TOF MS for mosquito blood meal identification. Both laboratory reared and field collected mosquitoes were tested. Sixty Anopheles gambiae Giles were experimentally engorged on the blood of six distinct vertebrate hosts (human, sheep, rabbit, dog, chicken and rat). The engorged mosquito abdomens were crushed on Whatman <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. 150 Whatman <b>filter</b> <b>papers,</b> with mosquitoes engorged on cow and goat blood, were preserved. A total of 77 engorged mosquito abdomens collected in the Comoros Islands and crushed on Whatman <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> were tested with MALDI-TOF MS. The MS profiles generated from mosquito engorged abdomens crushed on Whatman <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> exhibited high reproducibility according to the original host blood. The blood meal host was correctly identified from mosquito abdomens crushed on Whatman <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectra obtained after storage were stable regardless of the room temperature and whether or not they were frozen. The MS profiles were reproducible for up to three months. For the Comoros samples, 70 / 77 quality MS spectra were obtained and matched with human blood spectra. This was confirmed by molecular tools. The results demonstrated that MALDI-TOF MS could identify mosquito blood meals from Whatman <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> collected in the field during entomological surveys. The application of MALDI-TOF MS has proved to be rapid and successful, making it a new and efficient tool for mosquito-borne disease surveillance...|$|R
