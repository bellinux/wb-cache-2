50|$|The school {{offers a}} 3-year general {{education}} course and accepts new {{students at the}} beginning of each semester. The course aims to give participants the necessary qualifications to enter higher education or jobs requiring high school qualifications. Students must be at least 18 years old and demonstrate elementary Swedish language skills in order to be able to participate in classes. Students who have already attained some high school qualifications may take a shortened version of the course. However, at least one year's full-time study is required before a student becomes eligible for qualifications and a grade. Course participants may combine a number of core subjects (e.g. mathematics, Swedish, English, civics, religious studies and natural science) with extra subjects (e.g. film studies, art, computer studies and music) to create an <b>individual</b> <b>timetable.</b> Each semester includes at least one week dedicated to a specific theme in which all students and teaching staff participate.|$|E

40|$|Transferring {{from one}} vehicle to another is {{generally}} inevitable in public transportation. In urban areas this often includes changing between vehicles operated by different companies. It {{is well known}} that good transfer possibilities increase the attractiveness of public transportation. Since this is an important goal, in the present paper we study the synchronization of timetables between different operators with an <b>individual</b> <b>timetable</b> planning process. The synchronization task is a very complicated problem due to the large amount of transfer locations and possibilities {{and the fact that they}} are interrelated network-wide. Our main contributions are a model to evaluate transfer quality locally and globally and an interactive optimization approach that allows an integration of the power of mathematical optimization algorithms with the expertise of the planners. We demonstrate our approach by highlighting some results achieved for the public transportation network of the city of Kaiserslautern, situated in south-western Germany...|$|E

30|$|Students in {{the third}} year have a less tight {{timetable}} than they did in their first two years when more basic courses aimed at language skills are provided. Starting from the first term of the third year, students will have more professional courses which are highly academic and thus time-consuming. However, except Consecutive Interpretation, all the other courses are compulsory in nature; in this sense, English major students even when having a less tight schedule will have at least 4.8 periods a day excluding department-scale and University-scale electives aimed at individuals. Consecutive Interpretation is a department-scale elective open to the third-year English majors only. There are also University-scale electives open to all students of the same grade, regardless of their majors. These courses are only shown on students’ <b>individual</b> <b>timetables.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{accomplish}} {{more with}} fewer resources, many organizations are turning from costly traditional face-to-face (F 2 F) training to alternate methods, such as self-paced eLearning and distance learning. Distance learning is beneficial for various learning events, such as semester-long academic courses, {{which are often}} asynchronous, and shorter events, such as Webinars, which are typically synchronous. Although asynchronous methods, where learners interact with content and each other on <b>individual</b> <b>timetables,</b> can provide significant advantages, some learning experiences warrant synchronous real-time human interaction.

The terms are broken up by a 1 or 2 week half-term holiday. Holidays are long - four weeks at Christmas and Easter and ten over the Summer. During term time, school takes place {{six days a}} week, beginning at 8.20am with assembly. On Monday mornings this {{is led by the}} headmaster and takes place in the Academy Room (currently the Boys' Chapel). On the other five days it takes place in each playroom and is led by the playroom master, apart from Thursdays, which is a whole-school singing practice to prepare for the Sunday mass.

40|$|Variations of the {{examination}} timetabling problem {{have been investigated}} by the research community {{for more than two}} decades. The common characteristic between all problems {{is the fact that the}} definitions and data sets used all originate from actual educational institutions, particularly universities, including specific examination criteria and the students involved. Although much has been achieved and published on the state-of-the-art problem modelling and optimisation, a lack of attention has been focussed on the students involved in the process. This work presents and utilises the results of an extensive survey seeking student preferences with regard to their <b>individual</b> examination <b>timetables,</b> with the aim of producing solutions which satisfy these preferences while still also satisfying all existing benchmark considerations. The study reveals one of the main concerns relates to fairness within the students cohort; i. e. a student considers fairness with respect to {{the examination}} timetables of their immediate peers, as highly important. Considerations such as providing an equitable distribution of preparation time between all student cohort examinations, not just a majority, are used to form a measure of fairness. In order to satisfy this requirement, we propose an extension to the state-of-the-art examination timetabling problem models widely used in the scientific literature. Fairness is introduced as a new objective in addition to the standard objectives, creating a multi-objective problem. Several real-world examination data models are extended and the benchmarks for each are used in experimentation to determine the effectiveness of a multi-stage multi-objective approach based on weighted Tchebyceff scalarisation in improving fairness along with the other objectives. The results show that the proposed model and methods allow for the production of high quality timetable solutions while also providing a trade-off between the standard soft constraints and a desired fairness for each student...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND OR CONTEXT Teamwork is an {{integral}} component of any engineering degree, but students often have difficulty organising team meetings outside of class times due to discrepancies in their <b>individual</b> study <b>timetables</b> {{as well as their}} family and work commitments. Rich-media synchronous online technologies such as video/web conferencing and virtual worlds can be used to help address this problem by enabling anyplace, anytime interaction, {{while at the same time}} mirroring the communication modes students will encounter in their future workplaces. However, not much is known about how these technologies compare with one another for facilitating different types of collaborative learning task and in terms of their student-perceived affordances. PURPOSE OR GOAL In this study, the researchers sought to elicit student perceptions of and experiences using Adobe Connect, a 2 D web conferencing application with video capabilities, and iSee, a hybrid desktop video conferencing and 3 D virtual world environment. The goal was to examine, from a user standpoint, the appropriateness and efficacy of these software platforms for supporting student-directed project team meetings. Such research is of value to the academic community because it is important for educators and students to be able to make informed decisions about the modalities to be used for collaboration and concept representation, since these can impact heavily upon the effectiveness with which joint meaning-making and knowledge co-construction occur. APPROACH A quasi-experimental approach was adopted in which half of the student teams in a project based engineering subject were assigned to use Adobe Connect and the remaining half were assigned to use iSee for their online team meetings. The research design was specifically targeted at identifying differences that might exist between the Connect and iSee users in terms of: (a) time required to learn the software; (b) perceived ease of use; (c) perceived communicative affordances; (d) perceived enablement of co-presence, user/information representation, and collaboration; and (e) overall satisfaction. An end-of-semester survey was used to gather data from students relating to each of these aspects and to facilitate between-groups comparisons. DISCUSSION Basic measures of central tendency pointed to iSee requiring less time to learn and being easier to use than Adobe Connect, but the differences observed were not statistically significant at the. 05 alpha level. The survey data pertaining to perceived communicative affordances similarly tended to favour iSee, but the differences were again not statistically significant. However, iSee was rated as being effective at fostering co-presence and enabling collaboration by more students who used it than was the case for Connect, at a level approaching significance (p =. 090). A significantly higher proportion of iSee users than Connect users said they would recommend the use of the software for student team meetings (p =. 035), which can be seen as early evidence that iSee, with its combination of 3 D spatial interaction and video-based communication capabilities, lent itself to a more productive and enjoyable online collaboration experience within the application contex...|$|R
40|$|Ce texte examine le profil des travailleurs qui sont prêts à réduire volontairement leurs heures de travail pour participer à un {{programme}} départage de l'emploi. Nos résultats montrent que, contrairement aux enquêtes agrégées, les variables de capital humain (salaire, éducation), le statut marital, le sexe ainsi que la présence d'enfants en bas âge ne jouent aucun rôle dans la détermination de la probabilité à participer à un programme départage de travail. Par contre, l'âge et l'ancienneté affectent à la baisse cette probabilité. Par ailleurs, ce qui est plus révélateur c'est le fait que l'attitude à l'égard du loisir, ainsi que les caractéristiques de l'emploi occupé par les individus sont les principaux déterminants des choix des individus en termes de réduction des heures de travail. Unlike their U. S. counterparts, Canadian unions, governments, {{corporations and}} workers {{appear to be}} receptive to the debate on work-sharing programs. Canadian workers' desire to change working hours has been highlighted by Statistics Canada surveys. But corporate initiatives and union and government involvement are still in their early stages in {{both the public and}} the private sectors. One factor which emerged from the first Quebec experiments in this area, namely, the importance of voluntary participation in such programs, is instructive for other firms considering taking this route (see Huberman and Lanoie 1999). What would still be most helpful for these firms is information on the profile of workers likely to sign up for these programs. On the basis of the survey on work schedules and working conditions (1995), Drolet and Morissette (1997) maintain fhat those wishing to reduce their work week are professionals, managers and workers in the natural and social science sectors, have high income and education levels, as well as considerable seniority, hold permanent positions and already work long hours. Interestingly, those wishing to increase their working hours have a very different profile, so that redistribution of hours across the two groups is improbable. The objective of our research is to establish the profile of workers who accept to reduce their working hours in a work-sharing program. In particular, our findings will enable us to identify similarities and differences between the profile of workers who intendto accept a reduction in work hours, as highlighted by the national surveys, and that of workers who have actuallysigned up for a reduced work hours program. Our study sheds further light on the profile of these workers by including employmentrelated characteristics which the national surveys have not considered. Our study is based on a survey at the Jonquiere plant of the Alcan aluminium company. This survey was conducted in 1996 on nearly 1300 employees. With these data, we estimated the probability to sign up for the work-sharing program. We considered two groups of independent variables : (1) job characteristics and (2) characteristics of the worker (socio-demographic factors and variables which express attitudes toward leisure). Our results reveal that, unlike the national surveys, human capital variables (wages and education), marital status, sex and the presence of young children play no role in determining the probability of participating in a work-sharing program. On the other hand, age and seniority have a downward impact on this probability. Furthermore, what is more revealing {{is the fact that the}} attitude toward leisure (measured by the habit of banking overtime and the number of days of absence), as well as the characteristics of the jobs held by <b>individuals</b> (compressed <b>timetable,</b> possibility of doing overtime, office work, jobs related to operations and services) are the main factors determining individuals' choices with respect to reduced work hours. Este texto examina el retrato de los trabajadores que estan dispuestos a reducir voluntariamente sus horas de trabajo y participar a un programa de empleo compartido. Nuestros resultados muestran que contrariamente a las encuestas por datos compilados, las variables referentes al capital humano (salario, educaciòn), el estado civil, el sexo asi como la presencia de hijos de corta edad no juegan un roi en la détermination de la posibilidad de participar a un programa de trabajo compartido. Al contrario, la edad, el tiempo de servicios afectan, a la baja, esta probabilidad. De otro lado, es muy revelador el hecho que la actitud trente al esparcimiento asi como las caracteristicas del empleo ocupado sean los principales déterminantes de las opciones que adoptan los individuos respecto a la reduccion de las horas de trabajo...|$|R
