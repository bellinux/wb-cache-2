5|$|The Pizza Burger is {{a burger}} sold {{exclusively}} at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square, New York City that {{was introduced in}} September 2010. It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9.5inch sesame bun, sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni, mozzarella, basil pesto and marinara sauce. The whole burger contains more than the recommended daily allowance of calories for men at 2,520 calories, with 144grams of fat, 59g of which is saturated, and 3,780mg of sodium, {{more than double the}} recommended daily allowance for adults. However, according to Burger King's Vice President of global marketing, John Schaufelberger, the burger is not intended to feed just one person. <b>Each</b> <b>slice</b> has 420 calories, 24g fat (10g saturated), and 630mg sodium.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting <b>each</b> <b>slice</b> of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall.|$|E
25|$|Stone Roof, {{a private}} {{residence}} in Nagano, Japan, built in 2010, {{consists of a}} roof which is meant to spring from the ground, providing a complete enclosure to the home. A local stone was chosen to intimately relate itself to the preexisting natural environment of the mountain side. The exterior stone work is made light and airy by cutting each stone into thin slices and bracing <b>each</b> <b>slice</b> as a pivoting panel. In this way, the heavy quality of stone is diluted and provides the eye with an illusion of lightness, allowing light and air directly into the space within. With this choice of material and construction, {{a new kind of}} transparency emerges; one that not only frames nature the way a glass curtain wall would, but also deeply relates itself to the mountain side.|$|E

Non-uniform rational B-spline and FGM-based features have been proposed to present the models. Innovative algorithms for tool path optimization in RP/M have been developed, including: (1) a mixed tool path algorithm to generate contour/offset tool paths to represent varying material composition along the boundary of <b>each</b> <b>sliced</b> layer of a model and zigzag tool paths to present the internal area of a single material to simplify computing and processing and (2) adaptive algorithms to control the RP/M nozzle/print head to minimize the build time of <b>each</b> <b>sliced</b> layer according to the geometrical characteristics of the model.

500|$|She {{initially}} travelled to India to meet A. R. Rahman, {{but found}} it hard to communicate her ideas to him and the planned musical collaboration did not take place. Rahman did, however, provide M.I.A. with a number of contacts and allow her to use his studio, where 22 members of drumming group The Tapes were recorded for Kala. Producer Switch, who had initially travelled to India purely to engineer the planned sessions, ultimately became involved in the composition of several tracks for the album. A visit to Angola to work with DJ Znobia was cancelled after Znobia was involved in a car accident, but M.I.A. was able to record in Trinidad, Liberia, Jamaica and Australia. She and Switch relied heavily on Logic Pro, a digital audio workstation produced by Apple, and were able to capture vocals and background sounds outside the traditional studio environment, using a microphone and a Macbook Pro. The album features guest vocals from Afrikan Boy, The Wilcannia Mob, and Timbaland, and further collaborations with Switch, Blaqstarr, Morganics and Diplo. She likened the process of recording the album to [...] "making a big old marble cake with lots of different countries and influences.

Note that there is no intrinsic upper limit to chroma. Different areas of the color space have different maximal chroma coordinates.

This led to a wide range of possible chroma levels—up to the high 30s for some hue–value combinations (though it is difficult or impossible to make physical objects in colors of such high chromas, and they cannot be reproduced on current computer displays).

2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. <b>Each</b> <b>slice</b> is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

60|$|I {{had last}} week sent me {{by an unknown}} hand, a passage out of Plato,[3] with some hints how to apply it.

But Jupiter threatened, that if they did not mend their manners, he would give them t'other slit, and leave them to hop about in the shape of figures in basso relievo. The effect of this last threatening, my correspondent imagines, is now come to pass; and that as the first splitting was the original of love, by inclining us to search for our t'other half, so the second was the cause of hatred, by prompting us to fly from our other side, and dividing the same body into two, gave <b>each</b> <b>slice</b> the name of a party.|$|E
