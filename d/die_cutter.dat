50|$|Jacob Abraham (1723-1800) {{originated}} in the German duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He first cut precious gems {{at the age of}} thirteen in Polish Lissa. On {{the death of his father}} in 1731 the family moved to Sverin and then to Mecklenburg. In 1750 he married Beilchen, daughter of a teacher. His talents were recognised by Frederick the Great who confirmed his appointment at the Berlin mint as a <b>die</b> <b>cutter</b> in 1752 after a two-year apprenticeship. The following year, at the age of 31, he was transferred to Stettin as Royal Medalist to inaugurate a new mint. He also engraved small coins and Polish money before moving to Königsberg in 1755. Abraham fled before the Russian advance in the Seven Years' War (1756-63) to Danzig in 1758, Dresden in 1759 and Berlin in 1761 where he cut a new Prussian eagle for the thaler and struck medals in honour of Frederick’s military successes. In his biography Hoffmann describes Abraham as astute, intelligent and industrious; more of a craftsman than an artist. He worked at both the Neue Muntze and Berlin Altmuntze. In the last twenty years of his life his powers declined and much of his work was done collaboratively with his son Abraham Abramson. Forrer catalogued the better known works. Of note is the famous medal of Moses Mendelssohn where the portraiture is the work of the son. In the English series the marriage medal of George III is noteworthy. On his death in 1800, he was, most unusually, granted full civil rights, and laid to rest at the Hamburg Street Cemetery, Berlin (row 28, stone 19!) with many tributes.|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: Tetrahydrozoline {{has been}} {{introduced}} as new gingival retraction agent but its clinical efficacy with widely used conventional retraction agents has not been tested. Purpose: The {{study was designed to}} clinically evaluate efficacy of newer retraction agent tetrahydrozoline with two widely used retraction systems i. e., Expasyl retraction system and medicated retraction cords on basis of amount of gingival retraction. Materials and Methods: 30 subjects were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Maxillary Impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid for all subjects. Tray material was used for making the special tray. Latin Block Design was Used in the Study to avoid tissue fatigue. Retraction was done with aluminium chloride; Tetrahydrozoline and Expasyl according to Latin block design. Impressions were poured with die stone. Casts were retrieved and sections were made with <b>die</b> <b>cutter.</b> 3 mm thin slices were obtained. Each slice was used to measure the amount of retraction under stereomicroscope under 20 x and images were transferred to image analyser. Results: The amount of gingival retraction obtained by using aluminium chloride as gingival retraction agent was maximum (148238. 33 μm 2) compared to tetrahydrozoline (140737. 87 μm 2) and Expasyl (67784. 90 μm 2) ...|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of medieval coins were cold struck; the planchets were not heated. While medieval coin dies were largely made of iron, some dies have been discovered with a small region at {{the face of the}} die which is made of steel. As technology and the economy changed {{over the course of the}} Middle Ages, so did the techniques used to create coin dies. While most ancient coin dies used engraving very heavily, early medieval coinage was dominated by dies created mostly from punches, which displace the metal of the die instead of removing it. There is evidence of medieval <b>die</b> <b>cutters</b> using engraving tools to lay out designs, and to create detailed punches. However, engraving on the face of the die did not become commonplace until the early Renaissance.|$|R

In the ring die there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder.

40|$|The top {{priority}} of car-tire suppliers {{is to improve}} wetland grip force of the using tires, reduce the rolling resistance and the rolling noise of tires. It is urgent for the tire industry to research and develop high-performance tires to solve the above problems. They must use the high- performance synthetic rubber and auxiliary rubber to develop the most advanced manufacturing technologies and equipment. Silica, a kind of important tire auxiliary rubber, can significantly reduce the rolling resistance of tires, improve the grip force and properties resistant to ice, wetness or slippery of tires. In this paper, based on the conventional tire rubber forming technologies of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding, a study is made on the conical screw, the dewatering barrel, the drying barrel, the pin layout scheme, the expanding <b>die</b> head, <b>cutter</b> and the control system.
