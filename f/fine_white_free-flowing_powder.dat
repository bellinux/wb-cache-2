50|$|Cellulose acetate {{phthalate}} (CAP), {{also known}} as cellacefate and cellulosi acetas phthalas, is a commonly used polymer phthalate {{in the formulation of}} pharmaceuticals, such as the enteric coating of tablets or capsules and for controlled release formulations. It is a cellulose polymer where about half of the hydroxyls are esterified with acetyls, a quarter are esterified with one or two carboxyls of a phthalic acid, and the remainder are unchanged. Its CAS number is 9004-38-0. It is a hygroscopic <b>white</b> to off-white <b>free-flowing</b> <b>powder,</b> granules, or flakes. It is tasteless and odorless, though may have a weak odor of acetic acid. Its main use in pharmaceutics is with enteric formulations. It can be used together with other coating agents, e.g. ethyl cellulose. Cellulose acetate phthalate is commonly plasticized with diethyl phthalate, a hydrophobic compound, or triethyl citrate, a hydrophilic compound; other compatible plasticizers are various phthalates, triacetin, dibutyl tartrate, glycerol, propylene glycol, tripropionin, triacetin citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of "free" trimethylaluminum (TMA) in methylalumoxane (MAO) solutions {{can be highly}} detrimental {{to the performance of}} metallocene and "post-metallocene" olefin polymerization catalysts. The most used strategy to remove "free" TMA is to evaporate MAO solutions to dryness, until a <b>free-flowing</b> <b>white</b> <b>powder</b> ("solid MAO") is left. This procedure is tedious and potentially hazardous, because in some cases the distillate is a concentrated hydrocarbon solution of TMA. Moreover, "solid MAO" is poorly soluble in common polymerization media, and once in solution it can regenerate TMA to some extent. This communication reports on a facile alternative, which consists in the controlled addition of a sterically hindered phenol, such as 2, 6 -di-tert-butylphenol, effectively trapping "free" TMA. We show here that 2, 6 -di-tert-butylphenol/MAO solutions activate equally well the dichloro-precursors of well-known zirconocene and bis(phenoxyimine) Ti catalysts, and that their use in propene polymerization results in a substantially higher productivity, polymer stereoregularity, and/or average molecular mass compared with activation by MAO alone...|$|R

50|$|The Carr {{index is}} {{frequently}} used in pharmaceutics {{as an indication}} of the flowability of a <b>powder.</b> In a <b>free-flowing</b> <b>powder,</b> the bulk density and tapped density would be close in value, therefore, the Carr index would be small. On the other hand, in a poor-flowing powder where there are greater interparticle interactions, the difference between the bulk and tapped density observed would be greater, therefore, the Carr index would be larger. A Carr index greater than 25 is considered to be an indication of poor flowability, and below 15, of good flowability.|$|R

50|$|A random mixture can be {{obtained}} if two different <b>free-flowing</b> <b>powders</b> of approximately the same particle size, density and shape are mixed (see figure A). Only primary particles are present {{in this type of}} mixture, i.e., the particles are not cohesive and do not cling to one another. The mixing time will determine the quality of the random mixture. However, if powders with particles of different size, density or shape are mixed the segregation can occur. Segregation will cause separation of the powders as, for example, lighter particles will be prone to travel {{to the top of the}} mixture whereas heavier particles are kept at the bottom.|$|R

50|$|If a <b>free-flowing</b> <b>powder</b> {{is mixed}} with a {{cohesive}} powder an interactive mixture can be obtained. The cohesive particles adhere to the free-flowing particles (now called carrier particles) to form interactive units {{as shown in figure}} B. An interactive mixture may not contain free aggregates of the cohesive powder, which means that all small particles must be adhered to the larger ones. The difference from an ordered mixture is instead that all carrier particles {{do not need to be}} of the same size and a different number of small particles attached to each one. A narrow size range of the carrier particles is preferred to avoid segregation of the interactive units. In practice a combination of a random mixture and an interactive mixture may be obtained which consists of carrier particles, aggregates of the small particles and interactive units.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} obtain {{encapsulated}} lycopene in a powder form, using either spray-drying or molecular inclusion with beta -cyclodextrin (beta -CD) followed by freeze-drying.

Lycopene- beta -CD complexes were only formed at a molar ratio of 1 : 4, and irregular structures of different sizes that eventually formed aggregates, {{similar to those of}} beta -CD, were observed after freeze-drying.
