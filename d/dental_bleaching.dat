The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the influence of rebonding and bleaching on the release of metallic ions and microstractures of admixed and spherical amalgams. Materials and Methods: This experimental in vitro study was performed on 96 Class V cavities (3. 5 mm in length, 2 mm in width and depth) prepared on sound human premolars and restored with amalgams containing spherical and admixed particles. In half of the samples of each amalgam type rebonding procedure was carried out with Scotchbond Multi-purpose adhesive system and Guardian Seal resin sealant. Then half of the amalgam restorations, with or without rebonding, were exposed to 30 % carbamide peroxide (n = 12). The amount of metallic ions released from amalgams was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Surface topography and compositions of two samples in each group were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Data were analyzed by t-test and multivariate ANOVA (α = 0. 05). Results: 30 % carbamide peroxide gel caused a significant increase in Hg released from amalgams in non-rebonded groups (p value < 0. 001). There was no significant difference in ion release from spherical and admixed amalgams (p value = 0. 73). Rebonding resulted in significant reduction in Hg release (p value = 0. 007). Conclusion: Exposure of spherical and admixed amalgams to 30 % carbamide peroxide gel, without rebonding, caused a significant increase in Hg release from amalgam and changed amalgam microstructure.

Nanotribological and nanomechanical properties are proper displays for <b>dental</b> performance of <b>bleached</b> teeth. The {{purpose of the}} research was to reveal the effect of bleaching and remineralization on the nanotribological and nanomechanical properties of teeth in wet environment. The specimens were divided into four groups according to the bleaching products used: 12  % hydrogen peroxide (HP) (12 HP group); 15  % carbamide peroxide (CP) (15 CP group); 35  % CP (35 CP group); and artificial saliva (control group). The nanotribological and nanomechanical property changes of tooth enamel after bleaching and remineralization were evaluated respectively by nanoscratch and nanoindentation tests in wet environment, imitating the wet oral environment. The morphology changes were evaluated by statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After bleaching, 12 HP group and 15 CP group showed increased scratch depth with more pile ups on the scratch edges, decreased nanohardness, and corroded surface appearance. While the 35 CP group showed an increase in nanoscratch depth, no change in nanohardness and surface appearance was observed. The control group showed no change in these measurements. After remineralization, the three bleaching groups showed decreased nanoscratch depth and no change of nanohardness compared with the bleached teeth. And the control group showed no changes in nanotribological and nanomechanical properties. The nanotribological and nanomechanical properties of the 12 HP group and 15 CP group were affected by bleaching, but the nanotribological properties recovered partly and the nanomechanical properties got no change after 1  week of remineralization. As for the 35 CP group, the nanotribological properties were influenced and the nanomechanical properties were not affected. These results remind us of taking actions to protect our teeth during bleaching.|$|R
40|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> is {{a process}} making teeth look whiter. Bleaching may be {{performed}} in two methods; by using bleaching products or non-bleaching products. Bleaching products contain peroxide assisting to remove intrinsic and extrinsic stain, resulting in the changing of original color of teeth.

The use of bleaching products is not always safe, therefore, they should be assumed that their benefits are over their recognized biological risk. The choice of bleaching method for children depends on type and depth of the stain, and discoloring. Stain on the enamel surface can be removed by microabration, deeper stain is removed by bleaching.

Chapter 1 reports the suitability of this approach in extracted human teeth, {{as well as in}} a selected clinical case. Visual improvement in the color lighteness of the s-ACLs was observed and reported in photographs. In order to systematically study the impact of <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> on the s-ACLs, we developed in vitro models simulating the development of metallic and non-metallic s-ACLs (Chapter 2). Human dental specimens were submitted to incipient caries-like lesion formation, followed by a 5 -day cycling protocol based on remineralization and staining episodes. The created lesions were then bleached (simulating in-office/ 40 % hydrogen peroxide). Color change was measured spectrophotometrically at baseline, after lesion creation, staining/remineralization cycling and bleaching; while mineral loss and lesion depth were quantified by transversal microradiography after staining/remineralization cycling. Metallic s-ACLs were darker, more remineralized and more difficult to bleach, compared to the non-metallic ones (p< 0. 05). In Chapter 3, we tested the efficacy and safety of different <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> systems (simulating at-home/ 15 % carbamide peroxide and in-office/ 40 % hydrogen peroxide) using the in vitro models previously developed. Similar methods and outcomes were used, with the addition of demineralization after bleaching to simulate and test changes in caries susceptibility. At-home bleaching showed greater efficacy in color improvement compared to in-office (p< 0. 05), but also increased susceptibility to further demineralization (p< 0. 05), regardless of the type of stain.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} 10 % sodium ascorbate (10 SA), in gel (10 SAg) or aqueous solution (10 SAs) formulations, on fracture resistance of endodontically treated tooth submitted to <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> procedures with 15 % hydrogen peroxide associated with titanium dioxide (15 HP-TiO 2) nanoparticles and photoactivated by LED-laser. Material and methods: Forty maxillary premolars were endodontically-treated and embedded in acrylic resin up to the cement-enamel junction. The specimens were divided into four groups (n= 10) : G 1 (negative control) : no bleaching, coronal access restored with composite resin; G 2 (positive control) : three <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> sessions using 15 HP-TiO 2 and LED-laser photoactivation and restored with composite resin (positive control); G 3 (10 SAg) : similar procedures to G 2, but applied 10 SA, in gel formulation, for 24 hours before restoration; G 4 (10 SAs) : similar procedures to G 3, but applied 10 SA, in aqueous solution formulation. The 15 HP-TiO 2 was applied on buccal and lingual surfaces of the crown tooth and inside the pulp chamber and photoactivated by LED-laser. Between each bleaching session, the teeth were maintained in artificial saliva, at 37 oC, for 7 days. In sequence, the teeth were submitted to fracture resistance testing using an eletromechanical machine test. The data was analyzed using Kruskal Wallis test (p = 0. 05) Results: There are no differences significant among the groups in relation to fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth (p> 0. 05). Conclusions: The use of 10 % sodium ascorbate, in gel or aqueous solution formulations, did not interfered on the fracture resistance teeth after <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> using 15 HP-TiO 2 and LED-laser photoactivation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and objective: <b>Dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> is an effective, {{relatively}} simple and noninvasive technique. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of catalase, 2 % chlorhexidine gel, and 1 % sodium hypochlorite on the microtensile bond strength to enamel of bovine teeth submitted to internal and external bleaching with 35 % hydrogen peroxide. Material and methods: Sixty bovine incisors were used. They had their debris removed, washed in tap water and stored frozen. The samples were divided into five experimental groups according to the treatment applied after bleaching (n = 12) : 1 − control/no bleaching (C); 2 − catalase (CA); 3 − 2 % chlorhexidine gel (CG); 4 − 1 % sodium hypochlorite (SH); 5 − distilled water (DW). For microtensile test, samples were prepared into blocks of enamel/resin, which were sectioned to obtain hourglass-like specimens. Bond strength was calculated in MPa and data analyzed statistically by Anova (p < 0. 05). Results: Microtensile bond strength means decreased in comparison to control group, but no statistically significant difference between groups was found. Conclusion: The substances used after <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> did not result in statistically significant microtensile bond strength means of the tested groups...|$|E

Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), is an autosomal dominant disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 1, 000, 000 individuals. It is generally characterized by orofacial manifestations, including enamel hypoplasia, retained primary teeth, and impacted permanent and supernumerary teeth. The successful treatment involving a timing intervention (orthodontic-maxillofacial surgeons-restorative) is already described. However, the restorative treatment might improve the aesthetic final result in dentistry management {{for patients with}} cleidocranial dysplasia. Objective. Therefore, this clinical report presents a conservative restorative management (enamel microabrasion, <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching,</b> and direct composite resin) for aesthetic solution for a patient with CCD. Clinical Considerations. The cosmetic remodeling is a conservative, secure, and low cost therapy that {{can be associated with}} other procedures such as enamel microabrasion and <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> to achieve optimal outcome. Additionally, the Golden Proportion can be used to guide dental remodeling to improve the harmony of the smile and the facial composition. Conclusions. Thus, dentists must {{know and be able to}} treat dental aesthetic problems in cleidocranial dysplasia patients. The intention of this paper is to describe a restorative approac...|$|E
40|$|Superficial {{irregularities}} {{and certain}} intrinsic {{stains on the}} dental enamel surfaces can be resolved by enamel microabrasion, however, treatment for such defects need to be confined to the outermost regions of the enamel surface. <b>Dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> and resin-based composite repair are also often useful for certain situations for tooth color corrections. This article presented and discussed the indications and limitations of enamel microabrasion treatment.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> on the pulp tissue of diabetic rats over the histological aspects and proinflammatory cytokines regulation. Methods: Twenty-eight Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (N) normoglycemic; (NBle) normoglycemic-bleached, (D) diabetic, (DBle) diabeticbleached. Fourteen animals reveiced a 150 mg/kg dose of alloxan for diabetes induction, via IM. After 3 days, all animals were anesthetized and the <b>dental</b> <b>bleaching</b> performed using 35 % hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) gel (Whiteness HP Maxx) in the right maxillary molars for 30 minutes. Left upper molars were used as control. Two and 30 days after the animals were euthanized, and the hemi-maxillae processed for histological and histochemistry analysis. Qualitative analyses were performed for inflammatory reaction and immunolabelling, and quantitative for pulp chamber area reduction and collagen fibers. The results were submitted to statistical analysis (p 0. 05). However, {{there was a significant}} difference when NBle and DBle groups were compared with regards to reduction of the pulp chamber area due the presence of reactionary dentin deposition (p 0. 05). Entretanto, houve diferença significante quando comparados os grupos NCla e DCla em relação à redução da área da câmara pulpar devido a deposição de dentina reacionária [...] ...|$|E
