40|$|We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of thin <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> that are bent and strained {{under the influence of}} weak, smooth confinement. We show that the emerging shapes exhibit the coexistence of two types of domains that differ in their characteristic stress distributions and energies, and reflect different constraints. A focused-stress patch is subject to a geometric, piecewise-inextensibility constraint, whereas a diffuse-stress region is characterized by a mechanical constraint - the dominance of a single component of the stress tensor. We discuss the implications of our findings for the analysis of <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> that are subject to various types of forcing. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to PR...|$|R

40|$|Buckling and {{wrinkling}} instabilities are {{failure modes}} of <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> that are avoided {{in the traditional}} material design. Recently, a new paradigm has appeared where these instabilities are instead being utilized for high-performance applications. Multiple approaches such as heterogeneous gelation, capillary stresses, and confinement {{have been used to}} shape thin macroscopic <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets.</b> However, it remains a challenge to shape two-dimensional selfassembled monolayers at colloidal or molecular length scales. Here, we show the existence of a curvature instability that arises during the crystallization of finite-sized monolayer membranes of chiral colloidal rods. While the bulk of the membrane crystallizes, its edge remains fluid like and exhibits chiral ordering. The resulting internal stresses cause the flat membrane to buckle macroscopically and wrinkle locally. Our results demonstrate an alternate pathway based on intrinsic stresses instead of the usual external ones to assemble non-Euclidean sheets at the colloidal length scale...|$|R

The bond stresses are calculated by Fourier integral and modified point-matching techniques. The effects on the bond stresses of varying the length/spacing ratio and Poisson’s ratio for the matrix are investigated.

40|$|The crumpling of a {{thin sheet}} can be {{understood}} as the condensation of elastic energy into a network of ridges which meet in vertices. Elastic energy condensation should occur in response to compressive strain in elastic objects of any dimension greater than 1. We study elastic energy condensation numerically in 2 -dimensional <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> embedded in spatial dimensions 3 or 4 and 3 -dimensional <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> embedded in spatial dimensions 4 and higher. We represent a sheet as a lattice of nodes with an appropriate energy functional to impart stretching and bending rigidity. Minimum energy configurations are found for several different sets of boundary conditions. We observe two distinct behaviors of local energy density fall-off away from singular points, which we identify as cone scaling or ridge scaling. Using this analysis we demonstrate that there are marked differences in the forms of energy condensation depending on the embedding dimension.

40|$|We study {{steady-state}} oscillations of {{an elastic}} Hele-Shaw cell excited by traveling pressure waves over its upper surface. The fluid within the cell is bounded by two asymmetric <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> which {{are connected to}} a rigid surface via distributed springs and modeled by the linearized plate theory. Modal analysis yields the frequency response of the configuration {{as a function of}} three parameters: the fluidic Womersley number and two ratios of elastic stress to viscous pressure for each of the sheets. These ratios, analogous to the Capillary number, combine the effects of fluid viscosity and the sheets inertia, bending and tension. The resonance frequencies of the configuration include the resonance frequency of the upper sheet, and the resonance frequency of both sheets with a constraint of constant gap. Near the resonance frequency of the upper sheet, the fluid pressure is identical in amplitude and phase to the external excitation. For configurations where both sheets are near resonance, small changes in frequency yield significant modification of the fluidic pressure. In addition, a new resonance frequency is observed, related to the interaction between motion of fluid parallel to the <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> and relative <b>elastic</b> displacements of the sheets. The ratio of the amplitude of the fluidic pressure to the external pressure is presented vs. frequency for several characteristic solid and fluid properties, yielding a bandpass filter behaviour. For configurations with a rigid lower surface the pressure ratio is unity at the passband, while for two <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> pressure amplification or reduction occurs near the resonance frequencies. The results presented here may allow to utilize elastic Hele-Shaw configurations as protective surfaces and mechanical filters...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe study {{impacts of}} a rigid body on a thin <b>elastic</b> <b>sheet</b> {{floating}} on a liquid. When {{struck by a}} solid object of small size, the <b>elastic</b> <b>sheet</b> deforms and waves propagate in and on the membrane. The impact triggers a longitudinal elastic wave effectively stretching the membrane. The hydroelastic transverse wave that propagates in the stretched domain is similar to capillary waves on a free surface with an equivalent `surface tension' that results from the stretching of the elastic membrane. Two limiting cases, for which a self-similar solution can be computed, corresponding to short and long times are identified. Surprisingly, our study reveals that the fluid-body system behaves as a regular liquid-gas interface, but with an effective surface tension coefficient that scales linearly with the impact velocity...|$|E

It is shown that the model can explain both the deflection of the lithosphere and the gravity anomalies observed along four profiles across the Apennine convergent system in Italy.

In the continuity of our previous work on viscous wakes, we study theoretically the effects of an external pressure disturbance moving at constant speed along {{the surface of a}} thin lubricated <b>elastic</b> <b>sheet.</b> In the comoving frame, the imposed pressure field creates a stationary deformation of the free interface that spatially vanishes in the far-field region. The shape of the wake and the way it decays depend on the speed and size of the external disturbance, as well as the rheological properties of both the elastic and liquid layers.

30|$|To {{study the}} {{lithosphere}} flexural strength, the theory response and cross-correlation functions are calculated {{based on the}} lithosphere model of the sheet flexure, the response function and cross correlation functions are explained in the actual calculation, and the flexural strength of the lithosphere is then determined. The lithosphere model of the sheet flexure considers the flexural deflection of the <b>elastic</b> <b>sheet</b> (corresponding to lithosphere) on non-viscous, incompressible fluid (corresponding to asthenosphere) with topographic load. The so-called sheet refers to the vertical displacement with a flexural wavelength {{much larger than the}} plate thickness and deflection.

40|$|Numerically {{simulating}} deformations in thin <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> is {{a challenging}} problem in computational mechanics due to destabilizing compressive stresses {{that result in}} wrinkling. Determining the location, structure, and evolution of wrinkles in these problems has important implications in design and {{is an area of}} increasing interest in the fields of physics and engineering. In this work, several numerical approaches previously proposed to model equilibrium deformations in thin <b>elastic</b> <b>sheets</b> are compared. These include standard finite element-based static post-buckling approaches as well as a recently proposed method based on dynamic relaxation, which are applied to the problem of an annular sheet with opposed tractions where wrinkling is a key feature. Numerical solutions are compared to analytic predictions of the ground state, enabling a quantitative evaluation of the predictive power of the various methods. Results indicate that static finite element approaches produce local minima that are highly sensitive to initial imperfections, relying on a priori knowledge of the equilibrium wrinkling pattern to generate optimal results. In contrast, dynamic relaxation is much less sensitive to initial imperfections and can generate low-energy solutions {{for a wide variety of}} loading conditions without requiring knowledge of the equilibrium solution beforehand...|$|R

Implementation of such configurations inherently takes place over finite domains and often requires pre-stretching of the sheet. Under the assumptions of strong pre-stretching and small deformations of the lubricated <b>elastic</b> <b>sheet,</b> we derive Green's functions describing the deformation in a finite domain due to external forces acting either directly on the sheet or through the fluid, accounting for both bending and stretching effects.
