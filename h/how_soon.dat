5|$|Hirokazu Yashuhara of Sonic Team went to England and {{fine-tuned}} {{the game}} {{due to lack}} of time for communication. Technical and scheduling issues caused Sato to change the game design, leading to a dispute with producer Yuji Naka, and Sato removed his name from the credits. The game's final release would be first in North America on 18 November 1997, with releases in other regions occurring in late 1997 for the Sega Saturn, and into 1998 for the PC version. The PC versions allowed the user to alter graphics details to get the game to run optimally on different computers. Options include allowing to change between software rendering and 3D acceleration, or adjusting the game's draw distance, affecting <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> objects in the distance are visible. Like many other previous Sonic games during this time period, a largely unrelated Sonic R game was released as a Tiger Electronics LCD handheld game around the same time in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
25|$|Between 1917 and 1922, the Fordson was for {{tractors}} {{somewhat like}} the Ford Model T was for automobiles—it captured the public's imagination and widely popularized the machine, with a reliable design, {{a low price}} affordable for workers and farmers, a widespread dealership network, and a production capacity for large numbers. Just as the Model T helped the public to appreciate <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> cars and trucks might replace most horses in transport, the Fordson helped people to appreciate <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> tractors might replace most horses in farming (advancing the mechanisation of agriculture). As with cars, Ford never had the market to itself, but it dominated {{the market for a}} time (for cars, roughly 1910-1925; for tractors, roughly 1917-1925). Ford was the only automotive firm to sell cars, trucks and tractors simultaneously from 1917 to 1928.|$|E

25|$|The {{first three}} layers of {{modeling}} {{are used to}} determine the long-term, or Time Independent, estimates of the magnitude, location, and frequency of potentially damaging earthquakes in California. The Time Dependent model is based on the theory of elastic rebound, that after an earthquake releases tectonic stress there will be some time before sufficient stress accumulates to cause another earthquake. In theory, this should produce some regularity in the earthquakes on a given fault, and knowing the date of the last rupture is a clue to <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> the next one can be expected. In practice this is not so clear, in part because slip rates vary, and also because fault segments influence each other, so a rupture on one segment triggers rupturing on adjacent segments. One of the achievements of UCERF3 is to better handle such multifault ruptures.|$|E
25|$|Further, on March 28, 2017, Trump {{signed an}} {{executive}} order to rewrite President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan. Much of this incentive is driven by expanding the workforce in the coal industry, however it is still undetermined <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> this will take affect. With continued trends in repealing past rules and regulations regarding Climate change under the Trump administration, the commitment to the Paris climate agreement held at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference is under question. Uncertainty {{about the development of}} this debate sparks much global controversy and unclarity in the reactions and future prognoses of climate and environmental politics. While international concerns are expressed, economists do not think that the proposed repeals will have much effect. Demand for coal on the national market has been declining and is still low, so that changes to the pollution standards and greenhouse gas emissions do not actually change the market drastically.|$|E

500|$|From All Saints, Olivier {{went on to}} St Edward's School, Oxford, from 1920 to 1924. He {{made little}} mark until his final year, when he played Puck in the school's {{production}} of A Midsummer Night's Dream; his performance was {{a tour de force}} that won him popularity among his fellow pupils. In January 1924, his brother left England to work in India as a rubber planter. Olivier missed him greatly and asked his father <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> he could follow. He recalled in his memoirs that his father replied, [...] "Don't be such a fool, you're not going to India, you're going on the stage." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush {{therefore}} {{commissioned a}} review of the uranium project by the National Academy of Sciences. The review committee was chaired by Arthur Compton, with physicists Ernest O. Lawrence, John C. Slater, and John H. Van Vleck and chemist William D. Coolidge as its other members. [...] It issued a favorable report on May 17, 1941, recommending an intensified effort, but Bush was troubled by the emphasis on nuclear power instead of nuclear weapons, and had two engineers, Oliver E. Buckley from the Bell Telephone Laboratories and L. Warrington Chubb from Westinghouse added to produce a second report with an emphasis on estimating <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> practical benefits could be expected.|$|E
500|$|The {{contract}} {{started in}} May 1930, but the studio found little for Wodehouse to do, {{and he had}} spare time {{to write a novel}} and nine short stories. He commented, [...] "It's odd <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> one comes to look on every minute as wasted that is given to earning one's salary." [...] Even when the studio found a project for him to work on, the interventions of committees and constant rewriting by numerous contract authors meant that his ideas were rarely used. In a 2005 study of Wodehouse in Hollywood, Brian Taves writes that Those Three French Girls (1930) was [...] "as close to a success as Wodehouse was to have at MGM. His only other credits were minimal, and the other projects he worked on were not produced." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} Constable West spoke to Bamber {{again on the}} telephone; Bamber {{apparently}} complained {{about the time the}} police were taking, saying: [...] "When my father rang he sounded terrified." [...] He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it would make a difference to <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, {{the video}} for Branch's fourth single [...] "I Am America" [...] was {{released}} on YouTube. Her husband, Michael Branch, wrote the song partly in response to criticism of the Tea Party protests from Democrats, while also drawing on his own difficulties in life. In an interview for Billy Kelly of the Washington Times' Tea Party Report, Branch told <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> after her husband wrote the song he had her quickly learn the lyrics and then recorded her performing the song. She originally felt the song was too confrontational for her, but decided the message was so important that she should record the song. In the music video, footage of Tea Party rallies is interspersed with scenes of Branch singing on a sound stage and kids holding signs containing political messages and scripture. [...] "I Am America" [...] was played on the July 7, 2010, broadcast of Glenn Beck's radio show and a week later Fox News host Bill O'Reilly devoted {{a portion of his}} “Pinheads and Patriots” segment to the song, saying that [...] "for honoring legitimate protest" [...] Branch was a patriot. About 21 days after being uploaded the video had nearly 475,000 views. [...] "I Am America" [...] soon became a popular song with the Tea Party movement and has been described as the movement's anthem. The New York Times described Branch as having a [...] "dynamic presence" [...] on stage when singing the song.|$|E

500|$|The {{name change}} of the {{legislation}} reflected Brownlee's growing belief that farmers' financial troubles were due to factors more systemic than lack of rain. [...] Angry over the federal government's decision to allow the first incarnation of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) to lapse, many Albertan farmers began to advocate the [...] "pooling" [...] of their wheat, which would render individual farmers less susceptible to the machinations of grain speculators by introducing collective marketing, with each farmer receiving an averaged, identical price. Farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were more adamant about {{the return of the}} CWB; Prime Minister King eventually agreed to its re-creation, provided that at least two of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba passed enabling legislation and found the personnel necessary to sit on the Board. [...] By June 1923, the provinces had not found anybody suitable. Interest in pooling experienced a resurgence. [...] In July, a UFA meeting, which Brownlee attended as the government's representative, endorsed the creation of a wheat pool as soon as practicable. Brownlee and his cabinet colleague Richard Gavin Reid undertook an investigation of <b>how</b> <b>soon</b> this might be, which included a trip to San Francisco to meet with Aaron Sapiro, an American agricultural cooperative leader. Sapiro proclaimed that a wheat pool could be organized in a few weeks, though both Brownlee and Reid disagreed and returned to Canada committed to caution. [...] However, in their absence the Edmonton Journal and Calgary Herald had invited Sapiro to tour Alberta, and his speeches stirred up extravagant expectations among UFA members for immediate action, in time for the new organization to market the 1923 crop.|$|E
