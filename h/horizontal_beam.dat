5|$|Fragment of a Crucifixion is a 1950 canvas by the Irish-born, English figurative painter Francis Bacon, {{housed in}} the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. The {{painting}} shows two animals engaged in brutal struggle. The upper figure, which may be a dog or a cat, crouches over a chimera and is {{at the point of}} kill. It stoops on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam</b> of a T-shaped structure, which may signify Christ's cross. The painting contains thinly sketched passer-by figures, who seem oblivious to the central drama.|$|E
25|$|An optical {{keyboard}} technology utilizes {{light emitting}} devices and photo sensors to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors {{are located in the}} perimeter, mounted on a small PCB. The light is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams (most commonly vertical beam and <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam)</b> to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam).</b>|$|E

In 1958 a second antenna, [...] high by [...] long (called the Cinerama antenna), and new 1.2-megawatt {{transmitters}} were installed as part of a modification kit which provided three additional <b>horizontal</b> <b>beams,</b> a seven-beam vertical fan, and greater range capability.|$|R

50|$|Multiple {{interlocking}} bracket {{sets are}} formed {{by placing a}} large wooden block (dou) on a column to provide a solid base for the bow-shaped brackets (gong) that support the beam or another gong above it. The function of dougong is to provide increased support for {{the weight of the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>beams</b> that span the vertical columns or pillars by transferring the weight on <b>horizontal</b> <b>beams</b> over a larger area to the vertical columns. This process can be repeated many times, and rise many stories. Adding multiple sets of interlocking brackets or dougong reduces the amount of strain on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>beams</b> when transferring their weight to a column. Multiple dougong also allows structures to be elastic and to withstand damage from earthquakes.|$|R

On the side façade, ribs create a vertical rhythm.|$|E
25|$|A lintel is a <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam</b> {{spanning}} {{the gap between}} two posts. Some lintels serve a structural purpose, serving to support {{the weight of the}} superstructure, while others are purely decorative in purpose. The lintels at Banteay Srei are beautifully carved, rivalling those of the 9th century Preah Ko style in quality.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame of}} the {{building}} is composed largely of oak. The roof frame consists of six sets of rafters. The four interior trusses are composed of doubled rafters, rafter ties, and king posts. The king posts are braced longitudinally through the building by <b>horizontal</b> <b>beams</b> linking them at mid-height, and by diagonal braces which extend from points near the tops and bottoms of the king posts to the midpoints of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R

25|$|Occasionally, scourging preceded crucifixion, {{which would}} cause the {{condemned}} to lose {{a large amount of}} blood, and approach a state of shock. The convict then usually had to carry the <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam</b> (patibulum in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross. Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and four soldiers. When it was done in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (stipes) could even be permanently embedded in the ground. It's claimed by certain religious texts that the victims of crucifixion were stripped naked before being put on the cross—all the New Testament gospels describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{say there}} were two {{possible}} ways of erecting the stauros, which {{would probably have been}} not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam</b> and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice.|$|E
25|$|Naqsh-e Rustam is the {{necropolis}} of the Achaemenid dynasty (500–330 BC), {{with four}} large tombs cut {{high into the}} cliff face. These have mainly architectural decoration, but the facades include large panels over the doorways, each very similar in content, with figures of the king being invested by a god, above a zone with rows of smaller figures bearing tribute, with soldiers and officials. The three classes of figures are sharply differentiated in size. The entrance to each tomb is at the centre of each cross, which opens onto a small chamber, where the king lay in a sarcophagus. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam</b> {{of each of the}} tomb's facades is believed to be a replica of the entrance of the palace at Persepolis.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third of the way down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam</b> at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInteractive {{buckling}} of an elastically restrained {{truss structure}} is investigated {{by using an}} improved version of the Byskov-Hutchinson perturbation analysis. The mechanical model consists of two <b>horizontal</b> <b>beams</b> connected by rigid diagonals, whose out-of-plane displacements are prevented by a continuous distribution of linear springs. When the two <b>horizontal</b> <b>beams</b> are compressed, three buckling modes are possible: one overall in-plane mode and two local (lateral and torsional) modes which, for a particular choice of the geometry of the structure, may occur nearly simultaneously. Three nonlinear equilibrium equations are derived in the amplitudes of the three buckling modes and solved numerically for given initial imperfections...|$|R

50|$|Timber {{roof trusses}} were a medieval development.

The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. If you move them toward the beam, you count their value. If you move away, you don't count their value. The suanpan can be reset {{to the starting position}} instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>beam</b> at the center.|$|E
