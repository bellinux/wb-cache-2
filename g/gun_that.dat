5|$|Between 19–25 September 1944, {{during the}} Battle of Arnhem, Major Robert Henry Cain used a PIAT to disable an Assault <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> was {{advancing}} on his company position, and to force another three German Panzer IV tanks to retreat during a later assault.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1941, more {{sophisticated}} weapons were made {{available such as}} the Blacker Bombard anti-tank weapon, the Northover Projector (a black-powder mortar), and the Smith Gun (a small artillery <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> could be towed by a private motorcar).|$|E

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW) – {{commonly}} termed MIG (metal, inert gas), uses a wire feeding <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> feeds wire at an adjustable speed and flows an argon-based shielding gas or a mix of argon and carbon dioxide (CO2) over the weld puddle {{to protect it from}} atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Holt also {{produced}} a 75mm self-propelled <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> could travel at , exceeding the military requirement of , and climb a 45-degree slope. Before the work could be completed, the Armistice was signed {{and the war}} ended. Self-propelled artillery however did not garner attention again {{until the end of}} the 1930s, just before World War II.|$|E
5000|$|The rated {{number of}} guns often {{differed}} from the number a vessel actually carried. The <b>guns</b> <b>that</b> determined a ship's rating were the carriage-mounted cannon, long-barreled, muzzle-loading <b>guns</b> <b>that</b> moved on 'trucks'—wooden wheels. The count did not include smaller (and basically anti-personnel) weapons such as swivel-mounted guns ("swivels"), which fired half-pound projectiles, or small arms.|$|R

The raiders also captured a Japanese field <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> was delivering harassing fire on Henderson Field, the Allied airfield at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|The Menacer {{is remembered}} as a {{critical}} and commercial flop. Critics found the six-game pack subpar and repetitive, and criticized the peripheral's lack of games. The ToeJam & Earl spinoff game {{was held in the}} highest regard, and reviewers recommended the Menacer-compatible Terminator 2 game. A direct-to-TV light <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> includes the six-game Menacer pack was released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The San Esteban {{findings}} {{included three}} broken anchors and a wrought iron swivel <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> was also broken and unusable.

5|$|The episodes all {{contain a}} {{different}} set of enemies in their levels, which the player must kill, stun, or avoid. These enemies are typically aliens or robots. Levels can also include hazards, such as electricity or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Invasion of the Vorticons features a raygun that Keen can use ammo for to kill enemies; Keen Dreams exchanges this for flower power pellets that temporarily stun enemies when thrown, episodes four through six use a stun <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> permanently stuns enemies, and the 2001 Commander Keen has a stun <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> temporarily stuns enemies unless they are then killed with a pogo jump. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, collectable items that award an extra life beginning with episode four, and items that grant an instant extra life.|$|E
5|$|Cdr Katô Hirohasu {{pushed for}} the {{adoption}} of a new /45 calibre <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> was currently under development. After trials of the new gun, which were witnessed by both the Japanese Navy and Royal Navy, the Japanese made the decision on 29 Nov 1911 to use the new gun despite the keel having already been laid down on 17 January 1911, and the resulting need to quickly make a large number of alternations to the design, so as to not prolong the construction.|$|E
5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> can shoot plungers, popcorn or bubble gum. Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E

5|$|In January 1937, the Ordnance Committee {{recommended}} {{development of}} such a weapon; two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study. As the projected main user of the weapon, the Infantry Branch was chosen to oversee the work. They wanted a lightweight <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> could be moved around by the crew, so any ideas of using a larger caliber {{than that of the}} German gun were discarded. The 37mm was a popular caliber of anti-tank guns in the 1930s; other anti-tank guns of the same caliber included Swedish Bofors gun, Czechoslovakian vz. 34 and vz. 37, Japanese Type 94 and Type 1.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E

5|$|The 1965 Tiger Mark I {{gained some}} {{exposure}} on American television {{as the car}} of choice for Maxwell Smart in the spoof spy series Get Smart. The Tiger {{was used for the}} first two seasons in the opening credits, in which Smart screeched to a halt outside his headquarters, and was used through the remainder of the series in several episodes. Some of the scenes featured unusual modifications such as a retractable James Bond-style machine <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> could not have fit under the Tiger's bonnet, so rebadged Alpine models were used instead.|$|E
5|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic glazed stepless cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475km/h (295mph) at 5,000m (16,400ft) and a cruise speed of 370km/h (230mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300km/h (190mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.|$|E
5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the <b>gun</b> <b>that</b> it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it became apparent that the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E
