Nevertheless, some recent studies question the effectiveness of methanol <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> engines, as their total energy consumption (including fuel production) is judged less favorable than the energy consumption of optimized conventional internal combustion engines. This paper is trying to analyze if and how a methanol <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> engine can be optimized so that its total energy consumption is lower than that of an optimized conventional internal combustion engine. Only state of the art technology is considered for this study. The evaluation is carried out with a computer simulation model. It turns out that computer simulation models which were developed for conventional vehicles are unsuitable for the simulation of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> engines. A specific <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> simulation architecture is developed to consider the special <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system dynamics and the numerous combinations of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems, energy storages and electric <b>drives</b> (<b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> hybrids). A validation with measured data from a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> prototype vehicle shows a very good consistency between the model and the real vehicle.

Particularly, advanced storage options such as metal hydrides and carbon nanotubes are often hinted favourable to conventional, liquid and pressurized, storage options. This study assesses the technical and economic performance of four onboard storage technologies in a well-to-wheel assessment. It does so for centralized and onsite hydrogen production scenarios with gaseous pipeline and liquid truck distributed hydrogen. Energetically, centralized production and liquefaction outperforms onsite production and liquefaction by 20 % on the average primary energy input, despite the need of pipeline or over the road distribution. The gaseous handling on the filling station performs better with an average driving energy use of 0. 11 MJp/km compared to 0. 15 MJp/km for liquid handling. The advanced onboard storage technologies perform better by 22 % than the conventional storage technologies on primary energy input in the chain. The average driving cost for gaseous and liquid onboard storage are 53 % above the gasoline reference cost of 21 euroct/km and the advanced onboard storage technologies as much as 98 %, almost double the reference cost. The car expenditure for a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>driven</b> car compared to an internal combustion engine driven car is for a large part responsible for this difference.

The German Aerospace Center in Stuttgart, mainly {{represented by the}} “energy systems integration” group at the Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics intensified its activities since 2007 in this interesting research field. Main topics of the research are the development and optimization of high efficient power generators and complete electrical power trains based on hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, efficient voltage converters and high torque electrical motors. Mainly for the general aviation, an adapted fuel cell system {{can be used as}} a power generator unit for the main aircraft propulsion during flight.

40|$|A {{multicopter}} {{is a type}} of helicopter {{that has}} more than two rotors/propellers that lift and control the platform. They are inherently agile, compact and robust, making them ideally suited for both indoor and outdoor applications. The main disadvantage is the limited endurance due to the heavy Lithium Polymer batteries and the high disk loading through the use of many small propellers. Disk loading is defined as the thrust divided by the disk area. Large propellers have lower disk loading than smaller ones, resulting in higher efficiencies and lower power consumption, while smaller propellers have faster reaction times in spooling up and down. This short reaction time is crucial for outdoor conditions where wind and gusts are present. The solution lies in the combined use of both large lift propellers and small control propellers resulting in a compound multicopter. We conceived an asymmetrical compound hexacopter configuration that combines two large lift propellers with constant rotational velocity, that lift most of the total hexacopter mass, with four small control propellers configured as a quadcopter. This specific design was developed for flight through narrow corridors for the application of inspecting fruit orchards while flying through and not above them, using sideward looking cameras. Compared to a standard quadcopter, the compound hexacopter has up to 60 % more endurance with the same width, payload and battery capacity. A concept validator prototype, named the Demonstrator, has been designed, constructed and successfully flight tested. In addition, other compound configurations are possible. The lift propellers with constant rotational velocity open the door for non-battery driven propulsion: fossil fuel or even <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>driven</b> motors, as fast reaction time and large variations in power consumption are no longer an issue. This hybrid version dramatically increases the endurance of (compound) multicopters and vastly expands their capabilities. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{combines}} the research for biofuels processing development with the vehicle conception {{to focus on}} realistic scenarios for biofuels to attend vehicle specifications and future green mobility. Actually, these are two important segments of fuels and biofuels context which should converge to a sustainable and realistic model. Recently, due to the climate changes versus fossil fuels use, and its consequences, the United Nations System addressed to the world a report on green economy indicating large investments properly. In synthesis, it seeks for a new world reality towards a sustainable economy with emphasis on bioresources, mainly on biofuels research and production. Historically, wood biomass has had an important role since the 18 th century as a solid fuel used for heating and all types of society purposes. This was an indiscriminate use and it caused forest devastation and unsustainability in the North of Europe. In modern era, biomass assumed a challenging role due to the scientific development that supported the green revolution. In the last decades, agricultural markets were characterized by steady growth production, which induced price falling of agricultural products. After the seventies, world agricultural and land use suffered another challenging pressure to produce biofuels to replace fossil fuels. To support that, the 1961 Nobel Prize, Melvin Calvin made a fundamental scientific contribution {{to the understanding of}} the photosynthetic C 3 and C 4 plant mechanism of light absorption. In 1999, Melis and researchers from National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the USA discovered that the green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhartdtii could be forced to produce biohydrogen under Sulphur-free anaerobic conditions. This discovery is another fundamental step towards sustainable biohydrogen production in the future. Other biological processes are being developed at Duisburg-Essen University, in Germany, as well as, in other countries. In spite of biomass biodiversity and the renewable character of biofuels, they are still gaining space at regional level and impacting land use. However, no one can predict what kind of biofuel will properly succeed fossil fuels at the international market reality. In spite of the achievements in biofuels research and processing, a large proportion of biomass is still used for heating purposes in developing countries, causing devastation and increasing CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. Good examples of regional emphasis and hopes are the ethanol production from sugar cane in Brazil and from corn in the USA, as well as, biogas from wastes in Asia. Recently, the German automobile industry pointed out their challenging project to replace the actual inefficient intern combustion motors by batteries or hydrogen <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>driven</b> vehicles, towards world green mobility free of CO 2 – emissions for small cars. So, biohydrogen produced from renewable feedstocks will assume a strategic position in the next decades. Differently from oil, which has hydrocarbons as its main component, biomass has a large diversity of compounds, like, carbohydrates, fat acids or even lignocellulosic complex materials, available all over the world. However, such chemical biodiversity of compounds and structure bring technical barriers relating to high yields of biomass conversion into biofuels. In this sense, promising sustainable processes for cellulose materials and microalgae are being thermochemically developed to convert these materials into SYNGAS, a convenient intermediate to fuel and chemicals. Due to their high productivity, versatile and simple chemical composition, microalgae can be produced in semi arid regions, unproductive land and any source of water. Moreover, microalgae cultivation could absorb CO 2 from thermoelectric power plants increasing synthetic photosynthesis yield and reducing CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. This seems to be a strategic model to convert bioresources into biofuels to attend future automobile requirements, as well as, chemical industry...|$|E

Without {{the need for a}} conventional engine block and transmission system coupled to the steering column and pedals through mechanical linkage, the car's power system and single electric motor are built into a flat skateboard configuration. This serves to lower the car's center of gravity, but more importantly to standardize vehicle drive train systems. Because all propulsion and energy storage systems are housed in the skateboard, designers are free to arrange the passenger compartment however they see fit. This allows for highly flexible modular vehicle configurations such as a 4-door sedan, mini van, or even a small bus to be placed on the same drive system, with the only difference being the shape of the car's upper body and the location of seats.

40|$|Abstract Besides {{reducing}} fuel consumption, {{the chief}} motivating factor behind {{the development of}} new vehicle structures is the desire to decrease climate-affecting emissions. One approach to ad-dressing this involves reducing the vehicle mass and, as such, the various strategies relating to lightweight construction.

The work conducted in this field today centres around the synthesis of construction method and material development with the ob-jective of devising a multi-material-design [1, 2].
