5000|$|The Whittemore House is an {{historic}} house at 267 Broadway in Arlington, Massachusetts. The Greek Revival was built c. 1850, {{and is the}} only house in Arlington with the full temple-front treatment. It as two-story fluted Doric columns supporting a projecting gable end with a <b>fan</b> <b>louver</b> in the tympanum area. [...] The entrance is located in the rightmost of the front facade's three bays, and is framed by sidelight and transom windows. The building's corners are pilastered, and an entablature encircles the building below the roof.|$|E
50|$|On {{the east}} (front), the facade has a {{centrally}} located main entrance sheltered {{by a small}} one-story porch with gently pitched hipped roof. The north profile has two windows on all three levels. The western wing has a modified hipped roof with a large exterior chimney on the north side. The west (rear) facade has a detailed Federal entrance with a molded round arch frame and <b>fan</b> <b>louver.</b> On the south side is the stone wing, offset to the west, with a small wooden vestibule and entry on its south. It, too, has a gabled metal roof and chimney.|$|E
50|$|The Old Red Church {{stands in}} the main village of Standish, near its {{northern}} edge, on the northeasteast side of Oak Hill Road. The church is a two story wood frame structure, with front-facing gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. The front facade, facing the street, is symmetrically arranged, with two entrance set widely apart, with flanking sash windows to the outside, and sash windows above. The main gable has a full pediment, with a Federal period <b>fan</b> <b>louver</b> at the center. The facade is topped by a two-stage square tower, with an belfry open belfry at the second stage, and a balustrade at the top with finialed posts.|$|E

50|$|The Witter House is a {{historic}} house on Chaplin Street in Chaplin, Connecticut. Built in 1820-21, the 2-1/2 story brick structure is a late example of Georgian architecture. It is five bays wide, with paired chimneys {{at the ends of}} the hip roof. The centered entrance is flanked by arched sidelight windows, and has a fanlight above. The fanlight detail is echoed by semi-elliptical <b>fan</b> <b>louvers</b> above each window. The roof has a monitor section at its center, an unusual feature not normally found in New England houses of the period. The house was owned by three generations of medical doctors all named Oren Witter, and was sold by the last one in 1960 to another doctor.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{continued}} {{to expand its}} product line in the 1920s and 1930s, adding {{a wide array of}} products, including barn cupolas, exhaust and intake hoods and <b>louvers,</b> <b>fans,</b> valves, pulleys, power hoists, concrete mangers, a patented garage door hanger (using overhead door tracks for ease in opening and closing), playground equipment (including slides, see-saws, gym sets, [...] "swing bobs," [...] and [...] "whirl-arounds"), and themostats.|$|R
5000|$|The Sterling Homestead is a {{historic}} house at 2225 Main Street in Stratford, Connecticut. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof and two interior chimneys. A front-facing cross gable, decorated with a <b>fan</b> <b>louver,</b> stands centered above a Palladian window and the front entry, which is framed by sidelight windows and pilasters topped by an entablature. This house was probably built around 1790 for Abijah McEwen, and is most prominent for its association with John W. Sterling, a major local landowner and ship's captain engaged in the China trade, who purchased it in the mid-19th century. [...] Sterling later built an elaborate mansion nearby, which now houses the Sterling House Community Center.|$|E
50|$|The Kavanaugh House {{is located}} {{just west of}} the village of Damariscotta Mills, between Pond Road (SR 215) and Damariscotta Lake to the north. The house is a large two-story structure, nearly square in footprint, with a hip roof topped by an {{octagonal}} cupola. It rests on a granite foundation, and its main facade is finished in matchboard siding, while the sides and rear are finished in clapboards. The roof is encircled by a low balustrade, and has a dentillated cornice. The building corners are pilastered. The main facade is five bays wide, with the entrance at the center, set in a round-arch opening with a half-round fan above the door. The entrance is sheltered by a half-round porch, supported by Ionic columns, which rise to an entablature and balustrade. Above the entry is a Palladian-style three-part window, flanked by narrow pilasters, with a <b>fan</b> <b>louver</b> above the center window.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{achieve a}} {{beautiful}} appearance, the outdoor machine of a residential {{air conditioning system}} is often placed in a groove and shield with a louver. This paper presents split air conditioner outdoor machine in the semi closed space within the optimal locations and louver form. This study {{is based on the}} enthalpy difference laboratory platform, to evaluate an outdoor unit installation and lover form effect on air-conditioning energy and EER. The results show that the condenser should be more than 80 mm away from the walls; The EER increased with increasing distance and the optimal distance away from the <b>fan</b> <b>louver</b> was approximately 300 mm. The heat dissipation effects of the air conditioner were better with a greater louver spacing. The optimal louver angle was approximately 30 Â° when the outdoor wind come from the lateral direction. The air-conditioning efficiency was much higher than when the wind came from the front. Therefore, the outdoor unit and the local dominant wind direction should be presented to the lateral wind...|$|E

Twelve tests are conducted under different operation conditions {{in order to}} observe the influence of system instrumentation (such as <b>fans,</b> pumps and <b>louvers).</b> Vibration peaks can be detected, power spectral densities (PSDs) are presented to reveal their presence. Instrumentation-induced resonances, close-loop gain and future challenges in vibrations mitigation techniques are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Elevator {{shaft and}} {{stairwell}} shaft pressurization systems are studied as means of smoke migration prevention through the stack eect in tall buildings using the CONTAM simu-lation software. Stairwell pressurization {{is found to}} be completely feasible in the absence of elevator shaft pressurization. In contrast, coupled elevator shaft pressurization systems are found to produce prohibitively large pressure dierences across both the elevator and stairwell doors if: (1) minimum pressure dierences must be maintained at both open and closed elevator doors, and (2) if the system must function properly when the ground floor exterior building doors are closed. Even in these cases situations arise in which smoke may enter the shaft and be actively distributed throughout the building by the fan sys-tem. Furthermore, the results show that there is a strong coupling between the fan speed requirements of the stairwell and elevator shaft pressurization systems. Fan requirements are also found {{to be sensitive to the}} ambient temperature. Eects of the <b>fan</b> location, <b>louvers,</b> vents, the building height, and the number of elevator cars and/or shafts are also addressed...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{a direct}} method for {{measuring}} respiration and transpiration rates may lead to better storage control systems and closer observation of storage losses. A laboratory scale environmental chamber was constructed and provided with a <b>fan</b> and adjustable <b>louver</b> to obtain variable ventilation flow rates. Flow rates were determined using a pressure sensor and fan characteristic curves which were determined experimentally. A regression equation representing the flow rate versus pressure relation was derived and used for estimating the flow rates throughout the study. Respiration and transpiration were simulated using precision heat sources ranging from 15 to 105 W in 15 W interval and an evaporative pad. Measured wet and dry bulb temperatures and ventilation flow rates {{were used for the}} estimation of heat and moisture generated inside the chamber. The work was performed in two parts. In the first, precision heat sources were used and the heat balance equation components were solved. In the second part, heat and moisture were generated inside the chamber, heat and moisture balance equations as well as psychrometric equations were solved. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
