PVC and polyurethane plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and give off acidic vapors with time. High humidity of the air is a significant contributing factor, as <b>is</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction <b>is</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E

25|$|Malnutrition {{can be a}} {{consequence}} of health issues such as gastroenteritis or chronic illness, especially the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Diarrhea and other infections can cause malnutrition through decreased nutrient absorption, decreased intake of food, increased metabolic requirements, and direct nutrient loss.

A leading cause of diarrhea and intestinal worm infections in children in developing countries <b>is</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sanitation and hygiene.|$|E

Approximately two billion people (about a third of global population) are infected as of the latest estimate, and four billion at risk, surpassing even the all-time most prevalent parasitic disease, malaria. The largest numbers of cases occur in impoverished rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and China. Its main cause, like for many types of helminth infections, <b>is</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sanitation, such as the practice of open defecation and lack of hygiene such as hand washing.

25|$|One {{argument}} against Dualism is {{with regard to}} causal interaction. If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism <b>is</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally material—this is the basic problem of causal interaction.|$|E

25|$|World-known fashion brands such as H, Nike, Adidas and Uniqlo are all {{involved}} in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, Human Rights Now!, Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM) protested for the “harsh and dangerous” working conditions in Uniqlo’s value-added factories in China. (The Fashion Law, 2015) According {{to a recent report}} published by SACOM, Uniqlo’s suppliers were blamed for “systematically underpaying their labour, forcing them to work excessive hours and subjecting them to unsafe working conditions, which included sewage-covered floors, poor ventilation, and sweltering temperatures” (The Fashion Law, 2015). On the other hand, with reference to Clean Clothes Campaign(2016), H strategic suppliers in Bangladesh was reported in 2016 for the dangerous working environment, which <b>is</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> vital equipment for workers such as adequate fire exits.|$|E
25|$|The {{checks for}} {{responsiveness}} and breathing {{are carried out}} with the person horizontally supine. If unconscious but breathing, the recovery position is appropriate. If not breathing, rescue ventilation is necessary. Drowning can produce a gasping pattern of apnea while the heart is still beating, and ventilation alone may be sufficient, as the heart may be basically healthy, but hypoxic. The airway-breathing-circulation (ABC) sequence should be followed, rather than starting with compressions as is typical in cardiac arrest, as the basic problem <b>is</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> oxygen. Five initial breaths are recommended, as the initial ventilation may be difficult because {{of water in the}} airways which can interfere with effective alveolar inflation. Thereafter a sequence of two breaths and 30 chest compressions is recommended, repeated until vital signs are re-established, the rescuers are unable to continue, or advanced life support is available.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{symptom of}} copper {{deficiency}} is peripheral neuropathy, which is numbness or tingling that can {{start in the}} extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso. In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms. These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation {{was lost in the}} sternum, and markedly reduced proprioception or sensation about the self’s orientation. Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient. This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there <b>is</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.|$|E
