The prediction techniques available and applied today are mostly based on fatigue crack growth measurements determined in constant amplitude testing. However, while many service loadings are constant amplitude, many more loadings are random amplitude. An investigation to determine which statistics of random loadings are relevant to fatigue crack closure was conducted. The <b>fundamentals</b> of <b>random</b> <b>processes</b> and crack closure are briefly reviewed, then the relevance of certain <b>random</b> <b>process</b> parameters to the crack closure calculation are discussed qualitatively.

This work combines {{an analysis of the}} most recent achievements of genomics and <b>fundamental</b> concepts of <b>random</b> <b>processes</b> to provide a novel point of view on genome evolution. Exon sizes in sequenced genomes show a lognormal distribution typical of a <b>random</b> Kolmogoroff fractioning <b>process.</b> This implies that the process of intron incretion may be independent of exon size, and therefore could be dependent on intron–exon boundaries. All genomes examined have two distinctive classes of exons, each with different evolutionary histories. In the framework proposed in this article, these two classes of exons can be derived from a hypothetical ancestral genome by (spontaneous) symmetry breaking. We note that one of these exon classes comprises mostly alternatively spliced exons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In many {{engineering}} applications, {{specially in}} communication engineering, one usually encounters a bandpass non-Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>process,</b> with a slowly varying envelope. Among the available models for non-Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>processes,</b> spherically invariant <b>random</b> <b>processes</b> (SIRP's) {{play an important}} role. These processes are of interest mainly {{due to the fact}} that they allow one to relax the assumption of Gaussianity, while keeping many of its useful characteristics. In this paper, we have derived a simple and closed-form formula for the expected number of maxima of a SIRP envelope. Since Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>processes</b> are special cases of SIRP's, this formula holds for Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>processes</b> as well. In contrast with the available complicated expression for the expected number of maxima in the envelope of a Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>process,</b> our simple result holds for an arbitrary power spectrum. The key idea in deriving this result is the application of the characteristic function, rather than the probability density function, for calculating the expected level crossing rate of a <b>random</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R

The metamodel is constructed by decomposing the input <b>random</b> <b>processes</b> using principal components or wavelets and then using a few simulations to estimate the distributions of the decomposition coefficients.

But cumulants [16, 21] of order three and greater are zero and it is conventional to define higher order spectra in terms of cumulants of a <b>random</b> <b>process</b> rather than moments. This work is restricted to the third order and third order moment and cumulant spectra are identical, both referring to the same bispectrum. This definition of the bispectrum may be extended to include moment functions from harmonic <b>random</b> <b>processes</b> that are not absolutely integrable but have finite power, or finite energy within a period, similar to such extension for the power spectrum.
