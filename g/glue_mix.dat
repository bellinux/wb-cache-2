40|$|Tannins {{have been}} largely studied as wood {{additives}} and wood adhesives. In a perspective of a desirably increased utilization of natural raw material in the wood timber industries, this study provides further and specific information {{on the use of}} condensed tannins to improve the heat resistance of urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. The results obtained by thermomechanical and thermogravimetric analyses show that high percentage (33 and 50 %) of quebracho tannin in UF-tannin blend dramatically improves the overall UF thermal resistance, but 50 % of tannin decreases the maximum value of modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the bonded joint. The best balance between mechanical performance and decreased degradation at high temperature is obtained with 33 % of quebracho tannin. The MOE value of UF + 33 % of quebracho tannin at 260 A degrees C is seven times greater than MOE of UF control. Thermograms show that quebracho tannin has a beneficial effect on increasing the resistance of glue-mix to degradation induced by temperature. When the content of tannin in the glue-mix is increased up to 50 %, the resin degrades completely at about 670 A degrees C, i. e. more than 50 A degrees C higher than neat UF resin. This improvement is related mainly to the resorcinol-type ring structure of tannin and the alkaline pH of UF + quebracho tannin <b>glue</b> <b>mix</b> that confer a higher resistance against joint degradation to UF even at elevated temperatures...|$|E

The objective {{was to assess the}} feasibility _ [...] _. of using creosot&treated southern pine wood as a raw material for the-formulation-of-phenol-basedresmadhesives-Them liquefaction was conducted in the presence of phenol with sulfuric acid as a catalyst at reaction temperature and time of 150 °C and 60 minutes, respectively. Novolac and resole resins were formulated from the liquefied wood, and their physical and mechanical properties of molding compounds made with them were determined. Residues obtained from samples of liquefied creosote-treated wood (5. 8 %) were significantly lower than those from non-treated birch wood powder (17. 3 %). Apparently, the residual creosote content of the treated-wood behaved as a reagent co:working with phenol to enhance the liquefaction. The flexural strength and the flexural modulus of moldings made from novolac. resins prepared from liquefied creosotetreated wood were comparable to novolacs made from non-treated birch wood. Bond quality of southern pine plywood made from liquefied creosote-treated wood resin was only slightly lower than plywood made from conventional phenolic resin. Visual examination of the wood failure on broken shear specimens seemed to indicate overpenetration of the resin made from liquefied creosote-treated wood, and it {{was probably one of the}} major causes of lower bond quality. Nevertheless, the first attempt to formulate a phenol-based adhesive made from liquefied creosote-treated wood produced encouraging results.

A total of 144 plywood panels were fabricated with experimental variables included 2 phenol to wood (P/W) ratios in liquefaction, 6 resin formulations (3 formaldehyde/liquefied wood (F/LW) ratios × 2 replications), 6 glue applications (2 glue spreads × 3 assembly times), and 2 panel replications. Average shear strength (235. 6 psi) and wood failure (70. 5 %) for resin adhesives prepared from liquefied wood at P/W ratio of 2. 0 {{were significantly higher than}} the shear strength (184. 7 psi) and wood failure (53. 1 %) for that at P/W ratio of 1. 5. On average, F/LW ratio of 2. 25 yielded substantially lower shear strength and wood failure than that of F/LW ratios of 2. 0 and 1. 75. Differences in shear strength and wood failure between F/LW ratios of 2. 0 and 1. 75 were not significant. However, {{it is interesting to note}} that F/LW ratio interacted with P/W ratio to affect wood failure, but not shear strength. As shown in Fig. 2, at P/W ratio of 1. 5, the F/LW ratio of 2. 0 yielded the highest wood failure and the F/LW ratio of 2. 25 resulted in the lowest wood failure. On the contrary, at P/W ratio of 2. 0, the F/LW ratio of 2. 25 resulted in highest wood failure and the F/LW ratio of 2. 0 yielded the lowest wood failure. On the basis of wood failure, the resins prepared from liquefied wood at P/W ratio of 2., reacted at F/LW ratio of 2. 25, and applied the glue at the rate of 90 pounds per 1000 square ft of double glue line met the standard of vacuumpressure soak cycle for exterior glueline (PS- 1 - 66).

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{attention has}} focused on soybean-based adhesives because of increased phenolic resin prices and adhesive demand. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the adhesive properties of crosslinked soy flour and/or soy hydrolyzate with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins for use in structural panels. Neutral phenolic soy (NPS) and alkaline phenolic soy (APS) resins were prepared and used to bond southern pine plywood. Adhesive bond quality of the soybean-based phenolic resins was evaluated by glueline shear test following the procedure detailed in Product Standard PS 1 - 95 for construction and industrial plywood. Within the range of variable levels investigated, the following conditions produced higher wet wood failure than a control <b>glue</b> <b>mix.</b> For NPS resins best results were obtained with a 160 cps PF, a 30 minute assembly time, and no extender. For APS resins best results were obtained with a 50 cps PF, a 200 °C press temperature, 19 % corn-cob powder, and a 60 minute assembly time. Comparable results were obtained with either a 40 % or 50 % PF level in the resins. Under these conditions, the wet wood failure of plywood bonded with both resins approached the requirement of PS 1 - 95 for construction and industrial plywood. The APS resins were also used to fabricate homogeneous hybrid poplar flakeboards with different resin solid levels (5 %, 7 %, and 9 %), press temperatures (175 and 200 °C), and press times of 8 and 10 minutes. Internal bond strength, wet modulus of rupture, and dimensional stabilities of flakeboard improved with increased press time, press temperature, and PF level in the resins. In particular, increased press time can be used to offset the poor internal bonding associated with high resin content and the excessive moisture present in the mat. However, APS resin-bonded flakeboards provided higher mechanical and better dimensional stability properties compared to the Canadian Standard Association O 437 standard, except for modulus of elasticity, which could be easily improved by flake alignment. Optimum production condition for flakeboard bonded with the APS resins are a 5 % resin level, a 50 % PF level, a 200 °C press temperature, and an 8 minute press time. Although NPS and APS resins can be competitive with other conventional adhesives, further improvements are required to reduce press times for industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|Drosophila melanogaster {{provides}} an ideal model organism to test genetic and molecular biological mechanisms {{within the context}} of a living animal. For over one hundred years Drosophila continues to produce a boundless extent of informative and important scientific data providing crucial insight into development, disease progression and genetic interactions. A century as a model organism allowed for the development of an abundance of unique genetic and molecular tools allowing researchers to tease apart cellular mechanisms with very little limitation. From the whole adult body to tissue function to molecular networks, if a biological question arises it most likely can be answered using the fruit fly. The Drosophila larval salivary gland is an organ that not only takes advantage of the many biological tools available, but also has innate properties favoring it as a model tissue to investigate nuclear hormone activity. In the final larval stage (third instar) of Drosophila, the salivary gland responds to the steroid hormone, 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) by synthesizing and secreting a glycosylated polypeptide <b>glue</b> <b>mix</b> (glue). In the mid-third instar, a low titer of 20 E initiates a complex of gene expression that targets the glue genes resulting in the synthesis of glue. Using fluorescent markers tagged to the glue, this event is easily monitored using confocal microscopy. The first part of my dissertation describes a model in which glue synthesis is a 20 E-coordinated event and that surprisingly did not act through a canonical nuclear hormone receptor. Prior to my research, it was known that 20 E-activated genes act through a nuclear hormone receptor comprised of a heterodimer between two proteins, ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspirical (USP). However, I show that 20 E-regulated glue synthesis is USP independent. Included in this section of my dissertation are experiments designed to test this model of glue synthesis that is independent of USP and to investigate the potential for another co-receptor functioning with EcR to initiate glue synthesis. Following the logic that another receptor is functioning with EcR in 20 E-mediated glue synthesis, I investigated other candidate receptors. I found the nuclear receptor, DHR 96, to be required for glue synthesis and performed experiments that suggest DHR 96 may work with EcR to initiate glue synthesis in response to a 20 E signal. The remaining sections of my dissertation are focused on the latter half of the third instar. This stage of the larval life cycle is the late-third instar and is marked in the salivary gland by the secretion of mature glue granules into the lumen of the gland in response to a large pre-metamorphic pulse of 20 E. During this period, 20 E initiates the expression of proteins that are mostly transcription factors; however, a gene was identified that had sequence similarity to both calmodulin and myosin light chains. This gene, E 63 - 1, has been shown to trigger precocious glue secretion in glands overexpressing E 63 - 1. However, E 63 - 1 mutants secrete glue normally. Interestingly, calmodulin has been shown to prevent glue secretion in experiments using calmodulin inhibitors. These data provoked a model that E 63 - 1 and calmodulin are both needed for secretion to be successful. The goal of chapter 4 was to test this model using available molecular and genetic tools. Finally, I analyze a secretion phenotype caused by the overexpression of GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) that produces rubble-like glue granules, which do not secrete. Part of this analysis involved describing the localization and morphology of wildtype cells using fluorescently tagged markers. When I compared the markers from the wildtype cells to those overexpressing GDI, I found a number of cellular disruptions. GDI overexpression caused an extension of ER membrane, a failure of membrane recycling and a failure for the glue granules to acidify. Thus, through the use of molecular and genetic tools, I characterize 20 E-signaling events in the third instar salivary gland, and more importantly, I lay the foundation to test novel models of 20 E signaling and intracellular trafficking mechanisms...|$|E

The gelation of the system was enhanced by a crosslinker, 1 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) - 3 -(ethylcarbodiimide) hydrochloride (EDC). The gelation time of the bioadhesives was analyzed using rheological measurements. The results indicated that the type of gelatin was a critical factor in determining the gelation time of the biological <b>glues.</b> The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> had greater bonding strength and smaller gelation times as the molecular weight of gamma-PGA or gelatin increased.

The gilding is traditionally made with a thin piece of gold metal leaf applied to a gypsum layer and covered with a red or ochre layer of bole. In previous works, we observed in sculptures, altarpieces, etc. that the gold leaf was usually applied onto a bole. The bole is a mixture of clay minerals, iron oxides and organic compounds, such as oils. In addition, the bole is unctuous and capable of being polished. It has served, since early mediaeval times, as a ground for gilding [35]. For carved decorative pieces, a linseed oil added with a pigment, such as lead white, or coloured pigments was used as the support.

30|$|Glue is {{made from}} collagen, the primary {{structural}} protein of animals, which is the principal protein in skin, hides and bones. The sources for glue in ancient Egypt are currently unknown, but would probably have included various mammals and fish that were in use for other purposes (as food or primary sources for leather production). To make these glues, bones, hides, skins, etc. would be cleaned and boiled in water, strained and cooled to a jellied consistency, and finally dried to form a mass, which can be ground to a powder and mixed with warm water to form the adhesive [20]. Several identifications {{of the use of}} glue as a binding medium for paint and ground layers for ancient Egyptian polychromy have to date been published. Examples include paint from the Old Kingdom tomb of Nefer at Saqqara [21] and a Roman-Egyptian sarcophagus, where both the white ground as well as the paint layers were identified by pyrolysis to be bound in glue [22]. Examination of the Nebamun paintings, which belonged to a tomb chapel dated to c. 1350 BCE, established conclusively the presence of amino acids in two of the paints used, suggesting that proteinaceous binders (probably gelatine) were sometimes used, possibly in association with larger grained pigments and/or varnished areas [13].

40|$|The {{problem in}} using plywood bonded with urea {{formaldehyde}} (UF) is formaldehyde emission, {{especially in a}} room with limited ventilation. To reduce formaldehyde emission, the <b>glue</b> can be <b>mixed</b> with catching agent. In this paper the effect of urea and ammonium carbonate as catching agent on formaldehyde emission and on bonding strength of UF bonded three plies made from jabon is discussed. The effect of catching agent type on formaldehyde emission is not significant while the effect of percentage of catching agent is highly significant on formaldehyde emission. The higher percentage of catching agent, the lower formal dehyde emission of plywood. The effect of type and percentage of catching agent on plywood bonding strength is highly significant. The higher percentage of catching agent, the lower plywood bonding strength. To meet formaldehyde emission of 0, 165 µg/ml it is recomended to use urea 14 % on the weight basis of liquid UF. The bonding strength of this plywood conforms with the Japanese standard, 1973...|$|R

40|$|Upward saline {{groundwater}} seepage {{is leading to}} surface water salinization of deep lying polders in the Netherlands. Identifying measures to reduce the salt content requires a thorough understanding and quantification of the dominant sources of water and salt on a daily basis. However, as in most balance studies, there are large uncertainties in the contribution from {{groundwater seepage}}. Taking these into account, we applied a probabilistic (<b>GLUE)</b> end-member <b>mixing</b> approach to simulate two years of daily to weekly observations of discharge, salt loads and salt concentration of water pumped out of an artificially drained polder catchment area. We were then able to assess the contribution from the different sources to the water and salt balance of the polder and uncertainties in their quantification. Our modelling approach demonstrates the need to distinguish preferential from diffuse seepage. Preferential seepage via boils contributes, on average, 66 % to the total salt load and only about 15 % to the total water flux into the polder and therefore forms the main salinization pathway. With the model {{we were able to}} calculate the effect of future changes on surface water salinity and to assess the uncertainty in our predictions. Furthermore, we analyzed the parameter sensitivity and uncertainty to determine for which parameter the quality of field measurements should be improved to reduce model input and output uncertainty. High frequency measurements of polder water discharge and weighted concentration at the outlet of the catchment area appear to be essential for obtaining reliable simulations of water and salt fluxes and for allotting these to the different sources...|$|R
40|$|The {{formaldehyde}} emtsston of particleboard bonded with {{urea formaldehyde}} (UF) can affect health, {{especially if it}} is used {{in a room with}} limited ventilation. To reduce formaldehyde emission, the <b>glue</b> can be <b>mixed</b> with catching agent. In this report, the effect of using urea and melamine as catching agents on formaldehyde emission, and on the physical and mechanical properties of UF bonded particleboard is described. The effect of percentage of catching agent on formaldehyde emission is highly significant. The higher the percentage of catching agent, the lower formaldehyde emission of particle­board. On urea­melamine (U/M) ratio of 4, the formaldehyde emission of particleboard can meet American and Japanese Standard on the percentage of 5, 10 and 15 %, while on U/M ratio of 7 and 10, the formaldehyde emission can conform the standards on the percentage of 10 and 15 %. The effect of addition of urea and melamine was significant and even highly significant on the physical and mechanical properties, but not on the shear strength. The effect of U/M ratio was either not significant...|$|R
5000|$|Kiso {{was born}} in Niitsu, Niigata, into the Katsura family that long had ties to Japan's {{imperial}} family. Her father, {{who had been a}} part of the government there, owned large tracts of land noted for their rice production. Kiso learned all of the traditional feminine arts of the upper class, such as the tea ceremony, flower arranging, and others, but she excelled especially in bonseki. Bonseki is the ancient art of arranging pure white sand and small white rocks on a black lacquer tray, thus forming miniature landscapes and seascapes. The sand and rocks were carefully manipulated with feathers, small brushes, and spoons. Each scene was temporary, only for the moment. The sand and rocks would then be brushed together and returned to their small storage containers to be used again. In addition, Kiso learned a technique for <b>mixing</b> <b>glue</b> with the sand so that the miniature scene would adhere to paper, and thus have a more permanent form. About 1950 in Tokyo, Kiso helped initiate an association for the cultivation and perpetuation of bonseki art.|$|R
