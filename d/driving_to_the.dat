5|$|<b>Driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emirates Stadium is {{strongly}} discouraged {{as there are}} strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. An hour before kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement {{on a number of}} the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation. Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.|$|E

5|$|After three {{consecutive}} victories {{to start the}} season, the Crimson Tide opened conference play against the Arkansas Razorbacks, and defeated them 38–14 at Bryant–Denny Stadium. Alabama scored first with a trick play on their opening possession. After <b>driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas 37-yard line, Cade Foster lined up for a 54-yard field goal attempt. Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron received the snap as the holder, and proceeded to throw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Michael Williams to give the Crimson Tide a 7–0 lead. The Razorbacks tied the game at 7–7 {{late in the first}} quarter when Tyler Wilson threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Dennis Johnson. After an Arkansas goal line stand, Jeremy Shelley connected on a 20-yard field goal to give Alabama a 10–7 lead.

Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won their}} second matchup against the Yankees 7–0 amid a heavy downpour. The weather kept {{attendance}} to 34,252, but raised Cleveland's season attendance total over 300,000 people including its preseason {{game at the}} Akron Rubber Bowl. The only score of the game came in the third quarter, when quarterback Otto Graham passed to Dante Lavelli for a 33-yard touchdown. Cleveland won despite being outplayed by the Yankees statistically. The Yankees had 10 first downs to the Browns' five, and had 237 yards of total offense to just 67 yards for the Browns. Cleveland was held to just 24 yards of rushing, and Marion Motley, the team's star fullback, rushed for minus eight yards in six attempts. The Yankees threatened {{to tie the game}} {{at the end of the}} fourth quarter, <b>driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland 16-yard line. New York's pass attempts failed, however, giving the Browns the victory. It was Cleveland's sixth win in a row.|$|E

5|$|Appalachian State {{returned}} the opening kickoff {{of the second}} half to their own 36-yard line, but Michigan defender Morgan Trent intercepted an Edwards throw on the second play of the drive. Michigan took possession at the Appalachian State 40-yard line, <b>driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 25-yard line before kicking a field goal to decrease the Mountaineer lead to eight points. Appalachian State began play after the kickoff at their own 24-yard line, driving 64yards in 11 plays and scoring a 31-yard field goal to make the score 31–20 Appalachian State. After the ensuing kickoff, Michigan ran four plays before Minor fumbled the ball on the fifth. The fumble was recovered by Appalachian State defender Pierre Banks at the Michigan 28-yard line. However, Appalachian State failed to get a first down on the ensuing drive, and Rauch missed a 46-yard field goal attempt. Michigan went three-and-out on their next drive and had to punt, but a fumble by Edwards on the following Appalachian State drive was recovered by Michigan defender John Thompson, giving them control of the ball at the Appalachian State 31-yard line. Michigan drove 31yards over six plays, scoring a touchdown on a four-yard run by Hart. The Wolverines went for a two-point conversion, but failed to convert, making the score 31–26 in favor of Appalachian State. Appalachian State received the kickoff at their own 26-yard line with 19seconds left in the third quarter, and the quarter ended following a six-yard completion by Edwards to Batichon.|$|E
5|$|Massa made a {{pit stop}} on lap53, and rejoined behind Heidfeld in tenth. He {{subsequently}} set the fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap55, a 1:18.426. Meanwhile, Piquet was able {{to close the gap}} on Räikkönen to under a second, before losing time by running wide at turn five on lap60. Massa passed Heidfeld for ninth on the same lap, and began closing in on Webber. On lap65, Massa drafted down the straight and attempted to pass Webber, who defended his position by <b>driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. Crossing the track boundary into the end of the pit-lane, Massa managed to pass Webber, and out-braked him into turn one, to take eighth place. Alonso crossed the finish line on lap67 to take his second win of the season, five seconds ahead of Kubica. Räikkönen was third, ahead of Piquet, Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Massa. Webber took ninth on the line, ahead of Heidfeld, who struggled with a heavy car and failed to improve on a poor qualifying performance. Rosberg finished in front of Hamilton, in 11th. Barrichello and Button took the next two positions; both drivers blamed their Honda cars for their uncompetitive performance at the Fuji circuit. Nakajima finished last, in 15th, unable to recover after his forced pit-stop early in the race.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{received}} the ball first, with Mike Massey returning the Julian Rauch kick to the Michigan 33-yard line. Michigan gained {{a first down}} after converting a third and one with a three-yard run by Mike Hart. Chad Henne then completed an 18-yard pass to Massey, followed by a 33-yard rush from Hart, pushing Michigan to the four-yard line of Appalachian State. Hart then ran the ball in for a touchdown, and the ensuing extra point made the score 7–0. Appalachian State's CoCo Hillary took the kickoff to the 26-yard line of the Mountaineers. After the Mountaineers opened with a run for no gain and a six-yard completion, Armanti Edwards completed a 68-yard touchdown pass to Dexter Jackson. The extra point was converted, tying the score at 7–7. The following two drives resulted in three-and-outs for both teams, but after a Mountaineer punt went out of bounds at the Michigan 48-yard line, the Wolverines mounted a ten-play, 52-yard drive culminating in a ten-yard touchdown pass from Henne to Greg Matthews. The extra point gave Michigan a 14–7 lead. Appalachian State started their drive with 3:09 left in the quarter at their own 35-yard line, completing nine plays and <b>driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Michigan 36yard-line {{before the end of}} the quarter.|$|E

5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox was <b>driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{family home}} at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, {{and crashed into}} the back of a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{recovered}} the punt at their 14-yard line. The Hokies gained one first down with three rushes, then another on a pass from Cox, advancing {{the ball to}} their 35-yard line. A facemask penalty against Air Force aided Tech as the Hokies drove inside Air Force territory. Time remaining in the half quickly became a factor for Virginia Tech, as the Hokies penetrated the Falcons' 45-yard line with just 1:10 remaining in the half. As the Hokies rushed the ball, {{they were forced to}} call timeouts in order to stop the clock—which counts down following rushing plays that do not gain a first down or end out of bounds. Cox threw occasional passes, gaining short yardage, but most of the Hokies' work during the drive was done on the ground. Tech penetrated the Air Force red zone, <b>driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Falcons' 12-yard line with 25seconds remaining. As Cox attempted to throw a pass into the end zone {{in an effort to get}} a touchdown before time expired, Air Force's Mike Chandler intercepted the ball, denying the Hokies a scoring chance.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{is working}} on {{improvements}} to MD 404 {{in order to provide}} relief to travelers <b>driving</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway. The primary motive behind the widening is the high accident rate that plagues the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic. The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs. The widening of this section was completed in 2012. On May 21, 2014, groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road. The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $39 million. On June 25, 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton, among other projects across the state. A total of $160 million in funds would go to widening MD 404. The work on this is nearing completion in early 2017. Widening of the section between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road is expected to be completed by summer 2017 while widening of the remaining sections of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton is planned to be completed by late 2017.|$|E
