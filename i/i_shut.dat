25|$|Since {{the late}} Soviet times Russia has {{experienced}} another wave of Western cultural influence, {{which led to}} the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The most vivid example, perhaps, is the Russian rock music, which takes its roots both in the Western rock and roll and heavy metal, and in traditions of the Russian bards of Soviet era, like Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava. Saint-Petersburg (former Leningrad), Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk) and Omsk became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include Mashina Vremeni, Slot, DDT, Aquarium, Alisa, Kino, Nautilus Pompilius, Aria, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Splean and Korol <b>i</b> <b>Shut.</b> At the same time Russian pop music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as estrada into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like t.A.T.u. in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or Vitas in China.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} many bands from {{previous}} decades are still active, like DDT, Korol <b>i</b> <b>Shut</b> and Splean, {{due to the}} lack of new bands gaining significant attention there is a common view that Russian rock is in decline.
