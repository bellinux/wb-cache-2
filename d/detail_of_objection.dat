40|$|In {{a series}} of works Hubert Dreyfus argues that phenomenological {{considerations}} can show the falsity of John McDowell’s claim that ours actions are permeated with rationality. Dreyfus changes the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> his <b>objections</b> several times in this debate, but I shall {{argue that there is}} an implicit false assumption lurking in his thinking throughout his exchanges with McDowell. Originally Dreyfus proposed a distinction between “detached rule-following” and “situation-specific way of coping,” and later he replaces it with the distinction between “subjectivity” and “absorbed coping. ” He then uses this framework to interpret some examples, attempting to show that they cannot be accommodated by McDowell’s position. I shall argue that in doing so Dreyfus presupposes too narrow conceptions of “rationality” and “mindedness,” and if these notions are understood appropriately, we can see that phenomenological considerations can be good supplements, rather than objections, to McDowell’s claim that our mindedness is pervasive in actions...|$|R

40|$|The issue: Excluding cartels, most {{investigations}} into suspected infringements of European Union competition law are resolved with ‘commitment decisions’. The European Commission drops {{the case in}} exchange for a commitment from the company under investigation to implement measures to stop the presumed anti-competitive behaviour. Commitment decisions are considered speedier than formal sanctions (prohibition decisions) in restoring normal competitive market conditions. They have a cost, however: commitments are voluntary and are unlikely to be subject to judicial review. This reduces the European Commission’s incentive to build a robust case. Because commitment decisions do not establish any legal precedent, they provide for little guidance on the interpretation of the law. Policy challenge: The European Commission relies increasingly on commitment decisions. More transparency on the substance of allegations, and the establishment of a higher number of legal precedents, are however necessary. This applies in particular to cases that tackle antitrust issues in new areas, such as markets for digital goods, in which companies might find it difficult to assess if a certain behaviour constitutes a violation of competition rules. To ensure greater transparency and mitigate some of the drawbacks of commitment decisions, while retaining their main benefits, the full <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>objections</b> addressed by the European Commission to defendants should be published...|$|R

5|$|The most {{significant}} opponent to birth control was the Catholic Church, which mobilized opposition in many venues during the 1920s. Catholics persuaded the Syracuse city council to ban Sanger from {{giving a speech}} in 1924; the National Catholic Welfare Conference lobbied against birth control; the Knights of Columbus boycotted hotels that hosted birth control events; the Catholic police commissioner of Albany prevented Sanger from speaking there; the Catholic mayor of Boston, James Curley, blocked Sanger from speaking in public; and several newsreel companies, succumbing to pressure from Catholics, refused to cover stories related to birth control.Chesler, p. 220 (newsreels). The ABCL turned some of the boycotted speaking events to their advantage by inviting the press, and the resultant news coverage often generated public sympathy for their cause. However, Catholic lobbying was particularly effective in the legislative arena, where their arguments– that contraception was unnatural, harmful, and indecent– impeded several initiatives, including an attempt in 1924 by Mary Dennett to overturn federal anti-contraception laws.For a <b>detailed</b> discussion <b>of</b> religious <b>objection</b> to birth control, see: Tobin, Kathleen (2001), The American Religious Debate Over Birth Control, 1907–1937, McFarland.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe real-number {{model of}} {{computation}} {{is used in}} computational geometry, in the approach suggested by Blum, Shub, and Smale and in information based complexity. In this {{paper we propose a}} refinement of this model, the TTE-model of computation. In contrast to the real-number model, which is unrealistic or at least too optimistic, the TTE-model is very realistic; i. e., for TTE-algorithms there are digital computers, which behave exactly the same way as predicted by the theoretical model. We start with a <b>detailed</b> discussion <b>of</b> some <b>objections</b> to the real-number model. We introduce the refined model by adding the condition “every partial input or output information of an algorithm is finite” to the assumptions of the IBC-model of computation. First, we explain computability and computational complexity in TTE for the simple case of real functions. Then we apply the refined model to two typical IBC-problems, integration and zero-finding on the spaceC[0; 1] of continuous real functions. We study computability and computational complexity and compare TTE-results with IBC-results. Finally, we briefly discuss the computation of discontinuous problems. This paper does not present new technical results but should be considered as a fresh impetus to reflect on models of computation for numerical analysis and as an invitation to try out the TTE-model of computation in information based complexity...|$|R
