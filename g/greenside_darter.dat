50|$|The <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> (Etheostoma blennioides) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Percidae. It inhabits swift riffles in the eastern United States and {{southern}} Ontario.|$|E
50|$|<b>Greenside</b> <b>darters</b> inhabit gravel riffles {{of large}} creeks to medium rivers and often {{are found in}} swift waters over large {{boulders}} and large rubble.|$|R
50|$|<b>Greenside</b> <b>darters</b> {{typically}} {{live for}} three to five years, grow {{to a maximum of}} 132 mm standard length and sexually mature at one to two years of age. <b>Greenside</b> <b>darters</b> are reproductively active from February to April in the Midwest and Southeastern United States. Spawning occurs over algae- or moss-covered rocks in deep, swift riffles that are guarded by males that vigorously defended against intruders. Females linger in pools below the riffle and move into a male's territory when ready to spawn. Eggs are viscous and stick together in small clumps on green algae (Cladophora), moss (Fontinalis), and riverweed (Podostemaceae). E. blennioides is insectivorous, with analyzed gut contents containing Nematocera larvae, more specifically black fly and midge (Chironomidae) larvae. Significant numbers of mayfly (Ephemeroptera) and caddisfly (Trichoptera) nymphs were also found.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, {{not much}} {{is known about}} the {{lifecycle}} of Swannanoa darters compared to some other members of the genus Etheostoma. The breeding season of the Swannanoa darter is in early spring, and has been observed to occur on 2 April. [...] <b>Greenside</b> <b>darters</b> also spawn in early spring, when water temperatures reach 50-53 Â°F and this is probably similar to the time when Swannanoa darters breed. [...] Swannanoa darters spawn on variable substrates, and these may include vegetation, sand, or rock substrates. Sexual maturity is usually achieved at about one year of age, and growth is rapid. [...] Lengths of about 45 mm are achieved after the first year of growth, as well (Etnier and Starnes 1993). Adults can reach up to 90 mm in length (FishWisePro 2012). <b>Greenside</b> <b>darters,</b> which share many lifecycle characteristics with Swannanoa darters, usually live for about five years.|$|R
5000|$|E. b. pholidotum (central <b>greenside</b> <b>darter)</b> {{occurs in}} north-flowing rivers of the {{northern}} Ozarks, the Wabash basin, the Maumee River drainage, and along the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.|$|E

50|$|The known {{habitat types}} {{of the fish}} include quiet pools with clear water in creeks and rivers, usually with rocky substrates. It may be found with other fish species such as the striped shiner (Luxilus chrysocephalus), brook {{silverside}} (Labidesthes sicculus), blackspotted topminnow (Fundulus olivaceus), longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> (Etheostoma blennioides).|$|E
50|$|The <b>greenside</b> <b>darters</b> have an {{elongated}} {{body with a}} long and rounded snout. The dorsum is greenish-brown, with six or seven dark quadrate saddles and the sides with five to eight dark green, typically U- or W-shaped blotches. The nape, cheeks, opercle, and belly are completely scaled, with the breast naked. The anal fin has six to 10 rays (usually eight) and 13-16 pectoral fin rays, and both are bright green in breeding males; caudal fins are yellowish to clear; dorsal fin rays number 12-15, with red basal bands; breeding males have intensely bluish-green nasal and oral areas and sometimes black on the head.|$|R
40|$|Five darter {{species were}} {{collected}} from streams and rivers in two Indiana counties to determine patterns of microhabitat selection. Selection was based on three microhabitat variables and included flow (velocity), depth, and substrate. A Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) was also performed at each sampling location to differentiate the habitat quality at each site. Darters were segregated from one or more species present and overlap between species was observed. Specifically, <b>greenside</b> and rainbow <b>darters</b> used intermediate substrate in higher flows and depths relative to fantail, johnny, and orangethroat darters. Fantail and orangethroat darters were found among intermediate-large substrate sizes in reduced flow and depth. Johnny darters preferred small-intermediate substrate in greater depths and lowered flow. Microhabitat use is often driven by competition for food and space. Department of BiologyThesis (M.

5000|$|Areas of slow riffles {{and some}} {{moderate}} flows characterize the {{portions of the}} Little Chucky Creek that the chucky madtom occupies. The beds of these streams usually consist of gravel or flat slabs of rock. Due to {{the small amount of}} specimens observed in the wild there is currently no information about the diet of the chucky madtom or whether or not it has any natural predators. The species the chucky madtom competes with is also unknown, although when chucky madtom species were collected there were other species of fish usually present. Species such as the central stoneroller, banded sculpins, <b>greenside</b> darders, redline <b>darters,</b> and banded darters. The current habitat has a few indicators of good stream health like the aforementioned mussels. Upstream from the known range of the madtom there is some impact on the land from agricultural use. Environmental pressures like siltation and destruction of the riparian zone may play a key part in the range of this endangered fish.|$|R

5000|$|The Swannanoa darter (Etheostoma swannanoa) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the perch family. It is endemic to the eastern United States where it occurs in the {{drainage}} of the Tennessee River. It prefers flowing water in riffles in cool, clear mountain streams, with boulder substrates. The diet and natural history of this species have been little studied but are probably {{similar to those of}} its close relative, the <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> (Etheostoma blenniodies). The population trend of this fish seems to be stable and it is a common species with numerous sub-populations over its limited range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
5000|$|The Swannanoa darter prefers {{flowing water}} in riffles pools in cool, clear {{mountain}} streams. [...] For the <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> (Etheostoma blenniodies), {{a close relative}} of the Swannanoa darter found in similar areas, juveniles mostly eat midge larvae and microcrustaceans. Adults have more varied diets, primarily made up of mayflies and caddisflies. Adults also eat midge, black fly, and other aquatic insect larvae. In some areas, such as the Little River of Tennessee, adults ate many Leptoxis spp. snails. [...] Feeding intensity is much less in winter and greatest in May and June. Juvenile specimens were lacking in summer and early fall collections. [...] This suggests the juvenile habitat {{is different from the}} adult habitat. Pollution from mining operations and the impoundment of streams and rivers throughout the Swannanoa darterâs range has possibly resulted in declines in distribution.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other fresh}} water mussels {{in the family}} Unionidae, the Ouachita creekshell has a complex life history {{involving}} a larval stage known as a glochidium which attaches itself to the gill, fin or skin of a suitable host fish. The actual host fishes used by Ouachita creekshells are unknown but suitability trials in the laboratory showed that the shadow bass (Ambloplites ariommus) might be the primary host and that other possible hosts include the Creole darter (Etheostoma collettei), the <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> (Etheostoma blennioides) and the green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus). The female Ouachita creekshell produces a lure for potential host fish consisting of movements of papillae on the foot creating a wave action of the mantle. Fish that investigate this get showered in glochidia which have been brooded within the mussel's mantle cavity over the winter period. The glochidia encyst {{on the surface of}} the fish and feed on fish tissue for several weeks. They undergo metamorphosis while encysted before dropping off the host and settling on the stream bed as juvenile creekshells. The fish are unharmed by this process.|$|E
40|$|Species {{introductions}} in freshwater {{ecosystems are}} often complex processes, yet {{an understanding of}} the nature of the introduction can inform management and conservation actions. The <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> (Etheostoma blennioides), until recently a species of special concern, expanded its Canadian range and is now common and widespread in the Grand River watershed (GRW). This is despite there being no evidence of <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> in the GRW prior to 1990. The goal of this study was to genetically characterize the GRW <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> introduction. <b>Greenside</b> <b>darter</b> were sampled in the GRW, the three known native watersheds in Canada, and one site from Ohio. We measured genetic diversity and population structure, and tested for population bottlenecks using eight microsatellite loci. Genotype assignment was used to identify possible introduction sources. Populations in the GRW showed similar genetic diversity to native watershed populations with no evidence for recent or historical population bottlenecks. Genotype assignment showed that one of the Canadian watersheds and the Ohio site were not potential sources of the GRW <b>greenside</b> <b>darter,</b> whereas the Thames River watershed was the most likely source. Substantial population genetic structure exists among the sample sites in the GRW. Clearly, the current widespread and abundant distribution of the <b>greenside</b> <b>darter</b> in the GRW is not the result of recent expansion of an existing native population, but rather multiple introductions into at least three sites in the GRW, followed by rapid population growth. Although the GRW E. blennioides is introduced, it harbours considerable genetic diversity and represents an important northern range extension for this species...|$|E
40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} effluent (MWWE) has {{the potential}} for aquatic degradation, as it is the largest, per volume, anthropogenic discharge in Canada and other areas in the world. With an increasing population in many areas, such as Southern Ontario, there is concern that infrastructure of wastewater treatment facilities {{will not be able to}} maintain adequate treatment and prevent further degradation of the environment. The Grand River watershed, in Southern Ontario, is predicted to have its population increase to 1. 2 million people by 2031 (from 780, 000 people in 2001). Although wastewater treatment has improved, concern remains for receiving environments due to inadequate treatment (i. e. Kitchener) and minimal dilution (i. e. Guelph). This research was conducted to understand current impacts of MWWE in the Grand River watershed on fish communities to support future management and protection. Study sites upstream and downstream were chosen for their proximity to the Guelph, Kitchener, and Waterloo MWWE outfalls, similarity in habitat, and wadeability. Habitat analysis indicated that there were no large physical differences among sites. Fish communities were collected in a standardized method with a backpack electroshocker at each site (six randomly selected 10 m by 10 m sub-sites for 5 min). <b>Greenside</b> <b>Darter</b> (Etheostoma blennioides) and Rainbow Darter (E. caeruleum), the most abundant species, were also analyzed for stable isotope signatures (Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N) at each site. Downstream of the Guelph outfall there were no changes in mean total catch per unit effort (CPUE) or mean total mass. Changes to diversity, resilience, and tolerance in the fish community were attributed to a decreased abundance of <b>Greenside</b> <b>Darter</b> and increased abundance of Rainbow Darter. Downstream of the Kitchener discharge, there was a trend towards decreasing mean total CPUE, especially for darter species, and an increase in mean total mass due to a community shift to larger species including Catostomids and Centrarchids. The changes in abundance of Rainbow Darter, Catostomids, and Centrarchids among reference and Kitchener MWWE exposed sites explained the pattern in resilience, tolerance, and diet classifications. Lower diversity downstream of all three MWWE outfalls can be attributed to the increase in Rainbow Darter abundance. Stable isotope signatures (Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N) of <b>Greenside</b> <b>Darter</b> did not change downstream of the Guelph and Waterloo discharges, but signatures of Rainbow Darter increased immediately below the two outfalls. This shift may be due to the Rainbow Darter being able to take advantage of a change in the environment (i. e. food availability), resulting in its increased abundance and changes in isotopic signature. Directly downstream of the Kitchener outfall both darter species had an increase in Î´ 13 C and a large decrease in Î´ 15 N, likely due to high nutrient inputs from the outfall. The Kitchener wastewater discharge is also associated with a decrease in abundance of fish and a shift in community structure. MWWEs are currently affecting the aquatic environment, including fish communities in the Grand River watershed. Future investments in infrastructure and watershed management should be made to mitigate degradation of water quality in this watershed...|$|E

40|$|Aquatic {{receiving}} environments {{have long}} been used to dilute municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE) which are the largest discharge by volume into the aquatic environment in Canada. These treated effluents are a complex mixture of environmental contaminants that includes natural and synthetic hormones, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, nutrients and ammonia. Discharge of MWWE may lead to serious problems in aquatic environments such as eutrophication, hypoxia as well as increased occurrence of disease and toxicity in resident aquatic biota. Reproductive impairment in fish has also been widely reported in association with exposure to wastewaters. Recently, concerns have been raised {{about the potential for}} municipal effluents to cause endocrine disruption in fish and other organisms. The effects of MWWE on fish and fish populations in Canada are currently poorly understood. The overall objective of this thesis is to contrast the impact of MWWE discharged into two Canadian rivers on sentinel fish species across levels of biological organization ranging from biochemical responses to changes at the fish community level. Results from these studies support the development of robust effects-based biological monitoring approaches to assess the effectiveness of regulations and remedial actions for minimizing the effects of MWWE. Understanding the temporal changes in physiological and reproductive parameters across the annual cycle of a sentinel species is necessary to optimize biomonitoring programs. The annual variability in terms of survival, reproduction and energy storage in the <b>Greenside</b> <b>Darter</b> (Etheostoma blennioides), a potential sentinel species for the Grand River, Ontario, was documented at a reference site across two years. Variation in energy storage and reproductive development indicated by somatic indices (i. e., relative organ size) and steroid production suggest that biomonitoring can be optimized for this species by sampling in late fall or early spring (pre-spawning). With this new knowledge, field studies conducted with small bodied species, including Rainbow Darter (E. caeruleum), Brook Stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and Fathead Minnow (Pimephales promelas) have demonstrated that, when sampled during the appropriate season (e. g., pre-spawning), they can be used as effective biomonitoring tools to detect fish responses associated with exposure to MWWEs. Two sentinel fish species, Rainbow Darter and <b>Greenside</b> <b>Darter,</b> were then used to examine the impact of two MWWE discharges on fish in the Grand River, Ontario, relative to reference sites in two seasons (fall and early spring). Fish responses, in terms of energy storage (condition factor, liver size), energy utilization (gonadosomatic indices) and reproduction (in vitro sex steroid production, cellular development and intersex) were assessed at each site. Both sentinel species were longer and heavier downstream of the wastewater outfalls. However, these larger fish did not demonstrate consistent increases in condition and liver somatic indices. MWWE-exposed male Rainbow and Greenside Darters had impaired capacity to produce androgens in vitro, lower gonadosomatic indices and altered sperm cell staging. Exposed female fish also had impaired capacity to produce estrogens in vitro, however, they did not demonstrate differences in oocyte development. Male Rainbow and Greenside Darters collected downstream of both MWWE discharges showed increased incidence of intersex (33 - 100 %) in contrast to very low occurrences of this condition in upstream agricultural and urban reference sites. This increased incidence of intersex coincided with reductions in gonadosomatic indices and capacity to produce steroids, demonstrating the ability of MWWE to alter the reproductive systems of these fish. The fish communities downstream of the the MWWE outfalls demonstrated differences in abundance, diversity, and species composition when compared to reference sites. MWWE exposed sites had few of the darter species that dominate the fish community at reference sites. More mobile fish species such as suckers (Catostomidae spp.) and sunfish (Centrarchidae spp.) were more common downstream of the outfalls, with occurances becoming more pronounced downstream of the second sewage discharge. Wascana Creek, Saskatchewan, downstream of the wastewater treatment plant for the City of Regina can be up to 100 % treated municipal wastewater. Brook Stickleback and Fathead Minnow exhibited delayed spawning and altered gonadal development downstream of the wastewater outfall. Exposed male Fathead Minnows were feminized, having lower expression of secondary sexual characteristics (i. e., loss of nuptial tubercles, dorsal pad, and dorsal fin dot) and induction of the female egg-yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin. Fathead Minnows also showed cellular damage to the gills and kidneys. These responses indicate exposure to a variety of environmental contaminants in the effluent such as ammonia as well as endocrine disruptors. The potential effect of MWWE discharges in these two Canadian watersheds on fish responses was demonstrated across various levels of biological organization including reduced sex steroid production, altered gonadal development, reduction in gonadosomatic indices, delayed spawning, and changes in fish assemblages. An effects-based monitoring approach using sentinel species can be successfully applied to detect changes associated with MWWE outfalls, as long as sampling of sentinel species is conducted during optimal time periods (i. e., when somatic indices are maximized and variability among individuals is minimized). MWWE can impair the reproductive potential of fish beyond a threshold where impacts are expressed at higher levels of organization such as populations or communities. It is essential to make mechanistic linkages between responses at different levels to determine the overall potential impact of effluents on fish. The collection of responses across multiple levels of biological organization can complement and support development of biomonitoring approaches that are focused at the population and community levels such as those being proposed for MWWE in Canada...|$|E
40|$|Fast paced {{population}} growth in urban areas of southern Ontario is putting increased pressure on the surrounding aquatic environment. The City of Guelph uses the Speed River to assimilate its municipal wastewater effluent. With a projected 57 % population increase in the watershed by 2031, the assimilative capacity of the river may be challenged in the coming years. The Guelph Wastewater Treatment Plant uses tertiary treatment methods greatly reducing ammonia, suspended solids and phosphate concentrations in the effluent. However there are still impacts detectable related to excessive nutrients released into this relatively small river (6 th order) which promotes algae and aquatic macrophyte growth. There is also concern about a variety of emerging contaminants that may enter the river and impact {{the health of the}} ecosystem. The research in this thesis examined the seasonal and spatial variability and extent of the impacts of the wastewater effluent on the riffle fish communities in the Speed River. Stable isotope signatures (Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N) were used to understand the changes in the dominant benthic fish species, Rainbow Darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) and Greenside Darters (E. blennioides), relative to changes in invertebrate signatures and their abundance. Rainbow Darters were extremely abundant relative to Greenside Darters at the site immediately downstream of the effluent outfall, particularly in August. The benthic invertebrate community was distinctly different downstream of the effluent outfall, especially in the summer, with a reduced abundance of Elmidae beetle larvae and increased abundance of isopods (Caecidotea intermedius) compared to upstream. Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N of the two darters species were similar at all sites in May and July, but in August and October Rainbow Darter signatures were more enriched in the two heavier isotopes at sites downstream of the effluent outfall. The vast majority of invertebrate taxa sampled were also enriched at the downstream sites. An analysis of Rainbow and <b>Greenside</b> <b>Darter</b> stomach contents revealed that Rainbow Darters incorporated more isopods and other invertebrates in their diet, especially at the immediate downstream sites suggesting that they are more adaptable to the altered downstream environment. The feeding habits of Greenside Darters appear to change between July and August in response to changes in habitat and food availability. They are potentially consuming food organisms with less enriched isotopic signatures, which results in their isotopic signatures not rising during these months like most of the invertebrates and other fish. Alternatively, the Greenside Darters may move across the stream to feed on invertebrates that remain unexposed to the wastewater effluent. These impacts, although subtle, may be a reflection of the Speed River ecosystem being compromised by nutrient inputs from the wastewater effluent. With the impending increase in demand on the treatment plant (e. g., {{population growth}}), ongoing treatment and infrastructure improvements may be needed in the future to maintain the current ecosystem structure...|$|E
