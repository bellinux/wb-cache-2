50|$|While {{passing through}} the detector, a {{particle}} will ionise the gas atoms by pulling up an electron creating an electron/ion pair (1). When no electric field is applied, the ion/electron pair recombines and nothing happens. But here, within an electric field {{in the order of}} 400 V/cm the electron will drift (2) toward the amplification electrode (the mesh) and the ion toward the cathode. When the electron arrives close to the mesh (3), it enters an intense electric field (typically on the order of 4 kV/cm in the amplification gap).Accelerated by this field, the electron reaches enough energy to produce ion/electron pairs that will also ionise the gas, creating pairs; it’s the avalanche effect (4). By this means, several thousand pairs are created from hundreds of primary charges, which originate from the interactions with the <b>impinging</b> <b>particle.</b> The primary charges need to be multiplied to create a significant signal. A last, we read the electronic signal on the readout electrode (5) by a charge amplifier. The readout electrode is usually segmented in strips and/or pixels in order to obtain the position of the <b>impinging</b> <b>particle</b> in the detector. The amplitude and the shape of the signal, read via the electronic on the readout electrode, gives information on the time and energy of the particle.|$|E

40|$|The kinetic {{modelling}} {{of material}} erosion and impurity transport on divertor plates in edge localized modes (ELMs) in tokamaks has been performed using the SDPIC and ITCD codes. The kinetic information on <b>impinging</b> <b>particles</b> and background plasma such as incident angle and energy, electric potential and field during ELMs can be well {{treated by the}} SDPIC code; this is generally difficult to obtain in experiments and fluid simulations due to diagnostic and technical limitations. The heat flux modelled with the SDPIC code can well reproduce the experimental result in EAST. The major power delivered by ions results in a strong increase of the erosion rate for both carbon and tungsten substrates during ELMs. The variation of the incident angle of <b>impinging</b> <b>particles</b> can be interpreted by the change of the potential drop induced by fast electrons during ELMs. The time difference in the peak values of erosion rate between the carbon and tungsten substrates {{is determined by the}} particle flux and sputtering yield. The heat loads for present ELMs in EAST cannot cause the ablation and melting of surface material. The eroded tungsten species show different transport properties from the eroded carbon species due to the small mean free path of W atoms and consequent prompt redeposition.

A 21 × 21 array of 0. 18 × 0. 18 mm 2 pixels was realized {{on one side of}} a 10. 0 × 10. 0 × 0. 5 mm 3 polycrystalline diamond substrate by means of laser induced surface graphitization. With the same technique, a large graphite contact, used for detector biasing, was fabricated on the opposite side. A coincidence detecting method was used with two other reference polycrystalline diamond detectors for triggering, instead of commonly used scintillators, positioned in the front and {{on the back of the}} sensor-array with respect to the <b>impinging</b> <b>particles</b> trajectory. The collected charge distribution at each pixel was analyzed as a function of the applied bias. No change in the pulse height distribution was recorded by inverting the bias voltage polarity, denoting contacts ohmicity and symmetry. A fairly good pixel response uniformity was obtained: the collected charge most probable value saturates for all the pixels at an electric field strength of about ± 0. 6 V/μm. Under saturation condition, the average collected charge was equal to = 1. 64 ± 0. 02 fC, implying a charge collection distance of about 285 m. A similar result, within 2 %, was also obtained for 400 MeV electrons at beam test facility at INFN Frascati National Laboratory.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{collision of}} a point particle and an infinitely thin planar domain wall interacting gravitationally within the linearized gravity in Minkowski space-time of arbitrary dimension. In this setting {{we are able to}} describe analytically the perforation of the wall by an <b>impinging</b> <b>particle,</b> showing that it is accompanied by excitation of the spherical shock branon wave propagating outwards with the speed of light. Formally, the shock wave is a free solution of the branon wave equation which has to be added to ensure the validity of the retarded solution at the perforation point. Physically, the domain wall gets excited due to the shake caused by an instantaneous change of sign of the repulsive gravitational force. This effect is shown to hold, in particular, in four space-time dimensions, being applicable to the problem of cosmological domain walls. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures, revtex...|$|E
40|$|Within Surface and Coating Technologies, the High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) {{thermal spray}} process generates {{significant}} peening stresses {{due to the}} impact at high velocity of semi molten particles onto the substrate.

In a reactor environment, structural materials are often mechanically strained, and an expanded understanding of how this strain affects the generation of defects may be important for predicting microstructural evolution and damage accumulation under such conditions. In this study, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations in which various types of homogeneous strains are applied to BCC Fe and the effect on defect generation is examined. It is found that volume-conserving shear strains yield no statistically significant variations in the stable number of defects created via cascades in BCC Fe.

The sputtering process normally causes defects to the graphene lattice and adversely affects its properties.  Sputtering of WS 2  yields {{significant amounts of}} energetic particles, specifically negative S ions, and reflected neutral Ar, and it is therefore used as a model system in this work. The disorder-free sputtering is achieved by increasing the sputteringpressure of Ar thereby shifting the kinetic energy distribution towards lower energies for the <b>impinging</b> <b>particle</b> flux at the substrate.  Raman spectroscopy is {{used to assess the}} amount of damage to the graphene film.  Monte Carlo simulations of the sputteringprocess show that W is completely thermalized already at relatively low sputtering pressure, whereas Ar and S need a comparably higher pressure to thermalize so as to keep the graphene film intact.
