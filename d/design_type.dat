5|$|In 2006, Airbus tested three {{styles of}} winglet {{intended}} {{to counteract the}} wing's induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first <b>design</b> <b>type</b> to be tested was developed by Airbus and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme. The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas. Two aircraft {{were used in the}} flight test evaluation campaign– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.|$|E
25|$|However, {{before the}} new <b>design</b> <b>type</b> was {{accepted}} formally by the Navy, the A6M3 Model 22 already stood ready for service in December 1942. Approximately 560 aircraft of the new type had been produced in the meantime by Mitsubishi Jukogyo K.K.|$|E

25|$|A further {{investigation}} into car <b>design,</b> <b>type</b> of traction and {{the method of}} current collection {{was made by the}} City Engineer and the Electrical Engineer during a visit to New York and Boston. They confirmed that the overhead electric system would have to be used, although the conduit current collection system was preferable. Tenders were invited from Westinghouse and Dick, Kerr & Co. for cars, and that of Dick, Kerr & Co. for 12 cars was accepted.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{highways}} or {{road networks}} where capacity is disaggregated into unlinked trips over individual route segments, railway capacity is fundamentally considered a network system. As a result, many components are {{causes and effects}} of system disruptions. Maintenance must acknowledge the vast array of a route's performance (type of train service, origination/destination, seasonal impacts), line's capacity (length, terrain, number of tracks, types of train control), trains throughput (max speeds, acceleration/deceleration rates), and service features with shared passenger-freight tracks (sidings, terminal capacities, switching routes, and <b>design</b> <b>type).</b>|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{there was}} no {{information}} on the effectiveness for respirators of specific <b>design</b> (<b>type)</b> in the workplace. This {{is due to the}} fact that the measurement of workplace PF is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive work, which was carried out not very often. For these types of respirators experts used the results of WPF measurements of other types of respirators, which are similar. For example, the effectiveness of the Supplied Air Respirators (SARs, with hose) was considered similar to the efficiency of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs), if they have the same facepieces and the same air supply mode. Finally, in the absence of this information, specialists could use the results of Simulated WPF measurements; or estimates of competent experts.|$|E

As a result, she was in very poor condition by the late 1890s, which prompted a major reconstruction of her into a pre-dreadnought <b>design</b> <b>type</b> vessel in Genoa. The ship's armament was overhauled, though the gun turrets that were to have mounted [...] guns never received the weapons. A new propulsion system was also installed, which significantly improved performance.|$|E
