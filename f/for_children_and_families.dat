5|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois {{and raised}} in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Clinton {{graduated}} from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates <b>for</b> <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Families.</b> She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Rose Law Firm the following year.

5|$|In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates <b>for</b> <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Families,</b> a state-level {{alliance}} with the Children's Defense Fund. Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana) appointed her {{to the board of}} directors of the Legal Services Corporation, and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981. From mid-1978 to mid-1980, she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job. During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.|$|E

5|$|The 400-page report made 108 {{recommendations}} in child protection reform. Regional and local committees <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>families</b> {{are to be}} set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led {{to the implementation of}} the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the band}} self-released an EP titled First Impressions {{which was the}} product of a two-day session at A-Room Studios with Brian Tochilin. Only 1,000 copies were made and the band members sold them out of their cars. Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet {{recorded}} 12 tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released Identity Crisis on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album's proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services <b>for</b> <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> <b>Families.</b> More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued Identity Crisis, and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.|$|E

40|$|My Diploma Thesis themed "the Crisis centre <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> in the South Bohemian Region {{within an}} {{intervention}} care has a research character. This thesis {{is divided into}} two large parts and consists of a theory and practice. The theoretical part is divided into five major chapters. The first one describes the Crisis centre <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> in the South Bohemian Region. The second one is devoted to CAN syndrome. The third one deals with the most important legislation solving breaking of the basic children rights. In the fourth chapter I focus on <b>family</b> <b>and</b> the last one is devoted to divorces, serious child suits, solving of divorce suits in a Crisis centre. The practical part is research oriented. The aim of the thesis was to find out to what extent the intervention care is implemented {{in the work of the}} Crisis centre <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> in the South Bohemian Region during a divorce period and after. In the first hypothesis I supposed that the clients who used the support to families in a difficult life situation in the Crisis centre <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> in the South Bohemian Region managed to keep their role of parentage also after the divorce and finished conflicts <b>and</b> <b>child</b> manipulation. In the second hypothesis I supposed that clients managed to keep their role of parentage also after the divorce and finished conflicts <b>and</b> <b>child</b> manipulation regardless of being married, divorced or single and whether they care together for own or adopted child. To confirm or disconfirm the defined hypotheses I used the method of a questionnaire. The questionnaires were intended for employees of the Crisis centre <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family,</b> the clients of the Crisis centre <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> in the South Bohemian Region and to public. I prepared a different type of questionnaire for each group. In total I handed out 115 questionnaires. All of them were returned to me. The return was 100...|$|R

25|$|The {{interim report}} {{highlighted}} {{a number of}} core issues: that speech, language and communication are not only essential life skills but fundamental human rights; that early identification of problems and intervention is important to avoid social problems later on; and that {{the current system of}} treatment is patchy, i.e. {{there is a need for}} services to be continually provided <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>families</b> from an early age.|$|E
