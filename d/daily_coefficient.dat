40|$|The {{short-term}} (hourly and daily) {{variation in}} chromophoric {{dissolved organic matter}} (CDOM) in lakes is largely unknown. We assessed the spectral characteristics of light absorption by CDOM in a eutrophic, humic shallow mixed lake of temperate Sweden at a high-frequency (30 [*]min) interval and during a full growing season (May to October). Physical time series, such as solar radiation, temperature, wind, and partial pressures of carbon dioxide in water and air, were measured synchronously. We identified a strong radiation-induced summer CDOM loss (25 to 50 %) that developed over 4 [*]months, which was accompanied by strong changes in CDOM absorption spectral shape. The magnitude of the CDOM loss exceeded subhourly to daily variability by an order of magnitude. Applying Fourier analysis, we demonstrate that variation in CDOM remained largely unaffected by rapid shifts in weather, and no apparent response to in-lake dissolved organic carbon production was found. In autumn, CDOM occasionally showed variation at hourly to daily time scales, reaching a maximum <b>daily</b> <b>coefficient</b> of variation of 15 %. We suggest that lake-internal effects on CDOM are quenched in humic lake waters by dominating effects associated with imported CDOM and solar exposure. Since humic lake waters belong {{to one of the}} most abundant lake types on Earth, our results have important implications for the understanding of global CDOM cycling...|$|E

Stream ecosystems respond to extremes as well as central tendency variables. We selected ten flow variables that, in our judgment, are sufficient to characterize the hydrologic regime of a stream relevant to biota. These variables include the following that quantify the hydrologic extremes. 1) base flow index (BFI) 2) <b>daily</b> <b>coefficient</b> of variation (DAYCV) 3) average daily flow (QMEAN), 4) Number of zero flow days (ZERODAY) 5) bank full flow (Q 1. 67) 6) Colwell 2 ̆ 7 s index 7) seven day minimum (7 Qmin) 8) seven day maximum (7 Qmax) 9) number of flow reversals (NOR) and 10) flood frequency.

We are quantifying the above mentioned variables from stream flow data obtained from USGS Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN) stream gauges in the Western United States.

(2) observed considerable variability in serum theophylline concentrations in infants receiving the same dose on a body-weight basis. This large variability in serum theophylline is of concern becauseof the rather narrow therapeutic range for theophylline (2, 8). Maximum thera-peutic activity is observed to occur within the 10 to 20 mg/liter range (5, 8), while toxicity is more likely to be observed when concentrations exceed 20 mg/liter (9).

This investigation examined {{whether there was a}} relationship between ambient air pollution in Santa Clara County, California and emergency room visits for asthma during the winters of 1988 - 1989 through 1991 - 1992. Emergency room (ER) records from three acute-care hospitals were abstracted to compile daily visits for asthma and a control diagnosis (gastroenteritis) for 3 -month periods during each winter. Air monitoring data included <b>daily</b> <b>coefficient</b> of haze (COH) and every-other-day particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 microns (PM 10, 24 -hr average), as well as hourly nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations. Daily COH measurements were used to predict values for missing days of PM 10 to develop a complete PM 10 time series. Daily data were also obtained for temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. In time-series analyses using Poisson regression, consistent relationships were found between ER visits for asthma and PM 10. Same-day nitrogen dioxide concentrations were also associated with asthma ER visits, while ozone was not. Because there was a significant interaction between PM 10 and minimum temperature in this data set, estimates of relative risks (RRs) for PM 10 -associated asthma ER visits were temperature-dependent. A 60 micrograms/m 3 change in PM 10 (2 -day lag) corresponded to RRs of 1. 43 (95 % CI = 1. 18 - 1. 69) at 20 degrees F, representing {{the low end of the}} temperature distribution, 1. 27 (95 % CI = 1. 13 - 1. 42) at 30 degrees F, and 1. 11 (95 % CI = 1. 03 - 1. 19) at 41 degrees F, the mean of the observed minimum temperature. ER visits for gastroenteritis were not significantly associated with any pollutant variable. Several sensitivity analyses, including the use of robust regressions and of nonparametric methods for fitting time trends and temperature effects in the data, supported these findings. These results demonstrate an association between ambient wintertime PM 10 and exacerbations of asthma in an area where one of the principal sources of PM 10 is RWC...|$|E

[...] Humboldt State University: In Natural Resources, Watershed Management, 2012 Accurate modeling of forest hydrology regimes (i. e. hourly, daily and annual discharges, peak flows) requires detailed datasets to define the physiography, land cover, and meteorological variables. In this study, I used the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model to simulate hourly stream discharge for 6 hydrologic years in a small, coastal watershed (463 ha), using meteorological data sourced from a nearby National Weather Service station, and a combination of remote sensing and timber harvest records to prepare model inputs. During the model simulation period, approximately 20 percent (100 ha) of the basin was harvested. I calibrated and validated the model with continuous discharge measurements made in the study area, and used the Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency, the coefficient of determination, and percent bias metrics to evaluate model success at simulating hourly, mean daily, and total annual discharges. Simulated annual discharges over the six year period display a 2 percent to - 23 percent bias compared to observed values. Nash / Sutcliffe and coefficient of determination metrics iv were evaluated for hourly and daily discharges, with the daily metrics improving two percent to 10 percent over hourly metrics. Daily Nash / Sutcliffe values ranged from 0. 58 to 0. 85 and <b>daily</b> <b>coefficient</b> of determination values show the greatest success ranging from 0. 82 to 0. 94. The mean absolute error for hourly discharges ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 1 cubic meters per second and showed a slightly better performance when evaluated at the daily level. Daily mean peak flows display varying degrees of scatter year to year, with Root Mean Square Errors ranging from 0. 35 to 0. 68 cms. Poor model performance can be somewhat explained by the uncertainty in the meteorological and solar record (out-ofbasin observations) and limited soil data. The model???s performance could be improved with either the inclusion of preferential flow pathways (model coding), detailed soil data (spatial variability of soil properties), or in-basin meteorological observations.

Lack of reliable, cheap and easy-to-use instruments, associated with the chaotic and varying nature of the meteorological and plant physiological factors influencing ET cause these estimations to be based on calculated values rather than the measured ones. The two-step approach where ET from a reference crop is calculated and multiplied by empirical crop coefficients to obtain ET from a crop has gained wide acceptance. <b>Daily</b> <b>coefficients</b> for a winter wheat crop growing under standard conditions, i. e. not short of water and growing under optimal agronomic conditions, were estimated for a cold sub-humid climate regime. One of the two methods used to estimate ET from a reference crop required net radiation (Rn) as input. Two sets of coefficients were used for calculating Rn. Weather data from a meteorological station was used to estimate Rn and ET from the reference crop. The winter wheat ET was measured using an eddy covariance system during the main parts of the growing seasons 2004 and 2005. The meteorological data and field measurements were quality controlled and discarded from the analysis if flagged for errors. Daily values of ET from the reference crop and winter wheat calculated from hourly values were used to calculate the crop <b>coefficients.</b> Average <b>daily</b> crop <b>coefficients</b> were in the 1. 1 - 1. 15 range during mid-season with standard deviations ranging from 0. 13 to 0. 23 for both years.

However, not much {{is known about the}} daily and seasonal patterns and magnitudes in hourly Kc values for soybean. In addition, locally developed Kc values are necessary for more robust within-season irrigation management, crop ET estimation, and water balance analyses. Hourly and daily Kc functions were developed for soybean in south-central Nebraska through extensive field research. Actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) was measured using a Bowen ratio energy balance system. <b>Daily</b> crop <b>coefficients</b> were calculated as Kc = ETa/ETref, wherein reference (potential) evapotranspiration (ETref) was calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation with a fixed canopy resistance for both alfalfa-reference (ETr) and grassreference (ETo) surfaces. The Kc values were derived in two forms: (1) a single (normal or average Kc) Kcr based on ETr, and Kco based on ETo; and (2) a basal coefficient (Kcbr) based on ETr, and Kcbo based on ETo. The seasonal patterns of variation of Kcr, Kco, Kcbr, and Kcbo were examined on five different temporal base scales: days after emergence (DAE), cumulative growing degree days (GDD), leaf area index (LAI), fractional green canopy groundcover (CC), and plant phenology (V and R stages). The 2007 and 2008 growing season ETa totals were 535 and 514 mm, respectively. Extreme hourly Kc values were frequently observed in the early morning and late afternoon hours when ETa was very low relative to ETr and ETo. Daily means of the 10 to 13 hourly values computed for Kcr ranged from 0. 25 to 1. 06 in 2007 and from 0. 15 to 1. 02 in 2008, whereas those computed for Kco ranged from 0. 39 to 1. 37 in 2007 and from 0. 22 to 1. 29 in 2008.

A sequential estimation algorithm {{was used to}} obtain <b>daily,</b> zonal Fourier <b>coefficients</b> of the several parameters of the LIMS dataset for 216 days of 1978 - 79. The coefficients are available at up to 28 pressure levels and at every two degrees of latitude from 64 S to 84 N and at the synoptic time of 12 UT. Example plots were prepared and archived from the data at 10 hPa of January 1, 1979, to illustrate the overall coherence of the features obtained with the LIMS-retrieved parameters...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of the}} global model of ionospheric slab thickness (GMIST) in terms of F 2 layer critical frequency (foF 2) estimation during geomagnetic disturbed conditions. Hourly values of foF 2 as obtained from ionosonde stations located at equatorial, low- and mid-latitude regions are compared with the corresponding GMIST and IRI-STORM modeled values. For this purpose, the correlation <b>coefficient,</b> <b>daily</b> mean, root mean square error and improvement percentage are calculated at different regions and geomagnetic disturbance levels. The results show that GMIST is more accurate than IRI-STORM model in terms of foF 2 estimation at low- and mid-latitude regions, while at equatorial areas GMIST is less accurate during geomagnetically disturbed and quiet conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|A 51 -day {{feeding trial}} {{was carried out}} to {{determine}} the effects of various dietary levels of brewer’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the growth performance, body composition and nutrient utilization in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, juveniles. Fish (7. 6 ± 0. 3 g) were stocked into eighteen 1, 000 -L tanks (100 fish per tank; n = 3) and fed to apparent satiation six isonitrogenous (27 % crude protein) and isoenergetic (19 kJ/g) diets, formulated to contain different dried yeast levels (0 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 30 % or 40 % diet) in substitution to fishmeal. Body weight tripled at the end of the feeding trial for fish fed up to 20 % dietary yeast incorporation. <b>Daily</b> growth <b>coefficient</b> (DGC, % body weight/day) decreased with increasing dietary yeast level (P < 0. 0001). Voluntary feed intake (VFI, %BW/day) did not vary significantly with increasing yeast level. Fish fed 40 % yeast showed significant reduction in protein efficiency rate, protein retention and nitrogen gain. Increasing levels of dietary yeast did not significantly affect protein or lipid digestibility. Dietary dried yeast was seemingly palatable to tilapia juveniles and was suitable up to 15 % inclusion to promote growth and efficient diet utilization, without affecting body composition...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addressed}} if sturgeon larvae {{grew and}} survived better when fed a probiotic. Bacillus spp. were bioencapsulated in Daphnia magna (Straus 1820) and fed to Acipencer persicus (Borodin 1897) larvae. Bacillus bacteria (three species {{in a commercial}} preparation, Protexin Aquatic) were bioencapsulated within Daphnia at three concentrations by holding the Daphnia in suspensions of 1 × 10 7, 2 × 10 7 or 3 × 10 7 bacteria per milliliter for 10 hours. The sturgeon larvae were fed {{one of the three}} probiotic treatments at a level of 30 percent body weight 5 times a day. The growth and survival oflarvae fed the protbiotic enriched Daphnia were compared to those larvae fed a control treatment ofunbioencapsulated Daphnia magna. The results showed that larvae fed the probiotic Bacillus spp. hadincreased final body weight and specific growth rate in comparison to control treatment. The probioticbacillus also had significant positive effects on daily growth ratio, <b>daily</b> growth <b>coefficient,</b> averageweight gain and survival in comparison to those fed the control treatment. The food conversation ratiowas the one factor that decreased significantly in comparison with the control treatment. The amount ofprobiotic used did not improve performance, so larviculture can be increased merely by the addition of oflow level of probiotics...|$|R
40|$|Three {{prevailing}} hypotheses, namely resource availability, ecosystem size, and disturbance, {{are often}} used to explain variations in food chain length (FCL). Rivers vary widely in size, resources, and disturbance dimensions, even within the same catchment, providing an ideal platform to test ecological drivers of FCL in aquatic systems. In this study, we tested how resource availability (indicated by macroinvertebrate biomass), ecosystem size (indicated by basin area), and disturbance (indicated by <b>daily</b> water-level <b>coefficients</b> of variation) affected stable isotope-based estimates of FCL in subtropical rivers in the Province Jiangxi, China. The FCL varied widely among the studied rivers {{with a mean of}} 3. 09 (range 2. 00 - 3. 99). Model-selection results indicated that resource availability could explain 60 % of the observed variation in FCL. The FCL of the studied rivers was positively correlated with fish richness and the total area of fish community delta C- 13 -delta N- 15 bi-plot space, thereby indicating that an increase in fish diversity could influence the trophic structure within the food web and lead to a longer FCL. Taken together, our results suggest that resource availability could predict FCL in subtropical rivers and plays a significant role in maintaining longer FCLs by providing more energy to support upper trophic-level fishes...|$|R
40|$|The {{watersheds}} of the Des Moines lobe {{in north}} central Iowa have fundamentally {{changed in the}} last 170 years. Where there was once prairie, row crop agriculture now dominates. This progress has enabled this small region of the Midwest to provide food, fuel, feed, and fiber for millions, but with recent flooding events of 2008 and 2010 questions have been raised about the hydrological impacts of these lands. These flood events are driven by peak flow and concerns about the effect of drainage on peak flow should be investigated. MIKE SHE, a watershed scale model, was used to simulate daily streamflow in a multisite comparison to determine if the model is suitable to simulate streamflow in heavily drained agricultural land. The model was tested for five years (2007 - 2011) in two similar watersheds (1127 ha and 1356 ha) in Palo Alto County, Iowa. In the testing watershed, the simulated streamflow correlated well with the observed streamflow, as shown by a <b>daily</b> Nash-Sutcliffe <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 62 and a coefficient of determination of 0. 66. Likewise, the model performed well in the validation watershed with a <b>daily</b> Nash-Sutcliffe <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 73 and coefficient of determination of 0. 79. This shows that the model can be used in the future to simulate flow in similar agricultural regions throughout the Midwest that employ tile drainage to maintain suitable water table levels needed for crop growth. Changes in land use management and drainage design were simulated to better understand the hydrological impact that land use and tile drainage has on the landscape. It was shown that if row crops are converted to pasture or prairie, with drainage infrastructure intact, evapotranspiration would increase by 25 % and the magnitude of peak events would decrease by over 50 % in some cases. Likewise, if the drainage infrastructure was removed and only perennial grassland remained, similar to likely pre-settlement conditions for the region, then water table height becomes the main driver of surface flow and overall flow from both watersheds would decrease by 55 %. Alternatively, if the depth of tile drains were decreased from 1. 2 m to 0. 75 m the effect would allow for 7 to 20 mm of extra surface runoff, while decreasing subsurface flow and maintaining the total flow. Lastly, if all drainage infrastructures were removed from the watersheds and row crop monoculture were to be maintained there would be an increased frequency of peak flow that may lead to damaging flood events. These results show that MIKE SHE could be used in land use management decisions and assessment of drainage design for mitigation of hydrological impacts downstream of heavily drained agricultural watersheds. This may help target land areas for wetland placement by showing the effects of eliminating drainage structure will have on the watershed...|$|R
