5|$|Nikki Finn is a {{carefree}} young woman, who {{is always}} dressed in a leather jacket and skirt, with fire-red lips, platinum bob hair and speaking in a high-pitched voice. One day, her boyfriend Johnny uncovers two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes pictures of the theft. Johnny puts the pictures in a safety deposit box and gives Nikki the key for safekeeping.

This is seen during the animated opening credits of the film.|$|E
5|$|Banza {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who he looked to for support. Mandaba {{went along with the}} plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> a Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed {{to work on the}} film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning of Wednesday 3 February 2010, the 26-year-old Faiza Ashraf {{was waiting for the}} bus going from her home in Haslum to {{downtown}} Oslo, where she worked in a clothing boutique. While she was standing at the bus-stop at approx. 06:44, 25-year-old Håvard Nyfløt pulled up, grabbed her and forced her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> his car. Ashraf managed to call the police from her cell-phone and inform them that she was being kidnapped, but she could not give her exact location. This event was witnessed by at least one passing motorist.|$|E
25|$|Layering is a {{technique}} in which rooting is encouraged from part of a plant, usually a branch, while it is still attached to the parent plant. After rooting, the branch {{is removed from the}} parent and grown as an independent entity. For bonsai, both ground layering and air layering can create a potential bonsai, by transforming a mature branch <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> a new tree. The point at which rooting is encouraged can be close to the location of side branches, so the resulting rooted tree can immediately have a thick trunk and low branches, characteristics that complement bonsai aesthetics.|$|E

50|$|The dendroglyph ritual may be {{associated}} with death or remembrance. Many scholars over the years have tried to penetrate the reasons behind these incisions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kopi (karaka) trees and have not come up with explanations that satisfy everybody. The dendroglyphs cover a range of features, with many representing human figures and others clearly representative of birds, fish, plants and animals. The momori rakau are among the few visible remaining signs of Moriori culture from pre-European contact.|$|R
5000|$|The Highwaymen {{were mostly}} self-taught painters, who mentored each other. Excluded from the {{traditional}} world of art shows and galleries, the Highwaymen painted on inexpensive Upson board or masonite and framed their paintings with crown molding (brushed with gold or silver paint to [...] "antique" [...] them). They packed these paintings <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> their cars and sold them door-to-door throughout the south-eastern coast of Florida. Sometimes the paintings were stacked before the oil paint was dry.Paintings by the Florida Highwaymen are prized by collectors today, but their story is about much more than art.|$|R
500|$|Next, the Kings of Wrestling (Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Jeff Jarrett) {{fought the}} team of Jeff Hardy, A.J. Styles, and Randy Savage in a Six Man Tag Team match. Earlier in the night, The Kings of Wrestling {{attacked}} Savage and stuffed him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> a limo, which spend off out of the arena's parking lot. [...] Without Savage, Styles and Hardy had to work the match by themselves. After several minutes of Hardy and Styles fighting off {{all the members of}} The Kings of Wrestling, Savage returned to the arena and walked down to the ring, where he was tagged into the match by Hardy. A few moments later, Savage pinned Jarrett after a punch to the jaw.|$|E
500|$|Late on February 29, 2008, {{according}} to a report given by the Catholic News Service, Archbishop Rahho was [...] from his car in the Al-Nur district of the city; his bodyguards and driver were killed. [...] According to church officials, [...] "gunmen sprayed the Archbishop's car with bullets, killed two bodyguards and shoved the bishop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> a car.

[...] "He believed that this money would not be paid for good works and would be used for killing and more evil actions," [...] the officials said. Other reports stated that also investigators believed the archbishop may have been shot {{at the time of the}} kidnapping.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up 15-year-old Korean dance student Aiko Koo, who had decided to {{hitchhike}} to a dance class after missing her bus. He again drove to a remote area, brandishing a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside (Kemper had previously gained the 15-year-old's trust while holding her at gunpoint) where he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her and kill her. He subsequently packed her body <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> his car, had a few drinks at a nearby bar, then exited the bar and opened his trunk, [...] "admiring [...] catch like a fisherman," [...] {{and returned to his}} apartment. Back at his apartment, he had sex with the corpse before dismemberment and disposal of her remains in a similar manner as the previous two victims. Aiko's mother, Skaidrite Rubene Koo, called the police to report the disappearance of her daughter and put up hundreds of flyers asking for information as to her daughter's whereabouts, but did not receive one word in response regarding her missing daughter's location or status.|$|E

5000|$|A lung {{dissection}} {{showed that}} Hoffman died by drowning. When asked to theorize {{how this could}} happen, Dr. Hendry, the autopsy doctor, testified that, “This occurred because he fell head first, maskless and presumably unconscious, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diving bell. As {{there is no evidence}} of illness, injury, or environmental hazard, my interpretation is that his loss of consciousness was occasioned by a faint (Syncope). This could have happened, for example, if he had risen quickly to his feet from a squatting position thereby causing a fall of blood pressure. The effects of such an action would have been exaggerated if at the same time he had been over breathing or had closed his nostrils with his fingers to clear his ears.” Dr. Hendry went on to emphasize that his conclusion was “hypothetical,” and that he had “no way of knowing if this happened.” ...|$|R
500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm {{out of the trunk}} of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E
2500|$|According to the terrorist's declarations, {{made some}} {{ten years after}} the event, Moro was woken up at 06:00 AM with the excuse that he had to be moved to another secret base. In contradiction to this Bonisoli said that Moro was told that he had been [...] "pardoned" [...] and was going to be freed. The terrorists put him into a wicker basket and brought him to the parking garage of their base in via Montalcini. They put him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> a red Renault and, after {{covering}} him with a red sheet, Moretti shot Moro with a 9mm Walther PPK and after the weapon jammed, a 7.65mm Škorpion vz. 61.

5000|$|Bukovec is {{the site}} of three known mass graves {{associated}} with the Second World War. The Mačkovec Mass Grave (grobišče Mačkovec) is located in the woods southeast of the settlement. Its location is marked by crosses cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> two trees. It contained the remains of about 40 prisoners of war, members of the White Guard, that were taken from the prison in Ribnica and murdered at the site on 27 or 28 October 1943 by the Partisan Loka Brigade. In October 2013 the remains were disinterred and reburied at the cemetery in Begunje pri Cerknici. The Italian Soldiers Mass Grave (...) is located in the woods south of Bukovec, below the north slope of Mačkovec Hill. It contains the remains of Italian soldiers.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time Park saw Kaelin come {{from the back of}} the {{property}} to the front, Park testified that he saw [...] "a tall black man" [...] of Simpson's height and build enter the front door of the house from the driveway area, after which lights were turned on and Simpson finally answered Park's call. Simpson explained that he had overslept and would be at the front gate soon. Kaelin opened the Ashford gate to let Park drive the limo onto the estate grounds, and Simpson came out of his house through the front door a few minutes later. Both Kaelin and Park helped Simpson put his belongings (which were already outside the front door when Park drove up to the front of Simpson's house) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> the limo for the ride to the airport. Both Kaelin and Park remarked in their testimony that Simpson looked agitated.

Conflicting testimony such as this was to be a recurring theme throughout the trial.|$|E
2500|$|The Brandenburg tornado, which {{produced}} F5 damage and took 31 lives, touched down in Breckinridge County at 4:25pm CDT and followed a [...] path. [...] The tornado first {{moved across the}} north edge of Hardinsburg, inflicting F3 damage to homes at that location. The tornado quickly became violent as it moved into Meade County, producing F4 to F5 damage as it passed north of Irvington, sweeping away numerous homes in this rural area. Vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from residences and mangled, and a few were completely wrapped around trees. One home that was swept away sustained total collapse of a poured concrete walk-out basement wall. A news photographer reported that the tornado [...] "left no grass" [...] as it crossed Kentucky Route 79 in this area, and canceled checks from near Irvington were later found in Ohio. Past Irvington, the tornado tore directly through Brandenburg at F5 intensity, completely leveling and sweeping away numerous homes, {{some of which were}} well-built and anchor-bolted. 18 of the fatalities alone occurred along Green St in Brandenburg, and the town's downtown area was also devastated. Trees and shrubbery in town were debarked and stripped, extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred, and numerous vehicles were destroyed as well, some of which had nothing left but the frame and tires. A curtain rod was found speared deeply <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> one tree in town. Several tombstones in the Cap Anderson cemetery were toppled and broken, and some were displaced a small distance. Exiting Brandenburg, the tornado crossed into Indiana producing F4 damage there before dissipating. The same storm would later produce tornadoes in the Louisville metro area.|$|E
