Set 378 to win, West Indies were left to face the variations of Muralitharan – who bowled doosras and normal off-spin mixed up together as the West Indian batsmen were comprehensively deceived. Four catches went to the hands of Jayawardene who fielded at silly point – not normally the position where most catches are taken, but then again, this wasn't a usual innings. The West Indians were shown up for what they were – run-of-the-mill domestic players who should never have played international cricket, bar possibly Chanderpaul who made 24, Deonarine who even had the cheek to smash Muralitharan for six before being deceived, bowled for 29, and Denesh Ramdin who scampered together 28.

The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out the {{difference}} in the service fairness, customer’s participation behavior, relationship quality and relationship performance perceived by consumer according to the type of clothing store (department store versus Dongdaemun Fashion Town). The subjects of the research were men and women in their 20 s and 30 s who were residing in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do and who had the experience of purchasing clothing product at department store or Dongdaemun Fashion Town. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey, and a total of 424 questionnaires were used for final analysis: 213 questionnaires from the consumers who used department store, plus 211 questionnaires from those who used Dongdaemun Fashion Town. The result of this research showed that there was significant difference <b>in</b> <b>all</b> of service <b>fairness</b> (procedure and outcome), customer’s participation behavior (emotional participation, information participation and physical participation), relationship quality (satisfaction and trust) and relationship performance (repurchase intention, and positive word-of-mouth) perceived by consumer, according to the type of clothing store (clothing stores in department store versus Dongdaemun Fashion Town). Especially, the consumers who used the clothing stores in department store showed better perception of <b>all</b> the service <b>fairness,</b> customer’s participation behavior, relationship quality and relationship outcome.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Internal Auditing)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2010 Developing {{countries}} {{face the}} great challenge of balancing growth with equity and justice. Growth, <b>in</b> <b>all</b> its <b>fairness,</b> should translate into equitable opportunity for all, but as is observed, the distributional effect of growth often does not filter {{down to the}} majority of the socially and economically disadvantaged communities. It is imperative in these situations to embark on a process of developmental change {{to improve the quality of}} life of the majority of the disadvantaged community. South Africa used this strategy to endeavour to encounter or reverse the political history of the country, by encouraging entrepreneurs of previously disadvantaged racial groups through the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to open small businesses. The South African Government believes that the development, growth and sustainability of the Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise (SMME) sector will help the country to decrease the high unemployment rate, and lead the country as a whole to a sustainable economical development. Research has shown that this aim can no longer be achieved by only facilitating access to finance to entrepreneurs. They argue that some management strategies such as risk management should be introduced, understood and applied by small business owners, in order for their businesses to go beyond their actual estimated survival period referred as 3 to 5 years maximum. This research provides background to which risk management techniques are applied within the ambit of small enterprises. The data were collected from eighty eight companies drawn from a possible of 150 small enterprises found in the Cape Metropole. The analysis of data of those who responded has shown that very few SMME owners, managers, entrepreneurs or key designated employees make use of risk management tools and techniques within their businesses, to achieve growth and sustainability. However, the majority agreed to the high importance of risk management in the success of a business enterprise...|$|R

[...] The import of this decision is that it was made {{in the context of a}} purely economic regulation. [...] The plurality examines the statute and its resultant harm as an ad hoc factual inquiry based on factors delineated in Penn Central such as the economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action.(Penn Central Transportation Co. v.

2500|$|Statements of {{equitable}} principle stretch {{back to the}} Ancient Greeks in {{the work}} of Aristotle, while examples of rules analogous to trusts were found in the Roman law testamentary institution of the fideicommissum, and the Islamic proprietary institution of the Waqf. [...] However, English trusts law is a largely indigenous development that began in the Middle Ages, {{from the time of the}} 11th and 12th century crusades. After William the Conqueror became King in 1066, one [...] "common law" [...] of England was created. Common law courts regarded property as an indivisible entity, as it had been under Roman law and continental versions of civil law. During the crusades, landowners who went to fight would transfer title to their land to a person they trusted so that feudal services could be performed and received. But many who returned found that the people they entrusted refused to transfer their title deed back. Sometimes, common law courts would not acknowledge that anybody had rights in the property except the holder of the legal title deeds. So claimants petitioned the King to sidestep the common law courts. The King delegated hearing of petitions to his Lord Chancellor, who established the Court of Chancery as more cases were heard. Where it appeared [...] "inequitable" [...] (i.e. unfair) to let someone with legal title hold onto land, the Lord Chancellor could declare that the real owner [...] "in equity" [...] (i.e. <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>fairness)</b> was another person, if this is what good conscience dictated. The Court of Chancery determined that the true [...] "use" [...] or [...] "benefit" [...] of property did not belong to the person on the title (or the feoffee who held seisin). The cestui que use, the owner in equity, could be a different person. So English law recognised a split between legal and equitable owner, between someone who controlled title and another for whose benefit the land would be used. It was the beginning of trust law. The same logic was useful for Franciscan friars, who would transfer title of land to others as they were precluded from holding property by their vows of poverty. When the courts said that one person's legal title to property was subject to an obligation to use that property for another person, there was a trust.|$|E
