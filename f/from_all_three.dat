5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification {{and the fact that}} it is present in organisms <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E
