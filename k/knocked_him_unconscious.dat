500|$|Parliament and {{business}} {{came to a}} standstill in Melbourne for the January 1858 intercolonial match between Victoria and New South Wales, held at the MCG. Captaining Victoria, Wills took 8 wickets, the most of his side, and on the second day, batting in the middle order, a ball hit an imperfection in the pitch and <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> He recovered, played on for two hours, and won the match at day's end with a top score of 49*. The crowd rushed the field and chaired Wills off in triumph, and victory celebrations lasted for several days throughout the colony. Now a household name and the darling of Melbourne's elite, Wills was proclaimed [...] "the greatest cricketer in the land".|$|E
500|$|They tied up Till in {{the back}} of a green pickup truck and drove toward Money, Mississippi. According to some witnesses, they took Till back to Bryant's Groceries to drop off Carolyn Bryant and recruit two black men. The men then drove to a barn in Drew. They pistol-whipped him on the way and {{reportedly}} <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Willie Reed, who was 18 years old at the time, saw the truck passing by and identified five people on the truck with Till. Reed recalled seeing J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant in the front seat, while Henry Lee Loggins and Leroy [...] "Too Tight" [...] Collins were {{in the back}} with Till. Both Loggins and Collins worked for Milam and were allegedly forced to help with the beating.|$|E
500|$|McCain's plane {{went into}} a {{vertical}} inverted spin. McCain bailed out upside down at high speed; {{the force of the}} ejection fractured his right arm in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into Trúc Bạch Lake in Hanoi; the weight of his equipment was pulling him down, and as he regained consciousness, he could not use his arms. Eventually, he was able to inflate his life vest using his teeth. Several Vietnamese, possibly led by Department of Industry clerk Mai Van On, pulled him ashore. [...] A mob gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes; his left shoulder was crushed with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his left foot and abdominal area. He was then transported to Hanoi's main Hỏa Lò Prison, nicknamed the [...] "Hanoi Hilton" [...] by American POWs.|$|E

500|$|From October 1938, Hutton toured South Africa {{with the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—the name by which England teams toured at the time—under the {{captaincy}} of Hammond; England won the series 1–0, {{with the other}} four games drawn. He scored centuries in two early matches but in a match against Transvaal, a delivery from Eric Davies <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious</b> and forced him to miss the first Test. Unsuccessful on his return in the second Test, Hutton scored a double century in the following tour match, but had another low score in the third Test, which England won. He was more successful in the final Tests. In the fourth, on a difficult pitch for batting, he scored 92. The final Test was drawn after ten days of play in a supposedly [...] "timeless" [...] Test. In a match which set a record aggregate of runs, Hutton scored 38 and 55 but his contributions were overshadowed by the heavy scoring of others. Although Hutton scored 265 runs in the Test series, {{at an average of}} 44.16, critics were disappointed, expecting more after his record innings of 1938. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs at an average of 64.88, the highest aggregate among the tourists, and accumulated five centuries. Spectators found his batting attractive and the Wisden correspondent regarded him the most accomplished batsman on the tour.|$|E
2500|$|... started {{well with}} a fourth place in Brazil and a third place at Aida, which earned him his first podium position. These results put Barrichello in {{second place in the}} drivers' ranking at that moment, behind Michael Schumacher, who had won the two races. However, at the , Barrichello's career nearly ended when he {{suffered}} a violent crash during Friday practice. His car hit the wall in Variante Bassa, turning him upside down. This accident <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious</b> and threatened his life, with his tongue blocking his airway. [...] Barrichello credits the on-track work of Sid Watkins for saving his life.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most serious}} {{incident}} occurred on December 27, 1853, when a train of railroad officials and workers was stopped outside of Harborcreek by {{a crowd of}} people ripping up the tracks. An official shot at one the men in the crowd and <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> The crowd, who believed the man to be dead, chased the official back on to his train. After two or three members of the crowd forced their way on to the train, the train reversed and [...] "headed at full speed for the state line". Once across the border, the train stopped, and stowaways from Harborcreek were sent back over border into Pennsylvania.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{the band}} {{supported}} The Academy Is... on the band's worldwide tour [...] "Ambitious Ones and Smoking Guns" [...] from January to May. Beginning in June, the group headlined its first unnamed national tour, {{that would last}} until August. During the group's performance at the 2006 Reading Festival in August, the band was greeted by excessive bottling, one of which hit Urie in the face that <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Despite this, the band continued with its set after Urie recovered. The band's second headlining tour, dubbed the Nothing Rhymes with Circus Tour, began in November. In roughly one year, Panic! at the Disco went from being the opening act on a five-band bill to the headliners on a massive arena tour.|$|E
2500|$|Savage, Kehoe and Breen were {{interrupted}} by a RIC officer as they pushed a hay-cart halfway across the road blocking the path of French's car. He was dragged off the road after one of them lobbed a grenade at him, which did not go off but <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> When the convoy appeared minutes later, the IRA concentrated their attack on the second car {{on the basis of}} incorrect intelligence: French was actually in the first car. In the ensuing crossfire Breen was shot in the leg, and Savage was killed by a bullet in the neck. French's own bodyguard was wounded, and he was saved in part by the quick thinking of his driver. [...] A grenade, which would almost certainly have killed him, exploded {{in the back seat of}} the second car.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike many umpires, Evans {{never made}} claims to infallibility. [...] "I missed {{a lot of}} {{decision}}s", he once said. [...] "At the time of making such a decision {{there was no doubt}} in my mind as to its correctness. However, a second or two later I felt that I erred and wished I could change my original ruling". Evans' humility and impartiality did not always protect him from abusive fans. As sports writers Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, [...] "roughness on the field seemed to elicit the same in the stands". On September 15, 1907, in the midst of a doubleheader between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> The New York Times described the incident as [...] "one of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed on a ball field".|$|E
50|$|On July 10, 1911, Magee struck umpire Bill Finneran, <b>knocking</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Magee was {{suspended}} {{for the remainder of}} the season, but on appeal the suspension was shortened to just over a month.|$|R

2500|$|Captain Karl Friesenhahn was the {{technical}} or bridge commander and {{in charge of}} the demolition charges. He had earlier requested [...] of military explosives, but at 11:00 am on 7 March he received only half the amount requested, [...] Worse, he found he been sent [...] "Donarit", a much weaker ammonium nitrate-based industrial explosive used in mining. With no other option, he placed all [...] on the eastern pier of the bridge. At 2:00 pm, as the first elements of the U.S. forces came close to the western approach, he detonated a charge under the stone archway that connected the approach embankment with the bridge, blowing a [...] crater in the road bed, hoping it would slow down tanks and infantry. Scheller and Bratge entered the railroad tunnel where the electric switch controlling the detonators was located. Friesenhahn followed them, but before he could get to the tunnel, the concussion from an exploding shell <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> He regained his senses 15 minutes later and continued towards the tunnel. Bratge yelled at Friesenhahn to blow up the bridge. Friesenhahn replied they had to get the order in writing from Scheller, who was {{at the other end of}} the [...] tunnel that curved at almost 90° under Erpeler Ley. Bratge ran to find Scheller, got the order in writing, and when he returned to tell Friesenhahn to detonate the charges, Friesenhahn in turn required Bratge to give him the order in writing.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{win over}} Branko Cikatić, Andy Hug proved {{himself to be}} {{competent}} kickboxer and was entered into his first K-1 World Grand Prix, fighting at the K-1 Grand Prix '94 on April 30, 1994 where he faced Patrick Smith in the quarter-finals. Hug lost the match. He struggled with Smith's aggression and punch-heavy style, suffering three knockdowns in nineteen seconds and losing by technical knockout. Hug had problems with his gumshield as his molars didn't clamp down on it properly and he was instead pinching it with his incisors. In time, however, the K-1 doctors discovered the dental problems and fitted him with a mouthpiece that would provide standard protection. The rematch between Andy Hug and Pat Smith took place at K-1 Revenge on September 18, 1994 and the American again opened with an axe kick just as he done in the first fight. This time, however, Hug countered with the [...] "Hug Tornado", sweeping Smith to the canvas. As the fight went on, Hug weathered Smith's aggressive start and completed his revenge when he <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious</b> with a knee at the 0:56 mark of round one. In a kickboxing match at the 1994 Seidokaikan Karate World Cup on October 2, 1994, he scored a third round liver kick knockout of Duke Roufus before closing out the year by winning the UKF World Super Heavyweight Championship with a spectacular fourth-round KO win against Rob van Esdonk at K-1 Legend on December 10, 1994.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood in}} the corner of the {{corridor}} for several minutes, trying to pull himself together, mentally and physically.

60|$|The fellow {{rose with}} a {{promptness}} which partly disarmed Grant's suspicions, {{and put his}} foot {{on the edge of the}} vehicle, ready to jump down. Then he turned swiftly and flung himself upon the farmer, crushing his soft felt hat down to his chin. Grant could see nothing, and while he strove to get a grip on his antagonist he was thrown violently backward off the driving seat. The wagon was of the usual high pattern, and he came down on the ground with a crash that nearly <b>knocked</b> <b>him</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Before he got up, he was seized firmly and held with his shoulders pressed against the soil. He struggled, however, until somebody grasped his legs and his arms were drawn forcibly apart. It was impossible to see, because the thick hat was still over his face and somebody held it fast, but he had an idea that three or four men had fallen upon him. They had, no doubt, been hidden among the brush; the affair had been carefully arranged with his treacherous companion.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Hollmann {{was playing}} for Bundesliga side Eintracht Braunschweig against 1. FC Kaiserslautern.
