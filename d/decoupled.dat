The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of animals in entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Decoupling</b> {{capacitors}} {{are widely}} used to reduce power supply noise. On-chip <b>decoupling</b> capacitors have traditionally been allocated into the white space available on the die based on an unsystematic or ad hoc approach. In this way, large <b>decoupling</b> capacitors are often placed at a significant distance from the current load, compromising the signal integrity of the system. This issue of power delivery cannot be alleviated by simply increasing {{the size of the}} on-chip <b>decoupling</b> capacitors. To be effective, the on-chip <b>decoupling</b> capacitors should be placed physically close to the current loads. The area occupied by the onchip <b>decoupling</b> capacitor, however, is directly proportional to the magnitude of the capacitor. The minimum impedance between the on-chip <b>decoupling</b> capacitor and the current load is therefore fundamentally affected by the magnitude of the capacitor. A distributed on-chip <b>decoupling</b> capacitor network is proposed in this paper. A system of distributed on-chip <b>decoupling</b> capacitors is shown to provide an efficient solution for providing the required on-chip <b>decoupling</b> capacitance under existing technology constraints. In a system of distributed onchip <b>decoupling</b> capacitors, each capacitor is sized based on the parasitic impedance of the power distribution grid. Various tradeoffs in a system of distributed on-chip <b>decoupling</b> capacitors are also discussed. Related simulation results for typical values of on-chip parasitic resistance are also presented. An analytic solution is shown to provide accurate distributed system. The worst case error is 0. 003 % as compared to SPICE. Techniques presented in this paper are applicable not only for current technologies, but also provide an efficient placement of the onchip <b>decoupling</b> capacitors in future technology generations.
