It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying in brightness. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> up to 100,000 measurements per second with a photometric accuracy of about 2% or better.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.|$|E
5|$|The canal had a lock at Thorne {{and another}} where it joined the River Trent at Keadby. This lock had {{four sets of}} gates, {{so that it could}} be used whether the level of the river was higher or lower than that of the canal. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> keels up to , which could carry up to 200 tons.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{official}} outcome from these hearings, but Congress subsequently passed a Consular Reform Bill {{which included a}} provision that specifically would not allow a diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position. Rather than remove Magoon {{from one of his}} positions, he was named to become vice governor-general of the Philippines. Ultimately, this offer was rescinded before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> effect, and he was instead appointed governor of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Japanese {{government}} refused surrender demands as specifically {{outlined in}} the Potsdam Declaration. With the invasion of mainland Japan imminent, Truman approved the schedule for dropping the two available bombs. Truman always said that attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; military estimates for the invasion of mainland Japan were that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> a year and result in 250,000 to 500,000 American casualties. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving 105,000 dead. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9 and invaded Manchuria. Japan agreed to surrender the following day.|$|E
5|$|The ENIAC (1946) was {{the first}} machine that was both {{electronic}} and general purpose. It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and programmable to solve {{a wide range of}} problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patchcords, not in memory, and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> several days to reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated the idea of using the computer's memory to hold the program as well as the data it was working on, and it was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.|$|E

5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed {{in proportion to the}} number of local citizens who had died in the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; {{at the other end of}} the scale, more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} initially {{opposed the}} Swedish reforms, {{as can be}} ascertained from church records and court transcripts. The Swedes did encounter civil revolts in many areas, including the Göinge district, in dense forest regions of northern Scania. The Swedish authorities resorted to extreme measures against the 17th-century rebels who were described as snapphanar, a term used for raiding enemy soldiers or bandits.. The punishments included the use of impalement breaking on the wheel, {{as well as the}} nailing of bodies to church doors. In that way, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> four to five days before the victim died.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, China {{temporarily}} blocked all {{exports of}} rare earths to Japan {{in the midst}} of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. These minerals are used in hybrid cars and other products such wind turbines and guided missiles, thereby augmenting the worries about the dependence on Chinese rare-earth elements and the need for geographic diversity of supply. A December 2010 report published by the US DoE found that the American economy vulnerable to rare-earth shortages and estimates that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> 15 years to overcome dependence on Chinese supplies. China raised export taxes for some rare earths from 15 to 25%, and also extended taxes to exports of some rare-earth alloys that were not taxed before. The Chinese government also announced further reductions on its export quotas for the first months of 2011, which represent a 35% reduction in tonnage as compared to exports during the first half of 2010.|$|E

5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel. As a result, {{more than half of}} the {{electricity}} customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} the HBC {{had over}} the Americans was that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> such losses. As a vast corporation with {{a large amount of}} capital, the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into their hands and not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable—the HBC had captured the trade. But Americans still traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. As long as this continued, the HBC continued to have to pay high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American-Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions of the Alaska Panhandle. This proved to be the final blow for the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether.|$|E
