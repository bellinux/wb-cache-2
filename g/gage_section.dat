50|$|Very recently, {{advances}} in pattern application and deposition at reduced length scales have exploited small-scale synthesis methods including nano-scale chemical surface restructuring and photolithography of computer-generated random specular patterns to produce suitable surface contrast for DIC. The application of very fine powder particles that electrostatically {{adhere to the}} surface of the specimen and can be digitally tracked is one approach. For Al thin films, fine alumina abrasive polishing powder was initially used since the particle sizes are relatively well controlled, although the adhesion to Al films was not very good and the particles tended to agglomerate excessively. The candidate that worked most effectively was a silica powder designed for a high temperature adhesive compound (Aremco, inc.), which was applied through a plastic syringe. A light blanket of powder would coat the <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> of the tensile sample and the larger particles could be blown away gently. The remaining particles would be those with the best adhesion to the surface. While the resulting surface contrast is not ideal for DIC, the high intensity ratio between the particles and the background provide a unique opportunity to track the particles between consecutive digital images taken during deformation. This can be achieved quite straightforwardly using digital image processing techniques. Subpixel tracking can be achieved by a number of correlation techniques, or by fitting to the known intensity profiles of particles. Photolithography and Electron Beam Lithography can be used to create micro tooling for micro speckle stamps, and the stamps can print speckle patterns on{{to the surface of}} the specimen. Stamp inks can be chosen which are appropriate for optical DIC, SEM-DIC, and simultaneous SEM-DIC/EBSD studies (the ink can be transparent to EBSD).|$|E

40|$|After {{the flood}} of December 1964, 12 <b>gaging</b> <b>sections</b> in {{northern}} California widened as much as 100 % and aggraded as much as 4 m, and then degraded to stable levels {{during a period of}} 5 years or more. As channels aggraded, bed material became finer, and low to moderate flow through <b>gaging</b> <b>sections</b> in pools became shallower, faster, and steeper. Comparisons of longitudinal profiles also show the diminishment of pools as well as a decrease in bar relief accompanying the excessive sediment load. As <b>gaging</b> <b>sections</b> degraded, hydraulic geometries recovered to a limited degree; full recovery probably depends on channel narrowing and further depletion of sediment supply. The hydraulic changes with aggradation indicate an increase in the effectiveness of moderate discharges (less than 1 - to 2 -year recurrence interval, annual flood series) to transport bed load and shape the bed. Bars become smaller, pools preferentially fill, and riffles armored with relatively small gravel tend to erode headward during falling stages and form a gentler gradient. Excess sediment can thus be more readily transported out of channels when additional contributions from watersheds are usuall slight. A stream channel at grade provides the impetus to transport the supplied sediment load while maintaining a stable bed elevation [Mackin, 1948, p. 471]. Stream channels tha...|$|R

A detailed numerical analysis of this specimen is presented to assess its range of applications and limitations. The dominant deformation mode of the <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> of the SCS is found to be shear. The stress and strain state in the <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> is necessarily three-dimensional, in contrast with commonly assumed situations of simple shear. Yet, considerable simplification is gained through the introduction of simple approximations for the Mises equivalent stress and plastic strain. These fields are found to be uniformly distributed over the <b>gage</b> <b>section.</b> The SCS framework is applied to the characterization of the large strain behavior of OFHC copper over a range of strain rates ε_ε = 10 ^(- 3) to 3. 2 × 10 ^ 4 s^(− 1). The strain rate sensitivity of the material is noted, in accord with previous observations. The mechanical tests are complemented by microstructural characterization of the material which corroborate the numerical predictions of uniformity of the equivalent strain. The grains in the <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> are discernable for true strains less than 2. At larger strains, of the order of 3. 5, the individual grains are no longer discernable and small equiaxed grains are observed, using scanning electron microscopy.

Grain boundary composition was measured using a Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM) and an Analytical Transmission Electron Microscope (ATEM), while conventional TEM was used for microstructural evaluation. Non-equilibrium segregation of Si to grain boundaries following deformation was measured by both techniques. Significant interfacial Si enrichment was only detected in <b>gage</b> <b>sections</b> of tensile specimens after uniaxial strains from 50 to 200 %. Grip regions which experience identical thermal histories, but without plastic deformation, did not reveal Si segregation. Selected samples also showed a slight depletion of Mg at grain boundaries after deformation.

Microstructural analysis documented subgrain formation and subgrain-precipitate interactions during superplastic deformation.

40|$|Abstract. Degradation of tensile {{properties}} resulting from geometrical discontinuities due to localized pitting is usually evaluated {{in terms of}} the reduced section thickness associated with pit geometry which lowers the load carrying capacity of the structure. However, the effects of finer parameters associated with pit distributions such as pit area percent (PAP) are not usually taken into account. In this research, the effects of spacing, depth and PAP on {{tensile properties}} of a structural steel are investigated. Simulated pit distributions were produced on the <b>gage</b> <b>sections</b> of flat tensile specimens using mechanical drilling. It is found that final elongation is more adversely affected than tensile strength with increasing PAP, pith depth and pith spacing. However, the reduction in final elongation tends to be largely recovered at higher PAP values due to increasing uniformity of strain distribution. It is noted that increasing pit spacing at a constant PAP leads to greater reductions in tensile properties, especially at higher pit depths, due to the increased stress concentration and strain localization. It is further clarifies that the introduction of first few pits and their growth to larger depths could be very detrimental to the mechanical properties of structural alloys...|$|R

The process was run at constant tool rotation and traverse speeds of 800 rpm and 76. 2 mm min- 1, respectively. The microstructure of the processed region was examined by optical microscopy and orientation imaging microscopy. FSP of the AA 5083 reduced the average grain size from approximately 60 um in the base metal to 3 - 4 um in the processed zone.

40|$|Bi-axial {{testing of}} {{composite}} structures {{has been an}} important topic in the research community for some years now. Bi-axial test specimens in the past have typically been cruciform specimens with a tapered thickness <b>gage</b> <b>section.</b> This ensures that the specimen will fail under bi-axial loading rather than uni-axial loading due to high stress concentrations at the intersecting loading arms. To reduce the stress concentration in the loading arms the intersection points are rounded and curved inward {{toward the center of the}} specimen. By having the curvature of the intersecting arms come closer into the specimen it reduces the amount of uni-axial stress at that point. In order to reduce the stress even more, tapered thickness <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> milling is required to achieve adequate bi-axial failure. In the proposed research these specimens will be modified so that no milling of the <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> is required. The process of milling the <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> of the composite laminate could inflict initial damage to the specimen which would yield inaccurate results. The modified bi-axial specimen will instead have aluminum shims bonded to the rounded corner to ensure bi-axial failure. The location of the shims was determined using Finite Element Analyses which verified the location and magnitude of the stress concentrations. The use of the aluminum shims could allow the cruciform specimen to be completely unscathed of any initial damage. The specimens are thick woven carbon fiber/epoxy bi-axial specimens which previously haven’t been tested before. Two types of geometries were fabricated, one out of IM 7 /UF 3352 and one out of IM 7 /PATZ materials, both with a [(0 / 90) ]s lay-up. The first geometry had the aluminum shims. The second configuration consisted of a smaller composite laminate sandwiched in between two pre-fabricated G 10 glass/epoxy panels and only machining away the G 10 material, keeping the composite laminate unscathed. Both geometries had tapered thickness <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> counterparts for comparison purposes. The shimmed design showed undesirable failure modes but provided a reliable lower bound for bi-axial strength design. The sandwich panel design showed ideal failure conditions for all tests. This shows that a modified bi-axial composite specimen can be developed that limits the amount of machining and can still produce accurate results. Additional tests were conducted to study the effect of stress concentrations around holes of different diameter under biaxial load. Results were interpreted with the aid of Finite Element Analyses.

The mechanical properties of the matrix at this length scale are not well understood. In this study, processing methods {{have been developed to}} produce high quality epoxy micro-fibers with diameters ranging from 100 to 150 [*]µm that are used for tensile testing. Five types of epoxy resin systems ranging from standard DGEBA to high-crosslink TGDDM and TGMAP epoxy systems have been characterized. Epoxy macroscopic specimens with film thickness of 3300 [*]µm exhibited brittle behavior (1. 7 to 4. 9 % average failure strain) with DGEBA resin having the highest failure strain level. The epoxy micro-fiber specimens exhibited significant ductile behavior (20 to 42 % average failure strain) with a distinct yield point being observed in all five resin systems. In addition, the ultimate stress of the highly cross-linked TGDDM epoxy fiber exceeded the bulk film properties by a factor of two and the energy absorption was over 50 times greater on average. The mechanism explaining the dramatic difference in properties is discussed and is based on size effects (the film volume is about 2000 times greater than the fiber volume within the <b>gage</b> <b>sections)</b> and surface defects.

The quality of water along the Trail is spatially variable due to natural and human influences. Concentrations of dissolved solids and common ions such as chloride and sulfate were lowest in the central and eastern Big Cypress Swamp and were higher to the west due {{to the effects of}} seawater, especially during the dry season, and to the east due to canal drainage from the northern Everglades. Concentrations of total phosphorus tended to decrease from west to east along the 80 -mile section of the Trail, and were usually about 0. 01 milligram per liter or less in the Everglades. Short-term loads (based on average discharge for 4 days) of total phosphorus and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (ammonia plus organic nitrogen) across four <b>gaged</b> <b>sections</b> of the Tamiami Trail were highest in the Everglades near the S- 12 structures primarily due to the relatively greater discharges in that section.

Copper have been exploited mechanically and constitutively for applications {{that range from}} munitions for firearms, building material found in roofing and plumbing, electrical wire/interconnects in electrification and integrated circuits, germicide protection, cookware, and many other widely varying products. In munitions, copper is widely used as a bullet jacketing material protecting the steel core and lead slug during rifling, flight to the target, and delivery at target. In this study, an approach is developed to investigate and link the mechanical and microstructural evolution of the cold drawing of a copper jacket. Copper jackets are fabricated in a multi-step drawing process where an as-received copper plate {{is transformed into a}} 'cup', and then a pre-swaged jacket for the bullet.

40|$|The {{high-level}} {{goal of this}} multi-year {{effort was}} to facilitate the Advanced Combustion Engine goal of 20 % improvement (compared to 2009 baseline) of commercial engine efficiency by 2015. A sub-goal {{is to increase the}} reliability of diesel fuel injectors by investigating modelbased scenarios that cannot be achieved by empirical, trial and error methodologies alone. During this three-year project, ORNL developed the methodology to evaluate origins and to record the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks emanating from holes that were electrodischarge machined (EDM), the method used to form spray holes in fuel injector tips. Both x-ray and neutron-based methods for measuring residual stress at four different research facilities were evaluated to determine which, if any, was most applicable to the fuel injector tip geometry. Owing to the shape and small volumes of material involved in the sack area, residual stress data could only be obtained in the walls of the nozzle a few millimeters back from the tip, and there was a hint of only a small compressive stress. This result was consistent with prior studies by Caterpillar. Residual stress studies were suspended after the second year, reserving the possibility of pursuing this in the future, if and when methodology suitable for injector sacks becomes available. The smooth specimen fatigue behavior of current fuel injector steel materials was evaluated and displayed a dual mode initiation behavior. At high stresses, cracks started at machining flaws in the surface; however, below a critical threshold stress of approximately 800 MPa, cracks initiated in the bulk microstructure, below the surface. This suggests that for the next generation for high-pressure fuel injector nozzles, it becomes increasingly important to control the machining and finishing processes, especially if the stress in the tip approaches or exceeds that threshold level. Fatigue tests were also conducted using EDM notches in the <b>gage</b> <b>sections.</b> Compared to the smooth specimens, EDM notching led to a severe reduction in total fatigue life. A reduction in fatigue life of nearly four orders of magnitude can occur at an EDM notch the approximate size of fuel injector spray holes. Consequently, the initiation and propagation behavior of cracks from small spray holes is relevant for generation of design quality data for the next generation diesel fuel injection devices. This is especially true since the current design methodologies usually rely on the less conservative smooth specimen fatigue testing results, and since different materials can have varying levels of notch fatigue resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of pin-ended reinforced concrete columns subjected to biaxially eccentric loads isinvestigated experimentally and theoretically. Seven short column specimens, whose column lengthto section depth ratio were 5, with 12 x 12 cm square cross sections containing eight reinforcing barswere loaded monotonically at various eccentricities. It is observed that, from data of longitudinalstrain <b>gages,</b> the plane <b>sections</b> ramain plane after biaxial bending and the maximum compressivestrain at crushing of concrete reaches 0. 005. Computed results of load-deformation response of acolumn, {{based on the}} analytical method presented by the authors in earlier paper, are found to agreewell with the test results. Two analytical methods, proposed by Bresler and Ramamurthy, forcalculating the ultimate loads of biaxially loaded columns are also examined...|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{of large}} forces up to 10 MN with high {{accuracy}} {{is a complex}} subject, blending theory, practice and applications, with a special accent {{in the field of}} Metrology. It is simply to generate complex shapes of mono-block elastic structures starting from simple shapes of strain <b>gage</b> measuring <b>sections,</b> the axisymmetrical ones being the best suited in this respect. The body of the force transducer is easy to design by 2 D axisymmetric FEM and easy to manufacture. The paper have in view a unified approach of square (type A) and rectangle (type B). Square section is among the few with an analytical but complicated formula, having two strain gauges tangentially located {{on the outside of the}} ring torsion and the other two strain gauges, which complete the Wheatstone bridge, being diametrically opposed. The rectangular section (with different ratios between the two sides but without analytical formula), is obtained by a minimum modification of the previous one (making two slots), the strain gauges being circumferentially located on the upper and the lower faces. We formulate a standard FEA procedure for axisymmetrical elastic elements of strain gauged force transducers using ANSYS Mechanical program. The starting model is very “flexible”, so that, changing one by one different parameters (e. g. modifying the keypoints coordinates), a lot of variants could be studied. A special attention is necessary to obtai...|$|R
40|$|A new {{specimen}} geometry, the shear-compression specimen (SCS), {{has been}} developed for large strain testing of materials. The specimen consists of a cylinder in which two diametrically opposed slots are machined at 45 ° {{with respect to the}} longitudinal axis, thus forming the test <b>gage</b> <b>section.</b> The specimen was analyzed numerically for two representative material models, and various gage geometries. This study shows that the stress (strain) state in the gage, is three-dimensional rather than simple shear as would be commonly assumed. Yet, the dominant deformation mode in the <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> is shear, and the stresses and strains are rather uniform. Simple relations were developed and assessed to relate the equivalent true stress and equivalent true plastic strain to the applied loads and displacements. The specimen was further validated through experiments carried out on OFHC copper, by comparing results obtained with the SCS to those obtained with compression cylinders. The SCS allows to investigate a large range of strain rates, from the quasi-static regime, through intermediate strain rates (1 – 100 s^(− 1)), up to very high strain rates (2 × 10 ^ 4 s^(− 1) in the present case) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} analytical {{study was}} conducted to investigate the effects of cruciform test specimen geometries on strain distribution uniformity in the central <b>gage</b> <b>section</b> under biaxial loads. Three distinct specimen geometries were considered while varying the applied displacements in the two orthogonal directions. Two sets of woven fabric material properties found in literature were used to quantify the influence of specimen geometries on the resulting strain distributions. The uniformity of the strain distribution is quantified by taking the ratio between the two orthogonal strain components and characterizing its gradient across the central area of the <b>gage</b> <b>section.</b> The analysis results show that increasing the specimen s length relative to its width promotes a more uniform strain distribution in the central section of the cruciform test specimen under equibiaxial enforced tensile displacements. However, for the two sets of material properties used in this study, this trend did not necessary hold, when the enforced tensile displacements in the two orthogonal directions were not equal. Therefore, based on the current study, a tail length that is 1. 5 times that of the tail width is recommended to be the baseline/initial specimen design...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A Geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) {{system was}} used to support both the {{abutment}} shallow footings of the Founders/Meadows two-span bridge and the approaching roadway structures. This unique system {{has the potential to}} alleviate the “bump bridge ” problem, and allowed for a small work area and construction in stages. This paper provides an assessment of the Founders/Meadows performance and behavior under service loads from displacement data collected through surveying, inclinometer, road profiler, and strain <b>gages.</b> Three <b>sections</b> of the GRS system were instrumented to measure movements of the front GRS wall, settlement of the bridge footing, and differential settlements between the bridge abutment and the approaching roadway. Data was collected during construction of the GRS walls, placement of the bridge superstructure and during 18 months after opening the bridge to traffic. The structure showed excellent performance: monitored overall displacements were smaller than those expected in the design and allowed by performance requirements, there were no signs for development of the bridge bump problem or of any structural damage, and postconstruction movements became negligible a 1 year after opening the bridge to traffic. The influence of compaction, construction season and construction sequence on the structure movements are discussed in this paper. Finally, design implications of the measured results and basis for estimating the movements of structures similar to the Founders/Meadows structure are presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to study the effect of {{shot-peening}} on the fatigue behaviour of carbon steels. Differently heat treated medium and high carbon steel specimens were selected. Medium carbon steels, AISI 1141 and AISI 1151, were respectively air cooled and quenched-tempered. A high carbon steel, C 70 S 6 (AISI 1070), was air cooled. The other material was a powder metal (0. 5 % C) steel. Each group of steels was divided into two. One was shot-peened. The other half remained in their original conditions. All were fatigue tested under fully reversed (R=- 1) tension-compression loading conditions. Microhardness tests were carried out on both the grip and <b>gage</b> <b>sections</b> of selected non shot-peened and shot-peened specimens to determine the hardness profile and effect of cycling. Shot-peening {{was found to be}} deeper on one side of each specimen. Compressive residual stress profiles and surface roughness measurements were provided. Shot-peening increased the surface roughness from 0. 26 ± 0. 03 µm to 3. 60 ± 0. 44 µm. Compressive residual stresses induced by shot-peening reached a maximum of - 463. 9 MPa at a depth of 0. 1 mm. The fatigue limit (N≈ 106 cycles) and microhardness profiles of the non shot-peened and shot-peened specimens were compared to determine the material behaviour changes after shot-peening and cycling. Also their fatigue properties were related to the manufacturing process including heat and surface treatments. Comparing the grip and gage microhardness profiles of each steel showed that neither cyclic softening nor hardening occurred in the non shot-peened condition. Cyclic softening was apparent in the shot-peened regions of all steels except powder metal (PM) steel. The amount of softening in the shot-peened region was 55. 0 % on the left side and 73. 0 % on the right in the AISI 1141 steel, 46. 0 % on the left side and 55. 0 % on the right in the C 70 S 6 AC steel and 31. 0 % on the right side in AISI 1151 QT steel. Softening was accompanied by a decrease in the depth of surface hardness. It is suggested that although the beneficial effects of shot peening, compressive residual stresses and work hardening, were offset by surface roughness, crack initiation was more likely to occur below the surface. Surface roughness was not a significant factor in controlling the fatigue lives of AISI 1141 AC and C 70 S 6 steels, since they were essentially the same for the non shot-peened and shot-peened conditions. Shot-peening had very little effect on the push-pull fatigue limit of C 70 S 6 steel (- 2. 1 %), and its effect on AISI 1141 AC steel was relatively small (6. 0 %). However, the influence of shot-peening on the AISI 1151 QT and PM steels was more apparent. The fatigue limit of the PM steel increased 14. 0 % whereas the fatigue limit of the AISI 1151 QT steel decreased 11. 0 % on shot peening...|$|R

A static tension test, performed on a specimen with a variable cross [...] <b>section</b> <b>gage</b> part enabled analysis of {{degradation of the}} material structure for all stages of permanent deformation. Modified Johnson model {{has been used to}} quantify damage. Analysis of the damage of the specimen surface as well as observations of the damage induced inside the gage part of the specimen has been performed using SEM observations. Debonding at the interface between a hard inclusion and a ductile matrix {{has been found to be}} responsible for initiation of cracks on the specimen surface as well as inside the gage part of the specimen. Analysis of the subsequent void growth has been performed. Surface cracks are associated with plastic deformation resulting in an increase of the surface roughness. Variations of the specimen surface roughness have been found to be in good correlation with the damage parameter. This correlation enables the use of surface roughness as the relative damage indicator for the investigated material and deformation mode...|$|R
