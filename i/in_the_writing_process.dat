Rather, they simply peer through the sliding glass door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E

The research was carried out at the first semester from September 20 th to October 13 rd, 2010. It involved the English teacher and the students of Grade X B. The steps were reconnaissance, planning and observations, and reflections. The research was conducted <b>in</b> two cycles. <b>The</b> problems of this research were <b>the</b> Students’ passiveness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process,</b> <b>the</b> teacher does not pay much attention to the students, the students’ lack of vocabulary, the students’ tendency to copy their friends’ work to finish the task, and the materials given are uninteresting. The actions were implemented the CIRC (Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition) method and The Text-Based Approach, namely BKOF, MOT, JCOT, and ICOT. The researcher also gave interesting materials. The data were obtained by interviewing the English teacher, and the students of Grade X B, observing <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process</b> and taking pictures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teaching-learning process. The key instrument was the researcher. <b>The</b> data were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forms of interview transcripts, field notes and photographs. The implementation of the method and technique were obviously effective to improve the students’ motivation and interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> improvement covers (1) the students’ interest toward <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process,</b> (2) <b>the</b> students’ enthusiasm <b>in</b> reading, (3) <b>the</b> students’ involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process,</b> (4) <b>the</b> students’ concentration during <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process,</b> and (5) the students’ cooperation during <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process...</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>the</b> impact of one’s self-concept, {{the influences of}} mental translation and L 2 reading (termed as general facts in Table  6) on L 2 witting proficiency were also our concern. In a study by Cohen and Brooks-Carson (2001), the role of mental translation was investigated {{and it turned out}} that direct writing (in L 2) is far more effective for writers, specifically, when there is some time pressure. <b>The</b> semi-structured interview <b>in</b> <b>the</b> qualitative study also showed that both skilled and less-skilled writers maintain that translation is a barrier to L 2 writing. However, it was revealed that mental translation was unavoidable or even beneficial <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> which is <b>in</b> line with what de Larios, Murphy, and Marin (2002) found. For example, some skillful writers (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-structured interview) stated that they use their mother tongue for planning.

[...] In her dissertation, Dyson drew heavily from scholars such as Britton, Vygotsky,Ferreiro,and others who emphasized the critical role that oral language has in literacy learning. For instance, Britton was quoted by Dyson as stating: “All that <b>the</b> children <b>write,</b> your response to what they write, their response to each other, all this takes place afloat upon a sea of talk. Talk is what provides the links between you and them and what they have written, between what they have written and each other.” [...] In her dissertation,Dyson elected qualitative research to investigate the role of oral language <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> of five kindergarten students over a three-month period. During her case study she collected data, such as observational notes, audio recordings of children’s talk, written products, daily log entries, child and parent interviews, and informal assessment tasks. At the conclusion of this study, some of Dyson's findings include: that talk {{is an integral part of}} <b>the</b> early <b>writing</b> <b>process,</b> young children <b>write</b> for different purposes, and that there is no one early <b>writing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In {{high density}} digital {{magnetic}} recording systems, <b>the</b> nonlinear effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>write</b> <b>process</b> appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> readback waveform as shifts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peak positions and changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ampli-tude. The pulse shift causes a nonlinear intersymbol interference (ISI) on <b>the</b> readback signal. <b>In</b> this paper, a Volterra-DFE, in which a Volterra filter is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feedback section of decision feedback structure, is proposed to equalize the nonlinear ISI. By theoretical analysis, the minimum mean squared error (MSE) of the Volterra-DFE {{is found to be}} a function of sampling phase. This will affect the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the playback system. A baud-rate timing recovery system in conjunction with channel estimator is used to operate the sampling clock on the optimum phase.

30|$|Recently, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes {{have been}} applied in flash {{memories}} to correct errors. However, as verified in this article, their performance degrades rapidly {{as the number of}} stuck cells increases. Thus, this paper presents a concatenation reliability scheme of LDPC codes and source codes, which aims to improve the performance of LDPC codes for flash memories with stuck cells. <b>In</b> this scheme, <b>the</b> locations of stuck cells is recorded by source codes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>write</b> <b>process</b> such that erasures rather than wrong log-likelihood ratios on these cells are given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> read process. Then, LDPC codes correct these erasures and soft errors caused by cell-to-cell interferences. The analyses of channel capacity and compression rates of source codes with side information show that the memory cost of the proposed scheme is moderately low. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional scheme with only LDPC codes.|$|R
