40|$|Large, {{reconfigurable}} {{and light}} orbiting structures {{are necessary to}} accomplish a number of tasks, {{such as the ones}} related to astronomy and fundamental physics missions, where very large telescope or other sensor arrays are needed. Given the technical limits imposed to the mass at launch, a mostly studied solution {{can be found in the}} formation of many satellites controlled in such a way that they can be considered as a virtual structure. This is possible only if synchronized and very accurate control is accomplished. The present paper focuses on the alternative solution represented by the space webs, intended as a set of small corner satellites connected by tethers: along the ropes of the web small robotic systems can move like spiders to position and re-locate, at will, pieces of hardware devoted to specific missions. In this sense, this work is the natural prosecution of previous studies of the same authors, where the advantages, drawbacks and possible solutions have been analyzed. In fact, the presence of rigid links would add the advantage of a simpler control strategy to the typical benefits of formation flying. Unfortunately, there is no stable configuration for an orbiting two dimensional web made by light, flexible tethers, since it cannot support compression forces caused by the gravity gradient. However, if the net is initially rotating (at a sufficiently high velocity) in the orbital plane, the centrifugal force counteracting the gravity gradient compression leads to a stable motion. Residual shape deformations are still present: in order to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> desired <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> of <b>the</b> web, it is possible to introduce a coordinated attitude control of the corner satellites, as an example by means of reaction wheels. This paper shows some preliminary results on the dynamics of tethers which are subjected to a torque at their tip. The analysis requires to add to previous models the attitude of the corner spacecraft as well as of the section the tethers are divided in. At this step, tethers are modeled as axial springs with no compression resistance. The paper, based on a performing code specifically written, reports the results for a number of simulations in order to provide helpful insight in this unusual dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. We have {{explored}} {{the feasibility of}} designing atomic and molecular bright solitons in a hybrid atom-molecular BEC (Bose Einstein Condensate) system of 87 Rb coupled through Raman Photoassociation. It is found that the atomic and molecular waves when allowed to evolve in a spherical one-dimensional trap, initially oscillate with time and assume solitonic nature as bright solitons with progress in time. After the trap is switched off, atomic and molecular waves propagate retaining its solitonic nature and the final amplitude {{and nature of the}} bright solitons depend on the time of evolution within the trap. For this study we have used system parameters which are experimentally realizable. We have imposed random perturbation (5 %) on the initial atomic and molecular wavefunctions, which are the solution of time independent coupled equation (without decay) and studied the evolution of atomic and molecular solitons with trap on and off condition. A small regular or large irregular oscillation in the amplitude of atomic solitons during evolution of perturbed matter waves are imposed depending on the system parameters. However broad molecular solitons with slowly decaying amplitude are generated which oscillate symmetrically around the centre of the trap. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>stability</b> and <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> generated atomic and molecular bright solitons can be controlled by varying the system parameters e. g. initial number of atoms, decay rates of the excited molecule and the frequency of the trap. Since the boson-boson interaction and the atom-molecular coupling strength depend on the total number of atoms, one can control the interplay between boson-boson interaction (due to s-wave scattering) and the atom-molecular coupling (through Raman Photoassociation) by varying the total number of atoms. It is found that with <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in trap frequency generation of atomic and molecular solitons in atom-molecular coupled system is feasible if the strength of atom-molecular coupling and two-photon detuning is <b>increased.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shape</b> and <b>the</b> <b>stability</b> of the bright solitonic waves depend significantly on the strength of induced decay from the excited molecular state to the two-atom continuum or to the bound vibrational levels of the ground state.

One {{of the reasons}} for densifying wood is to produce high quality timber from timbers of low quality. However, densified wood shows an undesired behaviour, i. e. a tendency to return to its initial dimensions when it is subjected to heat and humidity, i. e. shape memory.

This study uses a three-layered cross-laminated wood panel where one of the layers is of densified wood and the other two are of normal wood together these will mechanically restrain <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> memory of <b>the</b> densified layer. The study includes three stages: * Densification of clear wood in the radial direction * Manufacture of a three-layered cross laminated composite product with densified wood as a service layer * Testing of <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> when <b>the</b> composite was subjected to variations relative humidity (40 - 85 % RH at 20 °) The result of this study reveals the significance of service to bottom layer thickness ratio on <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> of <b>the</b> cross laminated composite.

40|$|<b>Shape</b> <b>stability,</b> <b>the</b> {{ability of}} the wood to retain its shape, {{is one of the}} most {{important}} parameters when using timber as a building material and for other applications. Generally, timber undergoes changes in dimensions and shape when its moisture content is changed. However, this can often not be tolerated in constructions and thus, methods to improve <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> have to be found. In this thesis, the influence of high-temperature drying on <b>the</b> immediate <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> after drying but also on the long-term behaviour under in-service conditions was studied for Norway spruce and different larch species. Special focus was on twist, as this is the predominant distortion type leading to downgrading of Scandinavian timber species. Small-scale specimens were dried at high temperatures (120 ?C and 170 ?C) and compared to conventional drying (80 ?C). All drying schedules, independent of temperature, included pre-steaming and steaming phases at saturated conditions (98 ?C, 98 % relative humidity). The effect of restrained drying or top-loading was investigated by restraining half of the boards during the drying process. After completed drying, all specimens were moisture-cycled to investigate <b>the</b> permanency of <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> and distortion reduction attained during restrained drying. The influence of drying temperatures on <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> of spruce was also compared to commercial heat-treatment. The results showed that high-temperature drying is an alternative for Scandinavian timber species such as Norway spruce and larch. Distortions, especially twist, were successfully reduced by restrained drying and <b>the</b> obtained <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> was permanent, even in changing humidity conditions. Drying temperature did not influence <b>shape</b> <b>stability,</b> but similar results were found for <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> for drying at temperatures levels 80, 120 and 170 ?C. <b>The</b> good <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> for low-temperature drying (80 ?C) is most probably achieved by the pre-steaming and steaming phases, which constituted a short high-temperature treatment with corresponding softening and creep behaviour. Excessively twisted boards were heat-treated at 95 ?C to investigate the possibility to reduce twist. Twist could be effectively reduced by heat-treatment, however, twist increased slightly in subsequent moisture cycling. These results confirm earlier studies in that excessively twisted boards can be straightened by heat-treatment, as mechano-thermal creep helps to attain <b>the</b> desired <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> board. High-temperature drying influences both the chemical and physical properties of timber. In this study, sorption behaviour, stiffness (static and dynamic modulus of elasticity in bending), bending strength and toughness were investigated. It could be shown that stiffness is more or less unaffected by drying temperature, whereas bending stress decreases with <b>increasing</b> drying temperature. <b>The</b> toughness tests did not show a clear tendency of strength loss with <b>increasing</b> temperature. Finally, <b>the</b> effect of different drying temperatures and heat-treatment on the susceptibility for mould growth was studied. It could be stated that all kiln drying temperatures resulted in about equal mould growth levels, whereas air-drying had lower and heat-treatment substantially lower mould levels. Other factors influencing the amount of mould growth were presence of sapwood or heartwood and the type of surface ? original drying surface or re-sawn surface...|$|R

40|$|In timber {{exposed to}} {{moisture}} variations {{such as in}} wood drying, shape distortions are often a serious problem since it can make the wood products obtained unsuitable for construction purposes. Two characteristics of wood are that its behaviour is strongly orthotropic {{and that it is}} very sensitive to variation in moisture. In addition, wood is characterized by variation in its properties from pith to bark. A further important property of wood affecting its behaviour is its spiral grain. In addition, in timber containing much compression wood, drying distortion is highly dependent upon where the compression wood is located in the board. In the present thesis, a finite element method is used to simulate deformations and stresses in wood during drying. A three-dimensional theory for the numerical simulation of deformations and stresses in wood during moisture variation is described. The constitutive model employed assumes the total strain rate to be the sum of the elastic strain rate, the moisture-induced strain rate, the mechano-sorption strain rate and the creep strain rate. Wood is assumed to be an orthotropic material with large differences in properties between the longitudinal, radial and tangential directions regarding the stiffness parameters as well as the moisture shrinkage and mechano-sorption parameters. The influence of moisture content and temperature on the material parameters is likewise taken into account. In addition, the effect of inhomogeneity in the internal structure of the wood material is considered. The influence of the growth rings, the spiral grain and <b>the</b> conical <b>shape</b> of <b>the</b> log on the orthotropic directions in the wood is also taken account of in the model. Variations in the wood properties with distance from the pith are considered as well. The three-dimensional theory used for analysing <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> of sawn timber was implemented in a finite element program. To illustrate the types of results that can be obtained, the behaviour of boards during drying was simulated. These simulations yield information on unfavourable deformations and stresses that can develop during the drying process. Boards without external constraint during drying are analysed, as well as boards from different positions in the timber log, boards with deviations in the pith and boards with external constraints. The finite element model is also used to clarify how the material properties and the internal structure affect stiffness properties in sawn timber. The influence of the stiffness parameters, the spiral grain and the annual ring orientation are of particular interest. To investigate factors that influence drying deformations, a parameter study was performed in which the influence of different constitutive models and different material parameters was examined. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate how the annual ring orientation, the cross sectional size and the drying profiles affect <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> of sawn timber. The influence of radial variations in the basic properties, the spiral grain and the conical angle was analysed as well. The study involves an experimental investigation of density, grain angles, shrinkage parameters and the longitudinal elastic modulus of a number of spruce boards containing compression wood. On the basis of the data obtained, numerical simulations are carried out to determine deformations that develop in the boards during changes in moisture. <b>Shape</b> <b>stability</b> of sawn timber can often be improved by gluing pieces of wood together.

Results for spruce presented earlier have shown clearly that warping of the timber products is strongly influenced by the annual ring patterns within the individual boards. Comparisons between the two species were performed to study how the radial variations in the basic properties such as shrinkage parameters, stiffness parameters, and spiral grain have influence on the warping. Generally, the intrinsic patterns of variation in wood properties within stems were similar, and both species show a tendency to distort with changing moisture environment. There are strong indications that intelligent re-combination of material in glued products may overcome many of the inherent problems in using biological material with predictable variation in material properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{shortcoming}} of the {{laminated bending}} process {{is that the}} products may become distorted after moulding and during use. Annually, significant financial losses have incurred in the furniture and interior design industries {{as a result of}} distorted products. In this study, we have examined the influence of deviation of fibre orientation of individual veneers on distortion of a moulded shell to find ways to improve <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> of laminated veneer products. Ninety cross-laminated shells, consisting of 7 veneers of Birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) with a total thickness of 3. 6 mm, were studied. The in-plane dimensions of the veneer were 400 x 660 mm. All the veneers were straight-grained, but to simulate deviation in fibre orientation some of the individual veneers were oriented 7 degrees relative to the main orientation of the other veneers in the laminate. Distortion was determined directly after moulding and after storage in a changing relative humidity. The results show the well-known fact that deviation of fibre orientation of the veneers in the laminate influences <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>stability</b> of <b>the</b> product. The results from this study, however, also show how the placement of the abnormal veneers in the laminated veneer products influences the degree of distortions. From this basic knowledge some improvements for production of laminated veneer products were suggested. Godkänd; 2013; 20130910 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} stress on vacancy cluster {{configurations}} in silicon is examined using molecular dynamics. At zero pressure, <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> and <b>stability</b> of <b>the</b> vacancy clusters agrees with previous atomistic results. When stress is applied {{the orientation of}} small planar clusters changes to reduce the strain energy. The preferred orientation for the vacancy clusters under stress agrees with the experimentally observed orientations of hydrogen platelets in the high stress regions of hydrogen implanted silicon. These results suggest a theory for hydrogen platelet formation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> and <b>stabilities</b> of biomembranes within the {{framework}} of exterior differential forms. After a brief review of the current status in theoretical and experimental studies on <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> of biomembranes, a geometric scheme is proposed to discuss <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> equation of closed lipid bilayers, <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> equation and boundary conditions of open lipid bilayers and two-component membranes, <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> equation and in-plane stain equations of cell membranes with cross-linking structures, and the stabilities of closed lipid bilayers and cell membranes. The key point of this scheme is to deal with the variational problems on the surfaces embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space by using exterior differential forms...|$|R
