We, however, are not a judge or a jury and don't want to be one any time soon. We are however a band that really just wants to continue playing music. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> times have been severely trying for Dominic and the accuser. We hope for the best outcome for all parties. However, Dominic will no longer be playing music or working on behalf of Love Equals Death. This matter that he faces requires all of his attention right now and we wish him well as I know all of you do.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that different scholars frequently have different opinions regarding any given question. This is why there is usually more than one fatwa regarding any one question. In fact, {{there are a number of}} methodologies for how to understand evidence gathered from the previously mentioned sources of Islamic law. Scholars who follow different methodologies will frequently arrive at different answers to the same question. It is well known that in Islam there are four schools of thought, and each of them differ with respect to certain aspects. However, it is important to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> differences are usually about minor issues. For example, in terms of beliefs, the vast majority of Muslims agree on most aspects of belief, most importantly the concept of monotheism, and belief in the angels, Prophets, holy books and the Day of Judgment.|$|E
500|$|Rapunzel first {{appears in}} Tangled {{as an infant}} princess who is born to a queen. Having {{inherited}} the healing abilities of a magical flower the ailing queen ingested while pregnant, a vain old woman named Mother Gothel kidnaps the infant princess {{in order to use}} her hair to remain young and beautiful forever. Gothel raises the princess in an isolated tower, from which Rapunzel sees the release of thousands of floating lanterns; little does she <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> lanterns are actually the kingdom's way of remembering her. As her eighteenth birthday arrives, Rapunzel grows increasingly eager to leave the tower and see the floating lanterns, and blackmails a wanted thief named Flynn Rider to take her there in her mother's absence. However, Gothel soon learns of Rapunzel's disobedience and pursues them, hiring a pair of thieves to incapacitate Flynn.|$|E

500|$|If Philip {{had been}} a Christian during his {{military}} service, he would have not been a particularly unusual figure for his eraalthough membership in the army was prohibited by certain churchmen, and would have required participation in rites some Christians found sacrilegious, {{it was not uncommon}} among the Christian laity. The position of an emperor, however, was more explicitly pagan—emperors were expected to officiate over public rites and lead the religious ceremonies of the army. Christian scripture contains explicit prohibitions on this sort of behavior, such as the First Commandment: [...] "You shall have no other gods before me". Whatever the prohibitions, people raised on the [...] "more tolerant Christianity of the camp" [...] {{would have been able to}} justify participation in pagan ritual to themselves. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> people exist: the historical record includes Christian army officers, who would have been regularly guilty of idolatry, and the military martyrs of the late 3rd century. Their ritual sacrifice excluded them from certain parts of the Christian community (ecclesiastical writers tended to ignore them, for example) but these people nonetheless believed themselves to be Christian and were recognized by others as Christians.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Screams of Abel webzine, former Antestor member Morten Mageroy reacted with caution to the proliferation of unblack bands: [...] "I really hope that people (who play Christian black metal) {{know what they are}} doing. I know this sounds very rough, but I have seen people being pulled into something they do not know. I am not saying that I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> musicians are going to mess their lives up, but I have seen it happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done amazing things being led by God. I know that God is using many types of communication, and it is important that Christians is [...] present in every field, in every genre, privately and in work. God might just as well use heavy metal to bring salvation to people." ...|$|E

2500|$|In my {{own case}} {{the words of}} such an act as the Income Tax... merely dance before my eyes in a {{meaningless}} procession: cross-reference to cross-reference, exception upon exception—couched in abstract terms that offer [...] no handle to seize hold of [...] leave in my mind only a confused sense of some vitally important, but successfully concealed, purport, which it is my duty to extract, but which is within my power, if at all, only after the most inordinate expenditure of time. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> monsters {{are the result of}} fabulous industry and ingenuity, plugging up this hole and casting out that net, against all possible evasion; yet at times I cannot help recalling a saying of William James about certain passages of Hegel: that they were no doubt written with a passion of rationality; but that one cannot help wondering whether to the reader they have any significance save that the words are strung together with syntactical correctness.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{pictorial}} {{nature of the}} oracle bone script, it was a fully functional and mature writing system {{by the time of}} the Shang dynasty, i.e., able to record the Old Chinese language in its entirety and not just isolated kinds of meaning. This level of maturity clearly implies an earlier period of development of at least several hundred years. From their presumed origins as pictographs and signs, by the Shang dynasty, most graphs were already conventionalized in such a simplified fashion that the meanings of many of the pictographs are not immediately apparent. Compare, for instance, the third and fourth graphs in the row below. Without careful research to compare these to later forms, one would probably not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> represented 豕 shĭ [...] "swine" [...] and 犬 quǎn [...] "dog", respectively. As Boltz (1994 & 2003 p.31–33) notes, most of the oracle bone graphs are not depicted realistically enough for those who do not already know the script to recognize what they stand for; although pictographic in origin they are no longer pictographs in function. Boltz instead calls them zodiographs (p.33), reminding us that functionally they represent words, and only through the words do they represent concepts, while for similar reasons Qiu labels them semantographs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} in the {{learning}} to read process is the novice reading stage [...] also known as selective association. [...] This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded. To do this, the child must first figure out the Alphabetic principle and master it in only a few years. Most children know that the words on a page in a book mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning. [...] They <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> words are made of the sounds of their particular language, and that letters convey these sounds. [...] Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words. If a child is able to master this skill, called phonological awareness, {{it is one of the}} best predictors of a child's success in learning to read. One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as nursery rhymes that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words. [...] Another way to teach a child to read is through little [...] "games" [...] in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat. A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words [...] "have" [...] and [...] "who". It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words. Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day. This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.|$|E
