40|$|International audienceThe {{modification}} of raindrops by {{the canopy of}} olive trees increases the kinetic energy of the rain per unit area. The kinetic energy computed from the measured drop size distribution under the tree canopy in simulated rainfall experiments is greater than that received in the open, 17. 1 J mm - 1, as against 15. 7 J mm - 1. This causes higher soil detachment and loss than that observed outside the canopy. Tillage treatments of the soil modify its erodibility, accelerate soil detachment and reduce, simultaneously, the velocity of runoff. Both effects {{reduce the amount of}} sediment compared to that observed in the non-tilled soil. The average values of soil lost per unit of rain depth and unit area were 5. 81 <b>g</b> <b>mm</b> - 1 m - 2 (conventional tillage) and 4. 02 <b>g</b> <b>mm</b> - 1 m - 2 (zero tillage) under the canopy compared to 0. 89 <b>g</b> <b>mm</b> - 1 m - 2 (conventional tillage) and 0. 95 <b>g</b> <b>mm</b> - 1 m - 2 (zero tillage) in the open...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : The files in this dataset relate to the derived datafiles held in the Leicester database in the directory /rjb/malet/*. *. These data on seventeenth century French revenues and expenditure supplied by the Project Director, Professor Richard Bonney, draw upon J-R Malet, 'Comptes rendus de l'administration des finances du royaume de France, (London, 1789).

5000|$|Tongues are {{pierced with}} {{straight}} barbell style jewelry. Because of the frequent {{movement of the}} tongue, jewellery size and comfort is especially important. Barbells that are too thin are prone to migration, causing discomfort and irritation. Tongue piercings can often be easily stretched to accommodate larger jewellery. The initial piercing is often at 14 <b>g</b> (1.6 <b>mm),</b> but to avoid one or two stretching steps {{it is possible to}} pierce immediately at 12 <b>g</b> (2.0 <b>mm)</b> or even 10 <b>g</b> (2.4 <b>mm).</b> Some people later choose to stretch their piercing to 12 <b>g</b> (2 <b>mm),</b> 10 <b>g</b> (2.4 <b>mm),</b> 8 <b>g</b> (3.2 <b>mm)</b> or 6 <b>g</b> (4.0 <b>mm)</b> to protect against possible migration and to have a more stable 'snug' fit. It is possible to stretch further to diameters beyond 10 mm. The beads {{at the end of the}} barbell can be made of many decorative materials. [...] "No-see-um beads", flat beads matching the color of the tongue, are sometimes worn to conceal this piercing, often in places of employment. Using appropriate colored and styled jewellery, and taking care while talking/laughing, it is possible to conceal the piercing.|$|R
