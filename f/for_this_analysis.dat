5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
25|$|Two {{facets of}} the result came under {{particular}} scrutiny within the neutrino community: the GPS synchronization system, and {{the profile of the}} proton beam spill that generated neutrinos. The second concern was addressed in the November rerun: <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> OPERA scientists repeated the measurement over the same baseline using a new CERN proton beam which circumvented the need to make any assumptions about the details of neutrino production during the beam activation, such as energy distribution or production rate. This beam provided proton pulses of 3nanoseconds each with up to 524 nanosecond gaps. This meant a detected neutrino could be tracked uniquely to its generating 3 nanoseconds pulse, and hence its start and end travel times could be directly noted. Thus, the neutrino's speed could now be calculated without having to resort to statistical inference.|$|E

[...] Four cameras are required <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis.</b> [...] The two planes of laser light are created by splitting the laser emission with a beam splitter into two beams.

2500|$|A {{gear train}} is formed by {{mounting}} gears on a frame {{so that the}} teeth of the gears engage.

[...] <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> we consider a gear train that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by the angle of the input gear.|$|E
2500|$|The use of Bayesian {{decision}} theory in new product development {{allows for the}} use of subjective prior information. [...] Bayes in new product development allows for the comparison of additional review project costs with the value of additional information {{in order to reduce the}} costs of uncertainty. The methodology used <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> is in the form of decision trees and ‘stop’/‘go’ procedures. If the predicted payoff (the posterior) is acceptable for the organisation the project should go ahead, if not, development should stop. By reviewing the posterior (which then becomes the new prior) on regular intervals throughout the development stage managers are able to make the best possible decision with the information available at hand. Although the review process may delay further development and increase costs, it can help greatly to reduce uncertainty in high risk decisions.|$|E

2500|$|A {{topic of}} {{interest}} for critic Muguraș Constantinescu was the regulatory status of old men and women within a Moldavian community {{in the context of}} social change, as disclosed by the Childhood Memories text. She describes David Creangă as a [...] "clan leader" [...] and [...] "enlightened man", guided by [...] "the wisdom and balance of the ripe age", who, although illiterate, is able to understand the value of providing his grandson with a formal education. According to Constantinescu: [...] " [...] common sense is also apparent in the field of religious belief, where, as any good Christian in a Romanian village of the mid 19th century, he takes mass and behaves like a practicing Christian, but does not encourage his wife's bigotry." [...] The unnamed old man who cheats Nică out of his hoopoe, Constantinescu writes, is a figure among those who educate young Creangă by resorting to [...] "farce" [...] instead of a stern lesson in morals. Other figures she considers relevant <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> are Chiorpec the shoemaker, Bodrângă the performer and the various old women who function as healers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulties}} in identifying separate subspecies, or even species, is pronounced. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper reported some specimens of capuchin from the Barranquilla animal market had supposedly {{come from the}} middle valley of the San Jorge River. It {{is difficult to determine}} whether these are white-headed capuchins (Cebus capucinus) or white-fronted capuchins. Intermediate characteristics include a dark crown that is high and removed from the forehead. The white parts on the face are more distinctively bald and the outside parts of the arms and legs are more clear; this suggests they are white-headed capuchin. Some specimens of C. a. versicolor seen in the market at Magangué‚ and probably captured in the lower Cauca River, show similar tendencies to the above, except that there is no increase in the dark pigmentation. Based on these observations and on various [...] "intermediate" [...] specimens from northern Colombia, it seems possible that an investigation of the contact zone between the white-headed capuchin and white-fronted capuchin ultimately could show that these forms are conspecific. Another critical zone <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> is an area in northeast Ecuador where C. a. aecuatoriales and white-headed capuchin are found, although neither sympatric distributions or intergradation have as yet been determined.|$|E
2500|$|To perform PIV {{analysis}} on the flow, two exposures of laser light are required upon the camera from the flow. [...] Originally, with the inability of cameras to capture multiple frames at high speeds, both exposures were captured on the same frame and this single frame {{was used to determine}} the flow. [...] A process called autocorrelation was used <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis.</b> [...] However, as a result of autocorrelation the direction of the flow becomes unclear, as it is not clear which particle spots are from the first pulse and which are from the second pulse. Faster digital cameras using CCD or CMOS chips were developed since then that can capture two frames at high speed with a few hundred ns difference between the frames. [...] This has allowed each exposure to be isolated on its own frame for more accurate cross-correlation analysis. [...] The limitation of typical cameras is that this fast speed is limited to a pair of shots. [...] This is because each pair of shots must be transferred to the computer before another pair of shots can be taken. [...] Typical cameras can only take a pair of shots at a much slower speed. [...] High speed CCD or CMOS cameras are available but are much more expensive.|$|E
