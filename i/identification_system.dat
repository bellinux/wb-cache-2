40|$|So far, plant {{identification}} has {{challenges for}} several researchers. Various methods and features have been proposed. However, {{there are still}} many approaches could be investigated to develop robust plant <b>identification</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper reports several experiments in using Zernike moments to build foliage plant <b>identification</b> <b>systems.</b> In this case, Zernike moments were combined with other features: geometric features, color moments and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). To implement the <b>identifications</b> <b>systems,</b> two approaches has been investigated. First approach used a distance measure and the second used Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN). The results show that Zernike Moments have a prospect as features in leaf <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> when they are combined with other features...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} the intricate question of technology-enabled national <b>identification</b> <b>systems,</b> from a scientific perspective. We first present a framework to formalize {{the notion of}} <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> in general, before delving into the policy issues and technological challenges specific to national <b>identification</b> <b>systems.</b> With this thesis, we wish to present to non-specialists the different possibilities, often too little known to people outside the research community, enabled by the current knowledge {{in science and technology}} (especially cryptology and security), and to lay the foundations for future scientific research on the subject. We hope that this presentation contributes to widen the general public's view on the matter of national <b>identification</b> <b>systems,</b> in particular with respect to the possibility of novel architectures far from those of existing systems...|$|R

5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E
