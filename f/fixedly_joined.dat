40|$|A {{mounting}} assembly includes an annular supporting flange disposed coaxially about a centerline axis {{which has a}} plurality of circumferentially spaced apart supporting holes therethrough. An annular liner is disposed coaxially with the supporting flange and includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart mounting holes aligned with respective ones of the supporting holes. Each of a plurality of mounting pins includes a proximal end <b>fixedly</b> <b>joined</b> to the supporting flange through a respective one of the supporting holes, and a distal end disposed through a respective one of the liner mounting holes for supporting the liner to the supporting flange while unrestrained differential thermal movement of the liner relative to the supporting flange...|$|E
40|$|An {{aircraft}} {{gas turbine}} engine assembly includes an inter-turbine frame axially located {{between high and low}} pressure turbines. Low pressure turbine has counter rotating low pressure inner and outer rotors with low pressure inner and outer shafts which are at least in part rotatably disposed co-axially within a high pressure rotor. Inter-turbine frame includes radially spaced apart radially outer first and inner second structural rings disposed co-axially about a centerline and connected by a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart struts. Forward and aft sump members having forward and aft central bores are <b>fixedly</b> <b>joined</b> to axially spaced apart forward and aft portions of the inter-turbine frame. Low pressure inner and outer rotors are rotatably supported by a second turbine frame bearing mounted in aft central bore of aft sump member. A mount for connecting the engine to an aircraft is located on first structural ring...|$|E
40|$|A {{combustor}} {{includes a}} dome assembly having radially outer and inner liners joined thereto and defining therebetween a combustion zone. The dome assembly includes {{at least one}} annular dome having a pair of axially extending first flanges between which are disposed a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart carburetors for discharging a fuel/air mixture into the combustion zone for generating combustion gases. An annular heat shield includes a pair of axially extending legs integrally joined to a radially extending face in a generally U-shaped configuration, with the face including a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart ports disposed concentrically with perspective ones of the carburetors for allowing the fuel/air mixture to be discharged therefrom through the heat shield. At {{least one of the}} heat shield legs includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart mounting holes disposed adjacent to a respective one of the dome flanges, and a plurality of mounting pins are <b>fixedly</b> <b>joined</b> to the dome flange and extend radially through respective ones of the mounting holes without interference therewith for allowing unrestrained thermal movement between the heat shield and the dome while supporting the heat shield against axial pressure loads thereon. In a preferred embodiment, the dome assembly includes three domes having respective ones of the heat shield, and respective baffles are spaced from the heat shields for providing impingement cooling thereof...|$|E
