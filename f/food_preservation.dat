5|$|Salt is {{essential}} for life in general, and saltiness {{is one of the}} basic human tastes. Animals tissue contain larger quantities of salt than plant tissues do. Salt {{is one of the oldest}} and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and salting is an important method of <b>food</b> <b>preservation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of <b>food</b> <b>preservation.</b> Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E
5|$|Slow {{transportation}} and <b>food</b> <b>preservation</b> techniques (based on drying, salting, smoking and pickling) made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches. Social norms also dictated that the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required coarser, cheaper food.|$|E

5|$|<b>Food</b> <b>preservation</b> {{methods were}} {{basically}} the same as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E

40|$|Meat is {{the flesh}} of an animal, {{typically}} a mammal or a bird, which can be consumed as a food. In a broader sense, meat is the edible postmortem component originating from live animals, which is mostly muscle tissue. Meat, poultry, seafood, and their derived products are consumed {{as the most important}} foods worldwide. Due to its biologic composition, meat {{is one of the more}} highly perishable <b>foods.</b> <b>Preservation</b> techniques have been used to extend the shelf life of meat and meat-based products, primarily to reduce the growth and proliferation of foodborne pathogens and the development of spoilage. Several traditional and ethnic meat-and poultry-based foods are prepared and served worldwide. Asian meat products are famous due to the particular flavor development by the addition of spices and condiments. Meat and poultry are highly perishable; numerous outbreaks regarding spoiled products are reported each year, but many of them go unreported in developing countries. This chapter will briefly describe the safety and regulatory status for traditional and ethnic meat and poultry products. Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the economies}} of Europe, the {{religious}} directives involving dietary requirements, and the general human subsistence base were transformed. These complicated and intertwined issues are starkly revealed in an isotopic study of two inland Italian human populations that are separated by approximately 850 years in time. Stable carbon (delta C- 13) and nitrogen (delta N- 15) isotopic values observed in human dentin and bone collagen from the sites of early medieval Castro dei Volsci and late medieval Rome are consistent with diets that differed substantially. As the North Atlantic opened to fishing and <b>food</b> <b>preservations</b> methods improved, Mediterranean peoples increased their fish consumption dramatically, and in doing so, met the religious directives of the Catholic Church. By analyzing both teeth and bone collagen within individuals, long-term feeding behaviors are documented, and the utility of last erupted teeth collagen as sources of adult dietary information is established. This study offers the first physical evidence of this new economic reality linking the Atlantic and Mediterranean economies {{at the end of}} the Middle Ages. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|With the {{discovery}} of the importance of airtight containers for <b>food</b> <b>preservation</b> by French inventor Nicholas Appert, the tin canning process was patented by British merchant Peter Durand in 1810. After receiving the patent, Durand did not himself follow up with canning food. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned goods for the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|In home canning, food {{is packed}} into a jar, and the steel lid {{is placed on}} top of the jar with the {{integral}} rubber seal resting {{on the rim of the}} jar.

The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used sealing wax, which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid.

50|$|In February 1944 Anellis {{joined the}} newly created U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps Food and Container Institute in Chicago, and worked on {{problems}} of the microbiological safety of foods being shipped overseas to U.S. servicemen. Dehydrated milk and dehydrated eggs were products developed at this time for which Anellis tested the microbiological safety. Anellis's research focused on strains of bacteria which were especially heat-resistant, including salmonella and clostridium botulinum. This led to the consideration {{of the use of}} gamma radiation as a food preservative, and Anellis began research on the radiation resistance of bacteria in canned foods. In 1963 the Food and Container Institute was closed and its operations were moved to the U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Laboratories in Natick, Massachusetts. Anellis continued his research on the radiation resistance of bacteria at the Natick Labs until his retirement in 1977. While working at the Natick Labs he also participated in the program to develop <b>foods</b> and <b>food</b> <b>preservations</b> for NASA. Anellis was an advocate of irradiation of foods as a food preservative and preventative against microbiological contamination, and testified before the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the safety of human consumption of foods irradiated at low dosage.|$|R
