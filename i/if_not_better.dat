5|$|France hosted England at Colombes on 1 January 1908 for {{the third}} rugby {{encounter}} between the two nations. Although France lost the game 0â€“19, the press did not consider it a crushing defeat, given that on the previous occasions England had scored 35 points and then 41. During the first half, two French players departed the field injured, {{so that by the}} second half, England had the advantage in numbers and were able to control the game, which at the start had appeared (to the French press) to be well-balanced. The forwards were considered to be at least equal to, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>better,</b> than the English. Guillemin and Duval amongst the forwards, as well as the backs Hubert and Moure, drew praise from Reichel.|$|E
5|$|Western North America {{has several}} species {{closely related to}} B.edulis. The white king bolete (Boletus barrowsii), found in parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California (and {{possibly}} elsewhere), is named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows. It is lighter in colour than B.edulis, having a cream-coloured cap with pink tones; often mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine, it tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall. Some find its flavour as good as <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>better</b> than B.edulis. The California king bolete (Boletus edulis var. grandedulis) can reach massive proportions, and is distinguished from B.edulis by a mature pore surface that is brown to slightly reddish. The cap colour appears {{to be affected by}} the amount of light received during its development, and may range from white in young specimens grown under thick canopy, to dark-brown, red-brown or yellow brown in those specimens receiving more light. The queen bolete (Boletus regineus), formerly considered a variety of B.aereus, is also a choice edible. It is generally smaller than B.edulis, and unlike that species, is typically found in mixed forests. The spring king bolete (Boletus rex-veris), formerly considered a variety of B.edulis or B.pinophilus, is found throughout western North America. In contrast to B.edulis, B.rex-veris tends to fruit in clusters, and, as its common name suggests, appears in the spring.|$|E

25|$|Early Braille {{education}} {{is crucial to}} literacy for a blind or low-vision child. A study conducted {{in the state of}} Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>better</b> than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} war, {{upgrades}} {{on the line}} to Ararat necessary for H class operation were not made as the VR struggled with a backlog of maintenance work which had built up during the 1940s. When the VR finally embarked on major capital investment in the early 1950s, diesel and electric traction were under consideration. Although diesel locomotives of the early 1950s typically had far lower power outputs than the H class, they could be run in multiple-unit operation, with one crew controlling two or more locomotives. In August 1952, two new B class diesel-electric locomotives established their credentials during trials by hauling a 1,121 ton goods train up Ingliston Bank and covering in 44 minutes the same distance two A2 class locomotives took to haul a 690-ton load in 67 minutes. The B class locomotives proved their ability to provide the same (<b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>better)</b> performance as the H class, but without the heavy axle load and requirements for upgraded infrastructure. They became the new motive power not only for The Overland, but also mainline goods service. The days of mainline steam locomotives were numbered.|$|E

According to the reviewer, Sorga Ka Toedjoe seemed to have been inspired by American films but still showed its Indies character. The reviewer also opined that Djoemala was as good as, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>better,</b> than Mochtar.

500|$|Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition for Wii U {{received}} a mixed reception. GameRankings provided {{a score of}} 85%, and Metacritic provided a score of 85/100. Eurogamer's Richard Leadbetter was critical of technical performance including issues with visual quality and inconsistent framerate. EGMs Ray Carsillo said that the optional B.A.T. system made certain battles too easy. Carsillo also {{said it was the}} [...] "clearly inferior version" [...] of the game due to glitches and [...] "tacked on gimmicks". Nintendo World Report's Patrick Barnett wrote that certain uses of the Wii U controller made it [...] "the best way to experience Arkham City", but that some new features were a [...] "nuisance". Barnett added that it was [...] "on par, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>better,</b> visually", than its counterparts. Joystiq's JC Fletcher opined that the persistent map screen and touch screen interface were appreciated, and complimented the use of augmented reality to explore crime scenes. Game Revolution's Blake Peterson praised the real-time management of information, upgrades and equipment that he considered made Batman more vulnerable, although Barnett included this as a point of criticism.|$|E

Shelby's voice was almost too crystal clear for the Gaga half of the composition." [...] Futterman said that Menzel [...] "can kill a Gaga ballad", and while she [...] "outshines" [...] Morrison, he [...] "complements her nicely". West gave the mash-up a [...] "B+", called it [...] "really well-done" [...] {{and said it was}} [...] "elevated" [...] by Menzel's voice. MTV's Kevin P.
