On February 14, 1879 when Bolivian authorities attempted to auction the confiscated property of CSFA, Chilean armed forces occupied the port city of Antofagasta.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "written warranty" [...] (also {{called an}} <b>express</b> <b>warranty)</b> is any written promise made in {{connection}} with the sale of a consumer product by a supplier to a consumer that relates to the material and/or workmanship and that affirms that the product is defect-free or will meet a certain standard of performance over a specified time.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the phrase [...] "as is" [...] does not {{disclaim}} <b>express</b> <b>warranties,</b> {{such as those}} created by the seller's description of an item.

50|$|First, {{it should}} be pointed out that, where sales are {{concluded}} by sample, such a contract contains an <b>express</b> <b>warranty</b> that the bulk of the goods conform to the sample. If the final consignment does not comply, the warranty is breached, and the buyer has an actio empti, and a full range of contractual remedies, including (where appropriate) a claim for damages.|$|E

The plaintiff gave no instructions respecting the food other than to order it.|$|E
5000|$|Warranties are {{statements}} by a manufacturer or seller concerning a product during a commercial transaction. Warranty claims commonly require privity between the injured {{party and the}} manufacturer or seller; in plain English, this means they must be dealing with each other directly. Breach of warranty-based product liability claims usually focus on one of three types: (1) breach of an <b>express</b> <b>warranty,</b> (2) breach of an implied warranty of merchantability, and (3) breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Additionally, claims involving real estate may also {{take the form of}} an implied warranty of habitability. <b>Express</b> <b>warranty</b> claims focus on express {{statements by}} the manufacturer or the seller concerning the product (e.g., [...] "This chainsaw is useful to cut turkeys"). The various implied warranties cover those expectations common to all products (e.g., that a tool is not unreasonably dangerous when used for its proper purpose), unless specifically disclaimed by the manufacturer or the seller.|$|E
5000|$|Section 10 abolishes [...] "any rule of {{law that}} a breach of <b>warranty</b> (<b>express</b> or implied) ... results in the {{discharge}} of the insurer's liability".|$|R
50|$|By contrast, a {{warranty}} is not {{fundamental to}} the performance of the contract and breach of a warranty, while giving rise to a claim for damages, does not entitle the non-breaching party to terminate the contract. The meaning of these terms is reversed in insurance law. Indeed, a warranty if not strictly complied with will automatically discharge the insurer from further liability under the contract of insurance. The assured has no defense to his breach, unless he can prove that the insurer, by his conduct, has waived his right to invoke the breach, possibility provided in section 34(3) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 (MIA). Furthermore, in the absence of <b>express</b> <b>warranties</b> the MIA will imply them, notably a warranty to provide a seaworthy vessel at the commencement of the voyage in a voyage policy (section 39(1)) and a warranty of legality of the insured voyage (section 41).|$|R

50|$|In the United States, a {{disclaimer}} must be conspicuous in the contract, e.g., {{in a different}} kind of print or font that makes it stand out. On the other hand, <b>express</b> <b>warranty,</b> that is, any affirmation of fact or promise to the buyer, or description of the good, oral or written, can be negated or limited only if such disclaimers are not unreasonable. (Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-316 (1)).|$|E
5000|$|Before {{statutory}} law, {{the buyer}} had no <b>express</b> <b>warranty</b> ensuring {{the quality of}} goods. In the UK, common law requires that goods must be [...] "fit for the particular purpose" [...] and of [...] "merchantable quality", per Section 15 of the Sale of Goods Act but this implied warranty {{can be difficult to}} enforce and may not apply to all products. Hence, buyers are still advised to be cautious.|$|E
50|$|The <b>express</b> <b>warranty</b> {{signed by}} Mr. Henningsen will apply under {{contract}} law {{even if he}} did not read all of it. The warranty agreement, which is a standard used by all major automobile manufacturers, seems to disguise the limitations of the warranty coverage. The jury verdict at trial established this disclaimer was not fairly obtained, and, therefore, the disclaimer will not apply to the situation at hand. Therefore, damages under implied warranty will stand.|$|E
40|$|Except for {{a handful}} of {{rigorous}} software development schemes that are required for certi cation of certain critical software applications (e. g., RTCA DO 178 -B, SAE ARP 4754, UK Defence Standard 055, and IEC 61508), there are no generally applicable software certi cation schemes. While there is no theoretical reason why these standards could not also be applied to less critical applications, there is a practical reason: cost. Estimates vary, but it is generally accepted that one line of safety-critical software costs between $ 500 -$ 5, 000 to design, write, test, and certify. Such levels of rigor and quality are excessive for most non-critical applications. Nonetheless, a ubiquitously accepted process which provides guarantees about software quality for commercial software packages is still needed. These guarantees must be product-based and trustworthy.

5000|$|In the United States, various laws apply, {{including}} {{provisions in}} the Uniform Commercial Code which provide for implied warranties. However, these implied warranties were often limited by disclaimers. In 1975 the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act was passed to strengthen warranties on consumer goods. Among other things, under the law implied warranties cannot be disclaimed if an <b>express</b> <b>warranty</b> is offered, and attorney fees may be recovered. In some states statutory warranties are required on new home construction, and [...] "lemon laws" [...] apply to motor vehicles.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{warranties}} for product purchases, express warranties and implied warranties. Express warranties make specific promises about product repair, and are usually made in writing. An <b>express</b> <b>warranty</b> may be provided by the manufacturers in owner's manuals and other written sales or marketing materials. Implied warranties arise from a manufacturer's duty to meet certain minimum standards of quality whereby the product is fit for use for the purpose intended. An implied warranty arises from the sale itself, and need not be in writing. In each type the manufacturer assumes the liability and responsibility to correct the defect and, in the event that they cannot meet that duty, may be required to repurchase or replace the product.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} ruling also {{limited the}} potential litigants to smokers who developed disease prior to 1969. The opinion did not exclude fraud and conspiracy or <b>express</b> <b>warranty,</b> as section 5b of the 1969 Act does not explicitly define this; if the plaintiff could {{prove that the}} industry conspired to hide evidence concerning the harms of smoking or lied to the public about them, or if express warranties were breached, then a new case can be filed, {{as there is no}} discussion of tort litigation or damage claims in the Act. While the concurring opinion found that no damage claims were preempted rather than not discussed, the dissenting justices found that all state laws were preempted by the act.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{a seller}} of a used {{automobile}} sells {{his car to}} a buyer, and puts into the contract of sale the statement: [...] "The buyer accepts the automobile AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS." [...] Two minutes after the buyer drives off with it, the engine seizes, and the car stalls. Unless the buyer can show {{that there was some}} fraud involved, or the seller breached an <b>express</b> <b>warranty,</b> the buyer is not entitled to a refund. This would be a specific example where fraud in the inducement could outweigh anything in the contract, express or implied: it simply doesn't matter what disclaimer or limitations may be found in the contract, if the contract is void (or voidable) for any reason.|$|E

5000|$|On appeal, {{the court}} held (per Lewis AJA), that the {{surrounding}} circumstances—what passed between the parties, their negotiations and their conduct—did not show that the words [...] "no warranty whatsoever" [...] had included the implied warranty against eviction. Although the phrase had to be regarded at first blush as a complete catch-all, saving the seller from any liability that might have arisen by operation of law, or by virtue of representations or warranties, it could not, given its generality, {{and the absence of}} any evidence that the question of title had been considered or in contemplation, have excluded the most fundamental obligation of the seller: to give undisturbed possession of the merx to the buyer. The only inference to be drawn from the circumstances was that Arnold had not intended or even contemplated that he might be deprived of possession by the true owner, and yet have no recourse to Van der Westhuizen. The evidence did not show that Van der Westhuizen had any such liability in mind either. In the circumstances, then, the provision in the document that Van der Westhuizen had given no warranties whatsoever did not exclude his liability for breach of the warranty against eviction. This did not mean that the words at issue were superfluous; they referred also to <b>express</b> <b>warranties</b> which would have related to the condition of the car.|$|R
