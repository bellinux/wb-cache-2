5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license plates, with Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of the murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a woman who lived in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by legal authorities, to her residence and allowed him to stay there. Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at a shed near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E

The brothers then bought the plane from its owner with the very little money they had and rebuilt it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> at their family farmhouse. This was their first experience tinkering with an aircraft as a self-taught restoration project, followed by {{the making of a}} Glasair 1 they saw introduced at the 1980 EAA Convention and Fly-In (now called AirVenture) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. David Gustafson of Aircraft Spruce reported that the only way the Klapmeier brothers' parents would lend them the money to buy a Glasair was if they wrote up a business plan explaining why constructing a homebuilt would further their professional lives.|$|E

Good works, however, are a product of salvation.

500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> Mary and Joseph {{share an}} {{intensely}} private moment before the Annunciation to the shepherds of the Christ child's {{birth to the}} shepherds. They are rendered in bright colors. Mary wears a long flowing blue robe, Joseph a green-lined red cape over a brown robe. He holds his hat in hand, and his pattens are respectfully removed, left lying on the ground. They gaze reverently at the newborn figure of Jesus who lies on Mary's robe. [...] Mary's features have a softness and sweetness more characteristic of Christus's later paintings and remarkably similar to his Madonna of the Dry Tree, according to Maryan Ainsworth. [...] Kneeling in adoration to either side are four small angels.|$|E
500|$|The two {{uppermost}} reliefs on the arch, {{which have}} a central focus and function as keystones, bring attention to the juxtaposition of Old and New Testament themes. The relief to the left shows Cain and Abel sacrificing to God; on the right Cain commits the sin of murder, which God punishes. The two reliefs also function as a temporal device, leading the viewer directly to the moment of Christ's birth and mankind's redemption, which occurs below <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed.</b> [...] The viewer is reminded that mankind must sacrifice to Christ, who lies directly below, or risk punishment and expulsion from the church, just as God expelled Cain. [...] The Fall of man acted out on the archway reminds the viewer of the [...] "necessity of Christ's sacrifice".|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} contains several geometric constructions. The {{roof of the}} shed's trusses form {{series of}} triangles connecting lines joining {{the base of the}} pedestals and the crossbeams. These surround the gathering of the Holy Family, who form an inverse pattern. According to art historian Lawrence Steefel, [...] "the detail participates in an almost emblematic pattern of repeated triangles which establish a rhyme scheme above and below, of roof structure and figure disposition." [...] Upton writes that a [...] "clearly defined diamond" [...] is visible within the apex in the roof. From there it extends down to Eve, and the bottom apex is formed where the infant lies on the ground. It then extends up to Adam and back up to the roof. [...] "This diamond shape," [...] he writes, [...] "supplemented by the rectangle within it, formed by the shed supports, the base of the triangle and the ground line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed,</b> circumscribes the main event of the painting." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} {{emasculation}} is prevalent in Hemingway's work, {{most notably in}} The Sun Also Rises. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, {{is a result of}} a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained emancipation. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times. Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the [...] "natural" [...] versus the [...] "unnatural". In [...] "Alpine Idyll" [...] the [...] "unnaturalness" [...] of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the [...] "unnaturalness" [...] of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the [...] "natural" [...] spring for redemption.|$|E

However, as Michael leaves, [...] Mayhew says that he has the {{remaining}} money for him. Michael leaves, Mayhew goes to the door, and finds out that the police are there. They arrest him.

The meaning of this text is unclear, although presumably it refers to the bull killed by Mithras, as no other source refers to a Mithraic salvation. However, the servasti is only a conjecture. [...] According to Robert Turcan, Mithraic salvation had little to do with the other-worldly destiny of individual souls, but was on the Zoroastrian pattern of man's participation in the cosmic struggle of the good creation against the forces of evil.|$|E

2500|$|In a seeming anachronism, the {{painting}} shows sheep being shorn with blade shears {{rather than the}} machine shears which started to enter Australian shearing sheds in the late 1880s. Art historian Terry Smith's suggestion that Roberts presented a deliberately historical vision of shearing has been questioned on account of there being no evidence that electric shears had been introduced to [...] "Brocklesby" [...] {{at the time of}} {{the painting}}'s composition. The young man carrying the fleece on the left of the painting alludes to the figure of Esau in Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise at the Florence Baptistery. The model for the smiling tar-boy at the centre of the picture, the only figure to make eye contact with the viewer, was actually a girl, 9-year-old Susan Bourne, who lived until 1979.

In the corner of the main shed is a corner office, presented as a locomotive designer's office (only visible to visitors through windows). Off the pedestrian entrance in the southern side is a room presented as the engine crew's break room. Atop the Great Shed is a weather vane depicting a waggonway train approaching a cow, a reference to a famous quote by George Stephensen when asked by parliament in 1825 what would happen in such an eventuality - [...] "very awkward indeed - for the coo!".|$|E
2500|$|The more {{high-profile}} unit preserved is {{the former}} South West Trains (SWT) [...] "celebrity" [...] unit painted in BR blue livery with painted aluminium window frames, number 3417. The unit was initially used on Wimbledon depot as a shunter, but with SWT needing to get it off its books it was sold to the Bluebell Railway for the nominal sum of £1. It was moved to Eastleigh Works for storage, after having been used initially as the centrepiece for the Bluebell in a ceremony at East Grinstead railway station to mark the commencement of work at the station site {{as part of the}} line's work on the northern extension. The unit returned to East Grinstead for further use and storage in September 2010. In late April, the unit sustained minor damage to its shoegear as it was being towed from Clapham Junction Yard to the Swanage Railway. This resulted in the traction current being discharged in the yard overnight, whilst repairs were carried out.
