5|$|According to the 2007 census, 92.2% of the {{population}} was literate; most of the illiterate population was female. A total of 3,613 students were in elementary school, 3,601 in preparatory school, and 1,862 in high school. 958 people had college diplomas; 49 had academic degrees <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> BA.|$|E
5|$|A mid-20th-century report {{estimated}} {{the volume of}} surface seepage into mine workings at Hull Creek was 9.53 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of streambed seepage in the area {{was estimated to be}} 17.02 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall.

5|$|The Kemper Arena has {{a maximum}} {{capacity}} of 18,344, {{but that was}} reduced for New Year' Revolution (2007). The maximum attendance that was allowed was 10,000. The event received 220,000 pay-per-view buys, which was less than the 294,000 buys the previous year's event received. The promotion's revenue was $107.4million, which was greater than the previous year's revenue of $95.1. Canadian Online Explorer rated the overall event, {{as well as the}} main event, a six out of ten. None of the matches received a rating <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> 7.5 out of 10. The match between Mickie James and Victoria was rated a three out of 10, the lowest overall.|$|E

5|$|Points {{are awarded}} from 1 to 7, with 7 being equal to A*, 6 equal to A, and so on. Up to three {{additional}} points are awarded {{depending on the}} grades achieved in the extended essay and theory of knowledge, so the maximum possible point total in the IBDP is 45. The global pass rate for the IB diploma is approximately 80%. In order to receive an IB diploma, candidates must receive a minimum of 24 points or an average of four (or C) {{out of a possible}} seven points for six subjects. Candidates must also receive a minimum of 12 points from their Higher Level subjects and a minimum of 9 points from their Standard Level subjects. Additionally, candidates must complete all of the requirements for the EE, CAS and TOK. Failing conditions that will prevent a student from being awarded a diploma, regardless of points received, are non-completion of CAS, more than three scores of 3 or below, not meeting the specific points required for Higher Level or Standard Level subjects, or plagiarism in addition to scoring <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> score of 1 in any subject/level.|$|E

25|$|Handling and {{counting}} penny coins entail transaction costs {{that may be}} <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> penny. It has been claimed that, for micropayments, the mental arithmetic costs more than the penny.

25|$|The University of Cambridge {{borrowed}} 350 {{million pounds}} by issuing a 40-year security bond in October 2012. Its interest rate is about 0.6 percent <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> British government 40-year bond. Vice chancellor Leszek Borysiewicz hailed {{the success of}} the issue.

25|$|Subsequently, in {{the late}} 1980s and 1990s, the rates of upper-limb defects in babies born in Corby {{were found to be}} almost three times higher than those of {{children}} born in the surrounding area and ten times <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> town with a population of 60,000 should expect. In all cases initially referred to the court there were no previous family histories of limb defect.|$|E
25|$|Only {{medicine}} and dentistry retain their non-standard degree structure, where the Licentiate (<b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> master's degree, but less extensive than Doctor of Medicine or Dentistry degrees) {{is the basic}} degree. A six-year program of at least 360 ECTS credits leads to the Licentiate of Medicine (lääketieteen lisensiaatti) degree. There is an intermediate title (but not an academic degree) of lääketieteen kandidaatti, and no master's degree.|$|E
25|$|Achieving full {{acceleration}} or hill climbing, {{while avoiding}} engine speeds <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> certain limit (e.g. 3000 or 4000 RPM), is difficult since it requires avoiding triggering the kick-down-switch. Avoiding triggering the kick-down-switch requires a good {{feel of the}} throttle pedal, but use of full throttle can still be achieved with a little sensitivity as the kick-down button is only activated beyond the normal full opening of the accelerator pedal.|$|E

50|$|In {{the church}} hierarchy, a hieromonk is of <b>higher</b> dignity <b>than</b> <b>a</b> hierodeacon, {{just as a}} secular (i.e., married) priest is of <b>higher</b> dignity <b>than</b> <b>a</b> deacon.

25|$|However, most {{religious}} systems acknowledge {{an afterlife}} and improving this {{is seen as}} an even more basic good. In many other moral systems, also, remaining on Earth in a state that lacks honor or power over self is less desirable— consider seppuku in bushido, kamikazes or the role of suicide attacks in Jihadi rhetoric. In all these systems, remaining on Earth is perhaps no <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> third-place value.|$|E
25|$|While {{traditionally}} {{aimed at}} the domestic market, Canadian sparkling wines have recently gained prominence internationally. In 2011, L'Acadie Vineyards won a silver medal at an international competition for sparkling wines in France and in 2012, Benjamin Bridge winery's 2004 Brut Reserve placed <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> Louis Roederer 2004 Cristal (wine) champagne at a blind tasting held with noted critics, bringing attention to the country's wine industry.

Its popularity however remained strong right through the production run, family buyers appreciative of the plentiful interior room and standard features. It may have been somewhat conservatively styled, but the effort Nissan had put into the engineering of the car made it reliable and tough, qualities most Australians rated <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> more advanced design.|$|E
25|$|The F–K formula {{was first}} used by the Army for {{assessing}} the difficulty of technical manuals in 1978 and soon after became a United States Military Standard.

This is now a common requirement in many other states and for other legal documents such as insurance policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{lands of}} Galicia are {{ascribed}} to two different {{areas in the}} Köppen climate classification: a south area (roughly, the province of Ourense and Pontevedra) with tendencies to have some summer drought, classified as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb), with mild temperatures and rainfall usual throughout the year; and the western and northern coastal regions, the provinces of Lugo and A Coruña, which are characterized by their Oceanic climate (Cfb), with a more uniform precipitation distribution along the year, and milder summers. However, precipitation in southern coastal areas are often classified as oceanic since the averages remain significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> typical mediterranean climate.|$|E
