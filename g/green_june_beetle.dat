50|$|Cotinis mutabilis, {{also known}} as the figeater beetle (also green fruit beetle or fig beetle), {{is a member of the}} scarab beetle family. It belongs to the {{subfamily}} Cetoniinae, comprising a group of beetles commonly called flower chafers since many of them feed on pollen, nectar, or petals. Its habitat is primarily the southwestern United States and Mexico. Figeater beetles are often mistaken for <b>green</b> <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (Cotinis nitida) and occasionally Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica), which occur in the eastern US; however, they are not considered to be an important pest because they do not damage lawns as larvae and trees as much as their eastern cousins.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{locomotion}} response of airborne, ambulatory and aquatic insects to thermal stimulation. A {{finite element model}} has been developed to predict the variation of insect–stimulator interface temperature with input power. Piezothermal stimulators have been fabricated from lead zirconate titanate (PZT) using a batch mode micro ultrasonic machining process. Typical sizes range from 200 µm to 3. 2 mm. For PZT stimulators, the temperature and thermal efficiency reach the maximum value around the resonance frequency which is typically {{in the range of}} 650 kHz to 47 MHz. Experiments have been conducted on <b>green</b> <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (GJBs), Madagascar hissing roaches and green diving beetles (GDBs) in order to show the versatility of the proposed technique. The stimulators have been implanted near the antennae of the GJBs and {{on either side of the}} thorax of the Madagascar hissing roaches and GDBs, respectively. In all cases, the insects move away from the direction of the actuated stimulator. The left and right turns are statistically similar. Thermal stimulation achieves an overall success rate of 78. 7 %, 92. 8 % and 61. 6 % in GJBs, roaches and GDBs, respectively. On average, thermal stimulation results in an angle turn of about 13. 7 °– 16. 2 ° on GJBs, 30 °– 45 ° on the roaches and 30 °– 50 ° on GDBs. The corresponding average input power is 360, 330 and 100 mW for GJBs, roach and GDBs, respectively. Scaling limits of the PZT stimulators for operating these stimulators are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{explores the}} use of bulk micromachined {{piezoelectric}} transducers for ultrasonic heat generation. The work includes basic studies of the phenomenon, the development of simulation models, the design and fabrication of practical devices and interface circuits. The technology is demonstrated in two application contexts: cauterization with a biopsy needle, and stimulation of insect locomotion. Simulations based on three-dimensional finite element models, indicate that circular disc-shaped elements provide superior steady-state temperature rise for a given cross-sectional area, volume of the PZT element, and drive voltage. The heating is greatest at the frequency of maximum electromechanical conductance. The thermal efficiency is maximized at frequency of maximum electromechanical impedance. Stacked PZT heaters provide 3. 5 x the temperature rise and 3 x greater efficiency than single elements. A biopsy needle with an embedded array of four piezoceramic microheaters of 200 µm diameter and 70 - 80 µm thickness has been fabricated. The PZT- 5 A heaters generate the target temperature rise of 33 ˚C at the tissue-needle interface for an input power of < 325 mW and a drive voltage of < 17 VRMS when inserted into porcine tissue. The extent of tissue cauterization is < 1. 25 mm beyond {{the perimeter of the}} needle. Cauterization of porcine tissue sample results in a decrease of 600 kHz in the resonance frequency and 900 ohms in the peak impedance magnitude, allowing the extent of cauterization to be monitored easily. Interface circuits for measurement of resonance frequency shift due to cauterization and for actuation of PZT heaters are also described. Experiments have been conducted using piezothermal stimulators implanted near antennae of <b>green</b> <b>June</b> <b>beetles</b> (GJB), and {{on either side of the}} thorax of Madagascar hissing roaches and green diving beetles (GDB) to show the feasibility of locomotion control using microthermal stimulation. Thermal stimulation causes the insects to move away from the direction of the actuated stimulator. Thermal stimulation achieves an overall success rate of 80 %, 93. 5 % and 68 % in GJB, roaches and GDB, respectively. On average, thermal stimulation results in an angle turn of about 15 ˚- 18 ˚ on GJB, 30 ˚- 45 ˚ on the roaches and 15 ˚- 60 ˚ on GDB. The corresponding average input power is 360 mW, 330 mW and 100 mW for GJB, roach, and GDB, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Invasive species' facilitation, or benefiting, {{of native}} species is rarely {{considered}} in biological invasion literature but could have serious economic consequences should a non-native herbivore facilitate injury by a native pest of high-value crops. Japanese beetle (JB), Popillia japonica, a polyphagous scarab, facilitates feeding by the obligate fruit-feeding native <b>green</b> <b>June</b> <b>beetle</b> (GJB), Cotinis nitida, by biting into intact grape berries that GJB, which has blunt spatulate mandibles, is otherwise unable to exploit. Here, we show JB further facilitates GJB by contaminating fruits with yeasts, and by creating infection courts for yeasts associated with GJB, that elicit volatiles exploited as aggregation kairomones by GJB. Traps baited with combinations of grapes and beetles {{were used to}} show that fruits injured by JB alone, or in combination with GJB, become highly attractive to both sexes of GJB. Such grapes emit high amounts of fermentation compounds compared with intact grapes. Beetle feeding on grape mash induced the same volatiles as addition of winemaker's yeast, and similar attraction of GJB in the field. Eight yeast species were isolated and identified from JB collected from grapevine foliage. Establishment and spread of JB throughout fruit-growing regions of the United States is likely to elevate the pest status of GJB and other pests of ripening fruits in vineyards and orchards...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design, {{fabrication}} {{and testing of}} an energy scavenger that generates power from the wing motion of a <b>Green</b> <b>June</b> <b>Beetle</b> (C otinis nitida) during its tethered flight. The generator utilizes non-resonant piezoelectric bimorphs operated in the d 31 bending mode to convert mechanical vibrations of a beetle into electrical output. The available deflection, force, and power output from oscillatory movements at different locations on a beetle are measured with a meso-scale piezoelectric beam. This way, the optimum location to scavenge energy is determined, and up to ~ 115 µW total power is generated from body movements. Two initial generator prototypes were fabricated, mounted on a beetle, and harvested 11. 5 and 7. 5 µW in device volumes of 11. 0 and 5. 6 mm 3, respectively, from 85 to 100 Hz wing strokes during the beetle's tethered flight. A spiral generator {{was designed to maximize}} the power output by employing a compliant structure in a limited area. The necessary technology needed to fabricate this prototype was developed, including a process to machine high-aspect ratio devices from bulk piezoelectric substrates with minimum damage to the material using a femto-second laser. The fabricated lightweight spiral generators produced 18. 5 – 22. 5 µW on a bench-top test setup mimicking beetles' wing strokes. Placing two generators (one on each wing) can result in more than 45 µW of power per insect. A direct connection between the generator and the flight muscles of the insect is expected to increase the final power output by one order of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|Processing {{techniques}} for red wines {{and their potential}} health benefits have intensively been investigated, however, information relevant to the grape and wine industry in Texas is less frequently available. The overall objective of this work {{was to investigate the}} reduction of 3 -alkyl- 2 -methoxypyrazines that can affect the quality of Texas wines and to study the health benefits of Texas wines. The methods used include SPME-GC-MS and molecular bioassays. The first objective was to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory potential effect of red wine polyphenols from Black Spanish wine (Vitis aestivalis hybrid) in colonic human fibroblast cells. Results show that an extract prepared from Black Spanish wine decreased gene expression and activation of NF-kB transcription factor and target proinflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Induction of microRNA- 126 (miR- 126) by wine extract was found {{to be one of the}} underlying molecular mechanism by which wine extract decreased vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM- 1) and inflammation in colon cells. These mechanisms may be relevant to the prevention of iv inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may increase the risk for colon cancer. The second objective was to investigate the role of the <b>green</b> <b>june</b> <b>beetle</b> (GJB) as exogenous source of MPs other than the multicolored Asian Lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis). Over the last decade, the <b>green</b> <b>june</b> <b>beetle</b> has been suspected to be a source of MPs based on intermittent reports from Texas growers of an atypical aroma and flavor reminiscent of crushed green June beetles (GJB). Specifically the North region of Texas seems affected. Results demonstrated GJB as source of 3 -isopropyl- 2 - methoxypyrazine, where one GJB could elevate MPs above sensory perceptible levels in 4. 3 gallons of wine. The incorporation of GJB to the winemaking process may contribute negatively to the sensory properties of Texas wines and therefore should be strictly controlled. The third objective was to explore the potential effect of micro-oxygenation treatment and accelerated aging techniques relevant for the state of Texas in the reduction of 3 -Isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IBMP), and 3 -isopropyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP) levels as determined by SPME-GC-MS. Results show that MPs were not affected by MOX or oak interaction. Although the data suggest that MOX and oak exposure do not directly affect MPs concentration. The fourth research objective was to explore the potential effect of three commercial available yeast strains, BM 45, K 1, and D 80, on MPs levels in Black Spanish wines. Black Spanish wines were fermented with MB 45 strain resulted in the highest amount of MPs. Conversely K 1 and D 80 yeast strains reduced IBMP levels in comparison with the control. An increase in IBMP was not expected. However it has been demonstrated that amino acids valine and leucine are MPs precursors. If Vitis v aestivalis hybrid grapes contained a similar methyltransferase enzyme found in Vitis vinifera grapes and S. cerevisiae contained similar IPMP biosynthesis pathway found in Pseudomonas perolens BM 45 may have led to the increased IBMP observed in the fermentation. In addition we evaluated MPs levels of wines fermented over 20 days with a chemical defined grape juice medium containing a concentration of yeast available nitrogen of 200 mg N/L. Data suggest that wines fermented with BM 45 and D 80 yeast strains reduced IBMP but K 1 yeast did not show any effect in comparison with the control. In addition MPs were evaluated in the yeast mannoproteins fraction. Results show the presence of IBMP in low concentration below the method detection limit. This data demonstrate for the first time that yeast mannoproteins binds IBMP. to evidence for interactions between mannoproteins secreted by the D 80 yeast strain and IBMP. This work will provide valuable information regarding the potential health benefits of Vitis aestivalis hybrid grapes and reduction of MPs and thus improving the quality of Texas wine...|$|E
