40|$|The study {{engaged in}} the {{evaluation}} of the influence of sporogenic microorganisms belonging to the Bacillus genus on the quality of UHT milk products. <b>Heat</b> <b>resistence</b> of spores of the Bacillus spp microorganisms was determined as well as the possibility of resuscitation of sub-lethally damaged spores. There were found differences in the time necessary for the inactivation of spores and on this characteristic depending variable resistence of individual species as well as strains of the same species. It was found that the heat and time parameters of UHT milk treatment required by the legislation can, on occasion, be survived by some sporadic spores of heat-resistant strains. By determining the proteolysis and lipolysis caused by enzymes of the Bacillus spp strains we evaluated the extent of changes of proteins and fat in the UHT milk in dependence on the species and numbers of microorganisms and the heat regime.
