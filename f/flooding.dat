40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{urbanization}} rate and extreme rainfall {{as a form of}} the abnormal climate, the urban <b>flood</b> frequency has been increased. Therefore, it is very important for the policy makers to evaluate the urban <b>flood</b> vulnerability and propose the corresponding <b>flood</b> mit-igation policies. Since the interests on the urban <b>flood</b> mitigation is increased, many structural <b>flood</b> measures has been constructed. If a city has many structural <b>flood</b> measures, the city is considered as the <b>flood</b> safe city. In this study, inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability is pro-posed using <b>Flood</b> Protection Capacity and Damage(PCD) matrix with the <b>flood</b> damage cost and constructed structural <b>flood</b> mit-igation measures. The proposed inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability method was applied in Seoul. The results are categorized by four areas such as relatively <b>flood</b> safe area, <b>flood</b> risk area, inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerable area, and the area where more structural <b>flood</b> measures are needed. Calculated inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerabilities were compared to the conventional <b>flood</b> vulnerability-resilience indices. The proposed inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability showed more reasonable results. For example, Songpa and Mapo were considered as the <b>flood</b> safe districts because of its high financial independence rate and many constructed <b>flood</b> mitigation measures.

5|$|Argentina's geomorphic {{characteristics}} {{make the}} country highly vulnerable to floods. These floods can damage infrastructure, cause loss of life, {{increase the risk of}} diseases, and negatively impact agricultural productivity, {{which is one of the}} main economic activities of the country. Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers. The plains are at highest risk for <b>flooding,</b> particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country, including Greater Buenos Aires. This is because these plains, which cover 35% of the land area in the country (including the Chaco and Pampean areas), are characterized by a flat landscape, which can impede proper water drainage. Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to <b>flooding</b> due to river overflows following high rainfall. These floods can last for months, particularly in the Parana River, owing to its large basin. In the most extreme case, during the year 1982–1983, the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year, negatively impacting the area both socially and economically. Major <b>flooding</b> events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends. Similarly, in Buenos Aires Province, <b>flooding</b> occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage; major <b>flooding</b> events in the province occurred in 1987, 2002/2003, 2012 and in 2014, causing damage to agriculture production. Most of the <b>flooding</b> events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall. <b>Flooding</b> can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest, but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities. <b>Flooding</b> can jeopardize access to safe water.

The proposed method is suitable for making simple and reasonable estimates of the maximum expected <b>flood</b> and <b>flood</b> frequencies for a region and is usable for some engineering applications to hydraulic structure design, especially bridge hydraulic design. Goodness of fit of the proposed <b>flood</b> frequency distribution to observed <b>flood</b> frequency data was tested, and results indicate that <b>flood</b> frequencies of more than half the streamflow stations estimated using the suggested method adequately describe the observed <b>flood</b> frequency data. Simulation of <b>flood</b> data having the same record length as the observed data was made to test the possibility that deviation of the proposed <b>flood</b> frequency distribution from observed <b>flood</b> frequency data might be due to randomness.
