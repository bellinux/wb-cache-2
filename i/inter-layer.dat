The pressure on ice deeper than 50m causes plastic flow. At the molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers.

25|$|Avalanche {{formation}} {{requires a}} slope shallow enough for snow to accumulate but steep {{enough for the}} snow to accelerate once {{set in motion by}} the combination of mechanical failure (of the snowpack) and gravity. The angle of the slope that can hold snow, called the angle of repose, depends on a variety of factors such as crystal form and moisture content. Some forms of drier and colder snow will only stick to shallower slopes, while wet and warm snow can bond to very steep surfaces. In particular, in coastal mountains, such as the Cordillera del Paine region of Patagonia, deep snowpacks collect on vertical and even overhanging rock faces. The slope angle that can allow moving snow to accelerate depends on a variety of factors such as the snow's shear strength (which is itself dependent upon crystal form) and the configuration of layers and <b>inter-layer</b> interfaces.|$|E

40|$|The {{criteria}} of separation and dislocation of the layered roof in mining are put forward through the simplified mechanical model with weak <b>inter-layers.</b> Considering five different variables, namely {{the number of}} layers, {{the distance from the}} weak <b>inter-layers</b> to the mine opening, the thickness of the weak <b>inter-layers,</b> the lateral pressure coefficient and the spacing of the bedding planes, the distribution characteristics of the pressure-arch in the horizontal stratified rocks are analyzed during coal mining using FLAC 3 D. The results show that the newly appeared pressure-arch is composed of the original pressure-arch in each layer and the pressure-arch shape being affected by the weak layer in the surrounding rock of the mine opening. As the distance between the <b>inter-layers</b> and the coal seam increases, the effect on the pressure-arch is reduced gradually. The thinner <b>inter-layers</b> produce greater impact on the pressure-arch. The lateral pressure coefficient has a great influence on the pressure-arch and a stable pressure-arch could only be formed when the lateral pressure coefficient is in a suitable range...|$|R

30|$|Bentonite as a porous {{material}} {{exists in the}} environment in ease and abundance, and montmorillonite {{is the most important}} phase in it (Ahmadi et al. 2017 b). It is a three-layered clay mineral composed of a silica and alumina. Its layers are not electrically neutral and have a negative charge. To overcome the electrical repulsion due to it, the negative charge is established between the layers and a series of positively charged cations fall between that layers, and they are called <b>inter-layers</b> cations (Liu and Zhang 2007). One of the methods for the activation of natural bentonite is activation by strong mineral acids. As a result of the contact between the montmorillonite and sulfuric acids, <b>inter-layers</b> cations are separated and proton is substituted. Activated bentonite is able to degrade a range of water contaminants and industrial wastewaters (Shen 2002). For example, reduction of fluoride(Mahramanliglu et al. 2002), removal of paints (Özcan and Özcan 2004) and removal of organic compounds (Ahmadi and Kord Mostafapour 2017 c) from industrial wastewater.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Thick {{tungsten}} (W) coatings {{are potential}} plasma facing materials in fusion reactors, but {{the coefficient of}} thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between W and Cu or steel substrates leads to large thermally induced stresses and premature failure. While <b>inter-layers</b> can be used to grade and distribute stresses away from a discrete planar W-steel interface, in the present study an alternative approach was used based on patterning of the interface with repeating millimetrescale 3 D features or ìsculpturesî. Up to 2 mm thick W coatings were manufactured directly on water-cooled patterned substrates using vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), without any <b>inter-layers.</b> Synchrotron-based white beam, high energy X-ray diffraction measurements of lattice parameters was used to obtain maps of residual strains and stresses in slices through the VPS W coatings. Residual elastic lattice strains were deduced from energy-dispersive diffraction profiles collected by two detectors mounted in the horizontal and vertical diffraction planes, providing information about lattice strains in two nearly perpendicular directions lying in the plane of the coating. On the basis of these data, maps of residual stresses in the VPS coatings were constructed.
