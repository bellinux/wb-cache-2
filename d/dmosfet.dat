40|$|Trench Double-diffused Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (<b>DMOSFET)</b> is {{a special}} class of {{discrete}} power transistor. It is recognized by its ultra-low on-resistance, due to its special device structure of employing vertical trenches for channel formation. The inversion and accumulation layer mobilities of the trench <b>DMOSFET</b> are important parameters to determine its on-resistance. Extraction of the mobilities is difficult because the carrier flow in the trench <b>DMOSFET</b> is going through different regions {{in addition to the}} channel region. Existing approaches for the extraction of the mobilities suffer from different kinds of discrepancies arising from simulations, use of test structures, or incomplete consideration of all the carrier flow regions. Furthermore, they can be used to extract the inversion layer mobility only, but not the accumulation layer mobility as well. In this thesis, a simple method is proposed and implemented to extract both the inversion and accumulation layer mobilities of electrons in n-channel trench DMOSFETs. First, a new model is developed for the on-resistance of the n-channel trench <b>DMOSFET.</b> The proposed on-resistance model is fitted to the experimental data measured from an experimental n-channel trench <b>DMOSFET</b> by the method of linear least-squares fitting. A very good fit is obtained such that the average percentage error between the model curve and the experimental on-resistance is less than 1 %. The parameters obtained from the fitting are used to calculate the inversion and accumulation layer mobilities as a function {{of a wide range of}} effective electric field. The calculated mobilities agree very well with those previously reported for conventional MOSFETs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Due to {{the high}} {{critical}} field in 4 H-SiC, the drain charge and switching loss densities in a SiC power device are approximately 10 X {{higher than that of}} a silicon device. However, for the same voltage and resistance ratings, the device area is much smaller for the 4 H-SiC device. Therefore, the total drain charge and switching losses are much lower for the 4 H-SiC power device.

Since power {{devices such}} as <b>DMOSFETs</b> will operate at higher {{temperatures}} with accelerated degradation mechanisms, {{it is essential to}} understand the effects of typical operating conditions for power electronics applications. We have found that SiC MOSFETs when gate-biased at 150 °C show an increasing charge pumping current over time, suggesting that interface traps (or perhaps near-interface oxide traps) are being created under these conditions.

40|$|Because of {{its large}} bandgap, its high {{critical}} electric field, and its high quality native SiO 2, silicon carbide {{is considered to}} be the material of choice for power switching electronics in the future. ^ Until 1997 the maximum thickness of commercially available epilayers serving as the drift region for power devices has been limited to 10 – 15 μm, limiting the maximum blocking voltage to 1500 V for vertical power devices in silicon carbide. ^ In this study, we present the first lateral power devices on a semi-insulating vanadium doped substrate of silicon carbide. The first generation of lateral <b>DMOSFETs</b> in 4 H-SiC yielded a blocking voltage of 2. 6 kV—more than twice what was previously reported for any SiC MOSFETs—but suffered from low MOS channel mobility caused by the high anneal temperatures (≥ 1600 °C) required to activate the p-type ion-implant. Combining the high blocking-voltage of the vanadium-doped substrate with the higher MOS mobility previously achieved by an epitaxially-grown accumulation channel leads us to the LACCUFET device: No p-type implant is necessary. This device shows a blocking voltage of 2. 7 kV unmatched by any SiC transistor until February 2000 combined with a much lower specific on-resistance of 3. 6 Ω•cm 2. The ability to combine long-channel test MOSFETs with high channel mobility of 27 cm 2 /(volt·sec) in 4 H-SiC with power devices of 13 cm 2 /(volt·sec) on the same chip has been demonstrated.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on low voltage (∼ 1 kV) 4 H-SiC power <b>DMOSFET</b> design. The {{objective of the}} thesis is to achieve the smallest possible specific onresistance for 1 kV blocking voltage. 4 H-SiC is a wide bandgap (Eg = 3. 3 eV) semiconductor with high critical electric field, which makes it suitable for high voltage, high power applications. The main problem for the 4 H-SiC MOS devices is the low inversion channel mobility, which makes the channel resistance the most dominant component of the total on-resistance. The exceptionally low inversion channel mobility (∼ 20 cm 2 /V-s) is attributed to the high interface state densities near the conduction band edge and the surface roughening caused by high temperature implant annealing. As channel resistance is linearly proportional to both channel mobility and channel length, a self-aligned technology was used to reduce the channel length below 0. 5 μm. The fabricated device on 6 μm epilayer produced a specific on-resistance of 9. 95 mohm-cm 2 for an avalanche breakdown voltage of 900 V. The problem with these devices was the high gate oxide field (6 MV/cm), which implied a poor reliability. To overcome this problem {{as well as to}} reduce the specific on-resistance further, an exhaustive simulation study was done and an optimized <b>DMOSFET</b> structure was proposed. The new design includes a novel highly doped current spreading layer and a highly-doped JFET region to reduce the total on-resistance, and a JFET length of 1 μm was used to reduce the gate oxide field at the onset of avalanche breakdown. Moreover, an alignment tolerance of 0. 5 μm was used to reduce the cell pitch and thereby the specific on-resistance. Electron beam lithography was used to implement these short features. The fabricated device produced a specific on-resistance of 6. 95 mohm-cm 2 for a blocking voltage of 1050 V. The specific on-resistance of the fabricated devices was slightly higher than the simulated result (4. 0 mohm-cm 2) due to unexpectedly high contact resistivities. ...|$|E

Although recent fast I-V {{measurements}} and subthreshold analysis {{reveal that the}} threshold-voltage instability due to low-field bias stressing at room temperature is greater than previously reported when calculated using slower, standard measurements by a parameter analyzer—a result {{that is consistent with}} electrons directly tunneling into and out of near interfacial oxide traps, this effect will not prevent the use of power SiC <b>DMOSFET</b> switches in power converter applications if certain precautions are followed. Namely, if the threshold voltage is set high enough so that a negative shift in threshold voltage will not increase the leakage current in the off-state, then the primary effect will be to increase the on-state resistance by decreasing the effective gate voltage. The instability due to ON-state stressing is greater than that for bias stressing alone, but not significantly. For a well behaved device, a 1 -hour ON-state stress will result in about a 7 percent increase in conduction losses, which is manageable for power converter applications...|$|E

Both devices are based on pn junctions in 4 H-SiC, and are capable of 300 o C operation. The 4 H-SiC JFET showed very predictable, well understood temperature dependent characteristics, because the current conduction depends on the drift of electrons in the bulk region, which is not restricted by traps in the MOS interface or at the pn junctions. On the other hand, in a 4 H-SiC <b>DMOSFET,</b> electrons must flow through the MOS inversion layer with a very high interface state density. At high temperatures, the transconductance of the device improves and threshold voltage shifts negative because less electrons are trapped in the interface states, resulting in a much lower MOS channel resistance.

40|$|We present {{detailed}} physics based numerical {{models for}} characterizing 4 H-Silicon Carbide lateral MOSFETs and vertical power DMOSFETs for high temperature, high field, DC, AC and transient switching operating conditions. A complete 2 -D Drift-Diffusion based device simulator {{has been developed}} specifically for SiC MOSFETs, to evaluate device performance {{in a variety of}} operating scenarios, and to extract relevant physical parameters. We have developed and implemented room and high temperature mobility models for bulk phonon and impurity scattering, surface phonon scattering, Coulomb scattering from interface traps, and surface roughness scattering. High temperature models for interface trap density of states and occupation probability of interface traps are also implemented. By rigorous comparison of simulated I-V characteristics to experimental data at high temperatures, physical parameters like interface trap density of states, surface step height, saturation velocity, etc. have been extracted. Insight into relative importance of scattering mechanisms influencing transport in SiC MOSFETs has been provided. We show that the strongest contribution to low current in SiC MOSFETs is from the loss of mobile inversion charge due to large amount of trapping at the interface, and due to very low surface mobility arising due to a rough SiC-SiO 2 interface. We show that surface roughness scattering dominates at high gate biases and is the most important scattering mechanism in 4 H-SiC MOSFETs. Switching characteristics of SiC lateral MOSFETs have been modeled and simulated using our custom device simulator. A comprehensive generation-recombination model for interaction between inversion layer electrons and interface traps has been developed. Using this model, we have modeled the time-dependent occupation of interface traps spread inside the SiC bandgap. We have measured the transient characteristics of these devices, and compare our simulation to experiment and have extracted capture cross-sections of interface traps. Using the coupled experiment and modeling approach, we are able to distinguish between fast interface traps and slow oxide traps, and explain how they contribute to threshold voltage instability. High power 4 H-SiC <b>DMOSFET</b> operation in the ON and the OFF states has also been analyzed. We show that in current generation SiC DMOSFETs, the ON resistance is dominated by the channel resistance instead of the drift-layer resistance. This makes the design of SiC DMOSFETs far from ideal. OFF state blocking capability and breakdown due to impact ionization of the DMOSFETs are also modeled and simulated. We show that the 4 H-SiC DMOSFETs have excellent leakage characteristics and can support extremely high OFF state drain voltages...|$|E
