40|$|Revised October 2002 When {{should a}} buyer award a {{procurement}} contract through competitive bidding, and when would {{negotiating with the}} sellers be preferred? To {{shed some light on}} this question, we examine a unique data set of non-residential, private sector building contracts awarded in Northern California during the years 1995 - 2000. Our analysis suggests a number of limitations to the use of auctions, as compared to negotiations, that we believe are new to the literature. First, auctions perform poorly when projects are complex and contractual design is incomplete. Second, the benefits to auctions fall when the number of available bidders decreases. Third, auctions stifle communication between the buyer and the contractor, preventing the buyer from taking advantage of the contractor’s expertise when choosing how to design the project. Finally, auctions fail to protect the privacy of the buyer and involve increased administrative expenses and <b>delay.</b> <b>Working</b> Papers Index...|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, when {{interpreting}} AMS {{data from}} sediment cores, {{it is necessary}} to examine the influence of sampling using sample coordinates. AMS of sediment cores may not necessarily reflect sedimentary environments such as paleocurrent directions or tectonic stress directions. The composition and performance of core liners should be carefully examined to avoid deformation of sediments. Our comparison of down-core magnetic susceptibility variations between the piston and gravity cores revealed over-sampling and under-sampling of the piston cores. It is noteworthy that under-sampling can occur in the uppermost few meters of piston cores; Skinner and McCave (2003) mentioned a possibility of only over-sampling for a piston core. We believe that under-sampling of our piston cores was due to <b>delayed</b> <b>working</b> of the piston at the sediment/water interface.|$|R

Studies on this topic have been limited to processes in local circuitshowever, cognition involves large-scale brain systems with multiple interacting regions. A prominent feature of the human brainʼs global architecture is the anticorrelation of default-mode vs. task-positive systems. Here, we show that administration of an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, disrupted the reciprocal relationship between these systems in terms of task-dependent activation and connectivity during performance of <b>delayed</b> <b>working</b> memory. Furthermore, the degree of this disruption predicted task performance and transiently evoked symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia. We offer a parsimonious hypothesis for this disruption via biophysically realistic computational modeling, namely cortical disinhibition.

40|$|In {{long-term}} memory, negative {{information is}} better remembered than neutral information. Differences in processes important to working memory {{may contribute to}} this emotional memory enhancement. To examine {{the effect that the}} emotional content of stimuli has on working memory performance, the authors asked partici-pants to perform working memory tasks with negative and neutral stimuli. Task accuracy was unaffected by the emotional content of the stimuli. Reaction times also did not differ for negative relative to neutral words, but on an n-back task using faces, participants were slower to respond to fearful faces than to neutral faces. These results suggest that although emotional content does not have a robust effect on working memory, in some instances emotional salience can impede working memory performance. Memory is often divided into the ability to retain information over short <b>delays</b> (<b>working</b> memory) and long delays (long-term memory). A critical question for understanding the relation between emotion and memory {{is the extent to which}} the emotional content of the to-be-retained information influences these forms of memory. Abundant evidence suggests that emotional content increases the likelihood that indi-viduals retain information over long delays. This emotional memory enhancement effect has been dem-onstrated in numerous studies, using stimuli that have included pictures, words, stories, and narrated slide shows (see Buchanan & Adolphs, 2003; Dolan, 2002; Hamann, 2001, for reviews). The effect of emotional content on working memory processes remains un-known.

40|$|The {{performance}} of memory-guided saccades with two different delays (3 and 30 s of memorization) was studied in seven healthy subjects. Double-pulse {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (dTMS) with an interstimulus interval of 100 ms was applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) early (1 s after target presentation) and late (28 s after target presentation). Early stimulation significantly increased in both delays the percentage of error in amplitude (PEA) of contralateral memory-guided saccades compared to the control experiment without stimulation. dTMS applied late in the delay had no significant effect on PEA. Furthermore, we found a significantly smaller effect of early stimulation in the long-delay paradigm. These results suggest a time-dependent hierarchical organization of the spatial working memory with a functional dominance of DLPFC during the early memorization, independent from the memorization delay.

Analyses compared groups on these cognitive outcomes and examined whether psychological distress mediated group differences in cognition. Results indicated that caregivers were significantly more distressed than non-caregivers and exhibited deficits in learning, recall of episodic information after short and long <b>delays,</b> and <b>working</b> memory. Furthermore, the majority of group differences in cognitive outcomes were mediated by psychological distress.

The effect of CGP- 37849, unlike those of surgical lesions and of AP 5, was not stimulus-specific and therefore cannot be solely attributed to blockade of NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus.

40|$|One of {{the first}} {{cognitive}} dysfunctions to arise with aging is memory loss, affecting an estimated 85 % of elderly in the U. S. {{over the age of}} 80 with Age Associated Memory Impairment. A common feature in humans and animals experiencing memory loss with aging is the decline in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptorbinding densities in the brain. Variability in the effects of aging on the GluN 1 subunit suggests that inflammation {{may play a role in}} NMDA receptor aging. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, on spatial long-term & short-term memory and cognitive flexibility in male C 57 BL/ 6 mice from four different age groups (5, 14, 20, and 26 months of age at the end of testing). Mice were fed either Ibuprofen (375 ppm) in NIH 31 diet or NIH 31 diet alone for 6 weeks prior to testing. This dose had been shown to reduce pathology in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. Behavioral testing using the Morris Water Maze showed a significant effect of age on acquisition of spatial reference memory, the formation of spatial memory bias in probe trials, cognitive flexibility in reversal trials, and working memory, with 20 and 26 month old mice performing significantly worse than 5 month old mice. Ibuprofen enhanced overall performance in the working memory task when data was collapsed across naïve and test trials and ages. The oldest mice receiving ibuprofen showed significantly better <b>delayed</b> <b>working</b> memory, but near significantly (p= 0. 08) worse spatial reference memory, as compared to age-matched controls. In situ hybridization assays showed significant decreases over all ages in the mRNA densities for the GluN 2 B subunit, all GluN 1 splice variants, and the GluN 1 - 1 splice forms in the frontal lobes of mice consuming ibuprofen. The GluN 1 - 3 splice form mRNA was significantly increased across ages in the frontal lobes of the ibuprofen-treated mice. There was no effect of ibuprofen on IL- 1 beta expression in the brains or spleens of these mice. These findings suggest that inflammation may play a role in working memory declines in aged animals, but the reducing effects of ibuprofen across ages on several factors, without reducing age-related increases in cytokine expression suggests that ibuprofen has effects on mRNA for the NMDA receptor that are unrelated to aging or inflammation...|$|R
