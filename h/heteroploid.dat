40|$|The {{perception}} of African nightshades (Solanum section Solanum) as “healthy ” foods, supported by documentation {{of their high}} nutri-tional and medicinal benefits, {{has led to a}} sudden and steady upsurge in their consumption, demand and monetary value in Africa and most parts of South-East Asia. However, due to very low leaf yields, production of these vegetables remains on small-scales, resulting in acute shortages and escalating prices, especially in urban areas. Apart from local variants or landraces selected in some regions where these plants are utilized as food and/or medicinal plants, there are no improved cultivars developed through conventional plant breeding techniques. Species belonging to this section, generally referred to as “Solanum nigrum-complex ” are predominantly autogamous, favour-ing production of many small fruits and seeds, which compete with leaves for photosynthates. S. nigrum-complex constitutes a polyploid series, with diploid (2 n= 2 x= 24), tetraploid (2 n= 4 x= 48), hexaploid (2 n= 6 x= 72) and rarely, octoploid (2 n= 8 x= 96) species, a trait that can be exploited for cultivar development. This review outlines the possible evolutionary mechanisms and modes of origin of the polyploids, breeding strategies to produce <b>heteroploids</b> such as triploid (2 x= 3 x= 36), pentaploid (2 n= 5 x= 60) and heptaploid (2 n= 7 x= 84) from existing or induced polyploids and envisaged advantageous properties of the novel polyploids or <b>heteroploids</b> over their wild-type progenitors.

Whereas this is valid for most types of retinal neurons, chicken horizontal cells are generated by delayed non-apical mitoses from dedicated progenitors. The regulation of such final cell cycle is not well understood and we have studied how Lim 1 expressing horizontal progenitor cells (HPCs) exit the cell cycle. We have used markers for S- and G 2 /M-phase in combination with markers for cell cycle regulators Rb 1, cyclin B 1, cdc 25 C and p 27 Kip 1 to characterise the final cell cycle of HPCs. The results show that Lim 1 + HPCs are heterogenic with regards to when and during what phase they leave the final cell cycle. Not all horizontal cells were generated by a non-apical (basal) mitosis; instead, the HPCs exhibited three different behaviours during the final cell cycle. Thirty-five percent of the Lim 1 + horizontal cells was estimated to be generated by non-apical mitoses. The other horizontal cells were either generated by an interkinetic nuclear migration with an apical mitosis or by a cell cycle with an S-phase that was not followed by any mitosis.

The research was conducted to explore whether DNA ploidy could be the prognostic indicator of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Xinjiang Uygur women. Methods: Case data and cervical exfoliated cell samples from 326 Uygur women. The DNA ploidy was analyzed by flow cytometry. The flow-through hybridization and gene chip (FHGC) for HPV type test then divided the cases into negative HPV group, non high-risk HPV infection group, single high-risk HPV infection group, and multiple high-risk HPV infection group. Lastly, 113 cases from 273 HPV infection cases were followed up. Results: The 16 -type HPV had the highest rate in all genotypes infection; 16 / 18 -type HPV mixed infection {{was the most common}} type in multiple high-risk HPV infection group. Abnormal DNA ploidy happened along with the seriousness of HPV infection. Compared with the HPV negative group, DNA <b>heteroploid</b> appeared 12. 750 times and 22. 705 times, respectively, in single high-risk HPV and multiple high-risk HPV infection groups.

There was no noticeable difference between C 32 -r 7 and its derivative C 32 -r 7 -nu- 1, which implied that transplantation into nude mice did not alter the expression of SCE in this subline. -JNCI 1981; 66 : 273 - 277.

Significant differences in the amounts of cellular glycoproteins, proteins, and RNA present in microexudates were found between different cell types and between cells of the same type at different stages of growth. Inoculation of cells onto substrates "coated" with microexudates altered their growth behavior. Microexudates from exponentially growing subconfluent homotypic and heterotypic cell populations enhanced the growth of mouse and chick embryo cells seeded at very low densities, but similar microexudates had no effect on the proliferation of cells seeded at higher densities. The enhanced growth of low-density cell populations seeded on microexudates was compared with the growth enhancement produced by feeder cell layers and conditioned medium...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} pore {{complexes}} per nucleus was determined {{for a wide}} variety of cultured cells selected for their variable DNA content over a range of 1 - 5, 600. The pore number was compared to DNA content, nuclear surface area, and nuclear volume. Values for pore frequency (pores/square micrometer) were relatively constant in the species studied. When the pore to DNA ratio was plotted against the DNA content, there was a remarkable correlation which decreased exponentially for the cells of vertebrate origin. Exceptions were the <b>heteroploid</b> mammalian ceils which had the same ratio as the diploid mammalian cells despite higher DNA content. The results are interpreted to mean that neither the nuclear surface, the nuclear volume, nor the DNA content alone determines the pore number of the nucleus, but rather an as yet undetermined combination of different factors. The surface and the volume of vertebrate nuclei do not decrease with decreasing DNA content below a given value. The following speculation is suggested to account fo...|$|E
30|$|Regardless of {{cellular}} heterogeneity, inherited down-regulation and/or absence of CKs and EpCAM [4, 59], {{as well as}} CTC size variation ranging from similar or smaller than WBCs up to large tumor cells [6, 10, 12], SE-iFISH® enables expeditious detection of CTCs, DTCs and CTMs in regard to efficient enrichment, identification and classification of hypotonic-free, heterogeneous subpopulations of non-hematopoietic <b>heteroploid</b> cancer cells. Our previous and on-going studies showed that those CTCs could be shed from various types of epithelial solid tumor, including lung, glioma, melanoma, osteosarcoma, pheochromocytoma, parathyroid, esophageal, breast, pancreatic, gastric, colon, cervical, ovarian, bladder, renal cell and HCCs in murine or patient’s peripheral blood, or disseminated in bone marrow, CSF, urine, malignant pleural effusion or ascites, despite existence of numerous CK positive mesothelial cells. Obtained viable and native tumor cells free of antibody perturbing are eligible for subsequent primary tumor cell culture (unpublished results) or genetic analyses performed on individual CTC. Successful EGFR mutation analysis performed on the single laser capture micro-dissected (LCM) lung cancer CTC enriched from patients has been recently published [58].|$|E
40|$|The diVerent {{subspecies}} of Phytophthora alni, P. alni subsp. alni (Paa), P. alni subsp. uniformis (Pau), and P. alni subsp. multiformis (Pam), are {{recent and}} widespread pathogens of alder in Europe. They {{are believed to}} be a group of emergent <b>heteroploid</b> hybrids between two phylogenetically close Phytophthora species. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analyses were performed, using a broad collection of P. alni and two closely related species, P. cambivora and P. fragariae. Paa possesses three diVerent alleles for each of the nuclear genes we studied, two of which are present in Pam as well, whereas the third matches the single allele present in Pau. Moreover, Paa displays common mtDNA patterns with both Pam and Pau. A combination of the data suggests that Paa may have been generated on several occasions by hybridization between Pam and Pau, or their respective ancestors. Pau might have P. cambivora as a species ancestor, whereas Pam seems to have either been generated itself by an ancient reticulation or by autopolyploidization. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|We {{isolated}} two novel {{cell lines}} from {{different types of}} sporadic human malignant melanoma: the hmel 1 line was obtained from a melanoma skin metastasis and the hmel 9 cell line from a primary superficial spreading melanoma. The karyotype and pigmentation parameters were assessed in these cell lines. Cytogenetic analysis in early stages of culture revealed that both cell lines had chromosome instability and simultaneous growth of <b>heteroploid</b> subpopulations. The molecular analysis of some genes involved in melanoma showed that both cell lines harbor BRAF mutations. The unpigmented hmel 1 and the pigmented hmel 9 lines were found to express the tyrosinase gene. The tyrosine hydroxylase activity was detectable only in hmel 9 cells and practically absent in the hmel 1 cell line. This activity {{was found to be}} correlated with the relative tyrosinase protein amount in both melanoma cell lines. The biological behaviour in the two melanoma cell lines, derived from two different types of melanoma lesions displaying distinct clinical and histopathological features, confirms the heterogeneous characteristics of sporadic melanoma. Similarities and/or differences between cell lines extracted from different melanoma cases could be useful in the future for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic purposes...|$|E
40|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is {{the most}} common {{malignancy}} in children. The most important examination at the time of diagnosis includes karyotype of leukemic cells which divides patients into prognostic groups according to cytogenetic finding. In up to 90 % of patients the chromosomal aberrations with well known clinical significance are designated. One of cytogenetic type is high hyperdiploid ALL (51 - 68 chromosomes) associated with favorable prognosis. Nevertheless, relapses of the disease occur even in these children. One possible reason why this happens could be an increased genomic instability of leukemic cells that causes cryptic structural rearrangements. In a retrospective study, we examined a total of 232 children with newly diagnosed B-ALL using conventional cytogenetic analyses and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) with a panel of DNA probes (Abbott Vysis) in order to detect <b>heteroploid</b> cells. In patients with suspect cryptic structural chromosome aberrations, we analyzed the karyotypes in detail by multicolor FISH and multicolor banding (mFISH/mBAND; MetaSystems). The extent of aberrations was determined by comparative genomic hybridization on BAC arrays (array CGH; BlueGnome). Cell clones with high hyperdiploid karyotype were detected in a total of 102 children (44 %). In [...] ...|$|E
