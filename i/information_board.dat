In January 2007, children from Overchurch Junior School in Upton, Wirral celebrated the life of Brassey. In April 2007 a plaque was placed on Brassey's first bridge at Saughall Massie. In the village of Bulkeley, near Malpas, Cheshire, is a tree called the 'Brassey Oak' on land once owned by the Brassey family. This was planted to celebrate Thomas' 40th birthday in 1845. It was surrounded by four inscribed sandstone pillars tied together by iron rails but due {{to the growth of}} the tree these burst and the stones fell. They were recovered and in 2007 were replaced in a more accessible place with an <b>information</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

25|$|Where Herncliffe Gardens and Eddington Gardens stood, {{there is}} now the 1959 sea wall, beach and undersea mud.

A Council Oyster Bay Trail cycle route, planned in 2009, is named after the area's history. Today there is an established walking route along the 1959 coastal defence; {{it is part of}} the Saxon Shore Way. The committee for Herne Bay Festival 2008 agreed a cross-marketing strategy with Whitstable Oyster Festival, thus recognising the history of dredging off Herne Bay by the oyster fisheries working from Hampton-on-Sea in the 19th century. There is still a very small fleet of day fishing boats operating offshore of the Hampton area, and landing on the beach at Herne Bay.|$|E
500|$|To {{account for}} the {{uncertainty}} regarding the structure's original function, the term [...] "Wheeldale Linear Monument" [...] {{was introduced in the}} 2010s to refer to the structure. English Heritage in 2013 stated that the balance of opinion had swung to favour a prehistoric, rather than Roman, origin for the structure. , the uncertainty regarding the monument's purpose and origin is reflected by the <b>information</b> <b>board</b> {{at the end of the}} Wheeldale section of structure, where it meets the modern road. The original sign, pictured in 1991 states that the structure is a Roman road, whereas new signage installed in 1998 admits that the origin and purpose of the structure are unknown.|$|E

500|$|Greta Hall (see Lake Poets, below), is a Grade I listed building. The home of Coleridge in 1800–04 and Southey from 1803 until 1843, {{it later}} {{became part of}} Keswick School {{and is now in}} private ownership, partly divided into holiday flats. The three-storey house dates to the late 18th century and {{features}} a flush-panelled central double door with Gothic top panels and Venetian windows. A carved oak fireplace inside is dated to 1684. The Moot Hall is a prominent Grade II* listed building situated {{at the southern end of}} Main Street. It was built in 1571 and rebuilt in 1695, and the current building dates to 1813. It is built of lime-washed stone and slate walling, and has a square tower on the north end with a round-arched doorway and a double flight of exterior steps. At the top of the tower is what the Keswick Tourist <b>Information</b> <b>Board</b> describes as an [...] "unusual one-handed clock". Formerly an assembly building, The Moot Hall contains a tourist information centre on the ground floor, with an art gallery on the floor above.|$|E
500|$|Patchway {{railway station}} first opened on 8 September 1863 when {{services}} {{began on the}} Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (BSWUR), which ran from [...] to , north of Bristol {{on the banks of}} the River Severn. At New Passage, passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross the Severn to continue on into Wales. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as single track [...] broad gauge. Patchway was [...] from Temple Meads, adjacent to the Bristol to Gloucester road, what is now the A38 Gloucester Road. The station was only a small structure, and very little is known about it. There were initially six trains per day on weekdays in each direction, with three trains per day on Sundays. The BSWUR was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR), which had from the beginning operated all BSWUR services, in 1868; and in 1873 the line was converted to [...] standard gauge. Although the line made travel from Bristol to Wales easier, the change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient, and so a tunnel was built under the Severn. To cope with the anticipated increase in demand, it was decided that the line should be increased to twin track. However, the gradient between [...] and Patchway, 1 in 68, was considered undesirably steep for trains heading up the hill towards Bristol, particularly for heavy coal trains, and so a three-mile deviation was built with a 1 in 100 gradient between Pilning and a point south of Patchway. Trains uphill towards Bristol would use the new line, while trains downhill towards Wales would continue to use the steeper, original track. The deviation left the two tracks at Patchway at significantly different levels, and so made the original site impractical for a station. The station was rebuilt [...] south along the line at its present site, [...] from Bristol Temple Meads. A boulder and <b>information</b> <b>board</b> marks the site of the original station.|$|E
