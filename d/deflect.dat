40|$|For the {{development}} of the X-ray Free Electron Lasers test facility (SXFEL) at SINAP, ultra-short bunch is the crucial requirement for excellent lasing performance. It's a big challenge for <b>deflecting</b> cavity to measure the length of ultra-short bunch, and higher <b>deflecting</b> gradient is required for higher measurement resolution. X-band travelling wave <b>deflecting</b> structure has features of higher <b>deflecting</b> voltage and compact structure, which is good performance at ultra-short bunch length measurement. In this paper, a new X-band <b>deflecting</b> structure has been designed operated at HEM 11 - 2 pi/ 3 mode. For suppressing the polarization of <b>deflecting</b> plane of the HEM 11 mode, two symmetrical caves are added on the cavity wall to separate two polarized modes.

40|$|<b>Deflecting</b> {{structures}} are used now manly for bunch rotation in emittance exchange concepts, bunch diagnostics {{and to increase}} the luminosity. The bunch rotation is a transformation of a particles distribution in the six dimensional phase space. Together with the expected transformations, <b>deflecting</b> structures introduce distortions due to particularities - aberrations - in the <b>deflecting</b> field distribution. The distributions of <b>deflecting</b> fields are considered with respect to non linear additions, which provide emittance deteriorations during a transformation. The <b>deflecting</b> field is treated as combination of hybrid waves HE 1 and HM_ 1. The criteria for selection and formation of <b>deflecting</b> structures with minimized level of aberrations are formulated and applied to known structures. Results of the study are confirmed by comparison with results of numerical simulations. Comment: 39 pages, 21 figure...|$|R
5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} spate of new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied {{on the strength of}} inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to <b>deflect</b> and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can <b>deflect</b> long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|By 1967 {{the debate}} over ABM systems had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual debate on the topic in {{newspapers}} and magazines. It {{was in the midst}} of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in Test No. 6. Suddenly the Nth Country concept was no longer simply theoretical. McNamara seized on this event as a way to <b>deflect</b> criticism over the lack of deployment while still keeping costs under control. On 18 September 1967, he announced that Nike-X would now be known as Sentinel, and outlined deployment plans broadly following the I-67 concept.|$|E
5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to <b>deflect</b> a test particle from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces <b>deflect</b> all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E
40|$|<b>Deflecting</b> {{cavities}} {{are used}} in particle accelerators for the manipulation of charged particles by <b>deflecting</b> or crabbing (rotating) them. For short deflectors, {{the effect of the}} power coupler on the <b>deflecting</b> field can become significant. The particular power coupler type can introduce multipole rf field components and coupler-specific wakefields. Coupler types that would normally be considered like standard on-cell coupler, waveguide coupler, or mode-launcher coupler could have one or two rf feeds. The major advantage of a dual-feed coupler is the absence of monopole and quadrupole rf field components in the <b>deflecting</b> structure. However, a dual-feed coupler is mechanically more complex than a typical single-feed coupler and needs a splitter. For most applications, <b>deflecting</b> structures are placed in regions where there is small space hence reducing the size of the structure is very desirable. This paper investigates the multipole field components of the <b>deflecting</b> mode in single-feed couplers and ways to overcome the effect of the monopole component on the beam. Significant advances in performance have been demonstrated. Additionally, a novel coupler design is introduced which has no monopole field component to the <b>deflecting</b> mode and is more compact than the conventional dual-feed coupler...|$|R

40|$|The {{observed}} {{properties of}} the six systems generally accepted as gravitational lenses are compared with the properties predicted for the images of point-mass and distributed mass deflectors. Taken as a statistical distribution, {{the characteristics of the}} six known systems strongly suggest the existence of a super-massive black hole as the effective <b>deflecting</b> mass in {{one or more of these}} systems. If the <b>deflecting</b> mass in a gravitational lens is a black hole, the distance to the <b>deflecting</b> mass can be determined directly from the difference in light travel time along the separate image paths. (No direct solution for the distance to the <b>deflecting</b> mass exists when the <b>deflecting</b> mass is a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies). Geometric parallaxes of objects at 1000 Mpc distance are of obvious importance in a wide variety of cosmological studies...|$|R
5|$|During {{test flights}} of the Su-27Ms, {{which began in}} 1988, {{engineers}} discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high angles of attack due to the ineffectiveness of flight control surfaces at low speeds. The decision was therefore made to install thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association in the country's Far East and was {{being used as a}} radar test bed. Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft. Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight cleared. Therefore the aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU. The aircraft was rolled out in May. Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only <b>deflect</b> 15 degrees up or down in the pitch axis, and can <b>deflect</b> together or differentially.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{currents}} induced in the ionosphere generate {{magnetic fields}} (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated {{near where the}} atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can <b>deflect</b> surface magnetic fields {{by as much as}} one degree.
