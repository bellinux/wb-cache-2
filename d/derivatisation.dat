40|$|Due {{to their}} overfunctionality the direct a) regioselective {{esterification}} or b) stereoselective glycosidation of native, i. e. underivatised sugars (Fig. 1. 1. Enzymic <b>derivatisations</b> of D-glucose) poses a particularly challenging problem to synthetic organic chemists. In {{most cases the}} use of suitable protected groups and/or multistep synthetic sequences - all methods of low atom efficiency - provided in the past reasonably practical solutions.    Hydrolytic enzymes such as esterhydrolases (lipases) or glycosidases {{are known for their}} capability of such <b>derivatisations</b> with high regio- and stereoselectivity, respectively. However, successful applications of these transformations were largely limited by the                     a) low solubility of native sugars in non-polar solvents,                          where lipasesdisplay their highest esterification activity                     b) low activity (or inactivity) of glycosidases in organic solvents. In the past the problem was solved partially by using modified sugars like alkyl glycosides and protected sugars, solvents like DMF or pyridine or solubilising agents like phenyl boronic acid. In this work we provide satisfactory solutions for both problems using native sugars throughout in non-toxic solvents. Inspired by the discovery of Prasad and Sørensen [1] that 2 -deoxy-D-ribose and D-ribose can be acylated by Novozym SP 435 ™ in THF, we were able to demonstrate that also hexoses – which are practically insoluble in such organic solvents – can be esterified with high regioselectivity and excellent yields. Similarly, direct glycosylations via reverse hydrolysis of native, unprotected D-glucose were achieved by compromising the low solubility of these materials in organic solvents with the need of glucosidases for a microaqueous environment for activity. This way we were able to produce b-glycosides in stoichiometric reactions with up to 50 % yield. Yields of this magnitude were previously only achieved with excess of one reaction partner and the use of activated glycosides...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{oxidative}} coupling of H-phosphonate and H phosphonothioate diesters with different alcohols and amines are presented. Since the reactions with alcohols previously {{have been particularly}} unfavourable due to competing side reactions, a modified protocol leading to high coupling yields of structurally diverse hydroxylic components was developed. The phosphorylation reaction was studied using 31 P NMR spectroscopy {{and for the first}} time the previously only postulated reactive intermediate involved in these reactions was observed. The use of iodine in combination with a bulky chlorosilane in pyridine was found to have a profound effect on both the suppression of side reactions and the rate of the oxidative couplings, and led to a clean formation of phosphorylated products in high yields. This synthetic protocol was then extended to include coupling reactions with bis-functional reagents containing hexamethylene linkers to provide handles for <b>derivatisations</b> of oligonucleotides. A synthetic protocol consisting of the stereospecific oxidative coupling of amines with H-phosphonate diesters to produce phosphoroamidates was designed in such a way that it permitted control of the stereochemical outcome of the reactions.

Chapter 2 showcases a one-pot isothiourea-catalysed Michael addition-lactamisation using cheap and readily available starting materials (carboxylic acids) and easily prepared α,β-unsaturated ketimines via an ammonium enolate intermediate to give dihydropyridinones with high diastereo- and enantioselectivity (typically > 90 : 10 dr, up to 99 % ee). The resultant dihydropyridinones can be successfully derivatised into multiple products without erosion of stereointegrity. In chapter 3 the same concept has also been applied to the synthesis of planar molecules by using (phenylthio) acetic acid as a suiTable ammonium enolate precursor. Generation of an ammonium enolate using an achiral isothiourea (DHPB) and reaction with α,β-unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones allows an isothiourea-mediated Michael addition / lactonisation / thiophenol elimination cascade reaction for the formation of 4, 6 -disubstituted and 3, 4, 6 -trisubstituted 2 -pyrones in good to excellent yields (61 - 99 %). Notably this method allows low catalyst loadings of 1 % to be used.

S,S-diphenyl sulfimide (Ph 2 SNH) has been employed in current investigations divided in three different directions, concerning hydrogen bonding motifs of new sulfimide systems, polymorphism of trans- Cu(Ph 2 SNH) 2 Cl 2 as well as carboxylations of Ph 2 SNH. The isomorphic analogues of [Mn(Ph 2 SNH) 6]Cl 2 and [Co(Ph 2 SNH) 6]Cl 2 were synthesised as parent systems, with their <b>derivatisations</b> by metathesis to give BF 4 and PF 6 salts. The BF 4 daughter systems displayed face on and snug fit hydrogen bonding motifs in the Mn(II) and Co(II) variants respectively. The PF 6 analogues were the first examples to have spectator sulfimide units not participating in hydrogen bonds, rationalised as means to relief steric constrains. [Co(Ph 2 SNH) 4]SO 4 was observed to be stabilised by the formation of l-D hydrogen bond array between the unsaturated complex centres with SO 4 anions. The square planar polymorph of trans- Cu(Ph 2 SNH) 2 Cl 2 has recently been observed to display reversible mechanochromism when ground. The yielding of a green ground collective was reasoned as {{the formation of an}} amorphous conformer closely related to the green pseudotetrahedral polymorph.

40|$|Nature employs dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) as a C 3 -building {{block for}} {{carbohydrate}} synthesis via enzyme catalyzed aldol reactions. Accordingly many groups focussed on broadening {{the scope of}} that enzyme catalyzed reaction. On the other hand a chiral, synthetic DHAP equivalent would not only be suitable for aldol type reactions but would open up {{the possibility of a}} wide range of stereoselective <b>derivatisations.</b> We found, that condensation of commercially available 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -one with (S) - 1 -amino- 2 -methoxymethylpyrrolidine (SAMP) to the respective SAMP-hydrazone proved to be an excellent platform for general asymmetric synthesis. Consequently in 1989 we published a stereoselective a-alkylation of the respective SAMP-hydrazone followed by oxidative auxiliary cleavage to the corresponding chiral, a-substituted acetonide protected ketodiols with good yields and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Since we were looking for new synthetically challenging and pharmacologically interesting targets, we thought about investigating the development of a new reliable method for the asymmetric synthesis of 2 -methyl substituted 1, 3 -diols. Therefore, a novel asymmetric synthesis of pseudo C 2 -symmetric, 2 -methyl substituted 1, 3 -diols was developed. Virtually diastereo- and enantiomerically pure 4, 6 -disubstituted 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -ones were synthesized based on the SAMP/RAMP-hydrazone method in moderate to good overall yields starting from 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -one-SAMP-hydrazone. a-Substituted ketones were converted into methylenated, 4, 6 -disubstituted 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -ones by epimerization-free Wittig-reaction in good to excellent yields. Hydrogenation led to 4, 6 -disubstituted 2, 2, 5 -trimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxanes in good to excellent yields by using PtO 2 ·H 2 O as well as Wilkinson´s catalyst. Finally, hydrolytic cleavage was demonstrated to afford the deprotected, pseudo C 2 -symmetric diols in almost quantitative yield (de >= 96 %; ee >= 98 %). However, if two different substituents R were introduced, again virtually diastereo- and enantiomericially pure acetonide protected keto diols and exo-methylene derivatives could be obtained with very good chemical yields, but the stereoselective hydrogenation could only be conducted with a diastereomeric excess up to 88 % (>= 96 %). A modification of that method to the monoalkylated, exo-methylene derivatives did open up the possibility for the stereoselective hydrogenation of the prochiral double bond to give acetonide protected diols in excellent yields (de up to 90 % (>= 96 %), ee = 90 - 94 %). Again, subsequent hydrolytic cleavage was demonstrated to obtain the deprotected diols in very good yields. As the double allylic alcohol moiety is a crucial structural feature of many natural products, found for example in metabolites of marine sponges and microorganisms with ionophoric activity, a further extension of the method would make those compounds easily available. Therefore, a straight forward five step synthesis of monoprotected, double allylic alcohols with very good overall yields and enantiomeric excesses (ee = 90 - 94 %) was developed, which allow for an enantioselective approach to these versatile building blocks for asymmetric synthesis. Another application of the basic methodology has been shown by the diastereoselective synthesis of acetonide protected, 1, 3 -syn-diols by utilizing the respective achiral N,N-dimethylhydrazone as starting material. The protected ketodiols have then been olefinated and hydrogenated to give 2 -methyl substituted 1, 3 -syn-diols in good yields and diastereomeric excesses up to 90 % (>= 96 %). The current research is directed towards the asymmetric synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides and is most focused on the synthesis of neplanocin A analogues which shows remarkable high antitumor activity. Hence, a four step asymmetric synthesis of cyclic olefins was developed. Starting again from the respective SAMP-hydrazone, the a-substituted keto diols were synthesized in good yields over two steps and very good enantiomeric excesses (ee = 96 %) using olefinic electrophiles for the stereoselective a-alkylation and utilizing aqueous oxalic acid for hydrolytic auxiliary cleavage. After Wittig-olefination, the cyclic olefins were obtained with very good yields by ring closing metathesis (RCM) using first generation Grubbs catalyst. Following the described synthesis route, a deoxyneplanocin A analogue should be obtaind by using a serin derived, nitrogen containing, chiral eletrophile. Besides, neplanocin A analogue should be obtained by an aldol route starting from the respective SAMP-hydrazone and adjacent ring closing metathesis (RCM). In summary, we have developed a novel and efficient method for the stereoselective synthesis of pseudo C 2 -symmetric as well as mono- and bisalkylated 2 -methyl substituted 1, 3 -diols starting from commercially available 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -one and employing the SAMP/RAMP-hydrazone method as stereoselective key step with very good to excellent asymmetric induction or utilizing the respective N,N-dimethylhydrazone as starting material with high diastereoselectivity. This method has been extended to an efficient five step asymmetric synthesis of monoprotected, double allylic alcohols in good overall yields and very good enantiomeric excesses. Furthermore, the asymmetric synthesis of 2 -hydroxymethyl- 3 -hydroxy cyclic olefins with very good yields and enantiomeric excesses has been developed and will be used as the basis for neplanocin A analogues synthesis...|$|R

Results: The LC/IRMS technique provided excellent precision (± 0. 08 ‰ and ± 3. 1 ‰ at natural abundance and enrichment levels, respectively) for the glucose standards and this technique proved to be superior to GC/IRMS (± 0. 62 ‰ and ± 19. 8 ‰ at natural abundance and enrichment levels, respectively). For GC/IRMS measurements the <b>derivatisation</b> correction and the conversion of carbohydrates into CO 2 had a considerable effect on the measured δ 13 C values. However, we did not find any significant differences in the accuracy of the two techniques over the full range of natural δ 13 C abundances and 13 C-labelled glucose. The difference in the performance of GC/IRMS and LC/IRMS diminished when the δ 13 C values were measured in natural samples, because the chromatographic performance and background correction became critical factors, particularly for LC/IRMS. The <b>derivatisation</b> of carbohydrates for the GC/IRMS method was complete. Conclusions: Although both LC/IRMS and GC/IRMS are reliable techniques for compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis of carbohydrates (provided that <b>derivatisation</b> is complete and the calibration requirements are met), LC/IRMS is the technique of choice. The reasons for this are the improved precision, simpler sample preparation, and straightforward isotopic calibration...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} gas chromatography/isotope ratio {{mass spectrometry}} (GC/IRMS) and liquid chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC/IRMS) for {{the measurement of}} δ(13) C values in carbohydrates. Contrary to GC/IRMS, no <b>derivatisation</b> is needed for LC/IRMS analysis of carbohydrates.

30|$|When {{comparing}} the different <b>derivatisation</b> agents, Henneken et al. (Henneken et al. 2006) established {{that even though}} some of the established methods endorsed by agencies, such as the OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1989 a; Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1989 b) uses 2 -PP; <b>derivatisation</b> by MAMA and MPP achieves greater stability and sensitivity. Moreover, 2 -PP also demonstrates stability problems if not properly stored before sampling (Streicher et al. 1996).|$|E
40|$|An {{optimisation}} of <b>derivatisation</b> {{methods for}} the simultaneous determination of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in water by solid-phase extraction (SPE) gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) {{was developed in}} this study. Seven highly potent EDCs including 17 β-estradiol (E 2), estrone (E 1), 16 α-hydroxyestrone, 17 α-ethynylestradiol (EE 2), bisphenol A, 4 -nonylphenol and 4 -tert-octylphenol were selected as the target compounds. The SPE technique, followed by the <b>derivatisation</b> with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) {{was used for the}} extraction recoveries of compounds from water and effluent samples. The stability of the silylation derivatives under different reaction conditions was investigated. The combined use of BSTFA and pyridine as <b>derivatisation</b> reagents, together with the use of hexane as the final solvent, was preferred in order to generate more stable derivatives of EDCs. The relative response factor (RRF) of all derivatives except that of EE 2 was stable 120 h after <b>derivatisation.</b> The addition of pyridine as <b>derivatisation</b> reagent with BSTFA can prevent the conversion of EE 2 to other products during the reaction. Several parameters that may affect the recovery of EDCs, such as the SPE flow rate, and water properties including aquatic colloid content and surfactant concentration were tested. The results showed that the flow rate (1 – 25 mL min− 1), colloid concentration (0 – 50 mg L− 1) and surfactants concentration (0 – 10 μg L− 1) did not cause significant decrease in the EDCs recovery...|$|E
40|$|<b>Derivatisation</b> of the avermectines {{ivermectin}} (IVM), doramectin (DOR), abamectin (ABA) and eprinomectin (EPR), and the milbemycin moxidectin (MOX) to fluorescent derivatives {{is commonly}} used for quantitative analysis at relevant levels using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. Problems associated with the differences in reactivity towards <b>derivatisation</b> (EPM) and limited stability of the derived products (IVM, DOR, ABA) may seriously hamper {{the applicability of the}} method and the reliability of the obtained results. A study was performed to obtain more insight in this <b>derivatisation</b> process from an organic chemistry point of view. This study demonstrated the occurrence of two main fluorescent derivatives: the trifluoroacetyl esters (flu-TFA) and the derivatives with a free hydroxy group at the glycosidic ring (flu-OH). Optimisation of the <b>derivatisation</b> conditions resulted in a fast and reproducible formation of the fluorescent derivatives for all analytes including EPM. The improved procedure involves the addition of 1 -methylimidazole (MI), trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA), triethylamine (TEA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) with a subsequent incubation for 30 min at 70 °C. With this procedure for IVM, DOR and ABA flu-TFA derivatives are obtained instead of flu-OH derivatives as generally described in literature. The <b>derivatisation</b> is reproducible in different milk samples and the derivatives proved to be stable for at least 80 h at room temperature. Using the optimised procedure a limit of detection (LoD) of 0. 1 ¿g kg¿ 1 in milk was readily obtained...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} {{for the analysis}} of phenolic acids in plasma based on ion-pairing ‘Micro-extraction in packed sorbent’ (MEPS) coupled on-line to in-liner derivatisation-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The ion-pairing reagent served a dual purpose. It was used both to improve extraction yields of the more polar analytes and as the methyl donor in the automated in-liner <b>derivatisation</b> method. In this way, a fully automated procedure for the extraction, <b>derivatisation</b> and injection {{of a wide range of}} phenolic acids in plasma samples has been obtained. An extensive optimisation of the extraction and <b>derivatisation</b> procedure has been performed. The entire method showed excellent repeatabilities of under 10 % and linearities of 0. 99 or better for all phenolic acids. The limits of detection of the optimised method for the majority of phenolic acids were 10 ng/mL or lower with three phenolic acids having less-favourable detection limits of around 100 ng/mL. Finally, the newly developed method has been applied in a human intervention trial in which the bioavailability of polyphenols from wine and tea was studied. Forty plasma samples could be analysed within 24 h in a fully automated method including sample extraction, <b>derivatisation</b> and gas chromatographic analysis...|$|E
