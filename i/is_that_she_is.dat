5|$|Grace's (Debra Messing) {{pregnancy}} prompts Karen (Megan Mullally) {{to have a}} baby of her own. She pays a surrogate, Cricket (Wanda Sykes), {{to carry}} her child. Grace, who is bewildered at the idea of Karen having a baby, suspects that the only reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> having one. Karen, however, dismisses the idea. Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child. This prompts Cricket to quit and Karen revealing to Grace that the only reason she wanted a baby was to help her marriage. She also admits that she has thought about leaving her husband.|$|E
25|$|The legendary Semiramis {{is usually}} {{considered}} a purely mythical figure; however, {{there is evidence}} in Assyrian records suggesting that she may, in fact, be a Greek reflection of Shammuramat. This identification is disputed. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> given that title after death to reflect similarities with an earlier Sumerian deity.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{argument}} against Meritaten either as Krauss's pro tempore Ankh-et-kheprure before marriage to Smenkhkare or as Akhenaten's coregent King Neferneferuaten <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> well attested as wife and queen to Smenkhkare. For {{her to have}} later ruled as king means necessarily, and perhaps incredibly for her subjects, that she stepped down from King {{to the role of}} King's Wife. This view places Smenkhkare after Neferneferuaten which requires the Meryre depiction to be drawn 5–6 years after the 'Durbar' depiction it is alongside and several years after work on tombs had stopped.|$|E
25|$|Among Bohnhoff's unique {{contributions}} to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a Bahá'í who has had more than three dozen works published in many major and some minor publishing venues and she has written at least 6 full-length novels of her own - four with strong Bahá'í references though mentioning something {{in relation to the}} religion in the others. In combination she has probably subtlety or directly presented themes of the Bahá'í Faith to the widest audience in literature. An anthology of many of her stories was published as I Loved Thy Creation which is available for download for free.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Annette Sefton-Wilcox introduces Rosie Seymour to one of several flats she is minding for a few days. This flat belongs to a Joanna Rupelford, who never seems to be at home (to the point where the labels are still on the pans). In the conversation, it is disclosed that Rosie is an actress with little success behind her (her only role so far being a rabbit in a miserable touring children's production), and no boyfriend, and that she is openly desperate for both. Her one hope <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> down to the last two for a big role as Jane Eyre, but just after Annette leaves, Rosie receives a call from her agent tell her the part went to the other girl.|$|E

In all other respects she is splendid: clever, cheerful, {{straightforward}} and very likeable." [...] According to Galina Vishnevskaya, who knew the Shostakoviches well, this marriage was a very happy one: [...] "It was with her that Dmitri Dmitriyevich finally came to know domestic peace... Surely, she prolonged his life by several years." [...] In November he made his only venture into conducting, conducting {{a couple of his}} own works in Gorky; otherwise he declined to conduct, citing nerves and ill health as his reasons.|$|E
500|$|Mariam is {{an ethnic}} Pashtun born in Herat, 1959 to a Pashtun father. She {{is the child}} of Jalil and Nana born out of the wedlock. She suffers shame {{throughout}} her childhood because of the circumstances of her birth. Khaled Hosseini described her portrayal: [...] "The key word with Mariam <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> isolated {{in every sense of}} the word. She is a woman who is detached from the day-to-day norms of human existence. Really, she just wants connection with another human being." [...] Despite initially resenting Laila, she becomes a [...] "friend and a doting alternative mother" [...] to her through the [...] "common hardship" [...] of being married to the [...] "abusive, psychologically imposing" [...] Rasheed.|$|E

And in my mind, what we realize <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not cold. She is terrified. Scared that if she lets her emotions out, they will overtake her and she will be hurt. And you can’t hate her. Because it's so incredibly human and understandable." [...] Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as [...] "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as [...] "her person". This led to the two being dubbed [...] "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a [...] "honeymoon" [...] together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale.|$|E

500|$|One {{interpretation}} of the lover in this song, {{as well as that}} which features in [...] "She Belongs to Me", <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> Dylan's muse. In each song, the inaccessibility of the lover/muse can be interpreted as Dylan's acknowledgment of his own limitations—limitations that he attempts to overcome in writing the songs. In this interpretation, the final raven image sitting at the window {{can be viewed as a}} symbol of the muse's inaccessibility, and the raven's broken wing a symbol of its wildness. A related interpretation is that the song reflects an artist's [...] "self-awareness through isolation." [...] The line [...] "She knows there's no success like failure, and that failure's no success at all" [...] can be seen as a reflection of the isolation of the American writer.|$|E
500|$|Paige {{has gained}} herself a {{reputation}} as someone who can be [...] "difficult". [...] The Times Brian Logan wrote, [...] "Paige is not exactly known for her humility. In newspaper profiles, that dread word 'difficult' is often applied". On one occasion, she told a male interviewer {{that she was going}} to stop giving interviews to female reporters because, in her own words, [...] "I don't trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with you and then betray it every time". What has been seen as a cold side to her personality was also noted by Logan, but Paige has said that a common misconception of her <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> confident and very serious. [...] Another editor found her [...] "refreshingly down-to-earth" [...] and [...] "very friendly".|$|E
500|$|Conceivably, Olga was {{initially}} either {{open to the}} possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind. Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf Zahle, at the end of October 1925: [...] "My feeling <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not the one she believes—but one can't say she is not as a fact". However, within a month she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, [...] "There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A." [...] Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia. Olga later said she sent the gift and letters [...] "out of pity", and called the claims [...] "a complete fabrication". When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper, Anderson's supporters, Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony. She told her official biographer, [...] "I never received any such telegram." [...] The supposed telegram was never produced by Anderson's supporters, and it has never been found among any of the papers relating to the case. Xenia said, ...|$|E

6000|$|Going {{involved}} {{two things}} that all Ann Veronica's tact had been ineffectual to conceal from her aunt and father. Her usual dignified reserve had availed her nothing. One point <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> to wear fancy dress in the likeness of a Corsair's bride, and the other <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> to spend whatever vestiges of the night remained after the dance was over in London with the Widgett girls and a select party in [...] "quite a decent little hotel" [...] near Fitzroy Square.|$|R
5000|$|The biggest myth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dumb. The second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fragile.

500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} Madonna {{delivered}} a [...] "joyous, unironic, openhearted" [...] show {{rather than a}} cautious performance. According to Tucker, the singer was in [...] "full command"; although the visuals lacked flow, the song transitions meshed [...] "perfectly". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the show a [...] "tribute to Madonna" [...] and a [...] "shameless" [...] promotion of the singer's return to the music scene after directing W.E.: [...] "The message [...] <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> back in business. I suspect she’d settle for a global number one over global harmony". Troy Patterson of Slate wrote that Madonna retained her [...] "greatest marketing agent" [...] title with the show and praised its costumes, sets and the singer's repeated self-referencing. Linda Holmes of NPR said, [...] "What's curious, given how much 'ewww, she's too old' stuff went around on Twitter, is that everything she did Sunday night is exactly what it should mean to age gracefully". Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone called the show a [...] "serious spectacle", and Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called it a [...] "high-concept music video": [...] "Madonna brilliantly manipulates the combined impact of visuals and sonics. The 13-minute performance was an eye-popping marvel". A Huffington Post reviewer wrote, [...] "Love her or hate her, there's no doubt that only Madonna can bring {{a certain level of}} pop flair to a performance". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the show's choreography and cinematography: [...] "With so, so much to look at, Madonna remained the center of attention. That is, until the end, when white light and smoke engulfed her and she dropped down through the stage, out of sight". According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, Madonna controlled her nerves and he liked her selection of songs.|$|E
500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not expect much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the Dark. In the books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter is Delicious, she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

2500|$|John Gill {{mentions}} that in Rabbinic literature Bathsheba {{is supposed to}} have been the granddaughter of Ahitophel.

The assumption is then that these two Eliams are the same person. This would then explain why Ahitophel, one of David's chief advisers, chose the side of Absalom during his rebellion.|$|E
2500|$|Hunt {{says that}} the biggest {{misconception}} people have about her <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> wealthy, though she describes herself as [...] "rich in spirit". Hunt has been true to her belief that wealth is not necessary for happiness and has lived the [...] "writing life" [...] for last two decades. Hunt enjoys the solitude of living on her own and finds that being single means she has encounters and experiences {{that she would not}} have if she were part of a couple, where others might choose not to intrude and where she would have to coordinate her schedule with another. Hunt has lived in Ireland since 1995. She also lives in France, where she owns a home in the countryside about 60 miles from Paris.|$|E
