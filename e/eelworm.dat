Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.

This fungus also traps <b>eelworms.</b> Harposporium anguillulae is one of 26 species in the genus Harposporium in the division Ascomycota.

40|$|Plant {{nematodes}} {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} invertebrates known as round worms, They derive their name from the Greek word 2 ̆ 2 nema, 2 ̆ 2 meaning thread. In literature some authors refer to nematodes as nemas. In England and many parts of the United States, plant-parasitic nematodes are called <b>eelworms.</b> While some damage to plants results from mechanical injury, salivary secretions injected by the nematode into the plant are usually the major cause of damage. Experiments conducted {{in the first part of}} the present century have demonstrated large differences in plant growth in soil infested with nematodes and soil freed of nematodes by chemicals. Any plant subjected to nematode attack is reduced in growth. The most important nematode which attacks and retards the growth of alfalfa in Utah is the stem nematode. This parasite has been reported in most of the major alfalfa-producing counties of the state. In certain areas the nematode is prevalent to such a degree that only resistant varieties can be grown if the crop is to remain for more than two or three years. In other areas stands and yields are reduced in varying degrees. In many additional areas it is not known if the stem nematode is present, since a complete survey of the state has never been made.

D. dipsaci is a migratory endoparasite that has a five-stage lifecycle and the ability to enter into a dormancy stage. D. dipsaci enters through stomata or plant wounds and creates galls or malformations in plant growth. This allows for the entrance of secondary pathogens such as fungi and bacteria. Management of disease is maintained through seed sanitation, heat treatment, crop rotation, and fumigation of fields.

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the county}} is historically pastoral. The soils are mostly clay, meaning that large scale potato production was very difficult, as tractors were not powerful enough to pull the large machinery required to harvest the crop. Around the early 1990s new technology and more powerful machines overcame this problem. Potato production started to increase, fuelled by a few other key factors: The previously pastoral soils had not had potatoes grown in them; consequently they were not infected with <b>eelworm</b> (Heterodera rostochiensis and Heterodera pallida), which in the east of England had to be sprayed against weekly (a large cost). Also, the clay soil produced an unblemished potato of the highest grade. The intensive nature of the crop meant that potatoes could be grown viably on a given field in only one of every five years. Because potato growers always needed more land than they owned, they rented extra. This demand for rental fields {{came at a time}} when the rest of the industry was struggling and in serious decline. The potato farmers' rents of £300-500 per acre (as opposed to normally £80 per acre) were very helpful to many farmers in a difficult period.|$|E
