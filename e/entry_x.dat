50|$|For {{decoding}} a Lehmer code into {{a permutation of}} a given set, {{the latter}} procedure may be reversed: for each <b>entry</b> <b>x,</b> in order from right to left, correct the items to its right by adding 1 to all those (currently) {{greater than or equal}} to x; finally interpret the resulting permutation of {0, 1, … } as sequence numbers (which amounts to adding 1 to each entry if a permutation of {1, 2, … n} is sought). Alternatively the entries of the Lehmer code can be processed from left to right, and interpreted as a number determining the next choice of an element as indicated above; this requires maintaining a list of available elements, from which each chosen element is removed. In the example this would mean choosing element 1 from {A,B,C,D,E,F,G} (which is B) then element 4 from {A,C,D,E,F,G} (which is F), then element 0 from {A,C,D,E,G} (giving A) and so on, reconstructing the sequence B,F,A,G,D,E,C.|$|E

Another method which is in-place, but not really more efficient, is to start with the permutation of {0, 1, … } obtained by representing each object by its mentioned sequence number, and then for each <b>entry</b> <b>x,</b> in order from left to right, correct the items to its right by subtracting 1 from all entries (still) greater than x (to reflect the fact that the object corresponding to x is no longer available). Concretely a Lehmer code for the permutation B,F,A,G,D,E,C of letters, ordered alphabetically, would first give the list of sequence numbers 1,5,0,6,3,4,2, which is successively transformedwhere the final line is the Lehmer code (at each line one subtracts 1 from the larger entries {{to the right of the}} boldface element to form the next line).|$|E

50|$|Jeu de taquin {{can be used}} {{to define}} an {{operation}} on standard Young tableaux of any given shape, which turns out to be an involution, although this is not obvious from the definition. One starts by emptying the square in the top-left corner, turning the tableau into a skew tableau with one less square. Now apply a jeu de taquin slide to turn that skew tableau into a straight one, which will free one square on the outside border. Then fill this square with the negative of the value that was originally removed at the top-left corner; this negated value is considered part of a new tableau rather than of the original tableau, and its position will not change in the sequel. Now as long as the original tableau has some entries left, repeat the operation of removing the <b>entry</b> <b>x</b> of the top-left corner, performing a jeu de taquin slide on what is left of the original tableau, and placing the value −x into the square so freed. When all entries of the original tableau have been handled, their negated values are arranged {{in such a way that}} rows and columns are increasing. Finally one can add an appropriate constant to all entries to obtain a Young tableau with positive entries.|$|E

As an outbreeder, S. hermonthica is highly variable with an extraordinary capacity {{to adapt to}} different hosts and environments, thereby complicating resistance breeding. To study genotype x environment (G x E) interaction for striga resistance and grain yield, nine sorghum lines, 36 F 2 populations and five local checks were grown under striga infestation at two locations in both Mali and Kenya. Mean squares due to genotypes and G x E interaction were highly significant for both sorghum grain yield and area under striga severity progress curve(ASVPC, a measure of striga emergence and vigor throughout the season). For grain yield, the <b>entry</b> <b>x</b> location-within-country interaction explained most of the total G x E while for ASVPC, <b>entry</b> <b>x</b> country and <b>entry</b> <b>x</b> location-within-country interactions were equally important.

The F 2 derived from the cross of the striga-resistant line Framida with the striga-tolerant cultivar Seredo was the superior entry for both grain yield and ASVPC, underlining the importance of combining resistance with tolerance in striga resistance breeding.

To investigate the effects of heterozygosity and heterogeneity on the adaptability of grain sorghum, two sets of material, each containing 12 parent lines, six single-cross hybrids, six two-component blends of parent lines, and six two-component hybrid blends were grown in eight macro-environments in the semi-arid Makueni District of Kenya, during 1991 through 1993. Environmental means for grain yield ranged from 584 to 47 g m- 2. In all environments, hybrids outyielded their parent lines, with a mean relative hybrid superiority of 54 %. Blending effects were non-significant. Combined analyses of variance were computed with logarithmically transformed data. <b>Entry</b> <b>x</b> environment interaction effects were more important than genetic effects.

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) can bind, fuse, and initiate {{gene expression}} in a {{diverse range of}} vertebrate cell types. This broad cellular tropism suggests that multiple receptors and/or universally distributed receptors mediate HCMV entry. Our laboratory has recently discovered that certain β 1 and β 3 integrin heterodimers are critical mediators of HCMV entry into permissive fibroblasts (A. L. Feire, H. Koss, and T. Compton, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101 : 15470 - 15475, 2004). It has also been reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is necessary for HCMV-mediated signaling and <b>entry</b> (<b>X.</b> Wang, S. M. Huong, M. L. Chiu, N. Raab-Traub, and E. E. Huang, Nature 424 : 456 - 461, 2003). Integrins are known to signal synergistically with growth factor receptors, and this coordination was recently reported for EGFR and β 3 integrins {{in the context of}} HCMV <b>entry</b> (<b>X.</b> Wang, D. Y. Huang, S. M. Huong, and E. S. Huang, Nat. Med. 11 : 515 - 521, 2005). However, EGFR-negative cell lines, such as hematopoietic cells, are known to be infected by HCMV. Therefore, we wished to confirm a role for EGFR in HCMV entry and then examine any interaction between β 1 integrins and EGFR during the entry process. Surprisingly, we were unable to detect any role for EGFR in the process of HCMV entry into fibroblast, epithelial, or endothelial cell lines. Additionally, HCMV did not activate the EGFR kinase in fibroblast cell lines. We first examined HCMV entry into two EGFR-positive or -negative cell lines but observed no increase in entry when EGFR was expressed to high levels. Physically blocking EGFR with a neutralizing antibody in fibroblast, epithelial, or endothelial cell lines or blocking EGFR kinase signaling with a chemical inhibitor in fibroblast cells did not inhibit virus entry. Lastly, we were unable to detect phosphorylation of EGFR in fibroblasts cells in response to HCMV stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that EGFR does not {{play a significant role in}} HCMV entry or signaling. These results suggest that specific integrin heterodimers either act alone as the primary entry receptors or interact in conjunction with an additional receptor(s), other than EGFR, to facilitate virus entry...|$|E

R 5 X 4 viruses differ in that they have yet to be characterized by the examination of the genetic sequence of HIV- 1 alone. In this study, a series of experiments was performed to evaluate different strategies of feature selection and neural network optimization. We demonstrate the use of artificial neural networks trained via evolutionary computation to predict viral coreceptor usage.

For these procedures, we prove sharp oracle inequalities, using a statistical learning theory point of view. A surprising fact in our results is that the rates of convergence do not depend on m and T directly. The analysis is conducted without the usually considered incoherency condition on the unknown matrix or restricted isometry condition on the sampling operator.

This CXCR 4 mimetic peptide, termed CX 4 -M 1, presents the three extracellular loops (ECLs) of the receptor. In binding assays involving recombinant proteins, as well as in cellular infection assays, CX 4 -M 1 was found to selectively recognize gp 120 from HIV- 1 strains that use CXCR 4 for cell <b>entry</b> (<b>X</b> 4 tropic HIV- 1). Furthermore, anti-HIV- 1 antibodies modulate this interaction in a molecular mechanism related to that of their impact on the gp 120 -CXCR 4 interaction. We could now show that the selectivity of CX 4 -M 1 pertains not only to gp 120 from X 4 tropic HIV- 1, but also to synthetic peptides presenting the V 3 loops of these gp 120 proteins. The V 3 loop is thought to be {{an essential part of the}} coreceptor binding site of gp 120 that contacts the second ECL of the coreceptor. We were able to experimentally confirm this notion in binding assays using substitution analogs of CX 4 -M 1 and the V 3 loop peptides, respectively, as well as in cellular infection assays.

The interaction of heat stress and pollen germination was investigated in order to determine if a physiological screen was a feasible method of determining heat tolerance in soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Ten soybean lines (Group A) from the 2006 Northern Region Uniform Soybean Tests were analyzed over two years in four locations consisting of irrigated and dryland field environments, with an additional twenty lines (Group B) analyzed in the second year. Pollen was collected from plants and incubated at either 28 o, 34 o, or 38 o C to determine pollen germination for optimal and stress-inducing temperatures. A three-way interaction of <b>entry</b> <b>x</b> incubation temperature x environment was observed, as well as significant differences among entries, incubation temperatures and environments. Average pollen germination for soybean entries ranged from 25 % to 38 % across three incubation temperatures and four environments in Kansas during 2006 – 07. The average environment effect for pollen germination ranged from 29 % (dryland, 2006) to 34 % (irrigated, 2007), while the average incubation temperature effect on pollen germination ranged from 25 % (38 oC) to 44 % (28 oC). This experiment has shown that increasing incubation temperatures significantly decreases pollen germination in vitro. It has also shown that soybean genotypes differ in pollen germination and that an in vitro screen can be used to characterize these differences. Further studies are needed to establish the relationship between pollen germination, seed set and seed yield in soybean. Work also needs to be completed to determine the proper sample size to adequately characterize differences in pollen germination so that performance differences among genotypes can be used as selection criteria in a plant breeding program...|$|E
