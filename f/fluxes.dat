In particular we consider the effects on the star's surface magnetic <b>flux,</b> open magnetic <b>flux,</b> mean azimuthal field strength, coronal free magnetic energy, coronal heating and <b>flux</b> rope eruptions. To do this, we apply a magnetic <b>flux</b> transport model to describe the photospheric evolution, and couple this to the non-potential coronal evolution using a magnetofrictional technique. A <b>flux</b> emergence model is applied to add new magnetic <b>flux</b> on to the photosphere and into the corona. The parameters of this <b>flux</b> emergence model are derived from the solar <b>flux</b> emergence profile, however the rate of emergence can be increased to represent higher <b>flux</b> emergence rates than the Sun's.
