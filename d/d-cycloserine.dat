40|$|<b>D-Cycloserine</b> is an {{effective}} second-line drug against Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To analyze the genetic determinants of <b>D-cycloserine</b> resistance in mycobacteria, a library of a resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis mutant was constructed. A resistant clone harboring a recombinant plasmid with a 3. 1 -kb insert that contained the glutamate decarboxylase (gadA) and D-alanine racemase (alrA) genes was identified. Subcloning experiments demonstrated that alrA was necessary and sufficient to confer a <b>D-cycloserine</b> resistance phenotype. The D-alanine racemase activities of wild-type and recombinant M. smegmatis strains were inhibited by <b>D-cycloserine</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. The <b>D-cycloserine</b> resistance phenotype in the recombinant clone {{was due to the}} overexpression of the wild-type alrA gene in a multicopy vector. Analysis of a spontaneous resistant mutant also demonstrated overproduction of wild-type AlrA enzyme. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the overproducing mutant revealed a single transversion (G 3 T) at the alrA promoter, which resulted in elevated b-galactosidase reporter gene expression. Furthermore, transformants of Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium bovis BCG carrying the M. smegmatis wild-type alrA gene in a multicopy vector were resistant to <b>D-cycloserine,</b> suggesting that AlrA overproduction is a potential mechanism of <b>D-cycloserine</b> resistance in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and other pathogenic mycobacteria.

Kinetic {{and genetic}} {{analyses}} of <b>d-cycloserine</b> inhibition and resistance in Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1238 – 1250. 1965. —Wild-type cells of Escherichia coli growing at 37 C in mineral salts-glucose medium with vigorous aeration were lysed at maximal exponential rates by 10 − 4 to 10 − 2 md-cycloserine. At concentrations above 2 × 10 − 2 m, <b>d-cycloserine</b> was bacteriostatic. Low levels of <b>d-cycloserine</b> (10 − 5 m) and pencillin G (10 units per ml) interacted synergistically {{to cause a}} rapid exponential rate of lysis. Spontaneous mutations to <b>d-cycloserine</b> resistance occurred in discrete steps at frequencies of 10 − 6 to 10 − 7 for each step. First-, second-, and third-step d-cycloserine-resistant mutants were lysed at maximal exponential rates by <b>d-cycloserine</b> concentrations of 10 − 3, 3 × 10 − 3, and 5 × 10 − 3 m, respectively. d-Alanine, l-alanine, and dl-alanyl-dl-alanine reversed d-cycloserine-induced lysis, in that order of effectiveness. On {{the basis of these}} observations, a d-cycloserine-enrichment cycling technique was developed for isolation of auxotrophic mutants. <b>d-Cycloserine</b> at 2 × 10 − 3 m was as efficient as penicillin G (1, 000 units per ml) for mutant enrichment in E. coli and should be useful for isolation of mutants in penicillin-resistant microorganisms.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{effective}} {{pharmacological treatment}} options exist for chronic back pain, {{the leading cause}} of disability in the US, and all are associated with significant adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of <b>D-cycloserine,</b> a partial agonist to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, in the treatment of chronic low back pain. METHODS: A total of 41 participants with chronic back pain who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized pilot trial of <b>D-cycloserine.</b> Treatment was administered orally for six weeks at escalating daily doses of 100 [*]mg, 200 [*]mg, and 400 [*]mg, each for two weeks. The primary outcome measure was back pain intensity using the Numeric Rating Scale (0 - 10). Secondary measures were back pain-related questionnaires: McGill Pain Questionnaire short form, painDETECT, PANAS, and BDI. The pre-specified analysis was a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: A treatment difference was observed between groups treated with <b>D-cycloserine</b> and placebo at six weeks of 1. 05 [*]±[*] 3. 1 units on the Numeric Rating Scale, with an effect size of 0. 4 and p[*]=[*] 0. 14.

40|$|Context: Social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) is common and debilitating.

Fear reduction in exposure therapy is similar to extinction learning, and early clinical data with specific phobias suggest that the treatment effects of exposure therapy for SAD may be enhanced with <b>D-cycloserine,</b> an agonist at the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Objective: To determine whether short-term treatment with 50 mg of <b>D-cycloserine</b> enhances the efficacy of exposure therapy for SAD. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled augmentation trial examining the combination of <b>D-cycloserine</b> or pill placebo with exposure therapy for SAD. Setting: Patients were self-referred from the general community to 1 of 3 research clinics. Participants: Twenty-seven participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD with significant public speaking anxiety. Interventions: Following a diagnostic interview and pretreatment assessment, participants received 5 therapy sessions delivered in either an individual or group therapy format. The first session provided an introduction to the treatment model and was followed by 4 sessions emphasizing exposure to increasingly challenging public speech situations with videotaped feedback of performances. One hour prior to each session, participants received single doses of <b>D-cycloserine</b> or placebo. Main Outcome Measures: Symptoms were assessed by patient self-report and by clinicians blind to the randomization condition before treatment, after treatment, and 1 month after the last session.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>D-cycloserine</b> on the {{establishment}} of twist states in Bacillus subtilis macrofibers was examined. Macrofibers produced {{in the presence of}} the drug differed in twist compared with those produced in its absence. The degree of twist alteration was dependent on the concentration of <b>D-cycloserine</b> in the growth medium. Macrofibers of different twist states representative of the entire twist spectrum from tight left-handedness to tight right-handedness were produced in strains FJ 7 and C 6 D in four different ways: by control of the concentration of D-alanine, magnesium sulfate, or ammonium sulfate in the growth medium or by control of the growth temperature. The structures so produced were used to determine the effect of <b>D-cycloserine</b> on twist establishment starting from different twist states throughout the twist spectrum. In all but one case, twist resulting from growth in the presence of <b>D-cycloserine</b> was further towards the left-hand end of the twist spectrum than that produced in its absence, the exception being the unusual left-handed twist states produced in strains C 6 D and the closely related RHX 11 S at high D-alanine concentrations described here. Studies of the interaction between <b>D-cycloserine</b> and D-alanine both used alone and used independently with the other twist-modifying systems (temperature, magnesium sulfate, and ammonium sulfate) revealed that changes in twist resulting from <b>D-cycloserine</b> were always in the opposite direction from those resulting from D-alanine.
