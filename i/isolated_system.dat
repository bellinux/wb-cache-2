5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an <b>isolated</b> <b>system</b> will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E
25|$|While Clausius {{based his}} {{definition}} on a reversible process, {{there are also}} irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the second law of thermodynamics, entropy of an <b>isolated</b> <b>system</b> always increases. The difference between an <b>isolated</b> <b>system</b> and closed system is that heat may not flow to and from an <b>isolated</b> <b>system,</b> but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.|$|E

40|$|We present {{high-resolution}} 3 D smoothed particle hydrodynamics {{simulations of}} the formation and evolution of protostellar discs in a turbulent molecular cloud. Using a piecewise polytropic equation of state, we perform two sets of simulations. In both cases we find that <b>isolated</b> <b>systems</b> undergo a fundamentally different evolution than members of binary or multiple <b>systems.</b> When formed, <b>isolated</b> <b>systems</b> must accrete mass and increase their specific angular momentum, leading {{to the formation of}} massive, extended discs, which undergo strong gravitational instabilities and are susceptible to disc fragmentation. Fragments with initial masses of 5. 5 M_jup, 7. 4 M_jup and 12 M_jup are produced in our simulations. In binaries and small clusters, we observe that due to competition for material from the parent core, members do not accrete significant amounts of high specific angular momentum gas relative to <b>isolated</b> <b>systems.</b> We find that discs in multiple systems are strongly self-gravitating but that they are stable against fragmentation due to disc truncation and mass profile steeping by tides, accretion of high specific angular momentum gas by other members, and angular momentum being redirected into members' orbits. In general, we expect disc fragmentation to be less likely in clusters and to be more a feature of <b>isolated</b> <b>systems.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 21 figures.

25|$|This {{definition}} remains meaningful {{even when}} the system is far away from equilibrium. Other definitions assume {{that the system is}} in thermal equilibrium, either as an <b>isolated</b> <b>system,</b> or as a system in exchange with its surroundings. The set of microstates (with probability distribution) on which the sum is done is called a statistical ensemble. Each type of statistical ensemble (micro-canonical, canonical, grand-canonical, etc.) describes a different configuration of the system's exchanges with the outside, varying from a completely <b>isolated</b> <b>system</b> to a system that can exchange one or more quantities with a reservoir, like energy, volume or molecules. In every ensemble, the equilibrium configuration of the system is dictated by the maximization of the entropy of the union of the system and its reservoir, according to the second law of thermodynamics (see the statistical mechanics article).|$|E
25|$|Entropy is {{the only}} {{quantity}} in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an arrow of time.

40|$|The Russian {{power system}} is diversified {{regionally}} {{and consists of}} one Unified Power System (UPS) and multiple <b>isolated</b> power <b>systems.</b> In the Russian Federation the policy {{on the use of}} renewable energies {{has been one of the}} most debated topics in recent years. In 2010, the Russian Renewable Energy Program was launched which aims to generate 4. 5 % of the entire electricity demand from renewable energy sources by 2020.

In this study an innovative methodology for the planning of <b>isolated</b> power <b>systems</b> is presented.

25|$|Sadi Carnot and Rudolf Clausius {{discovered}} the Second Law of Thermodynamics in the 19th century. It states that total entropy, sometimes understood as disorder, will always increase {{over time in}} an <b>isolated</b> <b>system.</b> This means that a system cannot spontaneously increase its order, without an external relationship that decreases order elsewhere in the system (e.g. through consuming the low-entropy {{energy of a battery}} and diffusing high-entropy heat).|$|E
25|$|We now {{consider}} inhomogeneous systems in which internal transformations (processes) can take place. If we calculate the entropy S1 before and S2 after such an internal process the Second Law of Thermodynamics demands that S2 ≥ S1 where the equality sign holds if {{the process is}} reversible. The difference Si = S2 - S1 is the entropy production due to the irreversible process. The Second law demands that the entropy of an <b>isolated</b> <b>system</b> cannot decrease.|$|E
