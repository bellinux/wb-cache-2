40|$|Abstract. The {{numerical}} simulation of oil containment by <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> under wave-current coupling conditions {{is presented in}} a companion paper. The present paper focuses {{on the use of}} the numerical experimental platform developed by FENG and WU for the prediction of oil containment failure velocity of <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> under wave-current coupling conditions. Detailed derivation processes about the containment failure velocity formula are provided. The effects of oil parameters, wave parameters and oil boom parameters on oil containment failure velocity receive particular attention, and the influences of some of these parameters such as oil density, boom draft are quantified. The prediction model can provide an economic, convenient method for oil spill response...|$|R
50|$|After the Wetlands Reserve was constructed, tonnes {{of debris}} had flowed {{down from the}} River Taff and {{collected}} near the reserve, so in 2003 Cardiff Harbour Authority built a 450-metre <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> to prevent debris from entering the reserve.|$|R

50|$|The biggest {{limitation}} {{with this}} method is the length of holes that can be accurately drilled by the production drill, larger diameter holes using in the hole hammer drills can be accurate to over 100 m in length while <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> top hammer rigs are limited to ~30 m.|$|R
50|$|Also visible is a <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> that {{surrounds}} the reserve. Under conditions of high river flows on the Rivers Taff and Ely, water-borne debris can be washed down into Cardiff Bay from the upstream catchments. This boom prevents this debris from entering the reserve, and impacting upon the species that are found there.|$|R
40|$|A {{multi-phase}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) {{method is}} developed {{to model the}} failure process of a flexible oil boom. An algorithm is proposed based on the dynamic boundary particles (DBPs) for preventing the particle disorders during the multi-fluid particle movement around the solid boundary. The improved multi-phase SPH model is firstly validated by the experimental data of a wedge falling into a two-layer oil-water fluid. Then a numerical wave-current flume is established with an active absorbing piston-type wave generator and a circulating current system. The model reliability is validated against the measured vertical profiles of velocity. Simulation of the flexible <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> movement is implemented by introducing a Rigid Module and Flexible Connector (RMFC) multi-body system. The model is finally applied to the simulation of movement of a flexible <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> in containing industrial gear oil under the combined waves and currents. Good agreements are obtained between the SPH modeling results and the experimental data {{in terms of the}} ambient wave-current field, hydrodynamic responses of the floating body and evolution process of the oil slick for the flexible boom. The hydrodynamic responses and containment performances of the flexible <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> are also compared with those of the rigid one. It is found from both the experimental and numerical results that two vortices of the water phase exist in the front and rear of the boom skirt {{and the size of the}} front vortex decreases with an increase of the current velocity while the wake vortex is reversed. It is also found that the skirt of the flexible boom has a larger magnitude of the swaying and rolling than the rigid one and the maximum quantity of the escaped oil of a flexible boom within one wave cycle is about 5 % more than a rigid one under the present test conditions...|$|R
25|$|To {{attempt to}} reduce {{the effect of the}} Bushes Wind, the course was narrowed and pushed further to the centre of the river. The width was 135 feet in 1887, in 120 feet in 1888 and then {{progressively}} until by 1914 it was down to 100 feet at the start tapering to 80 feet at the finish. In 1899, <b>floating</b> <b>booms</b> secured between the pilings which mark the course were also introduced along part of its length in an attempt to keep spectators from obstructing races.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Reason {{for writing}} {{the paper is}} to present the project of design and {{industrialization}} of <b>floating</b> containment <b>boom</b> made of PVC material, which was successfully finished in 2010. This project was supported by Savatech d. o. o. Kranj. Design/methodology/approach: Research methodology of <b>floating</b> containment <b>boom</b> made of PVC has focused on a comprehensive analysis {{of this type of}} booms, which are used around the world. Based on this knowledge and over 25 years of experiences with rubber booms, a new type of PVC boom was developed. Findings: The result of the project was the design and implementation of a new type of <b>floating</b> containment <b>boom.</b> The new boom is light weight, highly stable with no inflation system required. Boom has small volume when packed for transport and is simple and quick to deploy. It is made of UV and oil resistant material. Practical implications: The new type of oil boom was tested in clean water and is available for application in oil spill accidents. Also calculations for salt water were made. Boom is suitable for closed waters, rivers and streams, harbours, canals, etc. Originality/value: Product of research and development is an original Slovenian PVC <b>floating</b> containment <b>boom</b> marked as Easy Boom...|$|R

40|$|Characterization is a {{critical}} step in the remediation of contaminated materials and facilities. Severe physical- and radiological-access restrictions made the task of characterizing the World War II-era underground radioactive storage tanks at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) particularly challenging. The innovative and inexpensive tank characterization system (TCS) developed to meet this challenge at ORNL is worthy of consideration for use in similar remediation projects. The TCS is a floating system that uses the existing water in the tank as a platform that supports instruments and samplers mounted on a <b>floating</b> <b>boom.</b> TCS operators feed the unit into an existing port of the tank to be characterized. Once inserted, the system`s position is controlled by rotation and by insertion and withdrawal of the boom. The major components of the TCS system include the following: (1) boom support system that consists of a boom support structure and a <b>floating</b> <b>boom,</b> (2) video camera and lights, (3) sludge grab sampler, (4) wall chip sampler, and (5) sonar depth finder. This simple design allows access to all parts of a tank. Moreover, the use of off-the-shelf components keeps the system inexpensive and minimizes maintenance costs. The TCS proved invaluable in negotiating the hazards of ORNL`s Gunite and Associated Tanks, which typically contain a layer of radioactive sludge, have only one to three access ports that are usually only 12 - or 24 -in. in diameter, and range from 12 to 50 ft in diameter. This paper reviews both the successes and the difficulties encountered in using the TCS for treatability studies at ORNL and discusses the prospects for its wider application in remediation activities...|$|R
50|$|Containment of the {{oil spill}} began with the {{placement}} of a <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> at the harbor entrance. A straw barrier was placed around the wreck to briefly contain the spill while boats spread dispersants.The owners {{of the ship and}} the Shell company met together to decide how the oil spill was going to be clean or treated. The cleanup was the responsibility of the Portuguese Navy, Commandant Casquinno was appointed to clean up the oil spill {{and came up with a}} plan.The plan was separated into two actions, the first part of the plan was to clean up as much oil as possible that was in the water and the second part of the plan was to clean the oil that washed ashore.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 April 2014, BP {{claimed that}} cleanup {{along the coast}} was {{substantially}} complete, but the United States Coast Guard responded {{that a lot of}} work remained. Using physical barriers such as <b>floating</b> <b>booms,</b> cleanup workers’ objective was to keep the oil from spreading any further. They used skimmer boats to remove a majority of the oil and they used sorbents to absorb any remnant of oil like a sponge. Although that method did not remove the oil completely, chemicals called dispersants are used to hasten the oil’s degradation to prevent the oil from doing further damage to the marine habitats below the surface water. For the Deep Horizon oil spill, cleanup workers used [...] of various chemical dispersants to further breakdown the oil.|$|R

Hugh and Gerald Dillon now climbed upon one end of the log, which at once sank into the water below the level of the bottom of the boom, and the current taking it, swept it beneath the obstacle. Rupert's rope directed its downward course, and it was soon alongside the boom, but on the lower side.|$|R
5000|$|At TEDxDelft2012, Dutch Aerospace Engineering student Boyan Slat {{unveiled}} a concept for removing {{large amounts of}} marine debris from the five oceanic gyres. Calling his project The Ocean Cleanup, he proposed to use surface currents to let debris drift to specially designed arms and collection platforms. Operating costs would be minimal and the operation would be so efficient that {{it might even be}} profitable. The concept makes use of <b>floating</b> <b>booms,</b> that divert rather than catch the debris. This way bycatch would be avoided, although even the smallest particles would be extracted. According to Slat's calculations, a gyre could be cleaned up in five years' time, collecting at least 7.25 million tons of plastic across all gyres. He also advocated [...] "radical plastic pollution prevention methods" [...] to prevent gyres from reforming.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: An {{effective}} {{mechanical method}} of confining the oil spills {{in an open}} ocean is to use barriers such as <b>floating</b> <b>booms.</b> However, the confined oil may leak beneath a boom if either the towing speed of the boom or the amount of oil is too large. In this paper a simple mathematical model based on the potential theory is presented for the two-layer (oil and water) flow near a vertical barrier. A set of non-linear integral equations is formulated and solved numerically. For the indirect approach we adopted to solve the non-linear integral equations, the water velocity at the water-oil upstream contact point becomes a determining parameter of the final results. It is shown that the oil leakage under the barrier is impossible if the contact point is a stagnation one. For other non-stagnation cases, {{we were able to}} compute flows up to critical Froude numbers beyond which the oil will leak underneath the barrier...|$|R

40|$|Rivers play an {{important}} role in providing the water resources for human and ecosystem survival and health. Nowadays, most urban areas experience difficulties in solving water pollution in rivers and streams. Hence, a proper solution should be carried out to overcome this problem. The objective of this research is to study an effective <b>floating</b> debris <b>boom</b> which can be created with appropriate dimensions, as well as good level of effectiveness of material in various flow rates, in a rectangular open channel to reduce the river pollution. In this research, there are two types of connection, hinged or drilled hole that will be used to connect the piers and the booms. Three types of material were used which are Styrofoam, bamboo, and PVC. Total six booms were created and tested with five different flow rates. An amount of 200 g of debris was put into the open channel to test the <b>floating</b> debris <b>boom.</b> The results indicated that hinged connection is stronger than drilled-hole connection to connect the piers and the booms as it provided a free movement for the boom to move. For the type of material, Styrofoam proved that it has the best effectiveness for capturing the debris due to its lighter weight among the three materials. Based on the data obtained, <b>floating</b> debris <b>boom</b> which is made from Styrofoam and connected by hinged connection has the best performance and effectiveness for capturing the debris in this experiment. Eventually, this finding may contribute toward the minimization of river pollution happening in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The Ocean Cleanup {{proposes to}} place a huge barrier in the ocean in order to clean it from plastic waste. Plastic will be caught as it flows towards the barrier on the ocean’s currents. As such a {{structure}} has no precedent, the concept has to be engineered {{from the bottom up}} and tested extensively. The barrier has a relatively shallow draft and moves in the splash zone, making it difficult to model the barrier’s behaviour. First, this study focusses on the development of a numerical two dimensional (2 D) hydro-elastic model. This model {{has to be able to}} simulate the motions of such a barrier as observed in two dimensional tests and allows for a better understanding of the barrier’s hydrodynamic behaviour. The wave forces on the barrier are calculated with the Morison equation, which is often used in offshore hydrodynamics to calculate the wave forces on slender members. Including all details necessary for a correct simulation, the model is simplified wherever possible. This reduces runtime so that the model can be used for simulations for a fatigue assessment in the second part of this thesis. These assumptions are validated using the results from 2 D tests carried out by Deltares. In addition, another student will develop a CFD model to validate these simplifications by an alternative way. The results of the validation using the 2 D tests suggest that the motions can be simulated very well using this approach. The validation also shows that the horizontal position of the barrier seems to be mostly affected by the forces on the screen, while the vertical position is dominated by the buoyancy force of the <b>floating</b> <b>boom.</b> The second part of this study consists of a first qualitative assessment of the fatigue life of the barrier. Earlier tests have shown that the loads on the barrier are relatively low. This is why fatigue is expected to play an important role, given the fact that the barrier will be deployed for about 5 to 10 years. Fatigue life of the rubber component at the point where the <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> is connected to the plastic capturing screen is investigated. To carry out this assessment, the prototype currently deployed in the North Sea is used as a starting point. The hydro-elastic model from the first part of this thesis is used to simulate the barrier’s motions. Using a structural model which simulates the rubber’s behaviour, these motions are superimposed from the global to the local structure. For this structural model a hyperelastic material that resembles the rubber component is assumed. After superimposing the barrier’s motions, fatigue life of the barrier is calculated using a damage model suitable for rubber. The results show that fatigue life seems to be dominated by seastates with steep waves or with large velocity and acceleration amplitudes. Also, the fatigue life in the Pacific Ocean will be about two and a half to three times longer than for one deployed in the North Sea.
