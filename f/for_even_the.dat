Suicide and desertions were common due to boredom, shortages of food and the poor living conditions. At Middle Hill Battery, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down the cliff face.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months <b>for</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> most frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E

25|$|The Ismaili Fatimid dynasty of Cairo contested the Abbasids <b>for</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> titular {{authority}} of the Islamic ummah.

25|$|The Betrayer – A Nazgûl who was cursed {{long ago}} for {{yielding}} the Southlands to Sauron's rule, the Betrayer {{is driven by}} malice and self-hatred that knows no bounds. Of all the Nazgûl, the Betrayer is amongst the lowest of Sauron's lieutenants, <b>for</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord is leery of placing faith in one who betrayed his kin so readily. The Betrayer is another addition to the nine Ringwraiths by Games Workshop, depicted wearing Haradrim armor and a turban around his hood, although his weapon is a western longsword, instead of a Southron's weapon.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other {{microcredit}} methodologies, village banking eliminates collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving commercial bank loans) as a loan prerequisite. Instead, it relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure makes it possible <b>for</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network.|$|E

25|$|Savolainen's closure {{plan was}} eagerly {{accepted}} by the technical committee and forwarded to the city council. The council however turned down the proposal. At {{the same time the}} requests for funds <b>for</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> most basic maintenance of the tram network were also turned down. Subsequently, Savolainen submitted a proposal for termination of tram traffic by 1972, as continuing traffic after that time was not viable without some investment in track maintenance and the rolling stock. However, earlier closure would not be possible due to the need to find new jobs for the tram staff. Additionally the closure of the tram system would require investment in 75–80 diesel-powered buses. None of the preceding or subsequent proposals for replacement of the tram system with buses included an objective comparison between the expenses of tram and bus operations. Each proposal simply presumed that buses were cheaper, without looking further into the matter.|$|E

He would march with his main army to the southeast of the Allied position, circling around Kunersdorf, screened by the Reppen Forest. This way, he thought, he would surprise his enemy, forcing the Allied army to reverse fronts, which is a complicated maneuver <b>for</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> best trained troops. Frederick could then employ his much feared oblique battle order, feinting with his left flank as he did so. Ideally, this would allow him to roll up the Allied line from the Mühlberge.|$|E
