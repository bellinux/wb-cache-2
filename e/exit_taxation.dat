This reference for a preliminary ruling constitutes a remarkable decision of the Grand Chamber of the CJEU, {{as it can be}} easily deduced by the number of the intervening Member States. Its significance relies on the fact that it constitutes the first case, decided by the CJEU, on the compatibility of companies’ exit taxes with freedom of establishment. It also provides the Court with an opportunity to revisit its Daily Mail and Cartesio case law. The article researches the impact of the judgment on companies’ <b>exit</b> <b>taxation,</b> while it also analyses the case in the context of previous case law both on <b>exit</b> <b>taxation</b> on natural persons and companies’ freedom of emigration...|$|E

Formally, the work on this piece of EU tax legislation {{is part of the}} controversial Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB).

40|$|Freedom of {{establishment}} {{statutes that}} restriction of citizens within the EU can not occur. A citizen {{should be free}} to establish themselves in a Member State and not be hindered if they choose to leave the State. "Citizens" also includes legal persons such as companies. Legislations in Member States which prevents the freedom of establishment shall be prohibited. When a company chooses to merge across borders and thus cease to be a Swedish company, the Swedish rules for <b>exit</b> <b>taxation</b> applies. This means that assets and unrealized gains will be taxed immediately. If the company instead chose to reorganize within the country, or to do nothing at all, a tax will only arise when the asset is sold. This different treatment could constitute a restriction of a company's freedom of establishment and thus discourage companies from moving to or from Sweden. The Malta case resulted in that the legislature introduced rules for deferment of payment of tax. Today there is an opportunity for companies that choose to move abroad to obtain a suspension of the payment of taxes just to be more in line with the freedom of establishment. Companies must meet certain conditions in order to be granted a deferral. If a company carries out a merger that falls within Chapter 22. 5 § 2 p. IL, <b>exit</b> <b>taxation</b> will be applied. There is no possibility for a company, which is subject to <b>exit</b> <b>taxation</b> according to Chapter 22. 5 § 2 p. IL, to be subject to deferral rules since 2 p. is not covered by the rules of deferral. Only mergers according to Chapter 22. 5 § 4 and 5 p. IL. are subject to deferral. There are less restrictive measures to take than immediate taxation which is more in line with the freedom of establishment. Examples of less restrictive measures are an extension of the already existing deferral rules or taxing companies on the disposal of the assets...|$|E

40|$|Il coordinamento tra sistemi impositivi è una questione originaria e tipica del diritto comunitario. La tesi ne esplora le conseguenze sotto più aspetti. Income tax systems' {{co-ordination}} is {{a relatively}} recent issue in the globalizing economy. In fact, a tendence to tax co-ordination begins, essentially, with the EU Law. Since 2006, European Institutions feel the urgence to solve problem of double imposition and non imposition phenomena left unsolved by the member states themselves, or by means of Double Taxation Conventions (DTCs). The tax co-ordination envisages means to do so. The theme is firstly envisaged by the unilateral and bilateral perspective, underlining the deficiencies of sovereignity methods in fronting the economies' integration problems. The theme is then pointed out by the perspective of EU Law. At a first level, by considering tax systems co-ordination methods envisaged by the Directives in matter of group-taxation. Then, monitoring the outgoing of co-ordination considered by three EU Communications dated 19 December 2006 (respectively targeted to the general problem of tax co-ordination, to the co-ordination between member states upon <b>exit</b> <b>taxation,</b> to the co-ordination upon consideraton of intra-EU losses). The issue is also considered by {{the point of view}} of the European Court of Justice. In this perspective, it's relevant to estabilish whether the ECJ has the power to compel the member states to structure each other their income tax systems, based on the application of the EU freedoms, with a view – in particular – to <b>exit</b> <b>taxation</b> policies, to intra-EU losses: a theme strictly linked to the view that is optioned out for the interpretation of EU non-discrimination clause (an overall approach facing the opposite per-country approach). ...|$|E

This article begins by briefly summarising the ambiguity that had surrounded this matter before this decision and then summarises the arguments of the Court, highlighting {{the circumstances under which}} such taxation might be compatible with EU law.

40|$|Already {{for some}} years, <b>exit</b> <b>taxation</b> {{has been a}} hot topic, {{especially}} within the EU. While this form of taxation is widely accepted in the international sphere, it remains arguable whether it infringes the freedom of establishment and/or capital movement. So far, due to {{the decisions of the}} European Court of Justice (ECJ), it has been accepted that, if specific requirements are complied with, exit taxes are still allowed in the EU. In this article, the authors argue that, in spite of what the ECJ proclaims, exit taxes are not permitted in the EU anymore. The analysis and comparison of the nature of an exit tax, mainly its tax base, and the alleged exit tax currently allowed in the EU demonstrate that, as a matter of fact, when speaking of an accepted exit tax, the ECJ is prescribing a new allocation of taxing rights between the Member States...|$|E
40|$|Within the European Union, {{there exists}} a {{fundamental}} tension between the fiscal sovereignty of its Member States, in particular {{in the field of}} direct taxation, and the requirements of the Internal Market, which aim at the abolition of any regulatory or fiscal obstacles to cross border movement of goods, persons, services and capital. While the impact of secondary European legislation and state aid control is still rather limited, the judicature of the European Court of Justice on the fundamental freedoms has established substantial constraints for national legislators which force Member States to provide equal treatment for purely domestic and cross-border situations. This has a major effect with respect to the taxation of corporate groups as the legislator is obliged to extend benefits for domestic groups to multinational enterprises. The article explains how this affects important elements of the international tax order like relief for intercompany dividends (credit or exemption), deductibility of expenditure related to foreign dividends, intra-group loss compensation, CFC legislation, thin capitalization and interest barriers/debt caps, transfer pricing and <b>exit</b> <b>taxation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} Court of Justice of the European Union in {{the process}} of direct tax {{integration}} in the European Union (EU) has been widely discussed in the academic literature, while another important actor, the European Commission, has attracted much less attention. The Commission’s input is commonly perceived to be limited to the right of legislative initiative. This study questions such an oversimplified interpretation and draws a more nuanced picture of EU tax harmonisation by integrating an analysis of the complex regulatory approaches adopted by the Commission for the establishment and smooth functioning of the Internal Market. It is argued that the past decade brought a notable change in the Court-dominated pattern of direct tax integration. This change is apparent first in the evolution of enforcement strategies under Articles 258 and 260 TFEU; and second, in the increased reliance upon non-binding regulatory measures. Both developments have strengthened the role of the Commission, supplying it with more possibilities for influencing national direct tax systems, despite the reluctance of Member States to agree upon legislative harmonisation. Against this background, the procedural and substantive problems associated with these instruments require closer examination. The normative scope of this research covers the key procedural problems related to the infringement procedure and non-binding regulatory measures. The empirical component explores the Commission’s enforcement and coordination practices, drawing particular attention to two case studies: the tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations and <b>exit</b> <b>taxation.</b> Following the analysis of enforcement and coordination in the field of direct taxation, the study argues the need and proposes potential solutions for (i) the developing of a more comprehensive procedural framework for the infringement procedure and non-binding regulatory acts; (ii) the strengthening of accountability mechanisms; and (iii) the enhancing of the effectiveness of their application.

40|$|Abstract Ever since Sweden joined EU Swedish law {{has to be}} {{compatible}} with EU law. Swedish law cannot state anything that may restrict the freedom of establishment. This means that companies are free to change their resident within the EU without any restrictions. National rules regarding exit tax states that companies who wants to move their business out of Sweden is taxed as if their assets has been disposed of at the exit time. These rules {{have been found to}} restrict EU law according to case RÅ 2008 ref 30. Because of this a new set of rules has arisen which regards respite of payment of the tax. The rules regarding companies who wants to establish business in Sweden is stated in chapter 20 a IL. This chapter states how purchase value and acquisition cost shall be calculated when a company enters taxation in Sweden. A company who enters taxation in Sweden is taxed as if the assets have been acquired {{at the time of the}} move. The Swedish rules can be incompatible with EU law if the rules restrict the freedom of establishment. In the analysis of this essay the conclusion is that Swedish national rules in question are restricting the freedom of establishment, because when a company is taxed though it vacates a Member State it can discourage companies from establishing in other member states. The determination of tax of entering can also discourage establishment, therefore the Swedish national rules conflicts with EU law. The question that occurs is whether the rules can be justified. The rules regarding taxation entry cannot be justified through the justification grounds, because the rule did not have an object of public interest and the rule was not likely to achieve the objective. <b>Exit</b> <b>taxation</b> can be justified through the principle of territoriality, however, the rule did not fulfill the requirement of proportionality and where therefore not accepted...|$|E

Exit tax on {{corporations}} is {{a capital}} gains tax imposed on companies when moving their residence to another country. The causes of emigration may be business-related or with the aim of moving the company a low-tax jurisdiction. The basic goal of the exit tax is to provide countries with a tool for protecting their tax base by taxing the events which would otherwise result in the loss of the countries 2 ̆ 7 taxing rights. However, taxing unrealized capital gains has proven to cause many problems in practice. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the exit tax features, especially regarding taxation of companies. Therefore, the paper commences by describing the scope and methods of collecting exit tax and questioning its justifiability. Exit tax is analysed as a tax avoidance strategy, but also as a means of avoiding double taxation. Further, the systems of determining companies 2 ̆ 7 tax nationality are analysed – namely the incorporation system and the real seat system, with an investigation into the effects of moving companies’ residence within each of them. Cases relating to exit tax were discussed before the European Court of Justice by addressing certain procedural matters of <b>exit</b> <b>taxation,</b> primarily in cases regarding the freedom of establishment. An overview of national exit tax systems in Italy, the Netherlands, the United States of America, and Croatia is followed by the author’s conclusions...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{exit tax}} {{legislation}} in Chapter 22. § 5 p. 4 IL states that businesses who change its tax residence to another Member State within the EES are taxed as having its assets {{sold at the}} time of the change of domicile. This legislation was declared incompatible with the freedom of establishment in case RÅ 2009 ref. 30 due to the fact that businesses who changed tax residence were treated worse than businesses that remained within the Member State of origin. Of importance for the outcome of the case was the fact that ECJ had declared exit tax incompatible with the freedom of establishment in two previous cases. In connection with RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the Commission also addressed requirements for Sweden to abolish the restrictive legislation through a reasoned opinion. In the aftermath of RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the legislator drafted a suggestion for new legislation which aimed to make the exit tag legislation in IL compatible with the freedom of establishment. The legislator made clear that the communication from the Commission on <b>exit</b> <b>taxation</b> was of great significance in formulating the legislation, particularly the requirement from the Commission that exit tax ought not to lead to immediate tax consequences for the businesses. The suggested legislation made businesses able to defer payment of the exit tax by introducing a new chapter in SBL. Thus did not the wording of the exit tax legislation in IL change. The suggested legislation was heavily criticized by the respondents in the preparatory legislation and also in legal doctrine. The legislation was, however, adopted and the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL came into force 1 January 2010. The question that arises is whether this addition to the exit tax legislation is a sufficient action to achieve the objective of the legislation. It can be concluded that the situation for businesses changing tax residence is not significantly affected by the introduction of the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL. The fact remains that business changing tax residence still are adversely affected due to the fact that taxation occurs on the exit date, which can have the effect of these businesses being taxed in an earlier phase than resident businesses. Consequently the legislation continue to impose immediate tax consequences in certain cases. The fact that the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by placing the time of taxation at the real disposal of the assets makes the legislation disproportionate. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the conditions which the deferment is associated with should be seen as proportionate either. Due to the fact that it is ascertain that the conditions in some cases can be costly in terms of valuation costs and that the purpose of the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by applying directives in the field of mutual assistance and recovery of claims instead of an annual deferment procedure. The conditions could therefore be considered disproportionate in relation to the purpose of the legislation. Nevertheless, the main reason for arguing that the Swedish exit tax legislation should be considered as incompatible with the freedom of establishment is the fact that the legislation does not take full account of the taxed assets potential decrease in value, capable of arising after the businesses transfer of tax residence. Through ECJ-case law it can be noted that decrease in value must be taken into account by either the state of origin or the host state to be considered proportionate. The Swedish exit tax legislation is therefore incompatible with the freedom of establishment in all cases where the host state does not take notice of such decrease in value...|$|E
