5|$|The {{selection}} {{process for the}} male lead was the longest, {{and a series of}} auditions attracted several celebrities. Giddens chose first-time actor Ko Chen-tung because he felt he showed great improvement in his acting skills in each successive audition. Giddens liked his attitude, having seen Ko Chen-tung hiding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> frantically studying the script just before his audition.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the room, far from large room openings, {{and closer to the}} listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E

5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of our 60m3 room {{farthest}} {{away from}} the apparatus, we exploded 3mg. of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool pressed and Thompson forced Sprake into {{a number}} of saves. Leeds had another chance as Bremner had a shot saved by Lawrence after {{receiving}} the ball from Reaney. A few minutes later, Strong forced Sprake into a save, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner.</b> St. John came close to scoring from the subsequent corner, but his shot went over the Leeds goal. However, with three minutes of extra time remaining, St. John scored. Smith found Callaghan, who ran past two Leeds defenders, his cross into the Leeds penalty area was headed into the goal by St. John to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead.|$|E

5|$|Lydford Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the town}} of Lydford, Devon, England. The first castle in Lydford, {{sometimes}} termed the Norman fort, was a small ringwork built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the Anglo-Saxon fortified burh in the years after the Norman conquest of England. It was intended to help control Devon following the widespread revolt against Norman rule in 1068. The Norman fort had been abandoned {{by the middle of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E

5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|In Poland, the {{earliest}} archeological sites considered Slavic include {{a limited number}} of 6th-century settlements and a few isolated burial sites. The material obtained there consists mostly of simple, manually formed ceramics, typical of the entire early Slavic area. It is {{on the basis of the}} different varieties of these basic clay pots and infrequent decorations that the three cultures are distinguished. The largest of {{the earliest}} Slavic (Prague culture) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to systematic research is located in Bachórz, Rzeszów County, and dates to the second half of 5th through 7th centuries. It consisted of 12 nearly square, partially dug-out houses, each covering the area of 6.2 to 19.8 (14.0 on the average) square meters. A stone furnace was usually placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period, but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found. 45 newer dwellings of a different type from the 7th/8th to 9th/10th centuries have also been discovered in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Kateri i Radës {{were transported}} to a {{concrete}} platform {{in the port}} of Otranto as {{a monument to the}} tragedy. The project cost €150 thousand and was entrusted to the Greek sculptor Costas Varotsos. Before the project, {{what was left of the}} ship lay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the port of Brindisi. The project was titled L'Approdo. Opera all'Umanità Migrante (The Landing. A work dedicated to Migrating Humanity). Photographers Arta Ngucaj and Arben Beqiraj published photographs of the ship on the Albanian-Italian newspaper Shqiptari i Italisë. The families of the dead requested for the relics of Kateri i Radës to be placed in Albania after Italian media reported that it was to be used as a monument.|$|E

5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run off the edge and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability {{to see where the}} edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as a worm). Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the cage for later consumption; no other food items were set aside in this fashion.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E
5|$|As {{the people}} inside the church scattered, the Mouzalon {{brothers}} tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> by the emperor's tomb. The mob, however, proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos ("Charles"). Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and, despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was the frenzy of the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is {{to be identified with}} Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told to be quiet or she would share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant.|$|E

5|$|Hicks, who was {{generally}} {{described as the}} most effective of the Manchester City forwards, had a chance which he hit high over the crossbar. In a rare spell of sustained Manchester City pressure, a free kick by captain Jimmy McMullan forced a save from Pym, and the resulting near-post corner prompted a goalmouth scramble which ended with a foul on Bolton's Greenhalgh. Pym made further saves from Browell and Hicks, the latter resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner.</b> From the corner Bolton won the ball and headed upfield on the counter-attack. Billy Butler's cross from the right went beyond the goal and was retrieved by Vizard on the left wing. The outside-forward then cut inside and played the ball across goal in a manner described by some correspondents as a shot and others as a pass. David Jack received {{the ball in the}} six-yard box and put the ball between Goodchild and McCloy into the City goal, giving Bolton the lead with 14 minutes remaining. In the few minutes after the goal, Manchester City came forward in numbers but lacked clear chances and were hindered by over-eager forwards going offside. Following a goal kick by Pym, the referee blew the final whistle. Bolton won the cup for a second time, becoming the first club to win twice at Wembley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, {{wrapped it around}} his fist and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
