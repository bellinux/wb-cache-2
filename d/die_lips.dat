50|$|There are two {{different}} types of die tooling used for coating over a wire, tubing (or jacketing) and pressure. In jacketing tooling, the polymer melt does not touch the inner wire until immediately before the <b>die</b> <b>lips.</b> In pressure tooling, the melt contacts the inner wire long before it reaches the die lips; this is done at a high pressure to ensure good adhesion of the melt. If intimate contact or adhesion is required between the new layer and existing wire, pressure tooling is used. If adhesion is not desired/necessary, jacketing tooling is used instead.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} die types for coextrusion: single {{manifold}} and multi manifold. Both types rely on a separate extruder for each polymer chemistry. In multi manifold dies, each layer is extruded separately and only combined just before the <b>die</b> <b>lips.</b> This die type is expensive due to the complex tooling required, but can alleviate vast differences in rheological behavior between the various layers. Single manifold dies form the multiple layers into a single layer, allowing contact between the polymer layers {{for a longer period}} of time. This ensures optimal bonding, but comes at the consequence of needing higher compatibility polymers.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{study of the}} film casting process, {{with a focus on}} the effect of the draw ratio on the swelling of the extruded sheet. So far, studies regarding film casting have dealt mainly with the phenomenon of neck-in and have neglected swelling of the material as it emerges from the <b>die</b> <b>lips.</b> Knowledge of the amount of swelling is important for accurate determination of the effect of stretching and orientation phenomena. The problem is tackled by studying the gap-wise swelling of the sheet or film as it emerges from a wide rectangular die and is subsequently drawn down under different draw ratios. The material is treated as viscoelastic by utilizing the Linear Phan Thien-Tanner (LPTT) model. Newtonian simulations are also carried out. A decoupled iterative algorithm is used for the determination of the shape of the extruded sheet, {{based on the fact that}} the sheet's surfaces belong to streamlines. Our results are in qualitative agreement with results in the literature, with the latter being limited in number and available mainly for the (similar) process of fiber melt spinning. © Applied Rheology...|$|E
40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{film casting}} {{involves}} melt flow through a slot die, across a small span, {{and onto a}} fast moving quench drum. In the ""wire-pinning"" casting process, a thin electrified wire close {{to the line of}} contact with the drum creates a strong pinning force that delays air entrainment to higher line speeds. Nonuniform wetting of the <b>die</b> <b>lips</b> by the extruded melt is thought to be responsible for the formation of streaks, a defect in the machine direction. A finite element model of the film casting process with wire pinning was developed to assist in understanding what causes significant wetting of the lips and whether this can be avoided by electrostatic pinning. The solution of the governing equations provide the location of the static and dynamic contact lines, thus finding the wetting and pinning points in the process. The simulations investigate the sensitivity of the static wetting line locations on the die lands to the imposed values of static contact angle and die-lip gap. It was found that while the contact angle has a small effect on the extent of die-lip wetting within the parameter ranges examined, there is a considerable chance that the feed slot surfaces can be dewetted. This seems to be the greatest danger for causing streaks rather than excessive wetting of the die lands. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|E

40|$|Coating tensioned-web {{running over}} slot die is an {{efficient}} way of depositing thin and uniform layers on flexible web {{at high speed}} with a relatively simple set-up, a combination of slot die premetering and carefully controlled web transport. A particularly attractive feature of such tensioned-web coating is that two layers can be coated simultaneously, which {{makes it possible for}} one of the layers to be exceptionally thin, and for two layers to be created with less wastage than in tandem single layer operation. Successful two-layer coating from a two-slot die requires not only avoiding bead break-up, but also operating at conditions that fix the separation line of the interlayer zone at a proper position, which is generally the downstream corner of the mid-lip between the two feed slots; otherwise the layer becomes non-uniform [Cohen 1993, Sartor 1998] and microvortexes may be prompted in the coating bead. Whereas one-dimensional elastoviscocapillary modeling accounts well for the web profile over the die, the gap between web and <b>die</b> <b>lips,</b> and the pressure profile along the gap, full two-dimensional Navier-Stokes theory is necessary to predict separation line location on the mid-lip and occurrence of microvortexes around the feed slots and downstream meniscus.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{viscosity}} and surface tension are well {{documented in the}} case of roll-to-roll slot die systems. However their influence in combination with process parameters for batch scale coaters are less often discussed. Lack of coating uniformity attained using a bespoke slot die coater at the CPI National Printable Electronics Centre led to the requirement for an investigation to identify the sources of error. This project outlines a method used {{to determine the effects of}} material and process parameters on coating quality without the requirement for modification of equipment. It also describes the development of a series of versatile formulations containing polyethylene oxide that can be used to mimic similar polymer formulations for cost-effective initial process development of new materials. Various dilute polymer systems were developed whereby solids loading, viscosity and surface tension were all fully controlled. Design of Experiments techniques were employed to determine relationships between parameters and fluid properties. Chosen parameters included coating velocity, coating acceleration, coating gap (gap between slot <b>die</b> <b>lips</b> and substrate), volume infuse (volume of material initially infused) and flow infuse (flow rate of material initially infused). Their effects on coating thickness and thickness uniformity were quantified for the bulk region of the coating, resulting in the development of a statistical model to aid optimisation of parameters for new materials. Surface tension had a minimal effect on coating thickness and uniformity during the screening study so this was not included in the final model. Coating acceleration and flow infuse exhibited a proportional relationship relating to coating thickness uniformity. Volume infuse did not have a significant effect on coating thickness or uniformity. Particular focus was placed on viscosity and coating velocity; {{in the case of}} this bespoke tool they were found to be inversely proportional in relation to coating thickness and uniformity. They strongly influenced the flow rate and the resultant coating thickness due to the effects of fluid resistance, though the wet coat thickness parameter was held at a constant value. This suggested that the system does not work by a feedback loop to correct the flow rate for fluid resistance and internal pressure effects. Regardless of this, an operating window was found in which coating thickness and uniformity can be controlled for polymer solutions with a range of viscosities...|$|E

In tensioned-web-over-slot die (TWOSD) coating, web is sustained {{only by the}} ten- sion of the web wrapped around the coating die. The distance between the die and web is set by {{the interaction between the}} hydrodynamic force of coating liquid and the normal stress resultant from the curved tensioned web, in what is called elaso- hydrodynamic interaction. In order to analyze this particular the coating flow, several tools are developed and tested on other coating flows relatively simpler than TWOSD flow. The theoretical conditions for the onset of vortex that degrades product qualities are proposed and the critical vortex birth trajectories inside the parameter space are tracked automatically by a direct tracking method. To detect a defect-causing flow feature in multi-layer coating, mid-gap invasion, the position of an interlayer separation point was tracked by theoretical model. The results are verified by flow visualization experiment for two- layer fixed-gap slot coating. Also linear stability analysis was performed, in order to detect unstable interlayer that signals coating defects in the two-layer slot coating. The purpose of the research is to understand the complicated flow characteristic inside the coating bead by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes theory using finite element method and visualizing the coating bead flow on a lab-scale TWOSD coater. Using the tools described above, the flow features that leads to coating defects, such as, bead breakup, weeping, mid-gap invasion and feed slot vortex, are identified and mathematical forms of the onset condition for the features are presented. The onset conditions are combined into the direct tracking method that was used to construct the vortex-free operating window for the given <b>die</b> <b>lip</b> configurations. Furthermore, the tracking method can be used to shows the effect of <b>die</b> <b>lip</b> design on the critical parameters for the onset of the flow features...|$|R
