The other judges thought her voice was too small, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had an {{incredible}} ability to communicate through music. I talked the other judges into giving her a grant.|$|E
500|$|The casting of {{the lead}} pair was leaked well before the {{intended}} official announcements. Gowariker cast Harman Baweja after watching the trailer of his debut film, the science fiction romance Love Story 2050 (2008). He asked Harman's father, Harry Baweja, to show him the film's rushes and was impressed with his performance, calling him the best person for the part. Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve zodiac signs. On casting Chopra, Gowariker said: [...] "I have always liked Priyanka's work, right from [...] She's been fabulous in all her films. So when I thought of somebody doing twelve roles I thought about her, as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had the potential." [...] When Gowariker offered the film to her, Chopra instantly agreed to star in it.|$|E
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E

500|$|Feminism {{academic}} Camille Paglia {{said that}} she used to be transfixed by this [...] "temperamental diva bitch", due to the contrast with the ideal of womanhood that she had been presented to as a child: [...] "Mary, this silent mother; and here was the witch queen who has this weird dialogue in the mirror and it didn't have to be charitable and it didn't have to be nice. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was fabulous." [...] Likewise, Lana Parrilla, who later herself played the Evil Queen in Once Upon A Time, said that whenever she watched Disney's Snow White as a young girl she rooted for and [...] "loved the evil queen―every time the evil queen came on, I was like 'OK!' She was just so fascinating to me." [...] Author Deborah Lipp wrote: [...] "As I've said before and will doubtless say again, given a choice of being Snow White (helpless, sweet, voiceless) and the Wicked Queen, with the cool castle and the magic and the minions, give me my Magic Mirror now!" [...] Film director John Waters said he too rooted for the evil queen to win, and Chay Yew said that if he were a Disney character, he would be the evil queen from Snow White.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, {{and a couple of other}} songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.|$|E
500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel's {{cover of}} [...] "Firework" [...] by Katy Perry was {{reviewed}} negatively by Coachman. She wrote, [...] "I'm not loving Michele’s vocals on this track. It {{was like they}} wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry. As much as I really like Katy Perry, Michele has more of a tremendous voice. There are parts where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", as well as the casts' performances of [...] "P.Y.T." [...] by Michael Jackson and [...] "When I get You Alone" [...] by Robin Thicke. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave Salling's performance a positive review. She wrote, [...] "We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces. Puck is no Freddie Mercury, but he handles the melody well and makes up for lack of range with swagger." ...|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|... "She told {{me things}} {{that there is}} no way she could have known. And the first part of the reading was that this was the path that I was {{supposed}} to be on and that I was supposed to be a teacher and help people and – <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was nuts." [...] Speaking of the same encounter in a 2002 interview, Edward said, [...] "She told me I would one day become internationally known for my psychic abilities through lectures, books, radio and TV. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was full of it until she started to tell me things no one in my life knew about... The details were unbelievable." ...|$|E

[...] "She was fresh out of school, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a genius," [...] Shrifte said. Vanguard published Oates' first book, the short-story collection By the North Gate, in 1963.|$|E
2500|$|Benson's {{band had}} a high {{turnover}} of musicians, as they frequently left to marry G.I.s they met while touring. She once commented, [...] "I lost seven in one year to America. Only the other week a girl slipped away from the stage. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{was going to the}} lavatory but she went off with a G.I. Nobody's seen her since." ...|$|E
2500|$|EastEnders {{scriptwriter}} Tony Jordan {{revealed that}} he created the character with Turner in mind: [...] "I first met Lacey {{when she came to}} a casting workshop for the Miller family ... She was leaning against a wall and looked just like Kat Slater, played by Wallace. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would be perfect for the Slater family so I wrote in Stacey’s character especially for Lacey." ...|$|E
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> {{would be}} very angry and was sorry that I had spoken. But as it {{happened}} she was not.|$|R
60|$|I saw she was embarrassed, so I {{asked her}} no further {{questions}} about it. Perhaps, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>she's</b> {{going to be}} married. Even in Polynesia, young girls are naturally reticent upon that subject. And Kea was hardly a Polynesian at all: on her father's side she was an English lady. So I turned {{on my back and}} dismissed the matter for the moment from my consideration.|$|R

2500|$|Upon Watson {{reaching}} the 2011 French Open second round, Andy Murray commented [...] "When I saw {{her for the}} first time, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was good. I like the way she moves on the court. She's very balanced". Bollettieri stated that Watson's [...] "game is based on great movement, but she's not afraid to whack the ball. She's not easy to beat. She has very good ground strokes, though she can over-hit and strike the ball a little too flat at times".|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Avis was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis. She died later that year, {{at the age of}} 58. Of his loss, Blake said, [...] "In my life I never knew what it was to be alone. At first when Avis got sick, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> just had a cold, but when time passed and she didn’t get better, I made her go to a doctor and we found out she had TB … I suppose I knew from when we found out she had the TB, I understood that {{it was just a matter}} of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the George Ryder Stakes at Rosehill on 19 March, she again won at short odds, beating Kermadec {{by one and}} a half lengths. On 2 April, the filly started odds-on {{favourite}} for the A$3 million Doncaster Mile at Randwick despite carrying top {{weight in}} a fifteen-runner field on unsuitably soft ground. She looked unlikely to obtain a clear run in the straight but broke through in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Happy Clapper. Waller commented, [...] "I'll call her a champion while I can speak. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was beaten at the half-mile. She must have an amazing will to win." ...|$|E
60|$|I smiled, and, {{looking into}} her eyes, {{was struck by}} their velvet softness. <b>I</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was as charming as she was beautiful.|$|R

2500|$|Notably, Gurinder Chadha {{previously}} {{directed the}} film What's Cooking, which featured Julianna Margulies and Kyra Sedgwick as a lesbian couple. Chadha is {{claimed to have}} softened the lesbian angle, to a case of [...] "crossed wires" [...] and jokes like [...] "Lesbian? Her birthday's in March. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a Pisces," [...] to make the film more marketable - something which has not gone down well with all gay reviewers. However, Jess' male friend Tony was retained as a sympathetic gay character. Bend it like Beckham also won an award for [...] "Outstanding Film" [...] from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Harris {{appeared}} {{in one of}} her signature film roles in Robert Altman's masterpiece Nashville, playing [...] "Albuquerque", a ditzy, scantily clad country singing hopeful who may be far more opportunistic and calculating than she would first appear. [...] Accounts of the film's chaotic and inspired production, particularly in Jan Stuart's book The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece, indicate a clash between actress and director. Harris earned a Golden Globe nomination (one of 11 for the film); as Oscar-nominated co-star Lily Tomlin put it, [...] "I was the hugest of Barbara Harris fan; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was so stunning and original." [...] Although the two were set to reunite with Altman in a sequel, that film was never made.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} she would return in 2004, Benjamin said, [...] "I loved Lisa. She was a great {{character}} and I loved playing all those story lines. It was a wonderful opportunity for me but all that angst and that drama can sometimes get to you. She hasn't been killed off. Loads of characters are revived and brought back but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do again at the moment. It still feels like only yesterday I was there and it's good to kind of recharge your batteries and {{get out there and}} do other things. But I love the show and I’d never say never! And I liked playing Lisa. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a great character so you just don’t know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Didn’t <b>I?</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> did,” <b>she</b> said innocently. I felt {{a sudden}} desire {{to get out of}} that house, to fly from the {{reinforced}} Blunt element which was to me so oppressive.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has made}} one guess that is right, and broken {{one of my}} neatest enchantments. By ricketty, it's too bad! <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would do it." ...|$|R
