5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gas {{mixtures}} {{of three or}} more gases are also available. Mixtures of argon, carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels. Other mixtures add {{a small amount of}} helium to argon-oxygen combinations, these mixtures are claimed to allow higher arc voltages and welding speed. Helium also sometimes serves as the base gas, with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added. However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at shielding the weld than argonwhich is denser than air. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases. Other specialized and often proprietary gas mixtures claim even greater benefits for specific applications.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be {{referred}} to as the radial distance from a given axis at which the mass of a body could be concentrated without altering the rotational inertia of the body about that axis.|$|E

25|$|Excreted by tubular secretion, {{therefore}} in severe kidney impairment (GFR 5–10ml/min) lower doses are required due to accumulation in the body. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> cause further kidney damage {{and should be}} administered with caution.|$|E
25|$|Chilled brood is not {{actually}} a disease, {{but can be}} a result of mistreatment of the bees by the beekeeper. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be caused by a pesticide hit that primarily kills off the adult population, or by a sudden drop in temperature during rapid spring buildup.|$|E
25|$|Amber is fossilized sap {{from tree}} trunks; {{it is used}} for jewelry and may contain ancient animals. Resins from conifer wood are used to produce {{turpentine}} and rosin. Tree bark is often used as a mulch and in growing media for container plants. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> become the natural habitat of lichens.|$|E
50|$|Rice Video {{supports}} scaling filters such as 2xSaI, Scale2X or the HQXX (HQ2x/HQ3x/HQ4x) filters, and {{has many}} options available, {{making it a}} very customizable plug-in. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be used to dump games' original textures in PNG, JPEG, and BMP formats.|$|R
5000|$|Gerasimos (Γεράσιμος) is a Greek {{given name}} derived from Greek [...] "γῆρας" [...] ("geras", [...] "old age, elder"). <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be anglicized as [...] "Gerassimos" [...] or [...] "Gerasimus". <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be slavicized as Gerasim (Герасим; [...] ).|$|R
50|$|Hydrobromic acid has {{commonly}} {{been prepared}} industrially by reacting bromine with either sulfur or phosphorus and water. However, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be produced electrolytically. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be prepared by treating bromides with non-oxidising acids like phosphoric or acetic acids.|$|R
25|$|When mass {{immunization}} {{programs are}} part of the health services in FID, it can be wise to avoid extreme measures to keep insurgents from receiving immunization. Increasing overall population immunity benefits all in the country, especially if the insurgency ends. In disaster situations, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> provide long-term benefits not to check identification as closely as might be done in other situations.|$|E
25|$|According to Danish scholar Miriam K. Zeitzen, anthropologists treat serial monogamy, {{in which}} divorce and {{remarriage}} occur, {{as a form}} of polygamy as <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> establish a series of households that may continue to be tied by shared paternity and shared income. As such, they are similar to the household formations created through divorce and serial monogamy.|$|E
25|$|Carotenemia or hyper{{carotene}}mia is excess carotene, {{but unlike}} excess vitamin A, carotene is non-toxic. Although hypercarotenemia {{is not particularly}} dangerous, {{it can lead to}} an oranging of the skin (carotenodermia), but not the conjunctiva of eyes (thus easily distinguishing it visually from jaundice). It is most commonly associated with consumption of an abundance of carrots, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be a medical sign of more dangerous conditions.|$|E

25|$|Romani {{are known}} {{throughout}} Turkey for their musicianship. Their urban music brought echoes of classical Turkish {{music to the}} public via the meyhane or taverna. This type of fasıl music (a style, {{not to be confused}} with the fasıl form of classical Turkish music) with food and alcoholic beverages is often associated with the underclass of Turkish society, though <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be found in more respectable establishments in modern times.|$|E
25|$|As an {{antibody}} technique, immunohistochemistry (IHC) {{allows for}} validating protein presence. It, and immunocytochemistry, allow for surveying the localization of proteases on a tissue or cellular scale respectively. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> evaluate for the localization of cleavage products using monoclonal antibodies raised against neo-epitopes of cleavage sites produced by protease processing. Unfortunately, {{in addition to}} providing little functional information, IHC is also non-quantitative, making it an unappealing option for describing degradomics on system-wide scales.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{equation}} governs heat diffusion, {{as well as}} other diffusive processes, such as particle diffusion or the propagation of action potential in nerve cells. Although they are not diffusive in nature, some quantum mechanics problems are also governed by a mathematical analog of the {{heat equation}} (see below). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be used to model some phenomena arising in finance, like the Black–Scholes or the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The equation, and various non-linear analogues, has also been used in image analysis.|$|E

25|$|Carbon dioxide {{is removed}} from the {{atmosphere}} primarily through photosynthesis and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water (oceans, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. When dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidity. It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> acidify other surfaces it touches or be washed into the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Influencing social {{interactions}} are {{introduced in the}} University expansion pack. A Sim is able to influence another Sim to complete a social interaction or a chore. Sims gain influence points by completing Wants and can lose influence points by completing Fears. The size of the influence bar depends {{on the number of}} friends the Sim has. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> grow in size with business perks from the Open for Business expansion pack. Influence was also in the Nightlife expansion but added nothing.|$|E
25|$|A {{dome car}} {{is a type of}} railway {{passenger}} car that has a glass dome {{on the top of the}} car where passengers can ride and see in all directions around the train. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> include features of a coach, lounge car, dining car, sleeping car or observation. Beginning in 1945, dome cars were primarily used in the United States and Canada, though a small number were constructed in Europe for Trans Europ Express service, and similar panorama cars are in service on Alpine tourist railways like the Bernina Express.|$|E

50|$|A Knox-Box can simplify {{key control}} for local fire departments. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> cut fire losses for {{building}} owners since firefighters can enter buildings without breaking doors or windows. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> reduce {{the potential of}} a firefighter being injured forcing entry.|$|R
25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|E
25|$|MRSA is an {{infection}} {{that has a}} resistance to certain antibiotics this is why MRSA is so dangerous and hard to treat. MRSA stands for Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus, which {{is a form of}} a staph infection. Any athlete who develops a skin infection should be checked by doctor immediately. Also, one should resist from trying to give themselves self care. When getting MRSA treated for they tend to make an incision and drain the infected area. MRSA can become life-threatening if it reaches the blood stream <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> cause infections on surgical sites that can cause major implications, and can even cause an pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Rats {{raised with}} {{environmental}} enrichment have thicker cerebral cortices(3.3–7%) that contain 25% more synapses. This effect of environmental richness upon the brain occurs {{whether it is}} experienced immediately following birth, after weaning, or during maturity. When synapse numbers increase in adults, they can remain high in number even when the adults are returned to impoverished environment for 30 days suggesting that such increases in synapse numbers are not necessarily temporary. However, the increase in synapse numbers has been observed generally to reduce with maturation. Stimulation affects not only synapses upon pyramidal neurons (the main projecting neurons in the cerebral cortex) but also stellate ones (that are usually interneurons). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> affect neurons outside the brain in the retina.|$|E
