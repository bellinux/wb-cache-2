25|$|The {{game has}} the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various {{activities}} and form relationships {{in a manner similar}} to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims <b>have</b> <b>life</b> goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearean characters.|$|E

This study described the characteristics of patients who <b>had</b> <b>life</b> support limitations in ICU and their subsequent in-hospital and out-of-hospital survival using linked data from the state’s death registry. Among 26, 019 ICU admissions between 1987 and 2002 there were 396 patients (1. 5 %) who <b>had</b> <b>life</b> support limitations.

500|$|Cicadas have {{prominent}} eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have {{an exceptionally}} loud song, produced not by stridulation, but by vibrating drumlike tymbals rapidly. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha {{appeared in the}} Upper Permian period; extant species occur {{all around the world}} in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees, feeding on sap and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic, singing at night to avoid predators. The periodic cicadas spend most of their lives as underground nymphs, emerging only after 13 or 17 years, which may reduce losses by starving their predators and eventually emerging in huge numbers that overwhelm and satiate any remaining predators. The annual cicadas are species that emerge every year. Though these cicada <b>have</b> <b>life</b> cycles that can vary from one to nine or more years as underground larvae, their emergence above ground as adults is not synchronized so some appear every year.|$|E
500|$|The strictest {{definition}} of [...] "plant" [...] includes only the [...] "land plants" [...] or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, clubmosses, liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis. They <b>have</b> <b>life</b> cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, {{known as the}} gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for {{at least part of}} its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in bacteriology), fungi (mycology) – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.|$|E

The Passion narrative opens with {{an account of}} the Last Supper that differs significantly from that found in the synoptics, with Jesus washing the disciples' feet instead of ushering in a new covenant of his body and blood. This is followed by Jesus' Farewell Discourse, an account of his betrayal, arrest, trial, death, burial, post-Resurrection appearances, and final commission for his followers. It also includes Peter's denial, the institution of the New Commandment and the New Covenant, the promise of the Paraclete, the allegory of the True Vine, the High Priestly Prayer, the ut omnes unum sint, the What is truth?, Jesus' mocking and crowning with thorns, the Ecce homo, the discovery of the empty tomb, the noli me tangere, the Great Commission, and the incredulity of Thomas.

Brainerd with his wife, Harriet, raised five children in the [...] by [...] farmhouse. At some point ownership of the property was transferred to Geraldine W. Hayden in a will.

A report by the Connecticut State Park and Forest Commission noted {{that it was not}} an ideal situation due the concerns about identifying a proposed site in advance and establishing the adaptability of the land for public use. The report also notes that Mrs. Hayden was unknown to the commissioners and despite the land having significant liabilities was waiting to become a state park by 1930. The delay in its transformation stemmed from a request that William Brainerd, one of Selden and Harriet's sons, <b>have</b> <b>life</b> use of the property. William Brainerd died in 1936 and the terms of the will were completed. At a later date, the State of Connecticut dismantled the buildings and established the Brainard Homestead State Park.|$|E

500|$|Speculation over Hamnet's {{influence}} on Shakespeare's works {{is not limited}} to Hamlet. Richard Wheeler theorises that Hamnet's death influenced the writing of Twelfth Night, which centres on a girl who believes that her twin brother has died. In the end, she finds that her brother never died, but is alive and well. Wheeler also posits the idea that the women who disguise themselves as men in The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, and Twelfth Night are a representation of William Shakespeare's seeing his son's hope in his daughters after Hamnet's death. Bill Bryson argues that Constance's speech from the third act of King John (written mid-1590s) was inspired by Hamnet's death. In the speech she laments the loss of her son, Arthur. It is possible, though, that Hamnet was still alive when Constance's lament was written. Many other plays of Shakespeare's have theories surrounding Hamnet. These include questions as to whether a scene in Julius Caesar, in which Caesar adopts Mark Antony as a replacement for his dead son is related to Hamnet's death, or whether Romeo and Juliet is a tragic reflection of the loss of a son, or Alonso's guilt over his son's death in The Tempest is related. Sonnet 37 may have also been written in response to Hamnet's death. Shakespeare says in it, [...] "As a decrepit father takes delight / To see his active child do deeds of youth / So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spight / Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth." [...] Still, if this is an allusion to Hamnet, it is a vague one. The grief can echo also {{in one of the most}} painful passages Shakespeare ever wrote, in the end of King Lear where the ruined monarch recognizes his daughter is dead: [...] "No, no, no life! / Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, <b>have</b> <b>life,</b> / And thou no breath at all?
