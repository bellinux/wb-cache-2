40|$|A {{study to}} {{optimize}} insulation thickness for stock-, industrial- and office-buildings for external walls and roof in an economical perspective {{has been conducted}} on behalf of DynaMate. DynaMate’s role is to maintain all Scania’s buildings. Analysis has also included {{other parts of the}} building envelope, such as windows, exterior <b>doors</b> and <b>industrial</b> <b>doors.</b> In this thesis, three different types of exterior wall constructions has been investigated, these are a sandwich design consisting of sheet metal and a another one consisting of concrete, as well as a wall of concrete with a coating of plasters. Furthermore, two types of roof structures have been studied, these are TRP-sheets and a concrete structure, both of which are externally isolated. For all types of building envelopes, different standard thicknesses of insulation have been used and the U-value of the windows has been varied. To calculate the energy needed for the different kinds of buildings, the program IDA Indoor Climate and Energy has been used.   Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the air tightness has been implemented for the building envelope. Based on the program results LCC (Life-cycle cost) calculations have been carried out for all combinations, thus be able to form an idea of ​​the combination and what kind of structure that is most economically tenable. A thermograph study was conducted in an existing warehouse at Scania. Observations show that the connection between the sandwich material of sheet metal and the foundation wall is flawed as this has a much lower thermal resistance compared {{to other parts of the}} building envelope. An alternative connection was developed which reduces the heat loss to one-fifth of the initial connection. An analysis regarding the companies approach to the vapour barrier in roof structures for industrial buildings has been investigated from a moisture standpoint. The analysis shows that without a functioning vapour barrier the moisture content in the construction increases over time, which leads to increased heating costs. The conclusion of this study shows that a reduction of insulation thickness for all types of studied buildings is more economically tenable than increasing the thickness. This is mainly due to the high cost of capital that the company uses for these investments. This means that any savings on cooling and heating costs very quickly is overthrown by the interest rate of the additional cost of the investment...|$|R

40|$|Many {{changes in}} {{building}} construction cost evoked by inflation recently, make {{an analysis of}} the relation between building construction cost and inflation is needed. In this analysis linear regression method is used to obtain the influence of inflation to building construction cost and the relationship between this two parameter. Element with the highest influence of inflation to precentage cost and per square meter cost for industrial building, housing and office building is structure. Element which precentage cost has the closest relationship with inflation is sitework for industrial building, structure for housing, thermal and moisture protection for office building. Element which per square meter cost has the closest relationship with inflation for <b>industrial</b> building is <b>doors</b> and windows, structure for housing, thermal and moisture protection for office building Abstract in Bahasa Indonesia : Banyaknya perubahan dalam biaya konstruksi bangunan akibat laju inflasi yang terjadi beberapa tahun terakhir ini, mendorong diperlukannya analisa hubungan antara biaya konstruksi bangunan dengan inflasi.
