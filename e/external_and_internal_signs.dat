40|$|The Scuticociliatosis, {{a disease}} caused by ciliates from the order Scuticociliatida {{characterized}} by their high potential {{to invade the}} host, {{is a serious problem}} in marine aquaculture. This paper describes scuticociliatosis infection in farmed flounder Paralichthys adspersus. <b>External</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> <b>signs</b> of infection include necrotic areas in the tegument, abundant mucus, swelling of the visceral cavity with ascitic fluid accumulation, necrotic muscle fibers and brain liquefaction, among others. The ciliate parasite was molecularly identified and characterized as M. avidus, using sequences of mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI), and nuclear genes β-tubulin and the region of the small subunit 18 S rRNA, showing synonymy with P. dicentrarchi. All lesions were infested by ciliates. Histologically, ciliates are detected in almost all tissues being the brain the organ more parasitized. The infected specimens associated with secondary bacterial infections, predominantly Vibrio alginolyticus, died after a lethargy period...|$|E
40|$|The article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} authorship and concomitant authenticity of treasure texts, a body of prophetic literature, discovered by Tibetan lamas, so-called ‘Treasure Revealers’ (gter ston), who belong to the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. 	After {{an overview of the}} structure and transmission of Treasures, the text titled Sbas yul spyi'i them byang (General description of Hidden Lands) is used as an example, a Treasure text of the Byang gter lugs kyi rnam thar dang ma 'ongs lung bstan (Biographies and Prophecies of the Northern Tresure tradition) collection, that gives {{a detailed description of the}} <b>external</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> <b>signs</b> of decline, the time when people need to leave Tibet due to foreign invasion, civil war and moral decline. It is a visionary guide book to hidden lands, and not only suggests ways to get there, but also provides instructions of how the land could be tamed, where temples should be built, or religious communities needed to be established. 	By shortly presenting and analysing some parts of the text, trying to find answers why a text in spite of being a compilation is attributed to a certain author, and what reasoning the followers of the Nyingma school use to prove that Treasure texts are also authentic teachings, the words of the Buddha. ...|$|E

Materials and Methods. There have been examined 146 patients with anomalies in Calot triangle area compared to classical anatomy revealed intraoperatively and 60 patients with such abnormalities. All the patients were thoroughly examined in order to reveal external phenotypic signs of abnormalities. The presence of internal features was revealed by instrumental technique. Conclusion. <b>External</b> <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> connective tissue dysplasia can serve as indicators of possible anomalies in anatomical structures of Calot triangle.
