5|$|Later twentieth-century <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{based on}} the area's natural beauty. In the 1960s, the {{affluent}} resort of Key Allegro, located between Rockport and Fulton, was founded. By 2000, 24,615 people lived in the surrounding Aransas County, including the cities of Rockport, Fulton, Aransas Pass and the unincorporated Key Allegro, Holiday Beach and Estes. The outer Refugio County located {{on the shore of}} Copano Bay, had 7,828 residents.|$|E
5|$|Merchandise {{based on}} Naruto {{includes}} figurines and keychains. Naruto's character <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> praised by anime and manga publications, and has drawn scholarly attention. Although some initially {{saw him as}} a typical manga and anime protagonist comparable to those in other shōnen manga, others have praised his personality and development as he avoids stereotypes.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the jobless nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E

50|$|Development {{of another}} followup, Airline Simulator 3, <b>had</b> long <b>been</b> teased by Nomissoft founder Simon Hradecky in {{parallel}} with Airline Simulator 2s development, but within weeks of AS2s release, AS3s <b>development</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken over by Aerosoft, a German company. Again, development stagnated, and finally in January 2013, the company confirmed that <b>development</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> ceased and the project written off.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} {{paleontology}} traces {{the history of}} the effort to understand the history of life on Earth by studying the fossil record left behind by living organisms. Since it is concerned with understanding living organisms of the past paleontology can be considered to be a field of biology, but its historical <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> closely tied to geology and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, a {{catalytic}} <b>development,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> initiated {{headed by}} the Government of Serbia aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy by revitalizing the Sava amphitheater, a neglected stretch of land on the right bank of the Sava river, between the Belgrade Fair and Belgrade Main railway station. Around €3.5 billion will be invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and Belgrade Tower. The project is, however, considered by many as 'controversial', since {{there are a number}} of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, as well as chosen architectural solutions.|$|E
5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in new product <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E

5|$|Ostrom's {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969 {{has been described}} as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> termed the dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of Deinonychus and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. <b>Development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> slow and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E
5|$|Male horn <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{linked to}} sexual selection, Horns are small spikes in the monogamous duikers {{and other small}} antelopes, whereas in the polygynous, they are large and elaborately formed (for example in a spiral structure, as in the giant eland). Thus, to some extent, horns depict the degree of {{competition}} among males in a species. However, the presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection. The horns of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. The horns of female bovids {{are believed to have}} evolved for defence against predators or to express territoriality, as nonterritorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defence, often do not have horns. Females possess horns only in half of the bovid genera, and females in these genera are heavier than those in the rest. Females use horns mainly for stabbing.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{exciting}} recent <b>developments</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{the use of}} Digital Conversations to drive Avatars.|$|R

5|$|On the {{southern}} {{side of the}} town, on a triangle of land bounded on the east by the A37, on the north by {{the line of the}} former East Somerset Railway, and on the west by Cannard's Grave Road, is Tadley Acres, a modern housing development built on land partly belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall. The <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> praised for the quality of its design and the use of locally sourced natural building materials. North of the former railway line is Collett Park. Across Cannard's Grave Road from Tadley Acres is the Mid-Somerset Showground. Immediately to the south-west of the town centre, on a site which {{at the start of the}} 20th century had been the grounds of the former Summerleaze House and then a shoe-factory, is the Townsend Retail Park, built in 2006–7.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood <b>development</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E
