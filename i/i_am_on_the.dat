500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg of you to release me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of breaking down & I cannot use my brain for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It was an awful wrench, but I had no choice from the moment it was made {{clear to me that}} the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E

Colin Egglesfield, Josh's portrayer, when queried by Soap Opera Digest on the matter of possibly holding the record in daytime for the oddest way to be brought into the world, replied, [...] "Yeah, and it's kind of funny because when people ask me who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show, I like to say, 'I'm the abortion of Erica Kane.' Or, technically, I think it's a 'transportion.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Nadezhda von Meck was a professed atheist, {{which was}} not unusual in aristocratic Russia in the 1870s. Her fierce need for independence, on the other hand, was very unusual for {{a woman of the}} time. Her {{division}} between that and concern for her family resulted in contradictions between her beliefs and actions. Her views on affairs of the heart were strictly moral, but she did not believe in marriage as a social institution and regularly professed her hatred of it to Tchaikovsky. [...] "You may think, my dear Pyotr Ilyich, that I am a great admirer of marriage," [...] she wrote on 31 March 1878, [...] "but in order that you not be mistaken in anything referring to myself, I shall tell you that <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> contrary, an irreconcilable enemy of marriages, yet when I discuss another person's situation, I consider it necessary to do so from his point of view." [...] On another occasion, she stated more genially but no less forcefully, [...] "The distribution of rights and obligations as determined by social laws I find speculative and immoral." ...|$|E

40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex class I (MHC I) proteins provide protection from intracellular pathogens and cancer via each of a cell's MHC I molecules binding and presenting a peptide to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. MHC <b>I</b> genes <b>are</b> highly polymorphic and can have significant diversity, with polymorphisms predominantly localised in the peptide-binding groove {{where they can}} change peptide-binding specificity. However, polymorphic residues may also determine other functional properties, such as how dependent MHC <b>I</b> alleles <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peptide-loading complex for optimal acquisition of peptide cargo. We describe how differences in the peptide-binding properties of two MHC I alleles correlates with altered conformational flexibility in the peptide-empty state. We hypothesise that plasticity is an intrinsic property encoded by the protein sequence, and that co-ordinated movements of the membrane-proximal and membrane-distal domains collectively determines how dependent MHC <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peptide-loading complex for efficient assembly with high affinity peptides...|$|R
