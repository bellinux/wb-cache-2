25|$|A {{variety of}} running events are {{held on the}} track which fall into three broad {{distance}} categories: sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance track events. Relay races feature teams comprising four runners each, who must pass a baton to their teammate after a specified distance {{with the aim of}} being the first team to finish. Hurdling events and the steeplechase are a variation upon the <b>flat</b> <b>running</b> theme in that athletes must clear obstacles on the track during the race. The field events come in two types – jumping and throwing competitions. In throwing events, athletes are measured by how far they hurl an implement, with the common events being the shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throw. There are four common jumping events: the long jump and triple jump are contests measuring the horizontal distance an athlete can jump, while the high jump and pole vault are decided on the height achieved. Combined events, which include the decathlon (typically competed by men) and heptathlon (typically competed by women), are competitions where athletes compete {{in a number of different}} track and field events, with each performance going toward a final points tally.|$|E

50|$|By {{changing}} the cadence (the {{speed at which}} the pedals turn). Pedaling {{at a higher rate}} expends more energy than pedaling at a lower rate with the same resistance. Correct cadence is between the range of 80 to 110 RPM for seated flat, standing <b>flat</b> (<b>running)</b> and jumping and 60 to 80 RPM for seated climb, standing climb, running with resistance and jumps on a hill. Sprints are taken under hill resistance building cadence up to no more than 110 RPM. Seated sprints are most suitable as the rider maintains full control of posture at all times and will avoid falling due to exhaustion. A correct sprint should last from 10 to 25 seconds, leaving the rider exhausted in the 85 to 92% max heart rate range.|$|E

After its rounded tip it gradually curves downwards again towards the skull top; its further shape is unknown because at this point the fossil ends.

5000|$|Along with mate changes, EPF's (extra pair fertilisations) {{are also}} {{witnessed}} in some populations, by females copulating with extra-pair males (EPP- extra pair paternity), or males copulating with extra pair females, who then {{lay their eggs}} in the male's nest (QP- quasi-parasitism). A theory as to why such EPC's occur is that this mechanism evolved to avoid the deleterious effects of inbreeding. This {{is supported by a}} study by Blomqvist et al., showing that EPC's are more common when a breeding pair are more closely related to each other. Another theory is that females may seek out EPC's with high quality males to get the ‘good genes’ for their sons, following the ‘sexy sons’ hypothesis. The breeding season of Kentish plovers lasts on average between 2 and 5 months and varies in the time of year dependent on the particular population. Breeding pairs can replace failed clutches more than once per breeding season, with the same or a different mate, and both males and females can parent more than one brood, due to mate change and EPC's as mentioned above. The courtship displays also vary between populations of plovers, especially between socially monogamous and polygamous populations, for example in polygamous populations the time spent courting is significantly higher {{for both males and females}} than in monogamous populations. Courtship displays include active gestures such as <b>flat</b> <b>running,</b> building nest scrapes (small shallow cavities in the ground that are later built into nests), and fighting/running to defend a breeding territory (mainly by males) ...|$|E

50|$|Scattered {{over the}} area are some {{thickets}} of gorse and broom, {{as well as a}} number of small woods and copses.

Paved shoulders are made with paving {{the part of the}} shoulder, in order to obtain a smooth and <b>flat</b> <b>running</b> surface, which is primarily used for recreational road cyclists. At the same time classic edge line is replaced by edge line rumble strip/stripe, whose characteristics and impact of the use of the road-safety point of view and in terms of impact on ride comfort of cyclists are given in the fourth chapter. I considered the regulations and recommendations of the designed bike areas in Slovenia and elsewhere in the world, where paved shoulders already exist. Then a Bicycle Compatibility Index method to determine the level of service on rural roads, and the effect of individual parameters on the bicycle level of service is presented. I first analyzed some examples of existing approximations of bake lanes on paved shoulders and then did the calculations for each of them separately, using the BCI method. After that an analysis of the results and measures to improve the current level of service with regard to road safety, which {{is directly related to the}} level of service were made. At the end of the thesis there is a short chapter on the implementation of paved shoulders at the intersections, followed by a chapter about maintenance of paved shoulders and rumble strips/stripes...|$|E

The day will include 116 km of cycling, 12 km of hill runs, 12 km of hill descents and 20 km of <b>flat</b> <b>running.</b> “After last year’s effort with the stair climbing at Jacob’s Ladder in Kings Park, I {{had to come up with}} another crazy event.

Things kick off at City Beach with a series of runs on the groyne, then onto Reabold Hill, Kings Park’s Cardiac Hill, Mount Pain (Mount Street Perth), a bridges run, then onto Brigadoon, two venues in Kalamunda, back for a Canning –Mt Henry bridge run and finishing off with 10 laps of Jacob’s Ladder – all connected by cycling. The event will raise money for Variety WA, which supports sick, disadvantaged and special needs children. “I hope to raise $ 10, 000 through the event by people and companies sponsoring the participating athletes.
