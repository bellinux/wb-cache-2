5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem is <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra {{space between the}} top of the cargo and {{the top of the}} hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E

At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounced.</b> Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E
5|$|Ruth had {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounced.</b> While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E

30|$|Mechanisms {{contributing}} to the presumed cellular activation and the subsequent MV generation within the hemofilter might include a high shear stress or contact with the hemofilter membrane [5 – 7, 23 – 25]. Such effects of CVVH might <b>even</b> be <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in a septic state where cells are already preactivated or highly susceptible to activation. Accordingly, septic shock patients exhibit already threefold higher levels of presumably mostly leukocyte-derived CD 31 +/CD 41 − MV compared to healthy subjects, as recently reported [19]. As calcium is a key mediator for neutrophil degranulation that is induced by dialysis membranes [23] and as influx of extracellular calcium is required for vesiculation of platelets induced by shear stress [24] one might speculate that MV release might <b>even</b> be <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in CVVH without citrate anticoagulation [6], but {{this needs to be}} tested.|$|R

5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E

30|$|In our study, however, {{we could}} not detect a {{positive}} effect of sirolimus coating with regard to granulation tissue formation.

30|$|It {{remains unclear}} how {{extensive}} peritoneal lavage should be done. It {{is unclear whether}} the upper abdomen should be included and whether lavage should be continued until the fluid is clear. The lower postoperative CRP concentrations after extensive lavage demonstrate, at least, that the postoperative inflammatory reaction is decreased in women who had a full thickness resection with an open bowel. It seems logic to postulate {{that the effect of}} extensive lavage will <b>even</b> be <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> when the abdominal bacterial load is more severe as in peritonitis. In the absence of negative side effects, we therefore suggest that more extensive peritoneal lavage should be considered to decrease the postoperative inflammatory reaction.|$|R

25|$|Because the Roman Catholic Church {{had played}} such an {{important}} role in the Reconquista (Christian reconquest) of the Iberian peninsula from the Moors, the Church in essence became another arm of the Spanish government. The Spanish Crown granted it a large role in the administration of the state, and this practice became <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in the New World, where prelates often assumed the role of government officials. In addition to the Church's explicit political role, the Catholic faith became a central part of Spanish identity after the conquest of last Muslim kingdom in the peninsula, the Emirate of Granada, and the expulsion of all Jews who did not convert to Christianity.|$|E

40|$|The Terminator Effect (TE) on {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves or Schumann Resonances (SR) was investigated {{on the basis of}} observations during a number of years at different mid-latitude stations [Hollister (36. 8 degrees N, 121. 5 degrees W, SAO, USA), Mitzpe Ramon (30. 5 degrees N, 34. 4 degrees E, MR, Israel) and Nagycenk (47. 6 N, 16. 7 E, NC, Hungary) ]. Definite shifts are observed in the SR magnetic and electric field characteristics during local sunrise and sunset. The terminator passage influences all magnetic field components at SAO, with more significant effects in the east-west component. At MR and NC stations notable effects were observed only in the vertical electric field. The TE is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in higher SR modes (14, 20 Hz) compared with the 8 Hz mode. Furthermore, the TE is <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in the morning than <b>evening,</b> and <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in winter than in summer. All these observations indicate that, in addition to diurnal-seasonal thunderstorm source motions, lateral ionospheric gradients across the terminator region have significant influences on ELF wave propagation.

5000|$|The {{presence}} of the TLR {{as well as other}} primitive reflexes such as the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR) beyond {{the first six months of}} life may indicate that the child has developmental delays and/or neurological abnormalities.

The TLR and ATNR both hinder functional activities such as rolling, bringing the hands together, or even bringing the hands to the mouth. Over time, both the TLR and ATNR can cause serious damage to the growing child's joints and bones, causing the head of the femur to partially slip out of the acetabulum (subluxation) or completely move out of the acetabulum (dislocation).|$|R
25|$|The Lusatian culture lasted on Polish lands from 1450 to 250 BC, {{through the}} {{remainder}} of the Bronze Age (middle and late periods) and then into the Iron Age, from 750 BC on. Although archeologically it presents itself in a fairly uniform way, it {{is believed to have been}} ethnically non-homogeneous, originating in the interplay between groups arriving from outside and populations in existence in Poland, in which new cultural patterns were adopted. The east-west cultural disparity continued: For example, the use of metal objects was less common in the eastern regions, while in the western zone besides the urns the burials contained often many other vessels. The western zone ceramics of the early Lusatian period had very prominent protuberances around the lower part of the container.

25|$|The Atlantic {{coast of}} the United States is low, with minor exceptions. The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast-southwest trend to crustal {{deformations}} which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian mountain system. This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or {{to the survival of}} the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{has been}} Thailand's largest {{population}} centre since its establishment as capital city in 1782, Bangkok grew only slightly throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries. British diplomat John Crawfurd, visiting in 1822, estimated its population at no more than 50,000. As a result of Western medicine brought by missionaries as well as increased immigration from both within Siam and overseas, Bangkok's population gradually increased as the city modernized in the late 19th century. This growth became <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> in the 1930s, following the discovery of antibiotics. Although family planning and birth control {{was introduced in the}} 1960s, the lowered birth rate was more than offset by increased migration from the provinces as economic expansion accelerated. Only in the 1990s have Bangkok's population growth rates decreased, following the national rate. Thailand had long since become highly centralized around the capital.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we reexamine the sheet-flow model {{proposed}} by Fung and Sobin (1969) for blood flow in capillaries in the pulmonary alveoli from micromechanical point of view. The pulmonary alveolar capillary {{is assumed to}} be two parallel membranes connected by periodic tissue posts. Blood is spread out into the very thin layer or sheet between the two membranes. The pulmonary alveolar sheet thus has a microstructure of hexagonal cells. A two-scale theory of homogenization is used to establish the canonical equations for the unit cell. The microscale solution is obtained by means of finite element method and the macroscopic pressure/discharge relationship for the flow in the pulmonary alveolar sheet is found through an average over the unit cell. The influence of cell geometry on the permeability and geometric friction factor of the cell are discussed through numerical examples. The tissue posts {{have a significant effect on}} the flow resistance. Reducing either the post diameter or the vascular space tissue ratio will reduce permeability. For the post configuration considered, with a post volume of 4. 5 % of the cell, the ratio of permeability to that of Couette flow (K- 11 /K- 0) changes from 0. 8 to about 0. 3 when the sheet gap to post diameter ratio (h/a) increases from 1 to 5. The reduction in permeability is <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounce</b> with denser posts. At h/a = 5, K- 11 /K- 0 is only about 0. 3 for the post volume of 4. 5 % of the cell.

2500|$|The Mithraic Mysteries, colloquially {{also known}} as Mithraism, was a 1st–4th century neo-platonic mystery cult of the Roman god Mithras.

Until the 1970s most scholars followed Franz Cumont in identifying Mithras as {{a continuation of the}} Persian god Mithra.

40|$|Popular belief has {{commonly}} held {{that participation in}} outdoor recreation activities {{can lead to a}} heightened level of concern for the environment. Participation that reflects a greater degree of commitment may perhaps have <b>even</b> a <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> role in this presumed proposition.

Place attachment served as the conceptual link between each of those two constructs. Results indicated that serious leisure participation was a significant predictor in climbers’ concern for the environment. Although place attachment was not found to mediate that effect, results suggested that serious leisure participation influenced the type of attachment reported by climbers. Findings from the study can provide resource managers and planners with {{a better understanding of how}} climbers of certain skill levels may view and value the places they visit...|$|R
25|$|Libya’s {{isolation}} became <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> {{following the}} 1992 imposition of United Nations sanctions designed to force Gaddafi {{to hand over}} two suspects indicted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The sanctions, imposed on 31 March 1992, initially banned sales of equipment for refining and transporting oil, but excluded oil production equipment. Sanctions were expanded on 11 November 1993, to include a freeze on Libya's overseas assets, excluding revenue from oil, natural gas, or agricultural products. Under these condition, NOC Chairman Abdallah al-Badri emphasized reducing new projects and upgrading domestic facilities. Joint ventures were initiated with Veba, Petrofina, North African Petroleum, the Petroleum Development Co. (Republic of Korea) and Lasmo.

40|$|Increasing {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that DNA vaccine {{is of interest}} to fight chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We used the Pekin duck infected by duck HBV (DHBV), {{closely related to the}} human virus, which is an attractive model allowing study of protective and therapeutic effectiveness of DNA vaccines against hepatitis B. Immunisation with a plasmid encoding the DHBV large (L) envelope protein induced a strong, specific, highly neutralising and long-lasting anti-preS humoral response in uninfected ducks. Importantly, maternal antibodies elicited by such DNA immunisation were vertically transmitted and protected progeny against viral challenge. Therapeutic immunisation of chronic DHBV-carrier ducks with this plasmid DNA led to the dramatic and sustained decrease in viral replication and even to clearance of intrahepatic viral covalently close circular DNA (cccDNA) pool in some animals. Our recent combination therapy data showed <b>even</b> a <b>more</b> <b>pronounced</b> antiviral effect of DNA vaccine to DHBV envelope protein when associated with antiviral drug (lamivudine) treatment.

Poststroke depression is frequently diagnosed although it is detected using simple studies (Beck depression inventory, Hamilton rating scale). Psychotherapy is effective in preventing poststroke depression; the efficacy of antidepressants is actively being investigated.
