5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} 3 to over 30years. Adults of most species are of one sex {{throughout}} their lives. The <b>gonads</b> are masses of developing gametes (ova or sperm), and most species have four <b>gonads,</b> two in each valve. Those of articulates {{lie in the}} channels of the mantle lobes, while those of inarticulates lie near the gut. Ripe gametes float into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity via the metanephridia, which open {{on either side of}} the mouth. Most species release both ova and sperm into the water, but females of some species keep the embryos in brood chambers until the larvae hatch.|$|E
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} ovary and testis develop from {{a sexually}} indifferent <b>gonad.</b> During early {{development of the}} organism, primordial germ cells (the gamete lineage) and somatic <b>gonad</b> cells coalesce and begin to undergo growth and morphogenesis to form this bipotential <b>gonad.</b> Although this aspect of development is requisite for a fertile adult, {{little is known about}} the genetic regulation of early gonadogenesis in any vertebrate. Here, we provide evidence that fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling is required for the early growth phase of a vertebrate bipotential <b>gonad.</b> Based on mutational analysis in zebrafish, we show that the Fgf ligand 24 (Fgf 24) is required for proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis of the early somatic <b>gonad,</b> and as a result, most fgf 24 mutants are sterile as adults. Additionally, we describe the ultrastructural elements of the early zebrafish <b>gonad</b> and show that distinct somatic cell populations can be identified soon after the <b>gonad</b> forms. Specifically, we show that fgf 24 is expressed in an epithelial population of early somatic <b>gonad</b> cells that surrounds an inner population of mesenchymal somatic <b>gonad</b> cells that are in direct contact with the germ cells, and that fgf 24 is required for stratification of the somatic tissue. Furthermore, based on gene expression analysis, we find that differentiation of the inner mesenchymal somatic <b>gonad</b> cells into functional cell types in the larval and early juvenile-stage <b>gonad</b> is dependent on Fgf 24 signaling. Finally, we argue that the role of Fgf 24 in zebrafish is functionally analogous to the role of tetrapod FGF 9 in early <b>gonad</b> development...|$|R

40|$|Objective To re-evaluate <b>gonad</b> {{shielding}} in paediatric pelvic radiography {{in terms}} of attainable radiation risk reduction and associated loss of diagnostic information. Methods A study on patient dose {{and the quality of}} <b>gonad</b> shielding was performed retrospectively using 500 pelvic radiographs of children from 0 to 15 years old. In a subsequent study, 195 radiographs without <b>gonad</b> shielding were included. Patient doses and detriment adjusted risks for heritable disease and cancer were calculated with and without <b>gonad</b> shielding. Results For girls, <b>gonad</b> shields were placed incorrectly in 91 % of the radiographs; for boys, in 66 %. Without <b>gonad</b> shielding, the hereditary detriment adjusted risk for girls ranged between 0. 1 ?×? 10 ? 6 and 1. 3 ?×? 10 ? 6 and for boys between 0. 3 ?×? 10 ? 6 and 3. 9 ?×? 10 ? 6, dependent on age. With shielding, the reduction in hereditary risk for girls was on average 6 ?±? 3 % of the total risk of the radiograph, for boys 24 ?±? 6 %. Without <b>gonad</b> shielding, the effective dose ranged from 0. 008 to 0. 098 mSv. Conclusions With modern optimised X-ray systems, the reduction of the detriment adjusted risk by <b>gonad</b> shielding is negligibly small.

5|$|Cnidarian sexual {{reproduction}} often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies) a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally {{into a series}} of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have <b>gonads</b> in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the area}} of Pendjari National Park, almost all West African males are maneless or have very weak manes. Maneless, male African lions have also been {{reported}} from Senegal, from Sudan (Dinder National Park), and from Tsavo East National Park in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless. The testosterone hormone {{has been linked to}} mane growth; therefore, castrated lions often have minimal to no mane, as the removal of the <b>gonads</b> inhibits testosterone production. In addition, increased testosterone may be the cause of the maned lionesses of northern Botswana.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the <b>gonads</b> into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E

5|$|Nemerteans {{often have}} {{numerous}} temporary <b>gonads</b> (ovaries or testes), forming a row down {{each side of}} the body in the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or tube, and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, and some of these are viviparous, growing their embryos in the female's body.|$|E
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential.

Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life.

5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the <b>gonads</b> are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the <b>gonads.</b>|$|E

40|$|SummarySex {{determination}} in Drosophila {{is commonly}} {{thought to be}} a cell-autonomous process, where each cell decides its own sexual fate based on its sex chromosome constitution (XX versus XY). This is in contrast to sex determination in mammals, which largely acts nonautonomously through cell-cell signaling. Here we examine how sexual dimorphism is created in the Drosophila <b>gonad</b> by investigating the formation of the pigment cell precursors, a male-specific cell type in the embryonic <b>gonad.</b> Surprisingly, we find that sex determination in the pigment cell precursors, as well as the male-specific somatic gonadal precursors, is non-cell autonomous. Male-specific expression of Wnt 2 within the somatic <b>gonad</b> triggers pigment cell precursor formation from surrounding cells. Our results indicate that nonautonomous sex determination is important for creating sexual dimorphism in the Drosophila <b>gonad,</b> similar to the manner in which sex-specific <b>gonad</b> formation is controlled in mammals...|$|R
