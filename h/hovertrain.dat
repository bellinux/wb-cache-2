25|$|The Aérotrain was a <b>hovertrain</b> {{developed}} in France from 1965 to 1977. The lead engineer was Jean Bertin.|$|E
25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to adopt air cushion technology for use in fixed track systems, in order to utilize the lower frictional forces for delivering high speeds. The most advanced example of this was the Aérotrain, an experimental high speed <b>hovertrain</b> built and operated in France between 1965 and 1977. The project was abandoned in 1977 due to lack of funding, the death of its lead engineer and the adoption of the TGV by the French government as its high-speed ground transport solution.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. Department of Transport's Urban Mass Transit Administration funded several <b>hovertrain</b> projects, which {{were known as}} Tracked Air Cushion Vehicles or TACVs. They were also known as Aerotrains since one of the {{builders}} had a licence from Bertin's Aerotrain company. Three separate projects were funded. Research and development {{was carried out by}} Rohr, Inc., Garrett AiResearch and Grumman. The UMTA built an extensive test site in Pueblo, Colorado, with different types of tracks for the different technologies used by the prototype contractors. They managed to build prototypes and do a few test runs before the funding was cut.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hovertrains</b> {{were seen}} as a {{relatively}} low-risk and low-cost way to develop high-speed inter-city train service, {{in an era when}} conventional rail seemed stuck to speeds around 140 mph or less. By the late 1960s, major development efforts were underway in France, the UK and the USA. While they were being developed, British Rail was running an extensive study of the problems being seen at high speeds on conventional rails. This led to a series of new high-speed train designs in the 1970s, starting with their own APT. Although the <b>hovertrains</b> still had reduced infrastructure costs compared to the APT and similar designs like the TGV, in practice this was offset by their need for entirely new lines. Conventional wheeled trains could run at low speed on existing lines, greatly reducing capital expenditures in dense areas. Interest in <b>hovertrains</b> waned, and major development had ended by the mid-1970s.|$|R
5000|$|A {{ground effect}} train is an {{alternative}} to a magnetic levitation (maglev) train. In both cases {{the object is to}} prevent the vehicle from making contact with the ground. Whereas a maglev train accomplishes this through the use of magnetism, a ground effect train uses an air cushion; either {{in the manner of a}} hovercraft (as in <b>hovertrains)</b> or using the [...] "wing-in-ground" [...] design.|$|R
50|$|The idea {{of using}} magnets to levitate a train had been {{explored}} throughout the active period of the <b>hovertrains.</b> At first it was believed this would be impractical; if the system used electromagnets, the control systems that ensured even lift across the vehicle would be prohibitively expensive, {{and at the time}} there were no suitably powerful permanent magnets that would be able to lift a train.|$|R
500|$|The Museum has a seven-story deep {{underground}} parking garage with over 1,200 parking spaces. Its roof has an outdoor sculpture garden. An automated three-car, cable-pulled <b>hovertrain</b> funicular, the [...] "Getty Center Tram", takes passengers between {{the parking garage}} {{at the bottom of}} the hill and the Museum at the top of the hill.|$|E
500|$|The Getty Center, in Los Angeles, California, is {{a campus}} of the Getty Museum and other {{programs}} of the Getty Trust. The $1.3 billion Center {{opened to the public}} on December 16, 1997 and is well known for its architecture, gardens, and views overlooking Los Angeles. The Center sits atop a hill connected to a visitors' parking garage {{at the bottom of the}} hill by a three-car, cable-pulled <b>hovertrain</b> funicular.|$|E
2500|$|However, the DOT {{was more}} {{interested}} in really high speed trains, and had been funding several developments along these lines for some time. In order to expedite these developments, they had recently selected a parcel of land outside Pueblo, Colorado as a test site that would become the Transportation Technology Center (TTC). They planned on using the TTC to lower the cost of all-up testing of advanced designs, as well as guaranteeing that all the participants would have a level playing field. Several U.S. companies {{were in the process of}} building <b>hovertrain</b> systems based on technology licensed from the French Aérotrain project, known under the U.S. term [...] "Tracked Air-Cushion Vehicle", or [...] "TACV", and these were in the process of being set up at the TTC.|$|E
50|$|These two {{properties}} {{meant that}} the running surface could be considerably simpler than the surface needed to support the same vehicle on wheels; <b>hovertrains</b> could be supported on surfaces similar to existing light-duty roadways, instead of the much more complex and expensive railbeds needed for conventional trains. This could dramatically reduce infrastructure capital costs of building new lines and offer a path to widespread use of high-speed trains.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, {{a wide variety}} of new maglev {{proposals}} were being actively worked on around the world. The German government, in particular, was funding several different passive and active systems in order to explore which of the proposed solutions made the most sense. By the mid 1970s, several of these projects had progressed to about the same point as the <b>hovertrains,</b> yet appeared to have none of their disadvantages—high sound levels, blown dirt and higher energy use than initially expected.|$|R
2500|$|The {{problem was}} first noticed {{towards the end}} of the 19th century, when train speeds became high enough to {{encounter}} it. This behaviour limited trains to operate at speeds of about [...] or less and led to a number of research projects in the 1960s using <b>hovertrains</b> and maglev systems to avoid it and reach higher speeds. But after empirical studies by the British Rail Research Division in the 1960s, remedial measures, particularly in the design of suspension systems, have been introduced permitting speeds exceeding [...] As a result of this research, most high-speed trains today still use steel wheels, rather than more expensive technologies.|$|R
2500|$|A {{test track}} for a tracked {{hovercraft}} system was built at Earith near Cambridge, England. It ran southwest from Sutton Gault, sandwiched between the Old Bedford River {{and the smaller}} Counter Drain to the west. Careful examination of the site will still reveal traces of the concrete piers used to support the structure. The actual vehicle, RTV31, is preserved at Railworld in Peterborough and {{can be seen from}} trains, just south west of Peterborough railway station. The vehicle achieved [...] on 7 February 1973 but the project was cancelled a week later. The project was managed by Tracked Hovercraft Ltd., with Denys Bliss as Director in the early 1970s, then axed by the Aerospace Minister, Michael Heseltine. Records of this project are available from the correspondence and papers of Sir Harry Legge-Bourke, MP at Leeds University Library. Heseltine was accused by Airey Neave and others of misleading the House of Commons when he stated that the government was still considering giving financial support to the <b>Hovertrain,</b> when the decision to pull the plug had already been taken by the Cabinet.|$|E
50|$|The Aérotrain was a <b>hovertrain</b> {{developed}} in France from 1965 to 1977. The lead engineer was Jean Bertin.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1970s {{it was not}} clear whether the <b>hovertrain</b> or maglev would {{eventually}} win the technology race. Krauss-Maffei, primary developer of the Transrapid and Transurban maglev trains, decided to hedge their bets and develop a <b>hovertrain</b> prototype of their own. The Transrapid03 was first tested in the summer of 1972, but by this time the maglev had proven itself and further work ended the next year.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hovertrains</b> {{were also}} {{developed}} for smaller systems, including {{personal rapid transit}} systems that were a hot topic in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In this role their ability to float over small imperfections and debris on the [...] "rails" [...] was a practical advantage, although it competed with the maglev concept that had the same advantages. The only hovertain to see commercial service was the Otis Hovair system. Originally developed at General Motors as an automated guideway transit system, GM was forced to divest the design {{as part of an}} anti-trust ruling. The design eventually ended up at Otis Elevator who later replaced its linear motor with a cable pull and sold the resulting design for people mover installations all over the world.|$|R
5000|$|Better yet, {{this vehicle}} would also retain {{all of the}} {{positive}} qualities of a hovercraft. Small imperfections in the surface would {{have no effect on}} the ride quality, and the complexity of the suspension system could be greatly reduced. Additionally, since the load is spread out over the surface of the lifting pads, the pressure on the running surface is greatly reduced - about [...] the pressure of a train wheel, about [...] of the pressure of a tyre on a road. These two properties meant that the running surface could be considerably simpler than the surface needed to support the same vehicle on wheels; <b>hovertrains</b> could be supported on surfaces similar to existing light-duty roadways, instead of the much more complex and expensive railbeds needed to support the weight on two rails. This could greatly reduce infrastructure capital costs.|$|R
5000|$|Otis Hovair Transit Systems {{is a type}} of <b>hovertrain</b> used in {{low-speed}} {{people mover}} applications. Traditional people mover systems used wheeled vehicles propelled by electric motors or cable traction, the Hovair replaces the wheels with a hovercraft lift pad. The aim is to reduce guideway complexity and vehicle maintenance. Another benefit is the system's ability to move in all directions, including sideways. The Hovair is the only <b>hovertrain</b> system to be used in commercial service.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} serious <b>hovertrain</b> proposals come, unsurprisingly, from Christopher Cockerell's group, organized in Hythe, Kent as Hovercraft Development Ltd. As early as 1960 their engineers were experimenting with the <b>hovertrain</b> concept, and by 1963 {{had developed a}} test-bed system {{about the size of}} a tractor-trailer that ran for short distances on a concrete pad with a central vertical surface that provided directional control. The prototype was pushed along its short test track by hand.|$|E
50|$|In later life, Cockerell {{developed}} {{many other}} {{improvements to the}} hovercraft, and invented various other applications for the air cushion principle, such as the <b>hovertrain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The crew of Serenity {{take on a}} <b>hovertrain</b> robbery {{commissioned}} by a sinister crime lord. The cargo they are after, however, {{is worth more than}} they know.|$|E
50|$|At {{this point}} the project entered hiatus for lack of funding. During this same period, British Rail was working on an {{extensive}} study project that was suggesting that the hunting problems seen on existing trains could be addressed through development of suitable suspension systems. BR lost interest in the <b>hovertrain</b> concept, {{and moved on to}} their Advanced Passenger Train (APT) efforts shortly thereafter. In the meantime, the Hythe team had no funds for the full-scale test system they were proposing, and complained at Hovershow that the French would be taking the lead in <b>hovertrain</b> development.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s, the Sutton Gault hamlet was {{the site}} of one of the world's first Tracked Hovercraft, {{designed}} by Eric Laithwaite. This <b>hovertrain</b> was propelled by a linear induction motor and ran alongside the Old Bedford River, on a one-mile section of air-cushion trackway.|$|E
50|$|The {{third stage}} of the TACV project was a {{complete}} LIM-powered <b>hovertrain</b> with passenger seating, the Urban Tracked Air Cushion Vehicle (UTACV). Rohr Industries won the contract with a design based on Bertin's Aérotrain, and delivered the prototype to HSGTC in Pueblo in 1974.|$|E
5000|$|Back to the Future Part III - the improvised {{method of}} {{propelling}} {{the time machine}} to 88 mph in 1885 was by using a steam locomotive, also Emmett Brown refitted a steam locomotive into a <b>hovertrain</b> {{as the basis of}} his new time machine.|$|E
50|$|The Getty Center Monorail, {{also known}} as Getty Center Tram, is an Otis Hovair {{monorail}} of the U.S. city of Los Angeles serving the Getty Center. It is an electric, cable-driven <b>hovertrain,</b> with a fleet of 6 people movers divided in 2 convoys of 3 cars each.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Brian Morris (19 March 1933 [...] - [...] 15 June 2001) was {{a pioneer}} in railway engineering, having helped develop the rail system for the Channel Tunnel, the <b>hovertrain</b> project {{as well as a}} number of the railway systems in Eastern Europe and South America.|$|E
50|$|More recently, a Japanese project {{known as}} Aero-Train {{has been built}} {{to the extent of}} several prototypes and a test track. The basic concept {{is the same as the}} classic <b>hovertrain,</b> but replaces the active {{hovercraft}} system of pumps and lift pads with wings, using the efficient generation of lift from the wing-in-ground-effect.|$|E
5000|$|The Museum has a seven-story deep {{underground}} parking garage with over 1,200 parking spaces. Its roof has an outdoor sculpture garden.

50|$|A <b>hovertrain</b> {{is a type}} of {{high-speed}} train that replaces conventional steel wheels with hovercraft lift pads, and the conventional railway bed with a paved road-like surface, known as the track or guideway. The concept aims to eliminate rolling resistance and allow very high performance, while also simplifying the infrastructure needed to lay new lines.|$|E
5000|$|Developed by Poma-Otis Transportation Systems, a {{joint venture}} of Poma and the Otis Elevator Company, and {{constructed}} by Brasfield & Gorrie, the two-car [...] "Hovair" [...] (<b>hovertrain)</b> system was completed at a final cost of $10.9 million. The two 1890 ft concrete guideways are elevated 30 ft above the surface. Costing $280,000 annually to operate, the Huntsville Hospital Tram System handles approximately 2,200 passengers per day.|$|E
5000|$|The closest {{real-world}} {{devices are}} the hovercraft, which elevates itself above a water or level hard surface using a cushion of air retained by a flexible skirt, and the <b>hovertrain,</b> {{which is a}} type of high-speed train that replaces conventional steel wheels with hovercraft lift pads, and the conventional railway bed with a paved road-like surface, known as the [...] "track" [...] or [...] "guideway" ...|$|E
50|$|While the <b>hovertrain</b> {{was being}} developed, BR was running an {{extensive}} research {{project on the}} topic of high-speed wheeled trains at their newly opened British Rail Research Division in Derby. This work was the first group to characterise the hunting oscillation in detail. Their work clearly suggested that careful design of the suspension system could eliminate the problem. This would allow high-speed trains to be built using conventional steel-wheel technology.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hovertrain</b> is {{a generic}} term, and the {{vehicles}} are more {{commonly referred to}} by the projects that developed them in different countries - in the UK they are known as tracked hovercraft, in the US they are tracked air-cushion vehicles, and in France they are the aerotrains. News sources often conflate maglev trains with hovertrains, as both are levitated above the running surface, [...] "hovering" [...] over them.|$|E
