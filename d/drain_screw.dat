40|$|When DOE {{funds were}} {{exhausted}} in March 1995, all Phase 2 activities {{were placed on}} hold. In February 1996 a detailed cost estimate was submitted to the DOE for completing the two remaining Phase 2 Multi Annular Swirl Burner (MASB) topping combustor test burns; in August 1996 release was received from METC to proceed with these tests. The first test (Test Campaign No. 3) will be conducted to: (1) test the MASB at proposed demonstration plant full to minimum loading operating conditions; (2) identify the lower oxygen limit of the MASB; and (3) demonstrate natural gas to carbonizer fuel gas switching. The Livingston Phase 3 Pilot Plant was last operated under contract DE-AC 21 - 86 MC 21023 in September 1995 for seven days in an integrated carbonizer-CPFBC configuration. In May, 1996, the pilot plant was transferred to Contract DE-AC 22 - 95 PC 95143 to allow testing {{in support of the}} High Performance Power Systems (HIPPS) Program. The HIPPS Program required modifications to the pilot plant and the following changes were incorporated: (1) installation of a dense phase transport system for loading pulverized coal into the feed system lock hopper directly from a pneumatic transport truck; (2) removal of the char transfer pipe between the char collecting hopper and the CPFBC to allow carbonizer only operation; (3) installation of a lock hopper directly under the char collecting hopper to facilitate char removal from the process, the hopper vent gases exhaust to the carbonizer baghouse filter and the depressured char is transferred via nitrogen to the CPFBC baghouse for dumping into drums; (4) removal of the carbonizer cyclone and top of bed overflow drain line; all material elutriated from the carbonizer bed will thus be removed by the 22 -element Westinghouse ceramic candle filter; (5) replacement of the carbonizer continuous bottom bed <b>drain</b> (<b>screw</b> feeder) with a batch-type drain removal system; and (6) installation of a mass spectrometer that draws sample gas via a steam jacketed line from the refractory lined piping downstream of the candle filter...|$|E
5000|$|De Olifant is {{what the}} Dutch {{describe}} as an [...] "achtkante grondzeiler". It is a smock mill winded by a winch. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to the ground. The mill has a single-storey brick base and a two-storey smock. The smock has vertical weatherboarding and the cap is thatched. The four Common sails have a span of 23.90 m and are carried in a cast-iron windshaft which was made by Prins van Oranje of Den Haag in 1877. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 65 cogs. This drives the wallower (37 cogs) {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel (71 cogs) drives three wooden shafts, each of which drives a wooden Archimedes' screw via another set of gears. Two of the Archimedes' <b>screws</b> <b>drain</b> the [...] "Olifant polder", while the third pumps water into the polder.|$|R
