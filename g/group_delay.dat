40|$|When {{stimulated by}} tones, the ear appears to emit tones of its own, stimulus-frequency otoacoustic {{emissions}} (SFOAEs). SFOAEs were measured in 17 chinchillas and their <b>group</b> <b>delays</b> {{were compared with}} a place map of basilar-membrane vibration <b>group</b> <b>delays</b> measured at the characteristic frequency.

The results for frequencies lower than 4 kHz cannot be explained by hypotheses based on waves propagating to and from their characteristic places in the cochlea.

25|$|The <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> {{is defined}} as the {{derivative}} of the phase with respect to angular frequency and {{is a measure of the}} distortion in the signal introduced by phase differences for different frequencies.

25|$|It is {{possible}} to use prisms rather than gratings as a dispersive elements, as in Figure 3. Despite such a simple change the set-up behaves quite differently, as to first order no <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> dispersion is introduced. Such a stretcher/compressor can have both a positive or negative dispersion, depending on the geometry and the material properties of the prisms. With lenses, {{the sign of the}} dispersion can be reversed, similar to Figure 2. For a given distance between the dispersive elements, prisms generate much less dispersion than gratings. Prisms and gratings are sometimes combined to correct higher order dispersion ("grisms"), in which case the distance between the prisms is on the order of 10 meters rather than 50cm as with a grating compressor. Gratings lose power into the other orders while prisms lose power due to Rayleigh scattering.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{manifestations of}} {{apparently}} faster-than-light effects confirmed our predictions {{that the group}} velocity in transparent optical media can exceed c. Special relativity is not violated by these phenomena. Moreover, in the electronic domain, the causality principle does not forbid negative <b>group</b> <b>delays</b> of analytic signals in electronic circuits, in which the peak of an output pulse leaves the exit port of a circuit before {{the peak of the}} input pulse enters the input port. Furthermore, pulse distortion for these superluminal analytic signals can be negligible in both the optical and electronic domains. Here we suggest an extension of these ideas to the microelectronic domain. The underlying principle is that negative feedback can be used to produce negative <b>group</b> <b>delays.</b> Such negative <b>group</b> <b>delays</b> can be used to cancel out the positive <b>group</b> <b>delays</b> due to transistor latency (e. g., the finite RC rise time of MOSFETS caused by their intrinsic gate capacitance), as well as the propagation delays due to the interconnects between transistors.

2500|$|A second {{series of}} {{approaches}} {{was designed and}} patented by Leonard R. Kahn. [...] The various Kahn systems removed the hard limit imposed {{by the use of}} the strict log function in the generation of the signal. Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. [...] One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. [...] It was known as the STR-77 exciter method, having been introduced in 1977. [...] Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation. [...] E represents the envelope term; roughly half the modulation term applied to the envelope modulator is utilized to reduce the second-order term of the arcsin [...] "phase"-modulated path; thus reducing the second-order term in the undesired sideband. [...] A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. [...] This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. [...] It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. [...] An additional audio processing device further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying pre-emphasis to the modulating signals. [...] Since the envelope of all the signals described remains an exact copy of the information applied to the modulator, it can be demodulated without distortion by an envelope detector such as a simple diode. [...] In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> in the IF filters of the receiver, which act to truncate the compatibility sideband – those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM – and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the quadrature distortion term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier. [...] The small amount of distortion caused by this effect is generally quite low and acceptable.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} for the <b>group</b> <b>delay</b> to be constant across all frequencies; otherwise there is temporal smearing of the signal.

40|$|We test various {{methods of}} {{quantifying}} the compliance of single and multiple rock fractures from synthetic ultrasonic data. The data are generated with a 2 D discrete particle scheme which {{has previously been}} shown to treat fractures in agreement with linear-slip theory. Studying single fractures, we find that delays derived from peak amplitudes do not correspond to <b>group</b> <b>delays,</b> as might be expected. This is due to waveform distortion caused by the frequency-dependent transmission across the fracture. Instead the delays correspond to an expression for phase delays, which we derive from linear-slip theory. Phase delays are a unique function of compliance, whereas <b>group</b> <b>delays</b> are non-uniquely related to compliance. We believe that this property of <b>group</b> <b>delays</b> has hindered the wider application of deriving fracture compliances from traveltimes. We further show that transmission coefficients derived from waveform spectra yield more accurate fracture compliances than those obtained from ratios of signal peak amplitudes. We also investigate the compliance {{of a set of}} parallel fractures. Fracture compliance can only be determined from transmission coefficients if the fracture spacing is so large that the first arriving pulse is not contaminated by reverberations. In the case of contamination the direct measurement of <b>group</b> or phase <b>delays</b> is not practical. However, we demonstrate that in such cases of strong waveform distortion the coda wave interferometry method is very effective for determining relative fracture compliance. First break delays in the fracture set data are related to those observed in single fracture simulations. This means that fracture set compliance can be estimated from first break data if used together with numerical simulations...|$|R
