40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a model that {{explains}} the degree {{of involvement in the}} different export regions based on the company’s marketing strategy. Of particular interest is the case of Spanish <b>exporting</b> <b>companies.</b> First of all, export propensity has been steadily growing over time from a 33 % of total sales in 1992 to a 41 % in 1998. Nevertheless, only 34 % of those companies could be considered as active exporters, i. e., companies that will continue exporting in the long run as part of their strategy. Second, Spanish <b>exporting</b> <b>companies</b> have to determine their level of involvement between regions with very different physical and psychological distance (Dow, 2000). This paper focuses on the effect of marketing strategies in reducing such perceived differences (Evans et al., 2000). In particular, the case of Latin America as an export region psychologically close to Spanish <b>exporting</b> <b>companies</b> and the second destinations of their exports provide an additional interest. Methodologically speaking, the analysis of the level of involvement of an <b>exporting</b> <b>company</b> in the different export regions is based on a Seemingly Unrelated Regression Model (SURE). The data were collected from a sample size of 2. 264 Spanish <b>exporting</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

In an L/C, in order that the obligation of payment of the applicant (issuing) bank and of the confirming bank, if any, against the beneficiary can continue, <b>exporting</b> <b>companies</b> are required to prepare documents in accordance with the UCP 600, ISBP 745 and terms of documentary letter of credit and present them properly (complying presentation). In order to prepare appropriate documents, it is essential for the <b>exporting</b> <b>companies</b> to act according to the three important criteria (letter of credit requirements, UCP 600 and ISPB 745) prevailing in this regard. Since competence of complying presentation requires a certain level of expertise, the <b>exporting</b> <b>companies</b> established in Turkey have experienced difficulties in terms of how to prepare documents and could not get benefit from payment obligation undertaking of the applicant bank and of the confirming bank, if any, due to the presentation of discrepant documents, getting export prices late, and payment of extra fees/commissions. Due to trade property, importing company’s demands and the conditions required by the legislation of the country where the <b>exporting</b> <b>company</b> is established, <b>exporting</b> <b>companies</b> are required to prepare many types of documents. In this study, the common mistakes that <b>exporting</b> <b>companies</b> in Turkey made in preparation of the charter party and the other types of B/Ls are analyzed, the basic and critical features of the charter party B/Ls, in particular, are considered and different and common parts compared to other bill of ladings are evaluated and how they can be organized properly according to letter of credit payment is shown...|$|R
