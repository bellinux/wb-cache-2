In 1956, with a loan of $2,000 from Jack's father-in-law Quill's first office {{was established in the}} back room of Millers father's poultry shop {{on the north side of}} Chicago. Initially lacking retail experience, the young entrepreneur relied heavily on his <b>face-to-face</b> <b>selling</b> techniques to drive revenue. With the assistance of Jack's brother Harvey, the two evolved their marketing strategies to include mail-order campaigns that enticed potential customers with substantially discounted prices and free shipping - transforming Quill Corporation into one of the first mail-order [...] companies in the United States. In 1974, Quill reported annual sales of $3.5 million. During the early and mid-1980s, the company's revenues amounted to $180 million in 1986. Its mail-order business was the most successful within the office supplies market, with more than 40 million catalogues and flyers sent to a customer base of approximately 600,000 businesses and organizations, and listing more than 9,000 various office supplies and products. In 1996, the company launched the website Quill.com. In 1998, Quill Corporation was acquired by Staples, Inc. for approximately $685 million. Jack Miller utilized funds from the sale of Quill to create the Jack Miller Center.|$|E
40|$|Selling and salesmanship are now {{among the}} {{universals}} of culture on this continent. Although much {{is known about}} the mass effects of salesmanship, relatively little knowledge exists {{on the nature of the}} <b>face-to-face</b> <b>selling</b> situation. It is an interpersonal situation, involving the interaction of two or more actors: salesman and customer(s). The specific purpose of this interaction is the transfer of a commodity. These facts seem familiar and taken for granted...|$|E

40|$|This high-stakes {{experiment}} {{investigates the}} effect on buyers of mandatory disclosures concerning an insurance policy's value for money (the claims ratio) and the seller's commission. These information disclosures have virtually no effect despite most buyers claiming to value such information. Instead, our data reveal that whether the subject is generally trusting plays an important role. Trust is clearly associated with greater willingness to pay for insurance. Unlike in previous work, trust in our setting is not about obligations being fulfilled. The contract is complete, simple {{and the possibility of}} breach is negligible. However, as for much B 2 C insurance marketing, <b>face-to-face</b> <b>selling</b> plays a crucial role in our experimental design. Trusting buyers are more suggestible, so take advice more readily and buy more insurance, although they are no more risk averse than the uninsured. Moreover, trusting buyers feel less pressured by sellers, and are more confident in their decisions which suggests that they are easier to persuade. Therefore, in markets where persuasion is important, public policy designed to increase consumer information is likely to be ineffective. insurance selling, trust, persuasion...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} the Internet can enable trust based {{marketing}} through accurate and complete information and advice. We concentrate on shopping advice and develop a virtual personal advisor as {{an important component of}} trust building. Bayesian utility and segmentation models are used to make recommendations and a dialogue-based computer graphical user interface (GUI) is designed to instill confidence in the advisor’s recommendations. A prototype system, called Truck Town, is developed for pickup truck purchasing and the proposed site is evaluated in an empirical concept and use test. The key research questions examined are: Can a site be developed on the Internet that develops trust via a virtual advisor? Can information intensive and virtual advisor sites do as well as <b>face-to-face</b> <b>selling</b> in terms of establishing trust? Which segments of consumers prefer a virtual advisor-based Internet site to objective, information intensive sites with no advisors? The results indicate that the proposed site can build trust; most customers would consider buying a vehicle through Truck Town and {{would be willing to pay}} for the service. A combination of the advisor site and an information intensive site together dominated the existing auto dealer system in terms of customer acceptance. The preference for the two Internet sites was equal, but analysis indicates segmentation in the site preferences. Consumers who are not very knowledgeable about trucks, who visited more dealers, and who are younger and more frequent Internet users have the highest preference for the virtual personal advisor. This paper closes with a discussion of future research and strategic marketing issues raised by a virtual trust based advisor system. ...|$|E

This study attempts to broaden {{the understanding of the}} companies' online competitiveness by applying the sales approach to customer service {{in the context of a}} specialty retailer's customer service chat. The objective is to find ways to make the company's customer service function more cost-effective by applying traditional, <b>face-to-face</b> <b>selling</b> strategies to their online channel.

In order to meet this objective, the following two research questions are answered: 1. How to increase sales via customer service? 2. How can a customer service chat generate more sales? In terms of methodology, this study is a combination of literature review and a descriptive, exploratory single-case study. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are used in the study in order to gain holistic understanding of the subject. The quantitative data was collected by conducting a web survey for customers. The data was analyzed with SPSS version 20 -software using linear regression analysis. The qualitative data was collected by conducting semi-structured interviews to all five case company's customer service agents working in Finland. Coding and thematic analysis were used to analyze the data set. The main finding of the survey data analysis was the clear correlation between the customer's appreciation for service dimension in the chat function and customer's willingness to shop in the company's web store. Several ways to utilize influence strategies in the chat function are also introduced in the findings of this study. Possible avenues for future research include the effects of implementing sales approach to customer service, for example in terms of profitability, customer satisfaction and loyalty.

40|$|The general {{conclusion}} from literature is that direct marketing strategies namely <b>face-to-face</b> <b>selling,</b> direct mailing, catalogue selling, telemarketing, online marketing and direct response advertisements if carried out properly result {{a number of}} benefits which include increased sales and profitability, increased loyalty and business with existing customers and expansion of business to new customers. However, most of the existing literature in direct marketing mainly refers to direct marketing experiences in other countries like North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to was to attempt to fill the research gap by investigating the the impact of direct marketing on sales performance in the potato seed industry in Zimbabwe. This research was carried out as a single case design of the Seed Potato Co-op (SPC). The data was obtained from face to face interviews of the employees and customers of the Seed Potato Co-op who had been employed or affiliated with the company for a minimum of 3 years. The questions asked were semi-structured and provided rich, in depth information. A qualitative research philosophy was followed and the data that was gathered was analysed through data displays in the form of content analytical summary tables The study found that there was no formal marketing plan at the Seed Potato Co-op which resulted in poor communication of marketing activities in the company. The company also only practised one major direct marketing strategy and there was a weak relationship between direct marketing and sales performance. The study showed that several constraints which include a lack of properly trained marketing personnel, no dedicated finances or marketing budget, a lack of a proper customer database and no proper blueprint for carrying out marketing activities inhibited the Seed Potato Co-op from fully undertaking direct marketing during the period under study. In view of the above, the study recommended that the company to carry out formal marketing planning to give direction to their marketing activities. It was further recommended that the Seed Potato carry out direct marketing using several direct marketing strategies, and also generate, and maintain a customer database...|$|E
