5|$|Dunstan's first Premiership was eventful, with {{a steady}} stream of reform and {{attempts}} to end the depression. The latter half of 1967 saw the beginnings of a slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity steadying. The 1967–68 budget ran into deficit, allocating funds to <b>energise</b> the economic engine whilst Dunstan lambasted the Federal Government for neglecting the South Australian economy, demanding it take a degree of responsibility for its ills.|$|E
25|$|With {{the onset}} of World War I, the British {{stiffened}} censorship and restrictions on political activity. Azad's Al-Hilal was consequently banned in 1914 under the Press Act. Azad started a new journal, the Al-Balagh, which increased its active support for nationalist causes and communal unity. In this period Azad also became active in {{his support for the}} Khilafat agitation to protect the position of the Sultan of Ottoman Turkey, who was considered the Caliph or Khalifa for Muslims worldwide. The Sultan had sided against the British in the war and the continuity of his rule came under serious threat, causing distress amongst Muslim conservatives. Azad saw an opportunity to <b>energise</b> Indian Muslims and achieve major political and social reform through the struggle. With his popularity increasing across India, the government outlawed Azad's second publication under the Defence of India Regulations Act and arrested him. The governments of the Bombay Presidency, United Provinces, Punjab and Delhi prohibited his entry into the provinces and Azad was moved to a jail in Ranchi, where he was incarcerated until 1 January 1920.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to measure the effects of <b>energising</b> drinks containing caffeine and glucose, upon mental activity during sustained selective attention. Non-invasive electrophysiological brain recordings were made during a behavioural study of selective attention in which participants received either <b>energising</b> or placebo drinks. We tested specifically whether <b>energising</b> drinks have significant effects upon behavioural measures of performance during a task requiring sustained visual selective attention, as well as on accompanying components of the event-related potential (ERPs) related to information processing in the brain. Forty healthy volunteers were blindly assigned to receive either the <b>energising</b> drink or a similar-tasting placebo drink. The behavioural task involved identifying predefined target stimulus among rapidly presented streams of peripheral visual stimuli, and making speeded motor responses to this stimulus. During task performance, accuracy, reaction times and ongoing brain activity were stored for analysis. The <b>energising</b> drink enhanced behavioural performance both in terms of accuracy and speed of reactions. The <b>energising</b> drink also had significant effects upon the event-related potentials. Effects started from the enhancement of the earliest components (Cl/P 1), reflecting early visual cortical processing in the energising-drink group relative to the placebo group over the contralateral scalp. The later N 1, N 2 and P 3 components related to decision-making and responses were also modulated by the <b>energising</b> drink. <b>Energising</b> drinks containing caffeine and glucose can enhance behavioural performance during demanding tasks requiring selective attention. The behavioural benefits are coupled to direct effects upon neural information processing...|$|R

2500|$|... "Bill" [...] Griffith P. Taylor in 1937 and {{published}} in Meccano Magazine, March 1938. The crane-like device was built almost entirely using Meccano parts, and powered by a single electric motor. [...] Five axes of movement were possible, including grab and grab rotation. Automation was achieved using punched paper tape to <b>energise</b> solenoids, which would facilitate {{the movement of the}} crane's control levers. The robot could stack wooden blocks in pre-programmed patterns. The number of motor revolutions required for each desired movement was first plotted on graph paper. This information was then transferred to the paper tape, which was also driven by the robot's single motor. Chris Shute built a complete replica of the robot in 1997.|$|E

His books on meditation include: Happy to Burn: Meditation to <b>Energise</b> Your Spirit (Lothian 1997) and Love & Imagination.

John Taylor became a film maker and graphics designer. He won an AFI award for The Huge Adventures of Trevor, a Cat in the category of Best Short Animation in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Although Vivekananda did {{not write}} any commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, his works {{contained}} numerous references to the Gita, such as his lectures on the four yogas – Bhakti, Gyaana, Karma, and Raja. Through {{the message of the}} Gita, Vivekananda sought to <b>energise</b> the people of India to claim their own dormant but strong identity. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay thought that the answer to the problems that beset Hindu society was a revival of Hinduism in its purity, which lay in the reinterpretation of Bhagavad Gita for a new India. Aurobindo saw Bhagavad Gita as a [...] "scripture of the future religion" [...] and suggested that Hinduism had acquired a much wider relevance through the Gita. Sivananda called Bhagavad Gita [...] "the most precious jewel of Hindu literature" [...] and suggested its introduction into the curriculum of Indian schools and colleges. In the lectures Chinmayananda gave, on tours undertaken to revive of moral and spiritual values of the Hindus, he borrowed the concept of Gyaana yajna, or the worship to invoke divine wisdom, from the Gita. He viewed the Gita as a universal scripture to turn a person from a state of agitation and confusion to a state of complete vision, inner contentment, and dynamic action. Teachings of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a Gaudiya Vaishnava religious organisation which spread rapidly in North America in the 1970s and 1980s, are based on a translation of the Gita called Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.|$|E

2500|$|England {{failed to}} match the Australians' high {{standards}} of fielding and were nicknamed Brown's Cows by the Australian barrackers. They dropped six catches in a match against Victoria and made frequent mistakes in the state matches. However, they made a considerable improvement in the Tests with [...] "...first class work in the field, in direct contrast to the slovenly and often lackadaisical displays in the previous games of the tour". Even so, they never reached the heights of catching and fielding displayed by the Australian team. Both Brown and Alec Bedser weighted 15 stone (over 200 lb or 100 kilos) and were particularly ungainly in the field, but their bucket-like hands picked up 9 catches and Brown twice caught and bowled Keith Miller. Godfrey Evans was the outstanding wicket-keeper of his generation whose enthusiasm could <b>energise</b> a fielding team and always entertained the crowd with his antics. His deputy was Arthur McIntyre, who kept wicket for Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and Tony Lock in the Surrey side that would win the County Championship seven {{times in a row}} in 1952-58. Len Hutton was a good slip and would pick up 9 catches in the series and Trevor Bailey took some great catches in the gully. Unfortunately the MCC had no other slip fielders and they were joined by Gilbert Parkhouse, who hated the role and frequently dropped catches. John Dewes was a good outfielder, {{but the rest of the}} team failed to impress and a picture of John Warr was used to illustrate how not to take catches.|$|E

For this we have reason to be thankful; and the appearance of affairs in that quarter is hopeful, but our hope is mingled with anxiety, because mankind is terribly prone to go to sleep on hopeful appearances. Our nature is such, that our only chance of success lies, under God, in resolving ceaselessly to <b>energise</b> until our ends be accomplished.

6000|$|Mr Sterling had a keen, earnest look, and a {{naturally}} eloquent {{as well as}} persuasive tongue. Though comparatively uneducated, he was deeply read in the Book which it was his life's work to expound, and an undercurrent of intense feeling seemed to carry him along--and his hearers along with him--as he spoke. He did not shout or gesticulate: that made him all the more impressive. He did not speak of himself or his own feelings: that enabled his hearers to give undistracted attention to the message he had to deliver. He did not <b>energise.</b> On the contrary, {{it seemed as if}} he had some difficulty in restraining the superabundant energy that burned within him; and as people usually stand more or less in awe of that which they do not fully understand, they gave him credit, perhaps, for more power than he really possessed. At all events, not a sound was heard, save now and then a suppressed sob, as he preached Christ crucified to guilty sinners, and urged home the two [...] "messages" [...] with all the force of unstudied language, but well-considered and aptly put illustration and anecdote.|$|E
