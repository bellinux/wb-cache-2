5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. <b>Each</b> <b>community</b> has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|M-87 is the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan, which prior to 1960 ran east–west between the towns of Fenton and Holly. The highway served as a connector between US Highway23 (US23) and the former routing of US10, which ran along {{what is now the}} Interstate75 (I-75) corridor. The highway connected the downtown areas of <b>each</b> <b>community</b> as well as running through then-rural areas of Genesee and Oakland counties. The trunkline was decommissioned in late 1960, removing it from the system.|$|E
5|$|After the Erdut Agreement {{was signed}} in 1995, the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) was {{established}} to enable the return of Croatian refugees and to prepare the region for reintegration into Croatia. This UN peacekeeping force provided security during the transition period between 1996 and 1998. It was only in 1999 that Croats began returning to Vukovar in significant numbers, {{and many of the}} pre-war inhabitants never returned. By March 2001, the municipality was recorded as having 31,670 inhabitants– less than half the pre-war total– of whom 18,199 (57.46%) were Croats and 10,412 (32.88%) were Serbs. The community did not recover its mixed character: Croats and Serbs now lived separate social lives. Public facilities such as shops, cafés, restaurants, sports clubs, schools, non-governmental organisations and radio stations were re-established on segregated lines, with separate facilities for <b>each</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Notitia lists {{a number}} of barbarian {{military}} settlements in the empire. Known as laeti or gentiles ("natives"), these were {{an important source of}} recruits for the army. Groups of Germanic or Sarmatian tribespeople were granted land to settle in the Empire, in return for military service. Most likely <b>each</b> <b>community</b> was under a treaty obligation to supply a specified number of troops to the army each year. The resettlement within the empire of barbarian tribespeople in return for military service was not a new phenomenon in the 4th century: it stretches {{back to the days of}} Augustus. But it does appear that the establishment of military settlements was more systematic and on a much larger scale in the 4th century.|$|E
