40|$|Water grids are {{a diverse}} and {{interconnected}} water supply {{systems that are}} emerging {{in response to the}} pressures of climate variability, climate change, and population growth. Water grid operation is guided by <b>operating</b> <b>rules,</b> which aim to manage supply and demand to meet multiple management criteria such as maximising water security, minimising operational cost, and minimising energy use. However, the diversity and interconnectedness of these water grids increases the number of possible configurations of the <b>operating</b> <b>rules,</b> and combined with uncertainty in forecast conditions, makes find optimal <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> more challenging. Further, trade-offs between the criteria mean that multiple sets of <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> can be considered optimal.

Eight performance measures (PMs) were identified under four main objectives to evaluate the system performance under alternative <b>operating</b> <b>rules.</b> Three major hypothetical stakeholder groups namely, resource managers, water users, and environmental interest groups were considered in decision-making. An interviewer-assisted questionnaire survey was used to derive the preference functions and weights of the PMs. The evaluation of alternative <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> is not covered in this paper, rather an approach to elicit and model stakeholder preferences in decision-making is described.

50|$|Some {{railroad}} operating officials urge {{that both}} GCOR and NORAC {{should be used}} as the SCOR was originally used. They say <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> books should be used as a basic guide to standardizing operating practices, while still preserving the flexibility of individual railroads to either modify or omit rules at their discretion. If standard <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> are not needed, the major question that remains is whether or not a process has been established for maintaining quality in <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> development. This is especially important with the implementation of constantly changing equipment and train control technology, which will force the need for more rapid rule changes. Therefore, the question that must be asked is whether or not guidelines are needed for the development, writing, testing, application, and representation of <b>operating</b> <b>rules.</b> What kinds of guidelines should be developed, if at all? If necessary, what should be the process for developing those guidelines? For this purpose, a focus group was assembled.|$|R
40|$|Genetic algorithms, founded {{upon the}} {{principle}} of evolution, are applicable to many optimization problems, especially popular for solving parameter optimization problems. Reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves {{are the most common}} way for guiding and managing the reservoir operation. These rule curves traditionally are derived through intensive simulation techniques. The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of two genetic algorithms (GAs), i. e., binary coded and real coded, to derive multipurpose reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves. The curves are assumed to be piecewise linear functions where the coordinates of their inflection points are the unknowns and we want to optimize system performance. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods are tested on the operation of the Shih-Men reservoir in Taiwan. The current M- 5 operating curves of the Shih-Men reservoir are also evaluated. The results show that the GAs provide an adequate, effective and robust way for searching the rule curves. Both sets of <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves obtained from GAs have better performance, in terms of water release deficit and hydropower, than the current M- 5 <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> curves, while the real-coded GA is more efficient than the binary-coded GA.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new storage {{allocation}} rule based on target storage curves. Joint <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> are also proposed {{to solve the}} operation problems of a multi-reservoir system with joint demands and water transfer-supply projects. The joint <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> include a water diversion rule to {{determine the amount of}} diverted water in a period, a hedging rule based on an aggregated reservoir to determine the total release from the system, and a storage allocation rule to specify the release from each reservoir. A simulation-optimization model was established to optimize the key points of the water diversion curves, the hedging rule curves, and the target storage curves using the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm. The multi-reservoir water supply system located in Liaoning Province, China, including a water transfer-supply project, was employed as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed join <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> and target storage curves. The results indicate that the proposed <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> are suitable for the complex system.

50|$|Mergers {{of major}} {{railroad}} companies {{in recent years}} resulted {{not only in the}} merging of different railroad lines and operating rulebooks, but also in the merging of railroad cultures and operating practices. Superficially, it may appear that most railroads have adopted a common code of <b>operating</b> <b>rules,</b> but major differences still exist in the application, and consequently, the compliance with these <b>operating</b> <b>rules.</b> Moreover, different management styles often clash when organizational cultures merge, as documented {{in the case of the}} Penn Central merger in 1968 and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe merger in 1995. This leaves <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> managers uncertain as to how specific rules should be applied on their newly formed railroad. Different management philosophies may also influence different compliance standards across railroads.|$|R
