40|$|Balancing is an {{effective}} way of reducing vibration and reaction forces in rotor’s bearings. Two main approaches of modal balancing and influence coefficients method {{have been used for}} this aim. However, by considering specific balancing procedure for each rotor and addressing and detecting many of the unbalance sources in manufacturing and assembly this reduction can be ensured in earlier stage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a tool, based on the {{knowledge}} of technical errors, which helps to improve the teaching and learning process of the Uki Goshi technique. With this aim, we set out to determine the most frequent errors made by 44 students when performing this technique and how these mistakes relate. In order to do so, an observational analysis was carried out using the OSJUDO-UKG instrument and the data were registered using Match Vision Studio (Castellano, Perea, Alday and Hernández, 2008). The results, analyzed through descriptive statistics, show that the absence of a correct <b>initial</b> <b>unbalancing</b> movement (45, 5 %), the lack of proper right-arm pull (56, 8 %), not blocking the faller's body (Uke) against the thrower's hip -Tori- (54, 5 %) and throwing the Uke through the Tori's side are the most usual mistakes (72, 7 %). Through the sequencial analysis of T-Patterns obtained with the THÈME program (Magnusson, 1996, 2000) we have concluded that not blocking the body with the Tori's hip provokes the Uke's throw through the Tori's side during the final phase of the technique (95, 8 %), and positioning the right arm on the dorsal region of the Uke's back during the Tsukuri entails the absence of a subsequent pull of the Uke's body (73, 3 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Auto-{{balancing}} or {{active control}} balancing can be efficient solutions for high speed rotors with changing out-of-balance loads like washing machines in spin-drying mode. In the LoWash EU project, Vibratec {{is in charge}} to design, to build and to validate a balancing system for reducing the vibrations at high spin-drying speeds. The system is based on two trolleys rolling in a ring linked to the drum. The trolley shape allows a ring cross section optimization and they are equipped with a mechanism for escaping the disadvantage encountered at low speeds by similar devices. Analytical and multi-body models are first made for understanding the mechanisms, highlighting the driving parameters and drawing the final design of a first prototype which is inserted in a washing machine drum. Different tests are carried out for different <b>initial</b> <b>unbalances</b> and different rotation speeds: the residual unbalance is measured {{by means of a}} set of accelerometers mounted on the tub, while the mobile masses behaviour is observed by means of a large aperture swift camera. The test results highlight the auto-balancer high efficiency but also the sensitivity to geometrical defects which should be corrected in the next systems. According the theory, the balancing is efficient when the rotation frequency is significantly greater than the hanging frequencies. The multi-body model relevance is also demonstrated. A washer-dryer prototype including an auto-balancer second prototype and two other innovations, regarding thermal exchange efficiency and drum insulation, will be tested in operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAngular phase mixing {{in rapidly}} {{rotating}} or in strongly stratified flows is quantified for single-time single-point energy components, using linear theory. In addition to potential energy, turbulent kinetic energy is more easily analyzed {{in terms of}} its toroidal and poloidal components, and then in terms of vertical and horizontal components. Since the axial symmetry around the direction n (which bears both the system angular velocity and the mean density gradient) is consistent with basic dynamical equations, the input of initial anisotropy is investigated in the axisymmetric case. A general way to construct axisymmetric initial data is used, with a classical expansion in terms of scalar spherical harmonics for the 3 D spectral density of kinetic energy e, and a modified expansion for the polarization anisotropy Z, which reflects the unbalance in terms of poloidal and toroidal energy components. The expansion involves Legendre polynomials of arbitrary order, P 2 n 0 (cos[*]θ), (n = 0, 1, 2, [...] .,N 0), in which the term [cos[*]θ = (k∙n) /∣k∣] characterizes the anisotropy in k-wavespace; two sets of parameters, β 2 n(e) and β 2 n(z), separately generate the directional anisotropy and the polarization anisotropy. In the rotating case, the phase mixing results in damping the polarization anisotropy, so that toroidal and poloidal energy components asymptotically equilibrate after transient oscillations. Complete analytical solutions are found in terms of Bessel functions. The envelope of these oscillations decay with time like (ft) − 2 (f being the Coriolis parameter), whereas those for the vertical and horizontal components decay like (ft) − 3. The long-time limit of the ratio of horizontal component to vertical one depends only on β 2 (e), which is eventually related to a classical component in structure-based modeling, independently of the degree of the expansion of the initial data. For the stratified case, both the degree of initial anisotropy and the <b>initial</b> <b>unbalance</b> in terms of potential and poloidal (or kinetic gravity wave) energy are investigated. The latter unbalance is characterized by a ratio χ/ 2, assuming initial proportionality between the kinetic energy spectrum and the potential energy one. The phase mixing yields asymptotic equipartition in terms of poloidal and potential energy components, and analytical solutions are found in terms of Weber functions. At large time, the damped oscillations for poloidal, potential and vertical components decay with time like (Nt) − 1 / 2 (N is the buoyancy frequency), while the oscillations for the horizontal component decay with time like (Nt) − 3 / 2. The long-time limit of the ratio of horizontal component to vertical one depends only on the parameters χ, β 2 (e), β 0 (z), β 2 (z), and β 4 (z) ...|$|E

40|$|Multilevel {{inverter}} technology has emerged {{recently as a}} very important alternative {{in the area of}} high-power medium-voltage energy control. Voltage operation above semiconductor device limits, lower common mode voltages, near sinusoidal outputs together with small dv/dt’s, are some of the characteristics that have made this power converters popular for industry and modern research. However, the existing solutions suffer from some inherent drawbacks like common mode voltage problem, DC-link capacitor voltage fluctuation etc. Cascaded multi-level inverter with open-end winding induction motor structure promises significant improvements for high power medium-voltage applications. This dissertation investigates such cascaded multi-level inverters for open-end winding induction motor drive with reduced switch count. Similar to the conventional two-level inverters, other multi-level inverters with PWM control generate alternating common mode voltage (CMV). The alternating common mode voltage coupled through the parasitic capacitors in the machine and results in excessive bearing current and shaft voltage. The unwanted shaft voltage may cross the limit of insulation breakdown voltage and cause motor failure. This alternating common mode voltage adds to the total leakage current through ground conductor and acts as a source of conducted EMI which can interfere with other electronic equipments around. As the number of level increase in the inverter, different voltage levels are made available by using DC-link capacitor banks, instead of using different isolated power supplies. The intermediate-circuit capacitor voltages which are not directly supplied by the power sources are inherently unstable and require a suitable control method for converter operation, preferably without influence on the load power factor. Apart from normal operation, the sudden fault conditions may occur in the system and it is necessary to implement the control strategy considering this condition also. A five-level inverter topology with cascaded power circuit structure is proposed in this dissertation with the strategy to eliminate the common mode voltage and also to maintain the balance in the DC-link capacitor voltages. The proposed scheme is based on a dual five-level inverter for open-end winding induction motor. The principle achievement of this work is the reduction of power circuit complexity in the five-level inverter compared to a previously proposed five-level inverter structure for open-end winding IM drive with common mode voltage elimination. The {{reduction in the number of}} power switching devices is achieved by sharing the two two-level inverters for both the inverter structures. The resultant inverter structure can produce a nine-level voltage vector structure with the presence of alternating common mode voltage. The inverter structure is formed by cascading conventional two-level inverters together with NPC three-level inverters. Thus it offers modular and simpler power bus structure. As the power circuit is realised by cascading conventional two-level and NPC three-level inverters the number of power diodes requirements also reduced compared to the conventional NPC five-level inverters. The present proposed structure is implemented for the open-end winding induction motor and the power circuit offers more number of switching state redundancies compared to any conventional five-level inverter. The inverter structure required half the DC-link voltage compared to the DC-link voltage required for the conventional five-level inverter structure for induction motor drive and this reduces the voltage stress on the individual power devices. The common mode voltage is eliminated by selecting only the switching states which do not generate any common mode voltage in pole voltages hence there will be no common mode voltage at the motor phase also. The technique of using the switching state selection for the common mode voltage elimination, cancels out the requirement of the filter for the same purpose. As the inverter output is achieved without the presence of common mode voltage, the dual inverter can be fed from the common DC-link sources, without generating any zero sequence current. Hence the proposed dual five-level inverter structure requires only four isolated DC supplies. The multi-level inverters supplied by single power supply, have inherent unbalance in the DC-link capacitor voltages. This unbalance in the DC-link capacitor voltages causes lower order harmonics at the inverter output, resulting in torque pulsation and increased voltage stress on the power switching devices. A five-level inverter with reduced power circuit complexity is proposed to achieve the dual task of eliminating common mode voltage and DC-link capacitor voltage balancing. The method includes the analysis of current through the DC-link capacitors, depending on the switching state selections. The conditions to maintain all the four DC-link capacitor voltages are analysed. In an ideal condition when there is no fault in the power circuit the balance in the capacitor voltages can be maintained by selecting switching states in consecutive intervals, which have opposite effect on the capacitor voltages. This is called the open loop control of DC-link capacitor voltage balancing, since the capacitor voltages are not sensed during the selection of the switching states. The switching states with zero common mode voltages are selected for the purpose of keeping the capacitor voltages in balanced condition during no fault condition. The use of any extra hardware is avoided. The proposed open loop control of DC-link capacitor voltage balancing is capable of keeping the DC-link capacitor voltages equal in the entire modulation region irrespective of the load powerfactor. The problem with the proposed open loop control strategy is that, it can not take any corrective action if there is any <b>initial</b> <b>unbalance</b> in the capacitor voltages or if any unbalance occurs in the capacitor voltages during operation of the circuit,. To get the corrective action in the capacitor voltages due occurrence of any fault in the circuit, the strategy is further improved and a closed loop control strategy for the DC-link capacitor voltages is established. All the possible fault conditions in the four capacitors are identified and the available switching states are effectively used for the corrective action in each fault condition. The strategy is implemented such a way that the voltage balancing can be achieved without affecting the output fundamental voltage. The proposed five-level inverter structure presented in this thesis is based on a previous work, where a five-level inverter structure is proposed for the open-end winding induction motor. In that previous work 48 switches are used for the realization of the power circuit. It is observed that all the available switching states in this previous work are not used for any of the performance requirement of CMV elimination or DC-link voltage balancing. So, in this proposed work, the power circuit is optimized by reducing some of the switches, keeping the performance of the inverter same as the power circuit proposed in the previous work. The five-level inverter proposed in this thesis used 36 switches and the number of switching states is also reduced. But, the available switching states are sufficient for the CMV elimination and DC-link capacitor voltage balancing. The advantage of the modular circuit structure of this proposed five-level inverter is further investigated and the inverter structure is modified to a seven-level inverter structure for the open end winding induction motor. The proposed power circuit of the seven-level inverter uses only 48 switches, which is less compared to any seven-level inverter structure for the open end winding induction motor with common mode voltage elimination. The power circuit is reduced by sharing four two-level inverters to both the individual seven-level inverters in both the sides of the of the open end winding induction motor. The cascaded structure eliminates the necessity of the power diodes as required by the conventional NPC multilevel inverters. The proposed seven-level inverter is capable of producing a thirteen-level voltage vector hexagonal structure with the presence of common mode voltage. The common mode voltage elimination is achieved by selecting only the switching states with zero common mode voltage from both the inverters and the combined inverter structure produce a seven-level voltage vector structure with zero common mode voltage. The switching frequency is also reduced for the seven-level inverter compared to the proposed five-level inverter. The advantage of this kind of power circuit structure is that the number of power diode requirement is same in both five-level and seven-level inverters. Since there is no common mode voltage in the output voltages, the dual seven-level inverter structure can be implemented with the common DC-link voltage sources for both the sides. Six isolated power supplies are sufficient for both the seven-level inverters. The available switching states in this proposed seven-level inverter are further analysed to implement the open loop and closed loop capacitor voltage balancing and this allow the power circuit to run with only three isolated DC supplies. All the proposed work presented in this thesis are initially simulated in SIMULINK toolbox and then implemented in a form of laboratory prototype. A 2. 5 KW open end winding induction motor is used for the implementation of these proposed works. But all these work general in nature and can be implemented for high power drive applications with proper device ratings...|$|E
