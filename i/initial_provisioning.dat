5000|$|A Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is a SIP proxy that is {{the first}} point of contact for the IMS terminal.

The P-CSCF is at its core a specialized SBC for the User-network interface which not only protects the network, but also the IMS terminal. The use of an additional SBC between the IMS terminal and the P-CSCF is unnecessary and infeasible due to the signaling being encrypted on this leg. The terminal discovers its P-CSCF with either DHCP, or it may be configured (e.g. during <b>initial</b> <b>provisioning</b> or via a 3GPP IMS Management Object (MO)) or in the ISIM or assigned in the PDP Context (in General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)).|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the entry}} into service of new {{aircraft}} such as the Airbus A 380 {{as well as the}} pressure to operate existing fleets at lower cost, not only in civil but also in military aviation, a new industry paradigm has emerged where MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) service providers or OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) supply spare parts to airline operators on a maintenance-by-the-hour basis. As a consequence, the associated logistics networks have reached unprecedented complexity: Component exchange commitments are now made to multiple operators, not only at their main bases but also at outstations. In this setting, the limitations of conventional <b>Initial</b> <b>Provisioning</b> methods can be overcome with high-fidelity simulation-based optimisation techniques.

40|$|In {{order to}} stay {{competitive}} in today’s global world, a common strategy for companies is to actively seek mergers and acquisitions. The increased use of mergers and acquisitions gave rise to deal saving devices, such as the earn-out. The earn-out is a contractual agreement on an additional payment that depends on deal specific terms. Through {{the introduction of the}} International Financial Reporting Standard in 2005 for all publicly traded companies within the European Union, the earn-out has been regulated in the International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business Combinations. As the field of mergers and acquisitions is diverse and tainted by many challenges, this would logically impose difficulties on the reporting of the earn-out. This study aimed to first map the prevalence of the earn-out and accordingly to evaluate the <b>initial</b> <b>provision</b> with the actual earn-out payment. By reading the financial reports between 2005 and 2010 from 133 companies registered at the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, this study attempts to answer these aims. One of the conclusions was that 47 % of the companies registered at NASDAQ OMX Stockholm Large and Mid Cap have reported the use of at least one earn-out. Furthermore, the distribution of the use of earn-outs was more prevalent in some sectors than others. Other findings in this study include that the earn-out constitutes {{a significant part of the}} total purchase price, the earn-out often leads to a payment and the reporting of the earn-out has been inconsistent. The <b>initial</b> <b>provision</b> of the earn-out was furthermore found to be rather accurate, and in some cases even identical, with the actual payment...|$|R

40|$|Aviation {{spare parts}} {{provisioning}} {{is a highly}} complex problem. Traditionally, provisioning {{has been carried out}} using a conventional Poisson-based approach where inventory quantities are calculated separately for each part number and demands from different operations bases are consolidated into one single location. In an environment with multiple operations bases, however, such simplifications can lead to situations in which spares – although available at another airport – first have to be shipped to the location where the demand actually arose, leading to flight delays and cancellations. In this paper we demonstrate how simulation-based optimisation can help with the multi-location inventory problem by quantifying synergy potential between locations and how total service lifecycle cost can be further reduced without increasing risk right away from the <b>Initial</b> <b>Provisioning</b> (IP) stage onwards by taking into account advanced logistics policies such as pro-active re-balancing of spares between stocking locations. ...|$|E

From examination of nine avionic systems over a 28 month period a binomial model was developed using a removal rate based on aircraft-months as a program element. The model is to be used before Fleet data are generated by obtaining aircraft-month estimates from the contractor and removal rate estimates from similar operational equipments. A probability distribution reflecting the degree of certainty is selected as a prior estimate. Then, as Fleet experience is accumulated the distribution is updated using Bayesian techniques and maturity growth curves. This distribution is used to give an estimate of current removal rate and to extrapolate to future removal rates. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|When an {{expensive}} {{piece of equipment}} is bought, spare parts can often be bought at a reduced price. A decision must be made about the <b>initial</b> <b>provisioning</b> of spare parts. Furthermore, if {{at a certain time}} the stock drops to zero, because a number of failures have occurred, a decision must be made about the number of parts to be ordered. We focus on one specific expensive slow-moving part that is essential for the functioning of the equipment. The lead time of that part is small compared to its lifetime. We seek an ordering strategy for this part that covers the entire lifetime. Such a strategy should also be applicable to cases where there is uncertainty about the lifetime of the machine, the reliability of the components and the cost of failure. The main result is the development of a simple strategy that performs well in almost all cases. Furthermore, this strategy can easily deal with uncertainty and changes in the parameters...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe main thrust {{of this study}} is centered around the United States Marine Corps' <b>initial</b> <b>provisioning</b> of spare parts. The research focuses on two integral components for the establishment of stockage levels. The first component considers an analysis of the peacetime replacement rate and the production leadtime data provided by contractors. The second component evaluates the current Marine Corps inventory model as compared to the Navy's inventory model and the Initial Spares Optimization Model (ISOM). This study is primarily concerned with initial issue provisioning stockage levels maintained by the Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany Georgia. During the course of the study it was found that: (1) Difficulties exist in documenting contractor provided engineering estimates maintained in the Marine Corps Provisioning Files. (2) The current inventory is inadequate and state of the art methods and models should be implemented by the Marine Corps. (3) Contractor-provided engineering estimates tend to be skewed. Provisioners have no formal method for validating contractor data. One major contribution {{of this study is}} the development of an initial manual of standard factors that can be used by provisioners to validate data and as a baseline from which pertinent questions could be raised.

40|$|Initial {{maternal}} provisioning has pervasive {{ecological and}} evolutionary implications for species with direct development, influencing offspring size and energetic content, with subsequent effects on performance, and consequences in fitness for both offspring and mother. Here, using three sympatric marine intertidal direct developing gastropods as model organisms (Cominella virgata, Cominella maculosa and Haustrum scobina) I examined how contrasting strategies of maternal investment influenced development, hatchling size, maternal provisioning and juvenile performance. In these sympatric whelks, duration of intra-capsular development was similar among species (i. e. 10 wk until hatching); nonetheless, differences in provisioning and allocation were observed. Cominella virgata (1 embryo per capsule; ~ 3 mm shell length [SL]) and C. maculosa (7. 7 ± 0. 3 embryos per capsule; ~ 1. 5 mm SL) provided their embryos with a jelly-like albumen matrix and all embryos developed. Haustrum scobina encapsulated on average 235 ± 17 embryos per capsule but only ~ 10 reached the hatching stage (~ 1. 2 mm SL), {{with the remaining}} siblings being consumed as nurse embryos, mainly during the first 4 wk of development. Similar chronology in the developmental stages was recognizable among species. Higher growth rates and evident juvenile structures became clear by {{the second half of}} development and larval characteristics were less frequently observed. Even after 10 weeks of encapsulation and despite emergent crawling juveniles, some hatchling H. scobina still retained “larval” traits, suggesting that this nurse embryo-based provisioning could result in intracapsular asynchrony of development, and that female of this species would be able to bet-hedge in a higher extent compared with female C. maculosa or C. virgata. Maternal investment in newly laid egg capsules differed among the three study species. The structural lipids phospholipid (PL) and cholesterol (ST) and the energetic lipids aliphatic hydrocarbon (AH), triglycerides (TG), diglycerides (DG) and free fatty acids (FFA) occurred in all three species. Only eggs (and also hatchlings) of the multiencapsulated embryos C. maculosa and H. scobina were provisioned with the energy lipids wax ester (WE) and methyl ester (ME), suggesting an interesting similarity with pelagic larvae of other invertebrates and fish where those lipid classes have also been recorded. Despite differences in hatchling size, the small H. scobina had significantly higher amounts of the energy storage lipid TG compared with C. maculosa and C. virgata, suggesting interesting trade-offs between offspring size and offspring energy resources. H. scobina was the only species that suffered a complete depletion of FFA during development (5 th wk), suggesting an additional role of this energetic lipid during the early stages of development. Differences in the amount of lipids among newly laid capsules and siblings within capsules were also detected within species. In both species with multiple embryos per capsule, C. maculosa and H. scobina, these differences were largely explained by variation in TG and PL, enhancing the important role of the major structural (PL) and energy (TG) lipids during the early stages of these whelks, and also providing an integrative approach for evaluating maternally-derived lipids on a perindividual basis in direct developing species with contrasting provisioning and offspring size. Because in direct developers maternal provisioning to the embryos is the primary source of nutrition until offspring enter juvenile life, differences in performance should be closely related with <b>initial</b> <b>provisioning,</b> which in turn may reflect maternal nutritional conditions. Field-based surveys and manipulative experiments in the laboratory showed that different maternal environments (i. e. locations and sites) and contrasting offspring size influenced juvenile performance in different ways for C. virgata and C. maculosa. Despite the large differences in conditions and available resources between the Wellington Harbour and the nearby South Coast, the two locations did not influence the hatchling size of either species, and the most important source of variation was at the smallest scale (i. e. among sites), with substantial variation also occurring within and among females. Between and within species differences in hatching size reflected juvenile performance when fed, regardless of whether subjected to desiccation stress. When starved however, species-specific and size differences in performance were less significant. As has been described for many taxa, large offspring often perform better than small conspecifics; however, because this performance is likely to be context-dependent, understanding the importance of the different scales of variation is crucial for determining how variation in size reflects an organism’s performance. Despite the long recognized role of intra-specific variation in offspring size in mediating subsequent performance, the consequences of inter-specific variation in peroffspring maternal investment for co-occurring taxa have been rarely examined in a predator-prey context. Manipulative experiments in the laboratory with hatchling and juvenile C. virgata and C. maculosa revealed that vulnerability of their early life-stages to common crab predators (i. e. the shore crab Cyclograpsus lavauxi) is highly size-dependent. When predator size was evaluated, small crabs were unable to eat hatchlings of either whelk species. Medium and large shore crabs consumed both prey species; however, hatchlings of C. virgata were less vulnerable to predation by medium crabs than large ones, and C. maculosa were equally vulnerable to both sizes of crabs. In hatchlings of both prey species the shell length and shell thickness increased over time; however, only C. virgata reached a size refuge from predation after two months posthatch. Results showed that vulnerability to predators can be mitigated by larger sizes and thicker shells at hatch; nonetheless, other species-specific traits such as juvenile growth rates, may also play key roles in determining the vulnerability of hatchling and juvenile snails when exposed to shell-crushing predators. Overall, these findings suggest that when defining offspring size, provisioning and performance relationships, many context-dependent scenarios are likely to arise. Therefore examining the early life-history stages of direct developing whelks with contrasting maternal investment under an integrative morphological, physiological and experimental approach, allowed {{a better understanding of how}} these complex relationships arises and how mediated the species life-history in terms of offspring size, maternal provisioning and subsequent juvenile performance...|$|E
