40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> hazards {{associated}} with polypropylene wall linings sub-jected to small ignition sources, were evaluated using large scale experiments and cone calorimetry. A series of seven ignition sources with increasing sever-ity as recommended in BS 5852 {{were used in}} the tests. The results obtained in-dicate that ignition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polypropylene linings is likely when exposed to igni-tion sources 5 to 7 as defined in BS 5852. It was observed that <b>the</b> melting behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polypropylene wall linings significantly affected the burning behaviour. A pool fire, consisting of melted polymer, formed at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall which then controlled <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>growth</b> processes. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> flame spread on the lining surface which depended on <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pool <b>fire</b> was slow because the thin polymer sheet could only supply a limited amount of melted polymer to the pool.

40|$|Hong Kong's {{economy has}} {{undergone}} a remarkable transformation {{over the past two}} decades. The rapid expansion of the service sector is a major outcome. Within the services sector, the finance, insurance, real estate (FIRE) and business services sub-sector is the most influential and also the major source of generating demand for office space in the economy. This paper examines how the rapid expansion of the FIRE and business service sub-sector influences new office construction. Using the Engle-Granger (1987) methodology for cointegration and error correction mechanism (ECM), the causal relationships between growth of sub-sectors of the services sector and the new office space construction were explored. The FIRE and business services sub-sector growth is shown to be cointegrated with new office space construction.

While previous research has examined the post-entry time-series behavior of firms, this research has focused exclusively on manufacturing firms. Examining <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> nonmanufacturing firms is important for two reasons. First, since <b>the</b> relative importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing industry has been declining recently, <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> manufacturing firms may be much different than <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> firms in an expanding industry, such as <b>FIRE.</b> Thus, comparing <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> firms in a nonmanufacturing industry, with <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing firms provides more general knowledge about firm behavior. Second, since any good theory of firm dynamics should explain cross-industry differences in firm behavior, cross-industry differences in behavior must be documented before models of this type can be developed. <b>The</b> main finding <b>of</b> this paper are: (1) relative to FIRE firms, manufacturing firms experience more periods <b>of</b> above average <b>growth</b> immediately after entry; (2) relative to FIRE firms, manufacturing firms experience more periods <b>of</b> below average <b>growth</b> immediately prior to exit; and (3) relative to <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing firms, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical <b>FIRE</b> firm is much more responsive to transitory shocks.

30|$|Heat release rate is an {{important}} fire severity characteristic relating to fire safety (Babrauskas and Peacock 1992). The heat release rate time-history defines the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and other related characteristics such as the peak heat release rate, the time to the peak and the total energy release which in turn determine some measures {{of the severity of}} the fire particularly when considering the impacts to people and property remote from the vehicle itself. Moreover, the fire environment can be assessed using the heat release rate information as input to a calculation. For example, the smoke layer height as a measure of tenability can be predicted by a computational model once the heat release rate is determined. In addition, the tenability components of smoke such as obscuration, toxic species and heat may need to be determined and these components can often be obtained {{as a function of the}} heat release rate. Thus, this review compiles the available heat release rates curves for a single passenger road vehicles from the current literature to form a resource for calculations such as the fire spread between vehicles, fire and smoke conditions in enclosures (such as car parks or tunnels), etc.|$|E
40|$|The Layman fire {{commenced}} as {{a routine}} fuel reduction burn in southwest Western Australia in October 2010. Late {{morning on the}} day following ignition, the fire was more active than fire management officers had expected under the prevailing conditions of wind, temperature and relative humidity in the local eucalypt forest fuels. A convective smoke plume developed over the fire, extending to a height of approximately 4000 m. Traditional measures for assessing fire behaviour gave no indication {{of the extent of}} the crown fire that occurred. This paper describes simulations of the fire using the coupled fire-atmosphere model WRF and SFIRE. The simulations show that fire-atmosphere feedback produces a northeast to northwest wind shift and surface convergence occur over the fire just after the fire’s buoyant plume grows through the overnight nocturnal layer into the residual mixed layer of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) from the previous day. The simulation results show that the timing of the wind shift and vertical <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> plume closely matched the observed development of the convective smoke plume above the fire.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Engineering and Architecture, Washington State UniversitySmoke plumes {{associated}} with wildland fires {{are difficult to}} characterize due to the non-linear behavior of the variables involved. Plume chemistry is largely modeled using emission factors to represent the relative trace gas and aerosol species emitted. Plume dynamics are modeled based on assumptions of plume vertical distribution and atmospheric dispersion. In the studies presented here, near and in-source measurements of emissions from prescribed burns are used to characterize the variability of emission factors from low-intensity fires. Emissions factors {{were found to be}} in the same range as those from other, similar studies in the literature and it appears that the emission factors may be sensitive to small differences in surface conditions such as fuel moisture, surface wind speed, and the ratio of live to dead fuels. We also used two coupled fire atmosphere models, which utilize the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model called WRF-Fire and WRF-Sfire, to investigate the role that atmospheric stability plays in influencing plume rise as well as developing a technique for assessing plume rise and the vertical distribution of pollutants in regional air quality models.

40|$|In Swedish law, fire {{protection}} in buildings facing antagonistic threats is not regulated. Buildings facing antagonistic threats with fire {{as a consequence}} can include services important for the community, for example embassies and military facilities. The Swedish police and military intelligence service states that <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> terrorism threats is elevated in Sweden. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency has assigned the Swedish Fortifications Agency to compile a handbook on how buildings should be designed to be safe based on the threat level. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this thesis {{is to develop a}} basis for how buildings can be protected against deliberately lit fires and antagonistic fire threats. Ten respondents have been interviewed and the interviews were in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> openly directed interview. The respondents represent for example emergency service, the consulting industry and <b>fire</b> researchers. <b>The</b> questions asked concerned how to think when designing {{fire protection}}, which parts of a building that are more exposed, what line of action and which starting area that is most likely when deliberately lighting a fire. Furthermore, questions about differences between a deliberately lit fire and an accidental fire as well as the probability for an attack were posed. A thematic analysis was performed on the interview data. The results show that the most common starting area for a deliberately lit <b>fire</b> was <b>the</b> façade, since it is accessible. Plausible lines of action for a deliberately lit <b>fire</b> for <b>the</b> studied type <b>of</b> building were to use flammable liquids, explosives or materials found at the scene as the ignition source. The difference between <b>the</b> two <b>fire</b> developments seemed to lie in <b>the</b> initial <b>growth</b> stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> A fire that is lit with flammable liquids has a much faster growth rate. Another difference was that for <b>the</b> deliberately lit <b>fire</b> an optimum starting area can be chosen to obtain great damage. The working process when designing <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> protection should be initialized with a risk and sensitivity analysis. The solutions that are chosen should be seen as an investment for the future. The outside {{has been shown to be}} the most common starting area, but Boverket’s building regulations are generally developed for a fire that starts inside the building. Due to this, the façade might need more protection for example by availability restrictions and that the façade is made out of nonflammable material. To secure <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people the requirement for two independent means of egress should always be fulfilled. Surveillance, dividing the building into zones and classifying the building plans are some actions that can prevent an attack. An easy action to prevent a fire is to keep the areas clean from garbage. <b>The</b> consequences <b>of</b> a <b>fire</b> can be limited by <b>fire</b> alarm systems. <b>The</b> deliberately lit <b>fire</b> attributes can mean that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> protection systems in the building are under designed, redundancy in the systems can solve this problem.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} <b>the</b> charring rate <b>of</b> large structural members <b>of</b> timber and <b>the</b> material properties and external {{factors that influence}} on <b>the</b> charring <b>of</b> these members. <b>The</b> most commonly used temperature-time curves for large structures, and calculation models for <b>the</b> charring rate <b>of</b> wood, are evaluated and used to establish the documented charring rates. The most important material properties and external factors that influence <b>the</b> charring rate <b>of</b> large timber structures are found by an extensive literature review, and total impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties and factors are listed in tables. However, the change in charring rate due to the various properties and factors is not unambiguous and more systematic research should be carried out to determine rules. An evaluation of calculation models for <b>the</b> charring rate <b>of</b> solid wood, nail-, glue- and cross-laminated structural members was performed and the models giving results closest to test results from the literature were determined. The standard model, EN 1995 - 1 - 2, was only accurate in a few cases. The models that include more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties and factors found to influence the charring rate were most accurate. Evaluation of standard and parametric temperature-time curves for <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> timber structures reveal that <b>the</b> “Swedish” <b>fire</b> and iBMB <b>fire</b> give <b>the</b> best representation <b>of</b> a real fire in a timber structure. The EN 1991 - 1 - 2 Standard fire {{does not include the}} contribution to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> load from <b>the</b> timber structure, and the EN 1991 - 1 - 2 Parametric fire has an unrealistic linear cooling stage. The experimental tests on <b>the</b> charring rate <b>of</b> cross-laminated timber panels show that the calculation models for the charring rate are inaccurate for this type <b>of</b> structural member. <b>The</b> charring rate is affected by <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and <b>the</b> maximum temperature. High initial growth rates result in higher charring rates. Short fires with steep cooling rate will have a short charring period, while a long fire will reach constant charring rate after a while. Comparing the obtained test results with test results from other researchers gave good matches. The charring rates found during the experimental tests are compared with charring rates found using the calculation models from the literature evaluated earlier in the thesis. As the experiments only resulted in a few measurements for <b>the</b> “Swedish” <b>fire</b> and <b>the</b> EN 1991 - 1 - 2 Parametric fire there was not much to compare with. The char depths for the EN 1991 - 1 - 2 Standard and Parametric fires match well with each other, but the charring rates have a wide scatter. This research has pointed out several issues where knowledge is lacking for fire safe design of large timber structures. <b>The</b> behaviour <b>of</b> exposed timber structures in compartment fires should be studied further, and the influence the timber structure has on the temperature development over time needs more research. This can result in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> better temperature-time curves for fire exposed timber structures. The models for, calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charring rate given in EN 1995 - 1 - 2 should be improved by introducing more factors and carrying out more research on the properties and factors that influence the charring rate.   PhD i bygg, anlegg og transportPhD in Civil and Transport Engineerin...|$|R

The proposal was initially rejected as being too expensive, however <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suburb eventually made it a necessity. A block of land extending from Pashen Street to Stephens Street was acquired for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> station, where <b>the</b> existing house and outbuildings were utilised as a temporary station from 30 June 1925 until March 1927 when the purpose-built station was opened.|$|R
