During the mid-Pliocene warm period (3. 264 to 3. 025 {{million years}} ago), global mean {{temperature}} was simi-lar to that predicted {{for the next century}} and atmospheric car-bon dioxide concentrations were slightly higher than today. Sea level was also higher than today, implying a reduction in the extent of the ice sheets. Thus, the mid-Pliocene warm pe-riod (mPWP) provides a unique testing ground to investigate the stability of the Earthâ€™s ice sheets and their contribution to sea level in a warmer-than-modern world. Climate mod-els and ice sheet models can be used to enhance our under-standing of ice sheet stability; however, uncertainties asso-ciated with different ice-sheet modelling frameworks mean that a rigorous comparison of numerical ice sheet model simulations for the Pliocene is essential. As an extension to the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP; <b>Hay-wood</b> et al., 2010, 2011 a), the Pliocene Ice Sheet Modelling Intercomparison Project (PLISMIP) will provide the first as-sessment as to the ice sheet model dependency of ice sheet predictions for the mPWP. Here we outline the PLISMIP ex-perimental design and initialisation conditions that have been adopted to simulate the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets under present-day and warm mid-Pliocene conditions. Not only will this project provide a new benchmark in the sim-ulation of ice sheets in a past warm period, but the analysis of model sensitivity to various uncertainties could directly inform future predictions of ice sheet and sea level change. ...|$|E
