The Sexual Harassment Perception Scale (SHPS) was used to measure the perception of sexual harassment Analysis of variance indicated that physically attractive males were perceived as less <b>harassing</b> than physically unattractive males, F(1, 68) = 5. 44, p 3 ̆c. 05.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess how {{attendance}} at a peer-led sexual harassment workshop affects college students 2 ̆ 7 intervention in response to their peers 2 ̆ 7 sexually <b>harassing</b> behaviors. A quasi-experimental panel design was used to assess change over an interval of six months. An instrument, the Sexually <b>Harassing</b> Behaviors Bystander Intervention Inventory (SHBBII), was developed to measure self-reported intervention response to different sexually <b>harassing</b> behaviors. College student peer sexually <b>harassing</b> behaviors were categorized as gender <b>harassing,</b> taunting or intrusive sexually <b>harassing</b> behaviors. Statistically significant differences were found between control and workshop students 2 ̆ 7 post-test interventions on Gender Intervention, Intrusive Intervention and Total Intervention scores. Students intervened more as observers among other witnesses than when they were sole witnesses. A causal model was constructed from a blocked hierarchical regression analysis for each of the sexually <b>harassing</b> behavior dimensions and for Total Interventions, using five student characteristics (student gender, academic class, racial/ethnic identity, resident assistant status and other sexual harassment training experience), pre-test scores and treatment condition. Implications for program assessment, educational policy, future legal directions and future research are discussed. ...|$|R

5|$|While nesting, Arctic terns are {{vulnerable}} to predation by cats and other animals. Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger herring gull steals eggs and hatchlings. Camouflaged eggs help prevent this, as do isolated nesting sites. While feeding, skuas, gulls, and other tern species will often <b>harass</b> the birds and steal their food. They often form mixed colonies with other terns, such as common and Sandwich terns.|$|E
5|$|After several months, Noriega was {{transferred}} to the province of Chiriquí, where Torrijos and Díaz Herrera were posted. That year's presidential election was contested by Arnulfo Arias, a native of that province. The sitting President, Rodolfo Chiari, ordered Torrijos to <b>harass</b> Arias's party members, to weaken his election bid. Torrijos passed this task on to Noriega, whose men arrested a number of people. Several prisoners said that they had been tortured; others stated they had been raped in prison. The brutality of Noriega's activities led to him being suspended for ten days, an item of information that was picked up by the U.S. intelligence services.|$|E

40|$|Some discursive {{incidents}} can {{be interpreted}} as either humorous or sexually <b>harassing.</b> Previous research has acknowledged sexually <b>harassing</b> situations to be ambiguous in nature, leading to questions of intent and outcome (Cohen 2 ̆ 6 Gutek, 1985; Keyton 2 ̆ 6 Menzie, 2007). Humorous incidents have also been acknowledged to be uncertain in nature (Bippus, 2003; Graham, Papa 2 ̆ 6 Brooks, 1992), in similar capacities as potentially sexually <b>harassing</b> messages. Each adds another layer of complication to an interaction. This study uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to understand both generalized and individual approaches to and interpretations of sexually <b>harassing</b> or humorous situations. Implications for both research and practice are discussed. ...|$|R

5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could <b>harass</b> a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to <b>harass</b> supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{males and females}} perceive sexual harassment of a female and if provocative dress {{plays a role in}} the perception of sexual harassment. Participants included 135 Framingham State College students (61 men). Participants were randomly assigned to read 1 of 4 scenarios that depicted a woman (provocatively dressed or not) being <b>harassed</b> (high or low level) by a male stranger. Students responded to an instrument assessing the perceived degree of harassment. Scales included the Harassment Attitude Scale, <b>Harassing,</b> the Uncertain, and Not <b>Harassing</b> Scale, the Mastery Scale and a demographic questionnaire. Findings showed no differences between males and females when rating low harassment scenarios and no difference between men and women who rated a high threat scenario versus a low threat scenario. When the victim dressed provocatively male participants rated high and low threat situations the same. Lastly, {{there was no difference in}} the level of powerlessness between students who were <b>harassed</b> and students who were not <b>harassed...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how mock jurors perceive female-female sexual harassment. Participants read a case vignette depicting female-female sexual harassment where the sexual {{orientation of the}} <b>harasser</b> (lesbian vs. straight) and type of sexual harassment (approach vs. reject vs. generalized) were counterbalanced across participants. Participants were asked to make a liability determination for the case. They {{were also asked to}} rate the unwanted conduct on several legally relevant dimensions (e. g., severity, pervasiveness, unwelcomeness). Results show that sexual orientation of the <b>harasser</b> is the most important factor used to determine liability, with participants finding more liability when the <b>harasser</b> was lesbian than when the <b>harasser</b> was straight. Participants similarly found the same conduct to be more severe, pervasive, unwelcome, and threatening when the <b>harasser</b> was lesbian than when she was straight. As expected, female participants found more evidence of discrimination than male participants. These findings illustrate biases mock jurors may hold when making legal decisions in female-female sexual harassment cases...|$|R
