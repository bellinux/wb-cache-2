This paper presents an energy efficient precoding/power allocation algorithm for the downlink of the multi-cell multi-user multi-antenna channel, based on block diagonalization (BD).

40|$|Journal PaperCurrent {{theories}} of a time-varying spectrum of a nonstationary process all involve, either by definition or by difficulties in estimation, {{an assumption that}} the signal statistics vary slowly over time. This restrictive quasi-stationarity assumption limits the use of existing estimation techniques to a small class of nonstationary processes. We overcome this limitation by deriving a statistically optimal kernel, within Cohen's class of time-frequency representations (TFRs), for estimating the Wigner-Ville spectrum of a nonstationary process. We also solve the related problem of minimum mean-squared error estimation of an arbitrary bilinear TFR of a realization of a process from a correlated observation. Both optimal time-frequency invariant and time-frequency varying kernels are derived. It is proven that, {{in the presence of}} any additive noise, optimal performance requires a nontrivial kernel, and that optimal estimation may require smoothing filters very different from those based on a quasi-stationarity assumption. Examples confirm that the optimal estimators often yield tremendous improvements in performance over existing methods. In particular, the ability of the optimal kernel to suppress interference is quite remarkable, thus making the proposed framework potentially useful for <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> via time-frequency <b>filtering...</b>|$|R

However, which specific executive control processes are involved is not known. One candidate executive process is <b>interference</b> <b>suppression,</b> which refers to the suppression of task-irrelevant information through the active maintenance of task-relevant information or a cognitive load. Objective: The present study aimed to (1) establish whether alcohol action tendency can be inhibited by <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> through the use of cognitive loads and (2) to assess whether individual differences in the degree of <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> from cognitive loads is related to individual differences in the ability to regulate {{alcohol consumption}}. Method: Two groups of social drinkers (total N[*]=[*] 58) who differed in their ability to regulate their alcohol consumption completed a novel cognitive load variant of the approach avoidance task (AAT) and an alcohol taste test. Results: Results indicated that (1) there was a relationship between alcohol bias on the AAT and alcohol consumption under low load, but not high load, consistent with the hypothesis that the action tendency would be inhibited through <b>interference</b> <b>suppression,</b> and (2) this effect of load was not modified by drinking group, with both groups demonstrating equivalent ability to inhibit the action tendency.
