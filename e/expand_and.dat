5|$|The Awahnechee {{and other}} {{aboriginal}} groups changed {{the environment of}} the Yosemite area. Parts of valley floors were intentionally burned each year to encourage the growth of acorn-bearing black oaks. Fire kept forests open, reducing the risk of ambush, and the open areas helped to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> maintain meadows.|$|E

5|$|The band's early {{sound was}} rooted in post-punk and pop but {{eventually}} grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music.

5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station. The cause {{was a combination of}} a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, many {{residential}} buildings {{were located in}} the Fortezza. Following the end of World War II, the city began to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> many of the inhabitants moved elsewhere in the city. Rethymno's landward fortifications and many houses within the Fortezza were demolished at this point, but {{the walls of the}} Fortezza were left intact. At one point, the local prison was housed within the Fortezza.|$|E

5|$|Continual {{growth and}} outside {{investments}} {{during these years}} allowed the company to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59million in sales, their highest ever. This constant growth made Odwalla {{one of the largest}} fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla's products were healthier than regular juice because of unpasteurization.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Guy Caron {{left the}} company due to artistic {{differences}} {{over what to do}} with the money generated by Cirque du Soleil's first financially successful tour. Laliberté wanted to use it to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> start a second show while Caron wanted the money to be saved, with a portion going back to the National Circus School. An agreement was never met and Caron, along with a large number of artists loyal to him, departed. This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{nations are}} {{beginning}} to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study {{of the effects of}} fishing on seamount communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|James was laird {{until his}} death in 1734, after which the estate passed to his eldest son, also called James, who was born at Pitfour soon after it was purchased. A {{solicitor}} like his father, he was promoted to the bench in 1764 and became Lord Pitfour. He continued to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> improve the estate {{until his death}} in 1777, and set up the planned village of Fetterangus in 1752.|$|E

5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance should be given to promoting exports.|$|E
5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Ring Road was {{completed}} in November 1974 around the town centre {{in an attempt to}} relieve congestion, though part of it involved demolition of existing properties and part of the old market. It initially opened as one way, but was converted back into a two-way operation in 2007, at a total cost of £14m, so the town centre could <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> accommodate more people. The two-way route incorporates the first shared space scheme in the country. An art installation, Lost O, curated by the artist Michael Pinsky, was created as part of this redevelopment but confused drivers.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> collapsing regions by taking two well-known spherically symmetric spacetimes. For this purpose, the general formalism is developed by using Israel junction conditions for arbitrary spacetimes. This {{has been used}} to obtain the surface energy density and the tangential pressure. The minimal pressure provides the gateway to explore the <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> collapsing regions. We take Minkowski and Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes and use the general formulation to {{investigate the}} <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> collapsing regions of the shell.

5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The third laird, {{also named}} James, {{inherited}} the estate in 1777; he was usually {{referred to as}} the Member to differentiate him from previous generations. Like his forebears, he was an advocate but also became a Member of Parliament. He too continued to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> improve the estate; he constructed a lake and a canal, and built the new mansion. He also expanded and altered Longside {{at the start of the}} 1800s, founded Mintlaw in 1813, assisted in the extension of New Deer and extended Buchanhaven.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Pictures {{purchased}} the film rights for Who Framed Roger Rabbits story in 1981. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman wrote two drafts {{of the script}} before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg, and his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film, and Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming, the production budget began to rapidly <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> the shooting schedule ran longer than expected.|$|E
