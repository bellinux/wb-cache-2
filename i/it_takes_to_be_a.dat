They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. I can see that with myself as well because you expect so much from yourself. You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- like you have to have masculine qualities as well as feminine. It’s just a song that recognizes what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> girl today, and it’s quite a lot.|$|E
500|$|Later on in {{the same}} essay, she commented that Brandon both {{embodied}} and rejected traditional masculinity, providing a new outlook on {{what it means to}} be a man which excited and thrilled the women in the film: [...] "Brandon’s performance of masculinity, however, can be interpreted as operating on two levels in the narratives: When Brandon tries to establish his male identity with his new buddies, he imitates the kind of overly aggressive macho machismo that John and Tom represent. But Lana falls for Brandon because of his version of masculinity, which contradicts and challenges traditional assumptions about what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> man and to please a woman. Brandon’s articulation of manhood effectively mocks sexist masculine ideals and appropriates the codes of normative masculinity." [...] Michele Aaron, in Screen, claimed that the film was primarily centered on [...] "the spectacle of transvestism" [...] and that the film as a whole was [...] "a tale of passing".|$|E
500|$|At World's End {{was meant}} to return it tonally to a {{character}} piece. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones's Locker, and now desires immortality. Sparrow struggles with what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> moral person, after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack's hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of [...] "Jack Sparrows" [...] appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two [...] "Jacks" [...] constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won (possibly due to not liking his sea creature-like [...] "future", which comedically dropped his brain and searched for it around the Brig). By the end of At World's End, Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expressed interest in a spin-off. Gore Verbinski concurred that [...] "all of the stories {{set in motion by}} the first film have been resolved. If there ever were another Pirates of the Caribbean film, I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, Farah Khan's Happy New Year was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om (2007). Set {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of the Hindi film industry, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual rolesShantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, [...] "I've grown up watching [...] and always admired him so much. To get to work with him... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him." [...] In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language, which she felt [...] "were more graceful" [...] and [...] "completely different from today's actors." [...] However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty. For one of the songs in the film, [...] "Dhoom Taana,” Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, [...] "mesmeriz audiences" [...] by using hasta mudras (hand gestures). Om Shanti Om was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, with a global revenue of [...] Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama reviewed, [...] "Deepika has all <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> top starthe personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too.

[...] At the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, Padukone was awarded the Best Female Debut Award and received her first nomination in the Best Actress category.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, {{the concept}} of [...] "employeeship" [...] recognizes that what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good leader is not too {{dissimilar}} to what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good employee. Therefore, bringing the notional leader together with the team to explore these similarities (rather than focusing on the differences) brings positive results. This approach has been particularly successful in Sweden where the power distance between manager and team is small.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Rediff listed {{her as the}} ninth-greatest Indian actress of all time, noting, [...] "It's {{hard not}} to be bowled over by Rekha's longevity, or her ability to reinvent herself... the actress took on a man's job and did it stunningly well, holding her own against all the top actors and being remembered despite them." [...] Filmfare {{described}} her acting style, writing, [...] "...when it comes to style, sexiness or sheer onscreen presence, she's unparalleled... a fierce, raw, flinty performer with unbridled honesty. Her acting isn't gimmicky." [...] Critic Khalid Mohamed commends her technical control: [...] "She knows how to give and to what degree. She has all that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> director. There is a kind of vulnerability in her control. She explores when she is acting." [...] Shyam Benegal, who directed her in two movies, believes she is [...] "a director's actress". M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune wrote, [...] "Rekha's flowering as an actress post Ghar and Khubsoorat climaxed in [...] Umrao Jaan. As a tragic courtesan she gave a performance of consummate artistry, adopting a much-admired huskiness and despondency of tone. Rekha communicated much with a delicately raised eyebrow.

2500|$|For Warrior Within, a {{decision}} {{was taken by the}} development team from the outset to make the game's atmosphere darker. They also wanted to flesh the Prince out as a character, as they had felt something was lacking in The Sands of Time. With these concepts in mind, they decided the Prince would [...] "grow up", with the story being more focused on his character than him saving a person or place. The two people most involved with the Prince's redesigned were art director Mikael Labat and illustrator Nicolas Bouvier. During the early stages, some hybrid designs with his appearance in The Sands of Time were created, but it was soon decided that the team was not being radical enough with the redesign. His [...] "charisma" [...] needed to be new, yet consistent with the events of The Sands of Time. His new armor reflected this change: it is made up of interlaced leather straps, granting him protection while giving him freedom to perform his acrobatic movements. His design and portrayal in The Two Thrones was intended to be a balance of elements from both The Sands of Time and The Warrior Within. In The Forgotten Sands, the story was written around the Prince still being a developing character, learning what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> ruler and to take responsibility for his actions. His representation was a cross between his portrayals in The Sands of Time and Warrior Within.|$|E
2500|$|Louise {{is now a}} young woman, and Rose {{has built}} a pale {{imitation}} of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell [...] "Madame Rose's Toreadorables" [...] to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together ("Together, Wherever We Go"). With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas, {{as a means to}} deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> successful stripper, a [...] "gimmick," [...] something that [...] "makes your strip special" [...] ("You Gotta Get a Gimmick"). Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. On {{the last day of the}} booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation. Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the strip tease as a last-minute replacement. Disgusted at Rose's blind ambition for her daughter, Herbie walks out on Rose forever ("Small World (Reprise)"). Although reluctant, Louise wants to please her mother and she goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip, but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old kiddie act song, [...] "May We Entertain You?". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her 'audience', which becomes her [...] "gimmick" [...] ("Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy Strip Tease)").|$|E
