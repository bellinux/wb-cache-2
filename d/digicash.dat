Chaum stated {{in an interview in}} 1999 that the <b>DigiCash</b> project, and its technology system, entered the market before e-commerce was fully integrated within the Internet. [...] In 1998, <b>DigiCash</b> filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and in 2002 the company was sold for assets.|$|E
50|$|<b>DigiCash</b> {{was a form}} {{of early}} {{electronic}} payment which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This advancement of public and private key cryptography allows electronic payments to become untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or a third party. This system of Blind Signatures through <b>DigiCash</b> software improved security for its users through the issuance of secured keys which prevented third parties from accessing personal information through online transactions. The Mark Twain Bank, later acquired by Mercantile bank, located in Missouri was the only U.S. bank supported <b>DigiCash</b> systems. Deutsche Bank, based in Germany, was the second backing bank of <b>DigiCash</b> systems.|$|E

5000|$|David Lee Chaum (born 1955) is an American {{computer}} scientist and cryptographer. He {{is famous for}} developing ecash, an electronic cash application that aims to preserve a user’s anonymity. He has also invented many cryptographic protocols and founded <b>DigiCash,</b> an electronic money corporation. His 1981 paper, [...] "Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms", {{laid the groundwork for}} the field of anonymous communications research.|$|E
50|$|Chaum {{gained a}} {{doctorate}} in computer science and business administration from the University of California, Berkeley in 1982. Also that year, he founded the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), which currently organizes academic conferences in cryptography research. Subsequently, he taught at the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration and at the University of California. He also formed a cryptography research group at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He founded <b>DigiCash,</b> an electronic cash company, in 1990.|$|E
50|$|David Chaum is {{associated}} with the invention of Blind Signature Technology. In 1982, while studying at the University of California, Berkeley, Chaum wrote a paper describing the technological advancements to public and private key technology in order to create this Blind Signature Technology. Chaum's Blind Signature Technology was designed to ensure the complete privacy of users who conduct online transactions. Chaum was concerned with the public nature and open access to online payments and personal information. He then proposed to construct a system of cryptographic protocols in which a bank or the government would be unable to trace personal payments conducted online. This technology became fully implemented in 1990 through Chaum's company, <b>DigiCash.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Chaum {{started the}} company <b>DigiCash</b> in 1990 with [...] "ecash" [...] as its trademark. He raised $10 million from David Marquardt and by 1997 Nicholas Negroponte was its chairman. Yet, in the United States, only one bank -the Mark Twain bank in Saint Louis,MO- {{implemented}} ecash, testing it as micropayment system; Similar to credit cards, {{the system was}} free to purchasers, while merchants paid a transaction fee. After a three-year trial that signed up merely 5,000 customers, the system was dissolved in 1998, {{one year after the}} bank had been purchased by Mercantile Bank, a large issuer of credit cards. David Chaum opined then “As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped. It was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company has}} been {{controversial}} for its alleged use of patents as a competitive hindrance. The [...] "1-Click patent" [...] is perhaps the best-known example of this. Amazon's use of the one-click patent against competitor Barnes & Noble's website led the Free Software Foundation to announce a boycott of Amazon in December 1999. The boycott was discontinued in September 2002. On February 22, 2000, the company was granted a patent covering an Internet-based customer referral system, or what is commonly called an [...] "affiliate program". Industry leaders Tim O'Reilly and Charlie Jackson spoke out against the patent, and O'Reilly published {{an open letter to}} Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, protesting the 1-click patent and the affiliate program patent, and petitioning him to [...] "avoid any attempts to limit the further development of Internet commerce". O'Reilly collected 10,000 signatures with this petition. Bezos responded with his own open letter. The protest ended with O'Reilly and Bezos visiting Washington, D.C. to lobby for patent reform. On February 25, 2003, the company was granted a patent titled [...] "Method and system for conducting a discussion relating to an item on Internet discussion boards". On May 12, 2006, the USPTO ordered a re-examination of the [...] "One-Click" [...] patent, based on a request filed by actor Peter Calveley, who cited the prior art of an earlier e-commerce patent and the <b>Digicash</b> electronic cash system.|$|E

40|$|The unparalleled {{success of}} the Internet has led to much debate about its ability to {{securely}} handle financial transactions. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is currently the de facto standard for the exchange of trade data, but the interest in the Internet amongst private users and business has made this a potentially very powerful and perhaps lucrative medium for conducting commerce. However, there is no widely adopted payment system that fulfils {{the needs of all}} interested parties. This report looks into electronic commerce and evaluates payment systems that are being developed for open networks, mostly focusing on the Internet. This report identifies key requirements that successful use for the Internet must impose on payment mechanisms. The payment systems can be classified as token, credit/debit or cash-based systems, examples of which are <b>DigiCash,</b> CyberCash and Mondex. Each system is evaluated in-depth against a general set of requirements which include security, global acceptance and ease of use and also against 3 hypothetical scenarios to obtain system strengths and weaknesses. <b>DigiCash</b> is best but this is attributed to omissions in functionality and use by competing systems rather than the strength of the <b>DigiCash</b> system itself. The text highlights the ways in which electronic commerce can be used and illustrates what the features of the main systems are. For this reason it should be read by researchers and I. T. enthusiasts interested in the implications and expectations of this area and also by merchants looking to experiment with selling goods and services over open networks. The report systematically shows, for example, why a merchant should choose one system over another. The conclusion to this report details improvements that need to be made to allow electronic commerce to flourish. A major issue is the inability of Internet protocols to offer service guarantees. Other issues include the need to have open standards to allow interoperability and the need for future software to embrace future needs such as interactive product specifications...|$|E
40|$|Cash in {{the real}} world allows for parties to {{exchange}} currency without the need to go through some sort of central authority. One person, Alice, can simply hand cash over to another person, Bob. In this transaction the only two people that have knowledge of this exchange are Alice and Bob. Until recently there was no electronic equivalent to this exchange. In 1982 David Chaum proposed a system of anonymous electronic cash based on blind signatures, and in 1990 founded <b>DigiCash</b> as an electronic cash company. There were a few banks that implemented electronic cash systems, but these banks and <b>DigiCash</b> ultimately went bankrupt in 1997 and 1998 despite the enthusiasm surrounding anonymous electronic cash. Between 1998 and 2008 there were no successful implementations of electronic cash that offer a decentralized, anonymous, and untraceable system. In 2008 a paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto on the cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency is a form of electronic cash backed by mathematical and cryptographic constructs, unlike traditional currency which was historically backed by gold or silver. Cryptocurrencies have seen rising popularity in recent years due to their decentralized, distributed, peer-to-peer protocols. Part of this rising popularity is also attributable to the supposed anonymity of these protocols; however, due to the public transaction history required for these protocols and the fact that transactions are pseudonymous and not purely anonymous, this supposed anonymity does not exist. While the systems may achieve the goal of decentralized currency it does not achieve the goal of untraceability. In this thesis we analyze the technical implementations of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to determine the level of anonymity provided by these protocols. We also analyze proposed improvements for their feasibility...|$|E
40|$|What {{properties}} of money {{are important for}} electronic commerce? We argue that both transactional and privacy properties distinguish electronic commerce systems. We provide a quick overview {{of the history of}} money. We then consider privacy provided by different forms of money, and socially desirable disclosure of information as specified by legal reporting requirements. We classify electronic and traditional commerce systems into two categories:. token systems, which exchange markers representing value. notational systems, where value is stored as notations in a ledger or computer. We analyze different forms of traditional money based on {{the degree to which they}} protect the privacy and preserve transactional ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties. Finally we apply our evaluation criteria to two proposed electronic commerce systems: <b>Digicash,</b> (Chaum, 1985; Chaum, 1992) a token-based system; and NetBill, (Sirbu, 1995) a notational system. 1 Token and Notationa [...] ...|$|E

30|$|Electronic payment services, {{including}} electronic banking, online financial escrow services, {{and other}} the online payment services by trusted third-party, {{have been the}} top critical success factor in e-commerce for two decades, and are the fundamental portion in Internet finance (Qiu 2013). China should be {{the country in the}} world that has been experiencing tremendous impacts from e-payment. In 2014 Chinese online payment companies grew 143.8 % to 10.3 trillion yuan ($ 1.66 trillion) (Tong, F 2015). This growth rate is two folded from the growth rate of banking card transactions in the same period (Duncan Hewitt 2015). In a long list of successful e-payment companies, such as PayPal, PaySomple, 2 C 2 P, Alipay, Unionpay, Tenpay, M-Pesa, <b>DigiCash,</b> GoCardless, etc., Alipay, born on December 30, 2004, is the most active and innovative one with its series of eye-attracting financial services launched in recent years (Qiu 2013). By a series of e-payment services since 2012, such as Quick Pay, barcode payment, and KongFu payment, Alipay facilitates customers with multiple bank accounts to simplify payment or transfer in the unique Alipay portal, and provides an online escrow service to reduce the risk perceptions of buyers and sellers in the e-market.|$|E
40|$|Your local {{publishing}} company Books’R’Us decides to publish on the Internet its latest book {{in an effort}} to cut down on printing costs and book distribution expenses. Customers pay for the digital books using sophisticated electronic payment mechanisms such as <b>DigiCash,</b> First Virtual or InterPay. When the payment is received, the book distribution server at Books’R’Us sends a digital version of the book electronically to the paying customer. Books’R’Us expects to make higher profits on the digital book due to lower production and distribution costs, and larger markets on the Internet. It turns out, however, that very few books are sold since digital copies of the Books’R’Us book had been widely circulated on UseNet newsgroups, bulletin boards, and had been available for free on alternate ftp sites and Web servers. Books’R’Us retract their digital publishing commitment blaming the ease of re-transmission of digital items on the Internet, and return to traditional paper based publishing.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} model checking {{techniques to}} examine NetBill and <b>Digicash.</b> We show how model checking can verify atomicity properties by analyzing simpli ed versions of these protocols that retain crucial security constraints. For our analysis {{we used the}} FDR model checker. 1 Atomicity Properties Correctness is a prime concern for electronic commerce protocols. How can we show that a given protocol is safe for use? Here we show how to use model checking to test whether electronic commerce protocols satisfy some given atomicity properties. For verifying properties of protocols, model checking is a dramatic improvement over doing hand proofs, because it is mechanizable � it is a dramatic improvement over using state-of-the-art theorem provers because it is automatic, fast, and requires no human interaction. Moreover, we found {{a number of problems}} in proposed electronic commerce protocols using model checking. Model checking allows us to focus on just those aspects of the protocol necessary to guarantee desired properties. In doing so, we can {{gain a better understanding of}} why the protocol works and often can identify places of optimizing it. For this paper, we have chosen to check atomicity properties. [2] argue that these properties are central to electronic commerce protocols. In an atomic protocol, an electronic purchase either aborts with no transfer of money and goods � o...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increased}} interest on the electronification of payments systems {{in the last two}} decades in general and on electronic money (e-money) on particular in the last decade with increased computing power and decreased cost of communication. E-money did not only attract attention from the academicians but also from central bankers, financial supervisory authorities, treasuries, finance ministries and innovators and operators all around the world. The purpose of this thesis is fourfold. Firstly, it seeks to define and critically assess e-money including the expected functions, necessary features, its potentials and major implications for different sides of financial system. Secondly, it tries to present empirical evidence on the current stage of e-money technology with two case studies, namely Mondei and <b>Digicash.</b> Thirdly, it investigates the perception of e-money innovators and operators with an assumption that they have the power and influence on the future shape of e-money. This section includes the analysis of two European surveys and one additional comparative survey conducted in Miami, the US. Lastly, it studies the free banking implications of e-money covering the impact on monetary policy framework and monetary policy instruments including whether e-money should be regulated or not. The research finds that the current definitions given to the e-money phenomenon is incomplete and defines the necessary functions and features for the future success of e-money applications. It describes e-money trends in Europe and compares it to the US perception finding no serious differences although the FED and the ECB have different approaches to money. Another conclusion the thesis reached is that e-money may result in a new approach to central banking with a contestable framework through the synergies with free banking. Finally, e-money is not seen as a danger for the successful conduct of monetary policy and the thesis underlines that when it is `representative', regulation is possible whereas `independent'money issuance may manage to stay out of the coverage of conventional regulatory frameworks...|$|E
