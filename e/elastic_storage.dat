This is based on: (a) comparison of kangaroos with the smaller kangaroo rat; and (b) calculations that predict that the capacity for <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage</b> relative to body mass increases with size. Here we argue that: (i) data from kangaroos and kangaroo rats cannot be generalized to other mammals; (ii) the <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage</b> capacity relative to body mass is not indicative of the importance of elastic energy to an animal; and (iii) the contribution of elastic energy to the mechanical work of locomotion will not increase as rapidly with size as the mass-specific energy storage capacity, because larger mammals must do relatively more mechanical work per stride. We predict how the ratio of <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage</b> to mechanical work will change with size in quadrupedal mammals by combining empirical scaling relationships from the literature. The results suggest that the percentage contribution of elastic energy to the mechanical work of locomotion decreases with size, so that elastic energy is more important in the locomotion of smaller mammals.

40|$|To {{test whether}} {{variation}} in muscle efficiency contributes to thermal stability during flight in the orchid bee, Euglossa imperialis, we measured CO 2 production, heat loss and flight kinematics at different air temperatures (T-a). We also {{examined the relationship}} between wingbeat frequency (WBF) and T-a in five additional species of orchid bees. Mean thoracic temperature (Tth) for Eg. imperialis hovering in a screened insectary and in the field was 39. 3 +/- 0. 77 degreesC (mean 95 % C. I.), and the slope of Tth on T-a was 0. 57. Head and abdominal temperature excess ratios declined with T-a, indicating that Eg. imperialis were not increasing heat dissipation from the thorax at high T-a. Elevation of Tth above T-a was correlated with WBF, but Tth alone was not. Estimates of heat production from both respirometry and heat loss experiments decreased 33 % as T-a rose from 24 to 34 degreesC. Mean muscle efficiency over this temperature range was 18 % assuming perfect <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage</b> and 22 % assuming zero <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage.</b> Both efficiency estimates increased significantly as T-a rose from 24 to 34 degreesC. In all six species examined, WBF declined significantly with T-a.

Treehoppers can attain a take-off velocity of up to 2.7 metres per second and an acceleration of up to 250 g.

40|$|Children perform cyclic motor tasks less {{efficiently}} than adults; however, the mechanisms underlying such differences {{are not fully}} understood. One mechanism thatmay contribute to these age-related differences is a differential contribution of muscles and tendons to a given muscle-tendon unit (MTU) excursion. The aims {{of this study were}} to (i) compare muscle and tendon excursion between children and adults performing vertical hopping, and (ii) determine whether children and adults choose a hopping frequency that maximizes movement efficiency, based on the utilization of energy-saving mechanisms. Twelve children (8. 8 ± 0. 3 years) and 12 adults (26. 0 ± 2. 1 years) performed 20 s of two-legged hopping at a self-selected frequency and at 1. 33, 2. 00, 2. 67 and 3. 33 Hz. Gastrocnemius medialis MTU excursion was estimated from kinematic data and muscle and tendon excursions were derived using a combination of 3 D-motion capture and ultrasonography. Optimum hopping frequency was determined as the frequency that maximized surrogate measures of <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage</b> potential of the tendon and minimized muscle excursion. Adults presented a significantly greater potential for <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage</b> in combination with lower muscle excursion than children at their selfselected frequency, suggesting that children do not utilize these energy-saving mechanisms as effectively as adults. However, tendon <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage</b> was maximized and muscle excursion minimized at the preferred frequency in both children and adults, indicating that children may select their preferred hopping frequency based on the same criteria as adults. These findings increase our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the higher energy cost of movement performance in children, and have implications for the interpretation of age-related differences in complex task performance...|$|R

The downstroke produced vertical forces on average 18 % in excess of those necessary to support the body weight through the wingbeat, while the upstroke contributed minimal or negative vertical force. Estimated effective angles of incidence (aQ of the wings averaged 39 ° during the downstroke and — 22 ° during the upstroke; spanwise variation in a'T was greater than the average difference between half-strokes. Total mechanical power requirements of forward flight averaged 12. 5 W kg" 1, for the case of perfect <b>elastic</b> <b>storage</b> of whig inertial energy, and 20. 2 W kg" 1, assuming zero elastic energy storage.

Storage at various sites can be dynamically acquired from (and released back to) the cloud provider {{so as to}} support content caching, according to the current demands for the content from the different geographic regions. When storage is sufficiently expensive that not all content should be cached at all sites, two issues must be addressed: how should requests for content be routed to the cloud provider sites, and what policy {{should be used for}} caching content using the <b>elastic</b> <b>storage</b> resources obtained from the cloud provider. Existing approaches are typically designed for non-elastic storage and {{little is known about the}} optimal policies when minimizing the delivery costs for distributed <b>elastic</b> <b>storage.</b> In this paper, we propose an approach in which <b>elastic</b> <b>storage</b> resources are exploited using a simple dynamic caching policy, while request routing is updated periodically according to the solution of an optimization model. Use of pull-based dynamic caching, rather than push-based placement, provides robustness to unpredicted changes in request rates. We show that this robustness is provided at low cost – even with fixed request rates, use of the dynamic caching policy typically yields content delivery cost within 10 % of that with the optimal static placement. We compare request routing according to our optimization model to simpler baseline routing policies, and find that the baseline policies can yield greatly increased delivery cost relative to optimized routing. Finally, we present a lower-cost approximate solution algorithm for our routing optimization problem that yields content delivery cost within 2. 5 % of the optimal solution. Keywords...|$|E

40|$|Abstract It {{is unclear}} whether small animals with their high stride {{frequency}} and crouched posture or large animals with more tendinous limbs are more reliant on storage and return of elastic energy during locomotion. The ostrich has a limb structure {{that appears to be}} adapted for high speed running with long tendons and short muscle fibres. Here we investigate biomechanics of ostrich gait through growth and, with consideration of anatomical data, identify scaling relationships with increasing body size, relating to forces acting on the musculoskeletal structures, effective mechanical advantage (EMA) and mechanical work. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected through growth from running ostriches. Joint moments scaled in a similar way to the pelvic limb segments as a result of consistent posture through growth, such that EMA was independent of body mass. Since no postural change was observed, relative loads applied to musculoskeletal tissues would be predicted to increase during growth, with greater muscle, and hence tendon, load allowing increased potential for <b>elastic</b> energy <b>storage</b> with increasing size.
