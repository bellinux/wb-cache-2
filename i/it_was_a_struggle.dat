Duchovny later joked that, after filming concluded, he [...] "could win an Emmy for most bruises." [...] Gillian Anderson described the real time directing style as [...] "challenging." [...] She said, [...] "I'm realizing how comfortable and connected I am to the rhythm we're used to." [...] Tom Braidwood, who played Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike and was an assistant director on the show, called Davis' role [...] "brutal" [...] and noted that [...] "It was really tough for William because he had to learn all this German." [...] Davis later joked that [...] "Maybe we shouldn't try to do two clever things at once. I think it worked fine, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> to do it." ...|$|E

On March 17, 2006, Aaron Solowoniuk revealed {{in a personal}} letter to fans {{that he was the}} friend in that song. Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His neurologist prescribed him medication {{that he would have to}} self inject three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> for Solowoniuk to come to terms with the reality of the disease, going to numerous doctor appointments and touring with a mini-fridge in their van has become normal routine. The medication has let him continue drumming with the band, as it eliminated his symptoms, and he has stated that [...] "this changes nothing about my band or me." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{staying with}} the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she {{requested}} the producers of the show to adjust her contract {{to allow her to}} direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers' firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when Dallas star Larry Hagman threatened to quit the show unless Gray were rehired. Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, [...] "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle,</b> though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, a very smart businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show." [...] We'll drink to that!" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a falling}} {{out with the}} Military Committee, {{of which he was}} a member, Muhammad Umran told Aflaq about the Committee's secret plans to oust the {{civilian}} leadership, led by Aflaq, and take over the Ba'ath Party. Shortly after, Umran was sent into exile as Ambassador to Spain for supporting the Aflaq faction. Aflaq responded to the threat posed to his leadership by invoking his office as Secretary General, and calling for the National Command to dissolve the Regional Command. He was forced to withdraw his request, when the majority of Ba'ath Party members proved to oppose such a move. A contest for power, between Aflaq and the Military Committee, ensued in the open; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> Aflaq was losing. It was plain from the very beginning that the initiative lay with the anti-Aflaq forces. To counter the military threat, Aflaq invoked party rules and regulations against them. To counter this, the Military Committee befriended a staunchly anti-Aflaq civilian faction calling themselves the [...] "Regionalists" [...] – this group had not dissolved their party organisations as ordered by Aflaq in the 1950s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pensions}} were means-tested (to {{receive the}} pension, {{one had to}} earn less than £31.50 annually) and intentionally low to encourage workers {{to make their own}} provisions for the future. An example of how low this amount was is that if an elderly person was to live on their pension alone they fell below Rowntree's poverty line. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> for elderly persons to claim their pension as they had to prove that they were not drunkards, for example. Also, to qualify for the pension scheme, they had to have worked to their [...] "full potential". There were no fixed guidelines as to what [...] "full potential" [...] was, so people who had been briefly unemployed could be penalised. To be eligible, they also had to have lived in the country for 20 years or more, so many immigrants could not claim a pension, or British people who had worked abroad and returned to Britain to retire. Also pensioners could not claim a pension if they had been to prison in the last 10 years. On 31 December 1908 a total of 596,038 pensions had been granted.|$|E

2500|$|Botvinnik {{then held}} the title, with two brief interruptions, {{for the next}} fifteen years, during which he played seven world {{championship}} matches. In 1951, he drew with David Bronstein over 24 games in Moscow, +5−5=14, keeping the world title, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> for Botvinnik, who won the second-last game and drew the last in order to tie the match. In 1954, he drew with Vasily Smyslov over 24 games at Moscow, +7−7=10, again retaining the title. In 1957, he lost to Smyslov by 9½–12½ in Moscow, but the rules then in force allowed him a rematch {{without having to go}} through the Candidates' Tournament, and in 1958 he won the rematch in Moscow; Smyslov said his health was poor during the return match. In 1960, Botvinnik was convincingly beaten 8½–12½ at Moscow by Tal, now 23years old, but again exercised his right to a rematch in 1961, and won by 13–8 in Moscow. Commentators agreed that Tal's play was weaker in the rematch, probably due to his health, but also that Botvinnik's play was better than in the 1960 match, largely due to thorough preparation. Botvinnik changed his style in the rematch, avoiding the tactical complications in which Tal excelled and aiming for closed positions and endgames, where Tal's technique was not outstanding. Finally, in 1963, he lost the title to Tigran Petrosian, by 9½–12½ in Moscow. FIDE had by then altered the rules, and he was not allowed a rematch. The rematch rule had been nicknamed the [...] "Botvinnik rule" [...] because he twice benefited from it.|$|E

40|$|Lost in the Funhouse is like {{textbook}} {{illustration of}} Derrida’s views on language and writing. The book <b>is</b> both <b>a</b> guide for “how not to write” and “how not to define” writing, thus defying an ultimate center. Although {{the lack of}} a “proper” theme and heavy metafictional structure makes it “difficult to read”, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> to subvert the definitions of writing. The author deconstructs the conventional form and theme that is believed to be necessary for writing. In this respect, Barth operates through the narratives like Derrida moves through ideas in history, and ending up with the conclusion that interplay is what matters rather than a fixed meaning. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{reducing}} complexity by observing others {{for the sake}} of finding further justification, mistrust is equivalent to trust. However, mistrust makes successful communication and cooperation with others more unlikely. If trust has <b>been</b> diminished <b>it</b> requires enormous efforts to <b>be</b> regained, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> against the persistent tendencies of mistrust. This cannot be achieved without external control mechanisms. However, these control mechanisms inevitably lead to increased social complexity. This will be demonstrated in the following using evidence-based governance in the education system as an example. Henceforth both the linking of the various systems as well as the institutionalization of check-ups will be evaluated in greater depth.|$|R
