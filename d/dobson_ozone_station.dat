40|$|Analysis {{of global}} ozone {{variations}} {{for the period}} April 1970 to December 1975 was performed by using the reprocessed Nimbus 4 backscattered ultraviolet (BUV) measurements of total ozone. A correlation coefficient of 0. 97 is found between the 6 -month running mean of global mean total ozone (filtered for mean semiannual, annual, and quasibiennial variations) and the 10. 7 -cm solar activity index. Correcting ozone for a time-dependent latitudinal bias relative to <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> measurements reduces to 2 - 3 % the global mean ozone variation over the solar cycle.

50|$|He was {{appointed}} University Lecturer in Meteorology, Oxford. By studying meteorites {{he noticed that}} the temperature profile of the tropopause was not constant, as had previously been believed (hence the name stratosphere). In fact there was, he showed, a region where the temperature sharply rose. This, he proposed, was happening because UV radiation was heating ozone in what has become known as the ozone layer.He noted the connection between sunspots and weather, and measured the ultraviolet levels of our star. He built the first <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> spectrophotometers and studied the results over many years. The Dobson unit, a unit of measurement of vertically integrated atmospheric ozone density, is named after him. The Brewer-Dobson circulation is a semi-eponymous model of atmospheric currents that explains the distribution of ozone by latitude.|$|R

Ozone measurement uncertainties are estimated, and results are presented in the Bass-Paur (1985) ozone absorption coefficient scale adopted for use with <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> spectrophotometers January 1, 1992. The data should be useful for comparison with model calculations of the global distribution of atmospheric ozone, for serving as apriori statistical information in deriving ozone vertical distributions from satellite and Umkehr observations, and for improving the satellite and Umkehr ozone inversion algorithms.

A strong anti-correlation of - 0. 88 was observed between the Dobson’s ozone profile and the EPTOMS in the month July-September.

40|$|The <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> {{spectrophotometer}} {{measures the}} difference of intensity between selected wavelengths in the ultraviolet. The method uses an optical attenuator (the 'Wedge') in this measurement. The knowledge {{of the relationship of}} the wedge position to the attenuation is critical to the correct calculation of ozone from the measurement. The procedure to determine this relationship is time-consuming, and requires a highly skilled person to perform it correctly. The relationship has been found to change with time. For reliable ozone values, the procedure should be done on a Dobson instrument at regular intervals. Due to the skill and time necessary to perform this procedure, many instruments have gone as long as 15 years between procedures. This article describes an apparatus that performs the procedure under computer control, and is adaptable to the majority of existing Dobson instruments. Part of the apparatus is usable for normal operation of the Dobson instrument, and would allow computer collection of the data and real-time ozone measurements...|$|R

50|$|The Dobson Unit {{is defined}} as the {{thickness}} (in units of 10 µm) of that layer of pure gas which would be formed by the total column amount at STP. This is sometimes referred to as a 'milli-atmo-centimeter.' A typical column amount of 300 DU of atmospheric ozone therefore would form a 3 mm layer of pure gas at the surface of the Earth if its temperature and pressure conformed to STP. The Dobson unit is named after Gordon Dobson, a researcher at the University of Oxford who in the 1920s built the first instrument to measure total ozone from the ground, making use of a double prism monochromator to measure the differential absorption of different bands of solar ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer. This instrument, called the <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> spectrophotometer, has formed the backbone of the global network for monitoring atmospheric ozone and was the source of the discovery in 1984 of the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{ultraviolet}} (UV) {{and visible}} irradiance has been monitored at the South Pole with a SUV- 100 spectro-radiometer since 1991. A new data version labeled “Version 2 ” {{has recently been}} produced, which has a higher accuracy than the original released “Version 0 ”. We have established a UV climatology for the South Pole based on the new data set, focusing {{on the effects of}} cloudiness, total column ozone, and volcanic aerosols. In addition, total column ozone was calculated from the spectral UV measurements for solar zenith angles (SZA) up to 87 ° using a recently developed algorithm. This new total ozone data set can complement <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> observations to validate satellite total ozone data. At the South Pole, NASA/TOMS Version 7 overpass data exceed SUV- 100 total ozone measurements by 5 - 8 %. In contrast, TOMS Version 8 data agree on average to within 2 % with SUV- 100 measurements, and the ratio of the two data sets shows virtually no dependence on SZA and the ozone amount. The good agreement confirms that the well-documented bias of TOMS Version 7 data at high austral latitudes was successfully reduced with the release of Version 8. A similar comparison between SUV- 100, <b>Dobson,</b> and TOMS <b>ozone</b> measurements was performed for the NSF/OPP network site at Arrival Heights (78 °S), and results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A second-derivative {{smoothing}} technique, {{commonly used}} in inversion work, {{is applied to the}} problem of inferring total columnar ozone amounts and aerosol optical depths. The application is unique in that the unknowns may be solved for directly without employing standard inversion methods. It is shown, however, that by employing inversion constraints, better solutions are normally obtained. The method is quite versatile and able to deal with varying total ozone and various aerosol size distributions. The technique is applied first in simulation, then to 119 days of measurements taken in Tucson, Arizona, that are compared to TOMS values for the same dates. The technique is also applied to two measurements taken at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, for which <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> values are available in addition to the TOMS values, and the results agree to within 15 percent. It is also shown through simulations that additional information can be obtained from measurements outside the Chappuis band. This approach reduces the bias and spread of the estimated total ozone and is unique in that it uses measurements from both the Chappuis and Huggins absorption bands...|$|R

The procedure used to convert UVS measured ozone above the aircraft altitude to total ozone above ground level introduces an additional 2 percent deviation for very high altitude UVS ozone data. Under stable aircraft operating conditions, the UVS derived ozone values have a variability, or reproducibility, of better than + or - 1 percent. The UVS data from the latitude survey flights yield a detailed latitude profile of total ozone over the Pacific Ocean during November 1976.

5000|$|The Umkehr is {{the time}} {{variation}} of {{the ratio of the}} scattered intensity at two different wavelengths. The word means reversal in German. The Umkehr effect is observed when measurements are made with ultraviolet spectrophotometer of the ratio of the zenith sky light intensities of two wavelengths in the solar ultraviolet when the sun is near the horizon. The shorter of two wavelengths (intensity I) is strongly absorbed and other (intensity I [...] ) is weakly absorbed. If the value of log(I/I [...] ) is plotted against the suns zenith angle, it is observed that this log-intensity ratio decreases as the zenith angle increases until a minimum is reached for a zenith angle of about 80 (when the wavelengths are 3114 and 3324 A0). This effect was first noticed by Götz in 1930. The Umkehr measurement is known as customarily N-value and is given by the logarithm base 10 of the ratio of cloudless zenith sky intensitities at two different wavelengths scaled by a multiplicative factor 100 plus a constant which depends on instruments and extraterrestrial radiation. Methods for deriving vertical distribution from the umkehr measurements were developed by Götz, Dobson and Meetham in 1934, using the <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> spectrophotometer developed by Gordon Dobson. In 1964 Carlton Mateer provided analysis on information content in umkehr measurements.|$|R
