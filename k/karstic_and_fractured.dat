Values are presented for limestones and mainly for dolomites, and additionally for separate aquifers, divided by age andlithology in several groups. Data was obtained from hydrogeological reports for 397 water wells, and among these, 79 pumping tests were reinterpreted. Hydraulic conductivities of fractures are higher than the hydraulic conductivities of matrix, and the differences are highly statistically significant. Likewise, differences are significant for specific storage, and the values of these coefficients are higher in the matrix. Values of all coefficients vary in separate aquifers, and the differences {{can be explained by}} diagenetic effects, crystal size, degree of fracturing, andcarbonate purity.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{advanced}} approaches for simulating groundwater flow in <b>karstic</b> <b>and</b> <b>fractured</b> porous media is {{the combination of a}} linear and a nonlinear model. The paper presents an attempt to determine outflow influencing parameters in order to simulate aquifer outflow. Our approach in this study is to create a productive interaction system between expert, mathematical model, MERO, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed method is especially suitable for the problem of large-scale and long-term simulation. In the present project, the first objective is to determine aquifer outflow influencing parameters by the use of MERO model, which gave a good results in a fissured and chalky media, and then introduce these parameters in neural network (NN). To determine outflow influencing parameters, we propose to test the NN under fourth different external input scenarios. The second objective is to investigate the effect of temporal information by taking current and past data sets.

40|$|Karstic {{aquifers}} {{are well}} known for their vulnerability to groundwater contamination. This is due to characteristics such as thin soils and point recharge in dolines, shafts, and swallow holes. In karstic areas, groundwater is often the only freshwater source. This {{is the case of}} the Apulia region (south-eastern Italy), where a large and deep carbonate aquifer, affected by <b>karstic</b> <b>and</b> <b>fracturing</b> phenomena, is located. Several methods (GOD, DRASTIC, SINTACS, EPIK, PI, and COP) for the assessment of the intrinsic vulnerability (Iv) were selected and applied to an Apulian test site, for which a complete data set was set up. The intrinsic vulnerability maps, produced using a GIS approach, show vulnerability from low to very high. The maximum vulnerability is always due to karstic features. A comparison approach of the maps is proposed. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. In general terms, three groups can be distinguished. The GOD method is useful for mapping large areas with high vulnerability contrasts. DRASTIC and SINTACS are "any-type aquifer" methods that have some limitations in applications to karstic aquifers, {{especially in the case of}} DRASTIC. EPIK, PI, and COP, which were designed to be applied to carbonate or karstic aquifers, supply affordable results, highly coherent with <b>karstic</b> <b>and</b> hydrogeological features, and reliable procedures, especially in the case of PI and COP. The latter appears simpler to apply and more flexible in considering the role of climatic parameters. If Iv of each method is considered, the highest variability is observed in cells in the neighbourhood of karstic features. In these spatial domains, additional efforts to define more reliable and global methods are required...|$|R

The environmental induced signals are becoming more evident, as those due to thermoelastic deformation, due to subsurface water flows and loading tides and the tectonic signals as seismic fault movements and free oscillations. The time series covering fifty years of continuous underground geodetic observations from the Karst and seismic Friuli area (in NE Italy) offer {{a broad spectrum of}} earth signals that have been univocally identified and which will be increasingly observable by GNSS alongside improvements in precision.

40|$|International audienceThis work proposes new semi-analytical {{solutions}} for the interpretation of cross-borehole slug tests in fractured media. Our model {{is an extension of}} a previous work by Barker (1988) and Butler and Zhan (2004). It includes inertial effects at both test and observation wells and a fractional flow dimension in the aquifer. The model has 5 fitting parameters: flow dimension n, hydraulic conductivity K, specific storage coefficient Ss, and effective lengths of test well Le and of observation well Leo. The results of a sensitivity analysis show that the most sensitive parameter is the flow dimension n. The model sensitivity to other parameters may be ranked as follows: K > Le ~ Leo > Ss. The sensitivity to aquifer storage remains one or two orders of magnitude lower than that to other parameters. The model has been coupled to an automatic inversion algorithm for facilitating the interpretation of real field data. This inversion algorithm is based on a Gauss-Newton optimization procedure conditioned by re-scaled sensitivities. It has been used to interpret successfully cross-borehole slug test data from the Hydrogeological Experimental Site (HES) of Poitiers, France, consisting of <b>fractured</b> <b>and</b> <b>karstic</b> limestones. HES data provide flow dimension values ranging between 1. 6 and 2. 5, and hydraulic conductivity values ranging between 4. 4 x 10 - 5 and 7. 7 x 10 - 4 m. s- 1. These values are consistent with previous interpretations of single-well slug tests. The results of the sensitivity analysis are confirmed by calculations of relative errors on parameter estimates, which show that accuracy on n and K is below 20 % and that on Ss is about one order of magnitude. The K-values interpreted from cross-borehole slug tests are one order of magnitude higher than those previously interpreted from interference pumping tests. These findings suggest that cross-borehole slug tests focus on preferential flowpath networks made by <b>fractures</b> <b>and</b> <b>karstic</b> channels, i. e. the head perturbation induced by a slug test propagates only through those flowpaths with the lowest hydraulic resistance. As a result, cross-borehole slug tests are expected to identify the hydrodynamic properties of <b>karstic</b> channels <b>and</b> <b>fracture</b> flowpaths, <b>and</b> may be considered as complementary to pumping tests which more likely provide bulk properties of the whole fracture/karstic-channel/matrix system...|$|R
40|$|Analyses {{of ground}} {{displacements}} {{can help to}} define the evolution of areas affected by instability phenomena and identify their triggering factors. To this end, Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) satellite data {{can be used to}} collect direct measurements of superficial deformations in instability-prone areas. Results from remote sensing analyses can be then compared with outcomes from numerical simulations, and in particular with displacement or velocity fields, to validate numerical modeling and eventually recalibrate the simulation of instabilities, predisposing and triggering conditions. Numerical simulations allow reproducing slope behavior under some hypotheses but their accuracy is strongly connected to the amount of available input data. Most of the required parameters can be set based on reasonable assumptions that consequently can be verified through classical field tools and geological survey or remote sensing techniques. Direct or remote sensing techniques can be used to characterize and monitor ground deformation phenomena, and particularly to identify surface displacements. These information can be used to verify the suitability of numerical model predictions and the adequacy of preliminary hypotheses. An innovative approach could consider a surface displacement map, as the starting point to re-create a model of instability phenomena. This application requires precise velocity data characterized by an adequate resolution, depending on the phenomenon analyzed. Recently this method was applied to earthquakes with satisfying results (Wright at al., 2006). This work is aimed to determine which is the contribution of SAR satellite data in investigating instabilities phenomena, in particular landslides and sinkholes. This methodological approach was tested in different conditions to understand its applicability and how to optimize the results overcoming some of the observed limits. Satellite remote sensing techniques have shown to lead to accurate large-scale surface displacement mapping. Specifically “Interferometric Synthetic Aperture RADAR” (InSAR) technique allows to measure accurate land displacement. Furthermore, not only deformation but even the evolution of displacements can be estimated, combining InSAR information from a large number of SAR images and analyzing changes on the signal phase. This technique is defined D-InSAR (Differential Interferometric SAR) and PS InSAR (Ferretti et al., 2001) and SBAS techniques (Berardino et al., 2002) represent the main methodology proposed. But D-InSAR techniques have some limits of applicability. For example, due to high RADAR viewing angles, the current space-borne systems can detect {{only a fraction of the}} horizontal component of the movement. In fact not every geometrical configurations and slope exposition can be surveyed. Further problems are connected with the presence of dense vegetation. In these situations amplitude can be exploited to identify surface deformations (Casu et al., 2011). Applying the above mentioned techniques it is possible to observe deformation patterns and surface movements. Comparing displacement obtain from monitoring stage with results from numerical modeling, let to understand if numerical prevision is satisfying and the evolution of deformations is correct. The contribution of SAR data in numerical simulation of ground deformations was tested in landslide, subsidence and sinkhole - prone areas, located in the piedmont sector of North-Eastern Italian Alps and in the Jordanian coast of the Dead Sea. The first case study is Val Maso landslide, located in Valli del Pasubio municipality, which was triggered by an exceptional flood event occurred in November 2010. A back stability analysis was carried out to evaluate the geotechnical properties of the involved materials. Then, parameters from back analysis were used in a uncoupled seepage and slope stability analysis of the area behind the main scarp to forecast the effects of hydrological conditions due to different rainfall depths, i. e. to identify the minimum rainfall threshold for triggering the retrogression of the phenomenon. Some more information about this phenomenon have been searched, analysing a stacking of RADAR satellite images. Because of the dense vegetation and the aspect of the area, outcomes of PS and SBAS DInSAR technique were not satisfying. That is why SAR data were analyzed concentrating on amplitude changes of the signal instead on studying the phase. A stack of nine COSMO-SkyMed images, acquired over the 2010 event, were used. Amplitude changes were evaluated. Results showed it is possible to detect the effect of ground deformations from the data analyzed and to define the boundary of the landslide. The second case study is Cischele landslide, located in Recoaro Terme municipality, which caused severe damages on the buildings and on the Provincial street after the rainfall event of November 2010. This phenomenon is related to a reactivation of a instability whose behavior seems to be connected to climatic conditions. Data obtained from field and laboratory analyses were used on the creation of a numerical model. Ground displacements of the slope were evaluated analyzing data obtained from PS available for Cischele area, obtained processing SAR images acquired by ERS and ENVISAT satellites, from May 1995 to May 2000 and from September 2004 to June 2010, respectively. Ground velocity and displacements are measured along the line of sigh of the satellites. Only information obtained from descending orbits are available. Furthermore, InSAR images acquired by COSMO-SkyMed satellites over the event were analyzed. SBAS techniques was applied. Interferograms were generated using InSAR images and a 90 meters resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM), SRTM DEM. 14 descending images were available from April 2010 to September 2012. Unfortunately, variation in surface condition between two different acquisitions produces loss of coherence. This effect is strongly connected to the presence of vegetation in the area. It was possible to overcome this problem through an accurate calibration of the filtering parameters, extending the coverage of the final displacement map. Results showed a maximum velocity component of 12 mm/year. Finally, DInSAR techniques were applied to investigate sinkholes affecting the Jordanian coast of the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is a hyper saline terminal lake located in a pull-apart basin, which is one of the major components of the Jordan Dead Sea Transform fault system. Most of the area is characterized by highly <b>karstic</b> <b>and</b> <b>fractured</b> rock formations that are connected with faults. Karstic conduits extend from the land into the sea. Since the 1960 s, the Dead Sea level is dropping at an increasing rate: from about 60 cm/yr in the 1970 s up to 1 m/yr in the 2000 s. From about the mid- 1980 s, sinkholes appeared more and more frequently over and around the emerged mudflats and salt flats. Strong subsidence and landslides also affect some segments of the coast. Nowadays, several thousands of sinkholes attest that the degradation of the Dead Sea coast is worsening. The deformation analysis is focused on Ghor Al Haditha area, located in the South-Eastern part of the lake coasts. SAR data acquired by three different sensors, ERS, ENVISAT and COSMO-SkyMed were processed. 70 ERS images from 1992 to 2009 and 30 ENVISAT images from 2003 to 2010 were processed. SBAS technique were applied to define surface velocity and displacement maps. Because of the resolution of these sensors, consisting on 25 m 2, it was possible to clearly define areas affected by subsidence but the single sinkholes could not be detected because of the small size of each punctual event, that is generally varying from few meters to a hundred meters diameter. Furthermore, SBAS was applied to 23 COSMO-SkyMed SAR satellite images from December 2011 to May 2013. The high resolution of these data (3 m x 3 m) and the short revisiting time allowed to have precise information of the displacement of punctual sinkholes beyond the overall subsidence of the coast. A specific sinkhole was considered to understand its temporal evolution. On the basis of the results from D-InSAR processing, a simplified analytical model was implemented. Vertical and horizontal components of the surface displacement field obtained from analysis of SAR images have been used as input data to derive geometric parameters of the source and in particular to estimate the volumetric strain of the phenomenon. Position, dimension and mechanism were obtained. The gained experience proved that space-borne SAR data allow to obtain important information about the dynamics of instability phenomena, which degree of precision depends on several factors, as vegetation density and surface velocity. The applicability of D-InSAR methods in different conditions was tested to obtain useful information to re-create the phenomena through numerical modeling. When rapid displacements overcome the maximum detectable surface velocities between two consecutive SAR acquisitions and changing in land cover produces a complete coherence loss, the amplitude of the signal can be analyzed instead of the phase. In the Val Maso landslide, a rapid mapping of surface deformation was possible, providing important hints to manage post-event emergency situations. Despite the dense vegetation in Cischele area, SBAS technique could assess a component of the landslide displacement, through an accurate calibration of some processing parameters. Thanks to the flat morphology of the site and the almost absent vegetation covering, analysis of sinkholes in Jordan Dead Sea coast gave precise information about ground deformation and helpful data to model a sinkhole and to define its geometry and volume reduction. In these favorable conditions, SAR data allow one to predict the occurrence of geological instabilities, characterize their extension, model their evolution and define an early warning system to prevent catastrophic events. ...|$|E

Faults, schists that are intruded cut by granites, and microgranites that formed by segregation at the edges of granite intrusions {{have a negative effect on}} aggregate quality and operations at quarries in Çatalca granite. Dikes, faults, folding, weathering, and lithologic transitions in Küçükköy sandstone and Cebeciköy limestone have a significant effect on the quality and operational characteristics of those quarries.
