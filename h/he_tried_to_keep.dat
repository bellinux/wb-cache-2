5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> alive {{the idea of a}} {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Project Gemini {{followed}} on from Project Mercury, {{taking its}} name {{from the fact that it}} carried two men instead of just one. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was cancelled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first manned Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.|$|E

25|$|Some Orthodox believers {{and even}} priests {{took part in}} the {{dissident}} movement and became prisoners of conscience. The Orthodox priests Gleb Yakunin, Sergiy Zheludkov and others spent years in Soviet prisons and exile for their efforts in defending freedom of worship. Among the prominent figures of that time were Father Dmitri Dudko and Father Aleksandr Men. Although <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> away from practical work of the dissident movement intending to better fulfil his calling as a priest, there was a spiritual link between Fr Aleksandr and many of the dissidents. For some of them he was a friend; for others, a godfather; for many (including Yakunin), a spiritual father.|$|E
500|$|Bissell {{was born}} on December 1, 1957 in Corpus Christi, Texas. He {{was one of the}} five {{children}} of Donald and Patricia Bissell; his siblings included his twin brother William, two sisters Susan and Barbara, and brother Donald. The family lived in Palos Park, Illinois for several years. His father was a computer-systems designer with Hiram Walker Inc. Bissell was an athlete who enjoyed performing feats of daring: at the age of 8 he jumped off a -high diving board, even though {{he did not know how}} to swim. He dabbled in many sports baseball, basketball, football, track, etc. He was introduced to ballet at age ten by his sister Susan who paid him to be her ballet partner; thus he was first paid to dance. He found a home and sanctuary in the passion of ballet and decided to make it his life pursuit. He began training in ballet and jazz dance and was soon accepted into a company in Toledo, Ohio. Like many boys who take up ballet, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his lessons a secret, but word got out and he was ridiculed and bullied every single day for the rest of his school days. [...] "I was a skinny kid. They could have crushed me in an instant," [...] he stated.|$|E

He wrote in thanks to Roeder, commenting sadly that [...] "I am not longing for much but a sight of the sea." [...] He composed a lot of poetry whilst first at his son's, until illness overtook him. His son wrote that: [...] "He has been writing verse since he came here until his head got bad, and now he says he shall write no more."

2500|$|On stage, Slash prefers Marshall amplifiers, {{particularly}} the Marshall [...] "Silver Jubilee" [...] JCM2555 amp. He used a rented early-1970s Marshall 1959 for {{the recording of}} Appetite for Destruction. Slash enjoyed the amp so much that <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it, telling the rental company, S.I.R., {{that it had been}} stolen. However, the amp was repossessed by S.I.R. employees after a roadie accidentally brought it to rehearsals at the store. For the recording of Velvet Revolver's debut album, Contraband, he used a Vox AC30 amp and small Fender tube amps, and on their second album, Libertad, he used the Marshall [...] "Vintage Modern" [...] 2466 amp. On his eponymous debut solo album he used a Marshall JCM800, issued as [...] "#34", and later, on the subsequent world tour, Slash used his signature Marshall AFD100 amp.|$|E
2500|$|By February 1980, {{evidence}} of widespread metastasis was found. While <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the condition a secret, the National Enquirer disclosed {{that he had}} [...] "terminal cancer" [...] on March 11, 1980. In July, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico, for unconventional treatment after US doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over the trip, because McQueen sought treatment from William Donald Kelley, who was promoting {{a variation of the}} Gerson therapy that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cattle and sheep, massage, and laetrile, an anticancer drug available in Mexico, but described as canonical quackery by mainstream scientists. McQueen paid for Kelley's treatments by himself in cash payments which were said to have been upwards of $40,000 per month ($ today) during his three-month stay in Mexico. Kelley's only medical license (until revoked in 1976) had been for orthodontics. Kelley's methods created a sensation in the traditional and tabloid press when it became known that McQueen was a patient.|$|E
2500|$|In the Eastern Conference semi-finals {{round of}} the 2012 MLS Cup playoffs, D.C. United faced arch-foe New York Red Bulls in what {{would become one of}} the most memorable playoff series in league history. The opening match of the home-and-home series was played in Washington, {{effectively}} giving New York the home field advantage of hosting the return match, despite the fact that United had finished higher in the standings. The game would have been played at Red Bull Arena, but New Jersey was still struggling to recover from the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Sandy. In the series opener, the teams drew 1-1, trading own goals midway through the second half. New York defender Roy Miller sent an attempted clearance into New York's net in the 60th minute. New York was awarded the tying goal, when Bill Hamid went up to take a header into the box away from a Red Bull defender who was standing directly in front of United's goalie. Hamid fell back into the goal while holding the ball, though <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it out. The ball was ruled across the line and no foul was given, leaving the teams deadlocked heading into the return match. United would also have to play that match without the gifted Andy Najar who received a second yellow card ejection for throwing a ball at a New York player with about 20 minutes remaining.|$|E

2500|$|Zhu Ci {{made it a}} {{priority}} to capture Fengtian to extinguish the hopes of Emperor Dezong's being restored. [...] He left Li Zhongchen and Qiu Jingzhong (仇敬忠) in charge of Chang'an, and personally led his army, assisted by Yao Lingyan and Zhang Guangsheng, to Fengtian. [...] He put Fengtian under siege, and {{despite the efforts of}} the Tang generals Hang Yougui (韓遊瓌) and Hun Jian in fighting off the Qin siege, Fengtian was soon in a desperate state, with its food supplies cut off. [...] Tang resistance forces were then harassing the Qin forces left at Chang'an, and in response, Zhu intensified his siege of Fengtian. [...] However, after Fengtian was under siege for more than a month, Li Huaiguang, who had been fighting Wang Wujun and Tian Yue to the east but immediately headed toward Chang'an upon hearing of Emperor Dezong's plight, arrived with his elite Shuofang Army. [...] On December 18, with Li Huaiguang not quite yet at Fengtian but having defeated Qin forces at Liquan (醴泉, in modern Xianyang), Zhu, fearful that he would be defeated by Li Huaiguang, lifted Fengtian's siege and returned to Chang'an. [...] He would not threaten Fengtian again, although <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the morale of his forces in check at Chang'an by periodically spreading rumors that Fengtian had fallen. [...] By this point, however, it was said that he controlled little more than Chang'an itself. [...] It was the consensus at the time that if Li Huaiguang had arrived three days later than he actually did, Fengtian would have fallen.|$|E
2500|$|From Brochu's perspective, {{a salary}} cap was not a major concern for the Expos as {{they could not afford}} to spend the maximum value of any {{negotiated}} cap. But when the strike ended eight months later, by the order of United States federal judge Sonia Sotomayor, the failure to implement strong revenue sharing was a major blow to the Expos. The team had already built a reputation as a penny-pinching organization (Larry Walker once complained in the media that the team asked the players to buy their own vitamins), with the second-lowest payroll in MLB in 1994. Following the strike, the team initiated a fire sale of players: Ken Hill, John Wetteland and Marquis Grissom were traded while Larry Walker was allowed to leave as a free agent. Moisés Alou, Pedro Martínez and Mel Rojas would eventually follow. In his book, My Turn At Bat, Brochu argued that the fire sale was the only viable option, since his partners in the ownership group were not interested in financing the team's losses. Brochu estimated that had <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the 1994 team together, the Expos would have lost $25 million in 1995, which would have pushed the franchise to the edge of bankruptcy. [...] He claimed that he would have certainly kept Hill, Wetteland, Grissom and Walker had the partners been willing to put up the money necessary to keep them in Montreal. [...] When Brochu told Malone that Hill, Wetteland, Grissom and Walker all had to go, Malone tried to persuade Brochu to keep at least one of them. [...] It was to no avail; Brochu told Malone that they all had to be off the roster by the deadline for salary arbitration—even though this made it all but impossible to get any leverage in possible deals. [...] As a result, the Expos got almost nothing in return.|$|E
2500|$|Mirabeau's {{love affairs}} are well-known, {{owing to the}} celebrity of the letters to Marie Thérèse de Monnier, his [...] "Sophie". In spite of his {{disfigurement}} (or perhaps because of it), he won {{the heart of the}} lady to whom his colonel was attached; this led to such scandal that his father obtained a lettre de cachet, and Mirabeau was imprisoned in the Île de Ré. On being released, the young nobleman obtained leave to accompany the French expedition to Corsica as a volunteer. During the Corsican expedition, Mirabeau contracted several more gambling debts and engaged in another scandalous love affair. However, he proved his military genius in the Corsican expedition, and also conducted a thorough study of the island during his stay. The study was most likely factually incorrect, but his desire to learn of a country that had been previously unstudied emphasizes Mirabeau's endless curiosity and inquisitiveness, particularly into the traditions and customs of society. [...] Mirabeau learned the value of hard work in the French army. This aspect of Mirabeau's personality contributed to his popular success in later years, during the Revolution. After his return, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on good terms with his father, and in 1772 he married a rich heiress, Marie–Marquerite–Emilie de Covet, daughter of the marquis de Marignane. Emilie, who was 18 years old, was apparently engaged to a much older nobleman, the Comte de Valbelle. Nonetheless, Mirabeau pursued her for several months, expecting that their marriage would benefit from the money that the couple would receive from their parents. After several months of failed attempts at being introduced to the heiress, Mirabeau bribed one of the young lady's maids to let him into her residence, where he pretended to have had a sexual encounter with Emilie. To avoid losing face, her father saw that they got married {{just a couple of days}} afterwards. Mirabeau received a small allowance of 6,000 livres from his father, but never received the expected dowry from the marquis.|$|E
