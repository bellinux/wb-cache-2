5000|$|Students need {{something}} complex that challenges them to explore: Students need {{to engage with}} the phenomena of study, not schematic substitutes. It is in struggling with complex problems that every learner undergoes the process of constructing their own knowledge. As learners experience internal cognitive conflicts in what they believe about the subject matter, their minds become more deeply engaged with the problem at hand. Learners' efforts in figuring out questions and puzzles are more productive than knowing the right answer because higher order thinking processes are involved. Therefore, teachers of critical exploration value the diverse efforts that students make during their explorations even where these efforts do not arrive at expected answers. In facilitating this investigative work, the questions that are asked {{over and over again}} by students and teachers alike are, for example: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> notice?" [...] What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean?" [...] "How are you thinking about it?" [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think that?" [...] "Is that the same as what (someone else) thought they saw?" [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>figure</b> that?" [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that?" [...] "How does that fit with what she just said?" [...] "Could you give an example?" [...] The responses that teachers and students give to each other might have the form of: [...] "I don't quite get it." [...] "It doesn't make sense (to me)." [...] "I don't really get that; could you explain it another way?" [...] Hence, most important: It is the students who make sense and understand by trying out their ideas, explaining them to others, and seeing how this holds up in other people's and their own eyes and {{in the light of the}} phenomena itself (Duckworth, 2002).|$|R
