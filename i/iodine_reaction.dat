The experiment was designed to compare the diurnal changes of translocation of starch of the diseased leaves with that of healthy. The materials were collected twelve times a day at every two hours under fine weather in August. The leaf starch was determined by the <b>iodine</b> <b>reaction.</b> The results were as follows: 1. The starch of the young healthy leaves began to decrease at about 11 p. m. and disappeared from 5 a. m. till 9 a. m. and began to reappear at about 11 a. m. However, the starch of the young diseased leaves began to decrease at about 5 a. m. and much decreased from 9 a. m. till 11 a. m., though entire disappearance of starch was not observed. 2. The starch of the young diseased leaves began to decrease at about 1 a. m. and much decreased from 7 a. m. till 9 a. m., then without entire disappearance it began to increase at about 11 a. m. again. While the old diseased leaves showed any remarkable changes of starch content. This apparently indicated that a large part of the starch assimilated in the diseased leaves remained without transportation. It seems likely that the death of the diseased paulownia tree is promoted in partby this low translocation of starch. 天狗巣病に感染した桐樹葉の同化澱粉滞積現象について 1954 年 8 月上句に行つた観察の結果を報告する, 実験方法は日没後より始めて 2 時間おきに健葉及び病葉を採取して, 同化澱粉移動の日変化を沃度沃度加里液によつて検出した. 1. 若健葉中の同化澱粉は午後 11 時頃より減少し始め, 午前 5 時頃より午前 9 時まで全く葉中に澱粉反応が認められず, 午前 11 時頃より再び同化澱粉が葉中に出現してくる. 若葉中の同化澱粉は午前 5 時頃より減少し始め, 午前 9 時より 11 時までの間僅少となるが, 完全消失の時期は認められない. 2. 老健葉中の同化澱粉は午前 1 時頃より減少し始め, 午前 7 時より 9 時までの間僅少となるが, 完全消失を見ずに 11 時頃より再び増加する. 老病葉中の同化澱粉は午後 9 時頃より減少の傾向が認められるが, それ以後は全く増減の関係が不明瞭である. 以上の実験結果より病葉は健葉より同化澱粉転移の作用が著しく鈍つている事は明白であり, 本作用の低下を天狗巣病桐樹の枯死原因の一つとして考察した...|$|E

Early in 1963, Mr. J. T. Palmer, Woodley (near Stockport), sent me two collec-tions of a geoglossaceous fungus. The specimens had been collected in Austria and showed colourless spores and a positive iodinereaction of the ascus pore. According to Nannfeldt's key (1942), these characters are common to three generaof Geoglos-saceae: Corynetes, Microglossum, and Mitrula. Corynetes was immediately ruled out, as the Austrian material was not black and the fertile head differently shaped, but it was impossible to decide in favour of either of the two remaining genera. The speci-mens resembled Mitrula as to the shape of the fertile head, but the spores were rather those ofa Microglossum. It was decided to search for other criteria by which {{it would be possible to}} distinguish the two genera without ambiguity. This led to some unexpected results. It was found that (i) there existed no generally agreed opinion on the generic limits between Corynetes, Microglossum, and Mitrula; (ii) the generic name Corynetes, although universally used, was not the correct name; (iii) Mitrula as understood in Europe and North America proved most heterogeneous; (iv) the Austrian material did not fitany described genus; (v) the structure of the stipe proved a useful additional character in the distinction of genera.

40|$|A survey {{has been}} made of the {{literature}} concerning the cleavage of tin-carbon bonds. Twenty-three tricyclohexyl- and trimethyl- phenylstannanes, and p-methoxyphenyltriphenyltin have been prepared, and their cleavages by aqueous-ethanolic perchloric acid at 50 ° or by iodine in carbon tetrachloride have been studied. First-order rate constants have been determined. The acid-catalysed cleavage reactions, which can be represented by the equation Aryl-SnR 3 + MOH H Aryl-H + R 3 SnOM (M = Et or H). were followed spectrophotometrically, and first-order rate constants were determined. The +E effects of substituents appear to operate less effectively in this reaction than in most electrophilic aromatic substitutions, including the analogous cleavages of aryl-silicon and aryl-germanium bonds. Although the effects of substituents cannot be related directly to the electrophilic substituent constants o+, or to the Hammett o substituent constants, they can be interpreted in terms of a combination of both sets of constants. The effects of substituents are greater in the tricyclohexyl series than in the trimethyl series, but smaller than in the triphenyl series. Third-order rate constants have been measured for the cleavage of the above compounds by iodine in carbon tetrachloride: Aryl-SnR 3 + I 3 → Aryl-I + R 3 SnI. There is a second-order dependence on the iodine concentration, and a first-order dependence on the concentration of the stannane over the range M/ 200 - M/ 1500. The + E effects of substituents operate less effectively than in the acid-catalysed cleavage of the same tin compounds, although the spread of relative rates is slightly greater in the <b>iodine</b> <b>reaction.</b> The cleavages of tricyclohexylphenyltin compounds are more rapid than the cleavages of the analogous trimethylphenyltin compounds, and the spread of relative rates is greater in the trimethyl series - the reverse of the situation in the acid-catalysed cleavage of these compounds. Detailed mechanisms ere suggested for both cleavage reactions. There is no overwhelming evidence for a mechanism fundamentally different from those commonly proposed for the well known aromatic substitutions in which Aryl-H bonds are broken by electrophilic attack at carbon, but it is suggested that the small effects of substituents in the destannylation reactions may be a result of some nucleophilic attack at the metal atom in the rate-determining step...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show the {{abnormality}} of the starch decomposition to sugars in paulownia tree leaves affected by witches 2 ̆ 7 -broom. The experiment was designed to compare the velocity and the amount of starch accumulation of in the leaf disks of the diseased tree with that of the healthy each floated on various sugar solutions. The leaf starch was detected with <b>iodine</b> <b>reaction.</b> The results were as follows. 1. Both the diseased and healthy leaf disks much synthetized starch from each 10 per cent solution of glucose, fructose, galactose, and sucrose, and less from each 10 per cent solution of xylose, maltose, and lactose; but not from each of the same per cent solution of arabinose, rhamnose, and glycogen. 2. The amount of starch synthetized in healthy and diseased leaf disks was related to the concentration of sugar solution upto 20 per cent and to floating times, but it was independent of leaf disk size. The widths of zones of starch accumulation in both healthy and diseased leaf disks (Fig. 1) were related to the kind of sugars and their concentrations, but were independent of leaf disks sizes and floating times. The diseased leaf disks had always wider starch accumulation zones than that of healthy ones without showing any definite forms. 3. The healthy leaf disks synthetized starch from sugar solutions after 4 hrs. treatment, while the disease ones after 6 hrs. Young leaf disks from healthy shoots synthetized starch from sugar solutions than old ones, but this tendency was not found in the diseased leaves. Above data showed that the starch synthesis from sugars in that diseased leaves was lower than in the healthy ones. This facts indicated that the gradation of starch of the diseased leaves decreased than that of healthy, because the gradation and the synthesis of starch are reversible reactions in leaves. It was concluded that the fact that abnormal, formerly reported by the author was due to the unbalanced degeneration of sugar translocation against the decrease of starch gradation. 桐樹天狗巣病葉の各種糖液より澱粉合成をする速度及び分量を健全葉と比較して, 病組織内に於ける解糖作用を明らかにしようとした. 実験方法は各種の糖液上に健葉及び病葉の葉円板(Cork borerで打抜いたもの) を浮かべ, 澱粉の出現する時間及び量を沃庶反応により調査したものである. 実験結果は次の通りである. 1. 多量の澱粉合成を起させる糖はglucose, galactose, fructose, sucroseで少量の澱粉の合成を起させる糖はxylose, maltose, lactoseであり澱粉合成を起させない糖はarabinose, rhamnose, glycogenであつた. 此の傾向は健病葉とも同一であつた. 2. 葉円板に合成される澱粉量は糖液の濃度と漬浸の時間に影響されるが,葉円板の大きさとげ無関係である. 葉円板周辺の澱粉集積帯の幅は糖の種類と糖の濃度に影響されるが葉円板の大きさと,浸漬時間には影響されない. 病葉円板は澱粉集積帯の幅が常に広くしかも不整形である場合が多い. 3. 健葉は糖液に浸漬して 4 時間後に澱粉が出現するが, 病葉は 6 時間後に出現する. 健葉では幼葉が老葉よりも澱粉の出現が早いが, 病葉では老幼の別は顕著ではない. 以上の結果より, 糖より澱粉への合成機能については病葉は健葉よりも劣つているから, その逆反応である澱粉より糖への分解機能も劣つていると推測される. 而して前報で述べた病葉中の可溶性糖質の異常集積は病葉の澱粉化作用の低下よりも更に強力な糖転移作用の阻害に基くものである...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare and test the {{efficiency}} of the leading kinds of media being used for the isolation and identification of Clostridium botulinum type E strains, and to develop a more reliable method and media for the differentiation of this organism based on the "pearly layer" characteristic. The production of "pearly layer" around the colonies of the different types of C. botulinum on egg yolk enriched media has been used as an aid in differentiation and isolation of this group of bacteria. In this investigation a comparative study was conducted to test the efficiency of the "pearly layer" formation on liver veal agar egg yolk media (LVA) and trypticase agar egg yolk media (TA). Liver veal agar egg yolk media was not entirely satisfactory in that strains of C. botulinum type E and most non-toxic "type E-like" clostridia did not always give a typical reaction. These organisms in many cases produced a faint "pearly layer" or, in some cases, no "pearly layer" on the LVA egg yolk media. When trypticase was substituted as the base in the egg yolk media, more consistant results were obtained in that all C. botulinum types produced the "pearly layer". To separate type E strains from types A and B, sucrose and an indicator, neutral red, were incorporated in the TA media. Since only type E strains ferment sucrose, the acid in the media was detected by the neutral red indicator as formation of a pink halo around the colony. Unfortunately, the fermentation of sucrose in the media suppressed the production of the "pearly Iayer". However, type E's can be differentiated from other types on the sucrose TA egg yolk media by the production of starch-Iike compounds which give an <b>iodine</b> <b>reaction.</b> Types A and B and most non-toxic "type-E-like" clostridia do not produce starch-like granules even on a utilizable sugar such as glucose. Trypticase base, therefore, is much more reliable than liver veal base, not only "pearly layer" formation but also in differentiation of C. botulinum type E's from other types by sucrose fermentation and starch reaction. Throughout this investigation, two morphologically different colony types have been associated with a pure culture of C. botulinum type E. One was the characteristic C. botulinum type E toxic colony which produced "pearly layer" on TA egg yolk plates; the other colony was a non-toxic sporulating isolate which did not produce a "pearly layer". The toxic cultures produced acid and gas from glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, and sorbitol. The nontoxic isolates produced acid but no gas in the same sugars. Microscopically, biochemically and morphologically the two types of colonies were very similar to the toxic (TOX) cultures and the nontoxic sporulating (OS) variant described by other investigators...|$|E
