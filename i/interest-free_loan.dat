5|$|Dr. James Baxter of the Everton {{committee}} donated a £1,000 <b>interest-free</b> <b>loan</b> {{to build}} Goodison Park. The stadium was England's first purpose-built football ground, with stands on three sides. Goodison Park was officially opened on 24 August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played; instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short athletics event followed by {{music and a}} fireworks display. Upon its completion the stadium was the first joint purpose-built football stadium in the world; Celtic's basic Celtic Park ground in Glasgow, Scotland was inaugurated {{on the same day}} as Goodison Park.|$|E
5|$|Among the company's {{other goals}} {{was that of}} helping finance road {{projects}} on Øygarden. The most pressing issue was the section from Kolltveit on Store Sotra to the bridge, part of National Road 555. In 1976, the company issued NOK5 million in an <b>interest-free</b> <b>loan</b> to the project, which was repaid in 1982 and 1983. Similar conditions were imposed for NOK2 million for National Road 561 to Nordra Straumsundet and NOK1.2 million {{for the establishment of}} the Solsvik–Rong Ferry in 1974. The rest of the subsidies were given as grants. The main project was National Road 561, which ran from Kollveit northwards through Øygarden, for which the company paid NOK28.6 million. It paid a further NOK9.3 million for other projects in Sotra and Øygarden, including connections to Turøy and Misje.|$|E

5|$|Currently, Wales {{play all}} their home matches at the 74,500 {{capacity}} Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, {{which is also}} Wales' national stadium. The Millennium Stadium was first conceived in 1994, when a group redevelopment committee was set up. It was decided to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park after a review found {{it was out of}} date; new legislation also required stadia to be all seated. Construction began in September 1997, and was completed by June 1999, in time for the Rugby World Cup. The construction cost the WRU £126million, which was funded by private investment, £46million of public funds from the National Lottery, the sale of debentures to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an <b>interest-free</b> <b>loan),</b> and loans. While the new ground was being built, Wales used the old Wembley Stadium for their home matchesa deal reciprocated during construction of the new Wembley, when FA Cup finals were held at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Although Taylor {{recorded}} nine {{sacks and}} made the All-Pro team {{for the third consecutive}} season in 1983, the Giants struggled. The team went 3–12–1, and Parcells received heavy criticism from fans and the media. Taylor was forced to play inside linebacker for part of the season, a position which allowed him less pass rushing opportunities, when Carson was injured. Frustrated by the losing, Taylor began acting out by arriving late for meetings, and not participating in conditioning drills in practice. After the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Taylor was given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor regretted the decision, and less than a month later attempted to renege. His agent was able to negotiate by meeting with Trump personally and then the Giants which resulted in allowing Taylor to go with the Giants. Taylor got a 6-year $6.55-million package that also included a $1 million <b>interest-free</b> <b>loan.</b> The main results of these negotiations were threefold: 1) Taylor returned the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants paid Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, the NFL {{provided}} a $3-million USD <b>interest-free</b> <b>loan</b> to the financially struggling CFL. In return, the NFL was granted access to CFL players entering a defined two-month {{window in the}} option year of their contract. This was later written into the CFL's collective bargaining agreement with its players. The CFL's finances have since stabilized and they eventually repaid the loan. The CFL–NFL agreement expired in 2006.

Many viewed the deal as significantly better for taxpayers than the 1997 plan. But the details of the financial arrangements once again were very complicated.

The new company was partially funded by the city and also received a long-term <b>interest-free</b> <b>loan</b> from the state.
