500|$|By early 1887, 13 African Americans {{were playing}} in the [...] "white" [...] minor leagues, {{including}} four in the Ohio State League. [...] Weldy began the season with the Akron Acorns of the Ohio State League. [...] However, he appeared in only four games for the Acorns. During the 1887 season, racial segregation began to become the official policy in certain minor leagues. [...] Weldy was outraged by a report that the Tri-State League (successor to the Ohio State League) had abandoned racial integration. [...] In March 1888, {{he wrote a letter}} to the league's president protesting the decision. [...] In his 1970 history of racial segregation in baseball, Robert Peterson described Weldy's letter as [...] "perhaps the most passionate cry for justice ever voiced by a Negro athlete." [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:The law is a disgrace to the present age, and reflects very much upon the intelligence of your last meeting, and casts derision at the laws of Ohio– the voice of the people– that say all men are equal. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> your honorable body, in case that black law is not repealed, pass one making it criminal for a colored man or woman to be found on a ball ground... There should be some broader cause– such as lack of ability, behavior and intelligence– for barring a player, rather than his color. [...] It is for these reasons and because I think ability and intelligence should be recognized first and last– at all times and by everyone– I ask the question again, 'Why was the law permitting colored men to sign repealed, etc.?' ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Good Morning America, Nancy Grace said in reaction to events that [...] "If anything, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> guilt made her commit suicide. To suggest that a 15- or 20-minute interview can cause someone to commit suicide is focusing on the wrong thing." [...] She then said that, while she sympathized with the family, she knew from her own experience {{as a victim of}} crime that such people look for somebody else to blame.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{independent}} {{evidence for}} Chalmers' claim is the essay and proposal he submitted for adhesive postage stamps to the General Post Office, dated 8 February 1838 and {{received by the}} Post Office on 17 February 1838. In this approximately 800-word document concerning methods of indication letters postage-paid he states, [...] "Therefore, of Mr Hill’s plan of a uniform rate of postage ... I conceive that the most simple and economical mode ... would be by Slips ... {{in the hope that}} Mr Hill’s plan may soon be carried into operation <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> sheets of Stamped Slips should be prepared ... then be rubbed over on the back with a strong solution of gum ...". Chalmers' original document is now in the UK's National Postal Museum.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be jabers! but it's cold, it is," [...] he cried. [...] "If I {{might be}} so bold, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> jist <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{we should go}} down below. How is the dead man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have assured {{ourselves}} on that score, and I {{know that it}} matters not how much Nana Furnuwees will have to give. What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> is <b>that</b> you shall seize Ghatgay, and rid yourself of his domination. He cannot but be as odious to you as he is to Bajee Rao, and to the people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad the}} thaw is so complete," [...] said Hendrick, [...] "for it may perhaps clear away the snow altogether. It {{is too early}} for winter to begin in earnest. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> now <b>that</b> we encamp again for a few days, {{to see whether the}} weather is really going to change; hunt a little, and rest a while. What say you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{is visible}} to the naked eye,' she retorted. 'But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it is only decent to go down on your bended knees.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Embarrassed, hopelessly at sea.) This is, I fear--ahem--too {{delicate}} a matter, Mr. Starkweather, {{for me to}} interfere. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it be {{advisable for}} me to withdraw--ahem-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur is a prince," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now for {{the further}} details. If {{monsieur}} would run the risk, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> he accompanies me {{to the office of}} this man Schwann." ...|$|E
50|$|I am of {{the opinion}} that the survey of this grant is grossly in excess of the {{quantity}} granted. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> respectfully <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> in the event of the confirmation of this claim by Congress it be limited to the extent of the land reduced to actual possession and occupancy, to be ascertained by additional evidence and survey.|$|R
60|$|Nothing excites my own {{suspicion}} of my provisional hypothesis {{more than its}} symmetry. It really seems to fit the facts, as they appear to me, too neatly. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest,</b> however, <b>that</b> ancient savage sacred hymns, and practices in the mysteries, are really rather {{of the nature of}} 'documents;' more so, at least, than the casual observations of some travellers, or the gossip extracted from natives much in contact with Europeans.|$|R
6000|$|... "These gentlemen {{have given}} you all the {{information}} in their power, {{and if you have}} finished with them, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> venture to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> any technical details of the work concern only Mr. Thurston and yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so do I," [...] said Mackinnon, very gravely. [...] "But if {{you will}} allow me to give you my advice, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it would be well to avoid such {{mistakes}} in future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is a {{beautiful}} woman, nevertheless," [...] continued de Batz with a smile. [...] "During the next act, my good St. Just, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> you open your eyes {{as well as your}} ears." ...|$|E
60|$|AUSTIN. Then, sir (with {{his hand}} upon the bell), this {{conversation}} becomes impossible. You have me at too gross a disadvantage; and, {{as you are}} a gentleman and respect another, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> you retire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, Fred, {{in spite}} of your disdain, we were all of opinion {{that it was a}} matter of rejoicing that Lord St. Leger and Lady Amelia were present, so that no one had any reason to say that they disapproved. Moreover, lest you should learn {{imprudence}} from my story, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> also <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> if your uncle and aunt had not been a couple comme il-y-en a peu, it would neither have been excellent nor glorious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could it!" [...] Ascobaruch {{uttered a}} hideous laugh. [...] "Could it! Arouse {{me in the}} night-watches and ask me! Question me on the matter, having stopped me for that purpose on the public highway! What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> suggest--I'm not dictating, mind you; merely {{trying to help you}} out--what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> is <b>that</b> you took that long, sharp knife of yours, the one you use for the sacrifices, and toddled out to the Linx--you're sure to find the King there; and just when he's raising that sacrilegious stick of his over his shoulder----" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> to you <b>that</b> {{this is only}} a very extreme {{instance}} of the general state of affairs, that there may be finer and subtler differences of level between one term and another, and that terms may very well be thought of as lying obliquely and as being twisted through different levels.|$|R
6000|$|... "They retire quite early, sir, as a rule. By half-past ten {{the coast}} is {{generally}} clear. At that time <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I {{came down and}} knocked on the cupboard door to notify you that all was well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that the public {{interest}} will not allow me to answer your question. Since, however, Lord Wellington himself is present, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> you ask his lordship whether I am {{to give you the}} information you require." ...|$|E
60|$|If I may {{venture to}} offer a word of advice to the Chiefs of the Salvation Army, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the very {{responsible}} position of first Anti-Suicide Officer in London is not one that any man should be asked to fill in perpetuity.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by {{no means}} all. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest,</b> for example, <b>that</b> a {{presentation}} {{to a doctor}} {{is more likely to}} come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} I have to {{beg your pardon}} once more," [...] said Attwater; [...] "but, do you know, you {{seem to me to}} be a trifle nearer, which is entirely outside of our bargain. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> venture to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> you take one--two--three--steps back; and stay there." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{will save}} continual trouble with weights and scales, if the powders be so diluted with flour, that one Measureful of each shall {{be a full}} average dose for an adult; and if the measure {{to which they are}} adopted be cylindrical, and of such a size as just to admit a common lead-pencil, and of a {{determined}} length, it can at any time be replaced by twisting up a paper cartridge. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> further <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the powders be differently coloured, one colour being used for emetics and another for aperients.|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case, your Grace, {{since you}} have {{yourself}} stated that any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> you make such amends as you can to the Duchess, and that you try to resume those relations which have been so unhappily interrupted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A brainy and admirable step,' said Psmith, approvingly. 'This rugged, honest man, all unused to verbal subtleties, shall give us his plain {{account of}} what happened. After which, as I presume this tram--little as I know of the habits of trams--has got to go somewhere today, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> we all {{separated}} and moved on.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Not probable; {{certainly}} not; but it's possible. Great {{interest will}} probably be made. If I might venture to advise your lordship, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> you should discuss the matter with his grace next week. I {{have no doubt that}} your wishes, if made known and backed by his grace, would be paramount with Lord ----." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this short}} essay, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>suggest</b> <b>that,</b> more than {{anything}} else, the London riots exposed a feature of contemporary British youth culture which, despite governmental and independent scrutiny, was laid completely naked during the unrest and downplayed in subsequent reporting – a strong social and individual commitment toward consumerism...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{the educated}} {{audience}} often uses [...] "art" [...] films {{in much the}} same self-indulgent way as the mass audience uses the Hollywood [...] "product," [...] finding wish fulfillment in the form of cheap and easy congratulation on their sensitivities and liberalism. - Fantasies of the Art-house Audience ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is plausible, your honour," [...] said Joyce, respectfully, [...] "and {{it shows}} that {{corporal}} Strides"--Joel insisted he was a serjeant, but the real Simon Pure never gave him a title {{higher than that of}} corporal--"and {{it shows that}} corporal Strides has an idea of war. By mounting that piece, and using it with discretion--refusing it, at the right moment, and showing it at another--a great deal might be done with it, either in a siege or an assault. If your honour will excuse the liberty, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> respectfully <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it might be well to set the quaker on his legs, and plant him at the gate, as an exhorter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, sir," [...] Desmond said, [...] "that it {{will not}} be {{necessary}} for us to have all these officials going round with us. It will be impossible, in one day, to do more than examine one department. As ammunition is the most important of all stores, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> we take only those in charge of the war material." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{absence of}} the latter means nothing, though its {{presence}} may mean everything," [...] said Holmes. [...] "Unless the powder from a badly fitting cartridge happens to spurt backward, one may fire many shots without leaving a sign. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Cubitt's body may now be removed. I suppose, Doctor, you have not recovered the bullet which wounded the lady?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Honor," [...] Watson said {{next day}} to the village Justice, a well to do farmer and graduate, thirty years before, from a cow college, [...] "since this Sol Witberg has seen fit to charge me with battery, {{following}} upon my charge of battery against him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> both cases be lumped together. The testimony and the facts are the same in both cases." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} {{examples}} of how Buddhism stimulated printing in Korea. Despite the difficulties the Mongol invasion presented, printing of texts continued. While in exile on Kangwha Island, the Koryo government re-carved a woodblock edition of a Buddhist text crucial to the Son sect that had become scarce. Sohn also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the invention of moveable type {{was due to the}} general scarcity of books after 1127 but before the Mongol invasion. Sohn mentions that there was an urgent need for these texts. (98) What he does not mention, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suggest,</b> is <b>that</b> moveable type was used because it would have taken too long to re-carve the woodblocks. Thus moveable type was utilized to meet the urgent demand for the texts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this brief}} note, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{it makes sense}} to reinterpret product update, as {{introduced}} by Baltag, Moss and Solecki, as a system to account for observations and metaobservations, where a meta-observation is an observation of an observation. Under this interpretation we also take products of action models with meta-action models. I deliberate on some possible consequences of this extension to the interpretation of product update. ...|$|R
40|$|As an anthropologist, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{the tropics}} provide a perceptual {{environment}} that promotes and enhances a particular 'science of the concrete, whereby perceived {{order in the}} environment {{is the basis for}} systems of classifications, epistemological structures, and cosmologies. In the American tropics, the science of the concrete takes on a particular character that results in epistemologies founded in what I will call dialectical, reversible dualism...|$|R
