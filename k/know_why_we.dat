Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

[...] Bunn credits Arrington with helping to alter the band's focus: [...] "We were playing music for God, but we didn't really <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> were doing it. [...] It was more so to be 'rock stars', per se, and just use God {{as a way to}} get there. [...] And so he really helped us flip-flop that and get it the way it should be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen {{and we do not}} <b>know</b> <b>why.</b> <b>We</b> were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to the}} First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Asked {{his opinion}} on {{same-sex}} marriage in October 2011, Paul expressed {{his support for}} marriage privatization by replying, [...] "Biblically and historically, the government was very uninvolved in marriage.

[...] Now we know that almost all these answers are highly likely to be nonsense, having sprung from man's ignorance and his enormous capacity for self-deception... The simple fables of the religions {{of the world have}} come to seem like tales told to children. [...] Even understood symbolically they are often perverse, if not rather unpleasant... Humanists, then, live in a mysterious, exciting and intellectually expanding world, which, once glimpsed, makes the old worlds of the religions seem fake-cosy and stale... ": ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, Cardinal Nicolás de Jesús López Rodríguez {{referred}} to President Obama's nominee for Dominican Republic's ambassador (Wally Brewster) by the anti-gay slur maricón.

Let's speak in Creole or Castilian: They're faggots. That's how you say it, right?" [...] He later apologized, saying: [...] "It is an offensive word, and [...] deserve respect." [...] However, in December 2015 Rodríguez again insulted Brewster who he said was abusing his role by speaking out against corruption: [...] "That man needs {{to go back to}} his embassy.
