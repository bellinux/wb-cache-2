So if we needed a spare train, we would pull one off the line and cancel it, which was why punctuality and reliability was so poor. After the public campaign in 2006 we <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't want to take that to carry on any more.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the poor}} {{commercial}} performance of The Eternal Idol, Black Sabbath were dropped by both Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with I.R.S. Records. The band took time off in 1988, returning in August {{to begin work}} on their next album. As {{a result of the}} recording troubles with Eternal Idol, Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. [...] "It was a completely new start", Iommi said. [...] "I had to rethink the whole thing, and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed to build up some credibility again". Iommi enlisted former Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell, long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist Laurence Cottle, and rented a [...] "very cheap studio in England".|$|E
500|$|The planned North American {{tour was}} cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan {{would join the}} group as his replacement, the {{remaining}} members decided to disband.

The head of the IFS, Paul Johnson said that the UK [...] "could perfectly reasonably <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are willing to pay a bit of a price for leaving the EU and regaining some sovereignty and control over immigration and so on.

Spotify had been in [...] "advanced discussions" [...] with Radiohead's management and label to make A Moon Shaped Pool the first album available exclusively to the service's paying subscribers, and not those listening to the free service, but no agreement was reached. Spotify spokesman Jonathan Prince said: [...] "Some of the approaches we explored with Radiohead were new, and we ultimately <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> couldn't deliver on those approaches technologically {{in time for the}} album's release schedule." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Dale {{was cast}} in the {{continuing}} role of Jim Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, earning him acclaim across the world, including the United Kingdom. He appeared on the show from the first episode and stayed for eight years before his character was killed off in 1993. He found working on Neighbours [...] "exciting" [...] and it enabled him to provide for his sons, but he noted: [...] "You were a totally replaceable commodity; [...] didn't put any value {{on any of the}} people appearing in the show." [...] He expanded: [...] "I didn't like it there, they were not nice people. When we <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hated each other, the company and me, {{one of the things the}} company did was to market everything they could out of us and pay us nothing."

I love you, bye." [...] Shortly after, an announcement was made through the speakers confirming the show was cancelled. According to local newspapers Milenio and El Universal, fans screamed [...] "Fraud!", booed and hurled chairs and other items. Two days later, a statement was released by Spears that said: [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't finish the show for my fans. The Mexican fans {{are one of the}} best audiences to play for. We <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had no choice but to}} cancel the show after the storm and lightning showed no signs of clearing up."

500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

On October 24, the band began a tour in support of the album, during which they began playing at small venues at college arenas. The tour lasted for six weeks. In November 2005, it was announced that guitarist Ben Harper had parted ways with the band. Key explained that the band went through [...] "a lot of the highest and lowest points" [...] and that making an album [...] "would be on the highest list, and losing a member would be on the lowest." [...] He also added, [...] "It's really been a long journey together, you know, so obviously, parting ways with Ben was a really unpleasant experience. It was either go on without him, or don't go on at all. And, at the core, we <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had something too great to let go of, and that we had to kind of make a last resort and move on without him."

2500|$|More recent {{artistic and}} {{cinematic}} portrayals {{have also made}} an effort to characterize Jesus as an ancient Middle Eastern resident. In the 2004 movie, The Passion of the Christ, Jesus was portrayed by Jim Caviezel who wore a prosthetic nose during filming and had his blue eyes digitally changed to brown to give him a more Middle Eastern appearance. According to designer Miles Teves, who created the prosthesis: [...] "Mel (Gibson) wanted to make the actor playing Jesus, James Caviezel, look more ethnically Middle Eastern, and it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could do it best by changing the shape of his nose." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joel David Hamkins {{proposes a}} multiverse {{approach}} to set theory {{and argues that}} [...] "the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, {{it can no longer}} be settled in the manner formerly hoped for." [...] (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, Saharon Shelah wrote that he does [...] "not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be <b>decided,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC." [...] (Shelah 2003).|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} issued in the United Kingdom in October 1970, where its sales were {{enhanced}} {{by the success of}} the [...] "Paranoid" [...] single. [...] "That single attracted screaming kids", Iommi recalled in the liner notes to Reunion in 1998. [...] "We saw people dancing when we played it and we <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't do singles for a long while after that to stay true to the fans who'd liked us before we'd become popular." [...] Paranoid US release was delayed until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts {{at the time of its}} UK release. Paranoid reached No.12 in the US in March 1971 with virtually no radio airplay.|$|E

40|$|When {{we teach}} physics to {{prospective}} {{scientists and engineers}} we are teaching more than the "facts" of physics - more, even, than the methods and concepts of physics. We are introducing them to a complex culture - a mode of thinking and the cultural code of behavior of a community of practicing scientists. This culture has components that are often part of our hidden curriculum: epistemology - how <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know something; ontology - how we parse the observable world into categories, objects, and concepts; and discourse - how we hold a conversation in order to generate new knowledge and understanding. Underlying {{all of this is}} intuition - a culturally created sense of meaning.

It is now irrevocably complex, and we, whoever we are, have become intertwined one with the other, {{whether we like it or}} not. Acting on that belief may be a more effective tribute to the memory of the dead than mourning alone or vowing that it shall not happen again.
