50|$|The {{effect of}} Nicothoe astaci upon the host European lobster has only {{recently}} been studied. Internally, lobsters respond to the parasite by encapsulating haemocytes {{in an attempt to}} partition off damaged gill areas, and Wootton et al. (2011) hypothesized that this response may impair gill respiratory function. Various haemolymph factors can provide a general health indicator of crustaceans. For example, haemolymph levels of <b>hyperglycaemic</b> hormone, proteins, haemocyanin levels, nitrogenous wastes (including ammonia, urea and ureic acid) and glucose change in response to environmental stressors such as temperature, salinity and hypoxia, as well as to physiological stressors such as moult stage and exogenous stressors such as temperature, handling, disease and parasitization. The data suggest that lobsters with gills damaged by the feeding activities of N. astaci respond by producing higher levels of haemocyanin, which is both a key defence response and may compensate for their decreased respiratory functioning (i.e. to bolster the oxygen transport capability of haemolymph).|$|E

Hippocampal samples from Alzheimer’s disease donors show decreased BDNF expression and individuals with Alzheimer’s disease have low plasma levels of BDNF. Also, patients with major depression have lower levels of serum BDNF than normal control subjects. Other studies suggest that plasma BDNF is a biomarker of impaired memory and general cognitive function in ageing women and a low circulating BDNF level was recently shown to be an independent and robust biomarker of mortality risk in old women. Interestingly, low levels of circulating BDNF are also found in obese individuals and those with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we have demonstrated that there is a cerebral output of BDNF and that this is inhibited during <b>hyperglycaemic</b> clamp conditions in humans. This last finding may explain the concomitant finding of low circulating levels of BDNF in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and the association between low plasma BDNF and the severity of insulin resistance.|$|E
50|$|The hormone {{glucagon}} {{was discovered}} by C. P. Kimball and John R. Murlin in 1923 as a <b>hyperglycaemic</b> (blood-sugar elevating) substance along the pancreatic extracts. Its true biological importance was not known and the name itself was ignored. At the time de Duve joined Bouckaert at Leuven university to work on insulin, it still remained a mystery. Insulin was the first commercial hormonal drug originally produced by the Eli Lilly and Company since 1921, but their extraction suffered from impurity which caused mild hyperglycaemia, the very opposite of what they expected. In May 1944 de Duve realised that the insulin impurity could be removed by crystallisation. He demonstrated that the insulin produced of ELi Lilly was contaminated by the impurity, whereas that of the Danish Novo was not. The Eli Lilly insulin caused initial hyperglycaemia, and the Novo insulin did not when he injected them into rats. His experiments were published in 1947, following which the Eli Lilly upgraded its method to produce purified insulin. By then he had joined Carl and Gerti Cori's at Washington University in St. Louis, where he worked with a fellow researcher Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr. (who later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971). Sutherland {{had been working on}} the insulin-impurity substance and had named it hyperglycemic-glycogenolytic (HG) factor. He and de Duve immediately discovered that the HG factor was synthesised not only by the pancreas but, surprisingly, by the gastric mucosa and certain other parts of the digestive tract. They further found that the hormone was produced from pancreatic islets by cells differing from the insulin-producing beta cells, presumably the alpha cells. It was de Duve who realised that Sutherland's HG factor was glucagon, and this rediscovery led to its permanent name, which he reintroduced it in 1951. They showed that glucagon was the major hormone influencing the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis) in the liver, by which more sugars are produced in the blood. de Duve's original hypothesis that glucagon was produced by pancreatic alpha cells was proved right when it was demonstrated that selectively cobalt-damage alpha cells stopped producing glucagon in guinea pigs, and finally isolated the purified hormone in 1953, including those from birds.|$|E

The results indicate that <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions modulate the potential proteolytic activity of the enzymes secreted by confluent cultures of these cells. Gelatinase A (MMP- 2) activity was always higher in cultures maintained under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> than under normoglycaemic conditions (4 mM D-glucose). In contrast, gelatinase B (MMP- 9) activity was decreased under the same conditions. Matrilysin (MMP- 7) activity was decreased by up to 100 % under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western-blotting analyses indicate that in all cases both the transcripts and the protein level were correlated with enzymic activity.

Slot blot analysis showed 2 - 3 -fold increases in mRNAs for collagen type I, fibronectin, versican and perlecan, whereas mRNA for decorin was increased by up to 20 -fold. Levels of mRNAs for biglycan and syndecan were unaffected by <b>hyperglycaemic</b> culture. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed that decorin mRNA levels are greatly elevated and also showed increased transcription of the TGF-beta 1 gene in <b>hyperglycaemic</b> cultures. Western analysis and ELISA indicated accumulations of collagen types I and III, laminin and fibronectin in the cell layers and media of <b>hyperglycaemic</b> cultures with increasing time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{describe}} {{the relationship between}} glycaemic control, <b>hyperglycaemic</b> symptoms {{and quality of life}} (HRQOL) in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: In a shared-care diabetes project HRQOL was assessed. A total of 1664 patients with type 2 diabetes were identified in 32 primary healthcare practices. Of these patients, 1149 were included. HRQOL was measured using a generic questionnaire (Rand- 36), completed by 1006 of the 1149 participants. RESULTS: The number of <b>hyperglycaemic</b> symptoms was higher in women (1. 88) compared with men (1. 64), without differences in mean haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) (7. 5 %) -Univariate analyses showed negative relationships between all dimensions of the Rand- 36 and <b>hyperglycaemic</b> symptoms (p< 0. 001), but between only one dimension and HbA 1 c (p= 0. 005). Multivariate analyses showed no association between any of the dimensions of the Rand- 36 and HbA 1 c, but the relationship between <b>hyperglycaemic</b> symptoms persisted in all dimensions (p< 0. 001). Notwithstanding these results, the presence of <b>hyperglycaemic</b> symptoms was related to higher HbA 1 c.

40|$|Background  Cutaneous {{wound healing}} is {{relatively}} slow {{in patients with}} diabetes. Objectives  To test the hypothesis that this defect in healing of wounds in patients with diabetes results from dysfunction of skin fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes and that this dysfunction is related to disrupted intracellular glutathione (GSH) homeostasis. Methods  We investigated the effects of esterified GSH on the contraction of fibroblasts in a fibroblast-populated collagen lattice and on keratinocyte apoptosis. Results  High glucose medium (hyperglycaemia) reduced the contraction ability of fibroblasts (P[*]< [*] 0 · 05). The normalization of glucose medium concentrations for <b>hyperglycaemic</b> fibroblasts did not restore the contraction capacity. The percentage of apoptotic keratinocytes was statistically higher in <b>hyperglycaemic</b> cells (P[*]< [*] 0 · 05).

We determined the prevalence of hypernatreamia and its associated factors at presentation for <b>hyperglycaemic</b> crisis. Methods This was a retrospective review of data for <b>hyperglycaemic</b> crisis admissions in Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, Mthatha, South Africa. The prevalence of hypernatreamia (uncorrected Serum Sodium at presentation > 145 mmol/L) was determined. Hyperosmolality was defined by calculated effective osmolality > 320 mosmols/Kg. Multivariate logistic regression was undertaken using variables that were statistically significant in univariate analysis to ascertain those that were independently associated (Odds Ratio (OR) with 95 % Confidence Interval (CI)) with hypernatreamia. Results The prevalence of hypernatreamia in our admissions for <b>hyperglycaemic</b> crisis was 11. 7 % (n = 32 / 273 including 171 females and 102 males).

New therapies for diabetic wounds are urgently needed and in-vitro or ex-vivo test systems are essential for the initial identification of new active molecules. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare in-vitro and ex-vivo test systems for their usability for early drug screening and to investigate the efficacy of a birch bark triterpene extract (TE) that has been proven ex-vivo and clinically to accelerate non-diabetic wound healing (WH), in a diabetic context. We investigated in-vitro models for diabetic WH, i. e. scratch assays with human keratinocytes from diabetic donors or cultured under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions and a newly developed porcine ex-vivo <b>hyperglycaemic</b> WH model for their potential to mimic delayed diabetic WH and for the influence of TE in these test systems. We show that keratinocytes from diabetic donors often fail to exhibit significantly delayed WH. For cells under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions significant decrease is observed but is influenced by choice of medium and presence of supplements. Also, donor age plays a role. Interestingly, <b>hyperglycaemic</b> effects are mainly hyperosmolaric effects in scratch assays. Ex-vivo models under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions show a clear and substantial decrease of WH, and here both glucose and hyperosmolarity effects are involved. Finally, we provide evidence that TE is also beneficial for ex-vivo <b>hyperglycaemic</b> WH, resulting in significantly increased length of regenerated epidermis to 188 ± 16 % and 183 ± 11 % (SEM; p< 0. 05) compared to controls when using two different TE formulations. In conclusion, our results suggest that microenvironmental influences are important in WH test systems and that therefore the more complex <b>hyperglycaemic</b> ex-vivo model is more suitable for early drug screening. Limitations of the in-vitro and ex-vivo models are discussed. Furthermore our data recommend TE as a promising candidate for in-vivo testings in diabetic wounds...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives. Diabetes affects {{approximately}} {{1 million}} South Africans. Hospital admissions, {{the largest single}} item of diabetes expenditure, are often precipitated by <b>hyperglycaemic</b> emergencies. A recent survey of a 200 - bed hospital, serving approximately 1. 3 million Cape Town residents, showed that <b>hyperglycaemic</b> emergencies comprised 25. 6 % of high-care unit admissions. A study was undertaken to determine the reasons for, and financial cost of, these admissions. Methods. All <b>hyperglycaemic</b> admissions during a 2 -month period (1 September - 31 October 2005) were surveyed prospectively. Admissions were classified using the American Diabetes Association classification of <b>hyperglycaemic</b> emergencies. Demographic data, and the reason for, duration of and primary outcome of admission, were recorded. The following costs per admission were calculated using public sector pricing: (i) total costs; (ii) patient-specific costs; (iii) no patient- specific costs; and (iv) capital costs. Results. Sepsis (36 %), non-compliance with therapy (32 %) and a new diagnosis of diabetes (11 %) were the predominant reasons for admission of 53 <b>hyperglycaemic</b> emergency cases. Mean duration of hospital stay was 4 days, with an in-hospital mortality of 7. 5 %. Mean cost per admission was R 5 309.

40|$|Clinicians often {{experience}} delayed epithelialization in diabetic patients, {{for which}} a high glucose condition {{is one of the}} causes. However, the mechanisms underlying delayed wound closure have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatments to enhance epithelialization in patients with hyperglycaemia have not been established. Here we propose a new reagent, acylated homoserine lactone (AHL), to improve the delayed epithelialization due to the disordered formation of a basement membrane of epidermis in <b>hyperglycaemic</b> rats. Acute hyperglycaemia was induced by streptozotocin injection in this experiment. Full thickness wounds were created on the flanks of <b>hyperglycaemic</b> or control rats.

We then examined the effects of AHL on delayed epithelialization in <b>hyperglycaemic</b> rats.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{activities of}} adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline in producing hyperglycaemia and glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle {{have been studied}} in both fed and fasted rats, 1 hr after subcutaneous injection of the catechol amines. The relative <b>hyperglycaemic</b> activities of the three catechol amines depended greatly upon the prandial state of the rats and on the dose range used. In fed rats the relative potencies were in the descending order of potency, adrenaline—noradrenaline—isoprenaline, irrespective of the dose range. Isoprenaline had no <b>hyperglycaemic</b> activity in fed rats even at doses as high as 2 mg/kg. In fasted rats the order of potency depended on the dose. At low doses (0. 005 to 0. 02 mg/kg) the descending order was isoprenaline—adrenaline—noradrenaline. At higher doses (0. 1 to 1 mg/kg) the descending order was adrenaline—isoprenaline—noradrenaline. The relative activities of the three catechol amines in causing glycogenolysis in muscle was independent of the dose range or the prandial state of the rats. Under all conditions the descending order of potency was isoprenaline—adrenaline—noradrenaline. The results are discussed with reference to Ahlquist's (1948) hypothesis of α- and β- receptors and {{were consistent with the}} concept that, in the rat, liver glycogenolysis is mediated predominantly by α-receptors and muscle glycogenolysis mainly by β-receptors. In general the <b>hyperglycaemic</b> response in the fed rat is mediated predominantly by α-receptors and in the fasted rat the response is mainly due to the activation of β-receptors. A drug possessing both α- and β-receptor activity elicits an exception to this rule in the fasted rat.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the <b>hyperglycaemic</b> action of the novel imidazoline compound FT 005 could be mediated by activation of α 2 -adrenoceptors, using a variety of in vivo and in vitro methods including radioligand binding. FT 005 produced a dose-dependent increase in blood glucose levels of CBA/Ca mice (0. 125 – 25 mg kg− 1, i. p.). The time course of this <b>hyperglycaemic</b> effect matched that of adrenaline (1 mg kg− 1) more closely than glucagon (1 mg kg− 1) or the KATP channel opener diazoxide (25 mg kg− 1). The <b>hyperglycaemic</b> effect of FT 005 (1 mg kg− 1) was significantly reduced by the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (0. 5 mg kg− 1). FT 005 produced a significant reduction in plasma insulin levels of mice 30 min after administration. The <b>hyperglycaemic</b> effect of FT 005 (25 mg kg− 1), although still present, was significantly less in fasted mice in which insulin levels are lower, suggesting that a reduction of insulin secretion contributes to the action of FT 005. When studied in the mouse isolated vas deferens preparation, FT 005 produced a complete inhibition of neurogenic contractions, which was blocked by rauwolscine. This is consistent with activation of pre-synaptic α 2 -adrenoceptors. In radioligand binding studies FT 005 completely displaced the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist [3 H]-RX 821002 from mouse whole brain homogenates. The displacement was best described by a two-site model of interaction comprising high and low affinity components. The results indicate that FT 005 is an agonist at α 2 -adrenoceptors.

Hyperglycaemia was mimicked in vitro by incubation of TAFI with glyceraldehyde and in vivo by <b>hyperglycaemic</b> clamping of healthy volunteers. The effects of long-term hyperglycaemia in vivo on TAR were investigated by comparing TAFI from poorly regulated and tightly regulated patients with type 2 diabetes. In vitro glycated TAR showed an altered migration pattern on SDS-PAGE due to aggregation. Glycated TAFI showed decreased activity after activation by thrombin-thrombomodulin in a glyceraldehyde-dose-dependent manner and a reduced anti-fibrinolytic potential. In vivo, no differences in TAR parameters were found after <b>hyperglycaemic</b> clamping of healthy volunteers and between tightly and poorly regulated patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, TAR purified from poorly regulated and tightly regulated patients with type 2 diabetes migrated similarly on SDS-PAGE, indicating little or no glycation of the protein. Despite the deleterious effects of glycation of TAR in vitro on its function,TAFI was neither affected by <b>hyperglycaemic</b> clamping, nor by long-term hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is in contrast to fibrinolytic factors as plasminogen-activator inhibitor I and tissue-type plasminogen activator, which are affected.

40|$|Summary-The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the role of}} endogenous opiate systems in the <b>hyperglycaemic</b> response to challenge with endotoxin in mice. Blockade of opiate receptors by administration of the opiate antagonists naloxone (1. O mg/kg) or naltrexone (1.

Naltrexone methyl bromide, a peripherally acting opiate antagonist, had no demonstrable ffect on the endotoxin-induced hyperglycaemia. Finally, induction of tolerance to morphine prevented the <b>hyperglycaemic</b> response to challenge with endotoxin. These results suggest a causative role for central endorphinergic mechanisms in the <b>hyperglycaemic</b> response to administration of endotoxin.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION What is {{the effect}} of beta-O-linked {{glycosylation}} (O-GlcNAcylation) on specific proteins in the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions? SUMMARY ANSWER Heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90) was identified and confirmed as being O-GlcNAcylated in mouse COCs under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions (modelled using glucosamine), causing detrimental outcomes for embryo development. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY O-GlcNAcylation of proteins occurs as a result of increased activity of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which provides substrates for cumulus matrix production during COC maturation, and also for O-GlcNAcylation. COCs matured under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions have decreased developmental competence, mediated at least in part through the mechanism of increased O-GlcNAcylation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This study was designed to examine the effect of <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions (using the <b>hyperglycaemic</b> mimetic, glucosamine) on O-GlcNAc levels in the mouse COC, and furthermore to identify potential candidate proteins which are targets of this modification, and their roles in oocyte maturation. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS COCs from 21 -day-old superovulated CBA × C 57 BL 6 F 1 hybrid female mice were matured in vitro (IVM). Levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins, HSP 90 and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT, the enzyme responsible for O-GlcNAcylation) in COCs were measured using western blot, and localization observed using immunocytochemistry. For glycosylated HSP 90 levels, and to test OGT-HSP 90 interaction, immunoprecipitation was performed prior to western blotting. Embryo development was assessed using in vitro fertilization and embryo culture post-maturation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Addition of the <b>hyperglycaemic</b> mimetic glucosamine to IVM medium for mouse COCs increased detectable O-GlcNAcylated protein levels (by western blot and immunocytochemistry), and this effect was reversed using an OGT inhibitor (P < 0. 05). HSP 90 was identified as a target of O-GlcNAcylation in the COC, and inhibition of HSP 90 during IVM reversed glucosamine-induced decreases in oocyte developmental competence (P < 0. 05). We also demonstrated the novel finding of an association between HSP 90 and OGT in COCs, suggesting a possible client–chaperone relationship. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION In vitro maturation of COCs was used so that treatment time could be limited to the 17 h of maturation prior to ovulation. Additionally, glucosamine, a <b>hyperglycaemic</b> mimetic, was used because it specifically activates the hexosamine pathway which provides the O-GlcNAc moieties. The results in this study should be confirmed using in vivo models of hyperglycaemia and different HSP 90 inhibitors. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This study leads to a new understanding of how diabetes influences oocyte competence and provides insight into possible therapeutic interventions based on inhibiting HSP 90 to improve oocyte quality.

Oral administration of Andrographis paniculata leaf extract (10 mg kg - 1 body weight) for 8 weeks resulted in {{significant reduction in}} glucose level as well as increased in body weight in alloxan induced <b>hyperglycaemic</b> rats but not in normal rats, which clearly shows the antidiabetic properties of Andrographis paniculata crude extract. The effect of the extract at dose 10 mg kg - 1 body weights was more effective than tested hypoglycaemic agent (glibenclamide) at dose 10 mg kg - 1 body weights in restoring the values of these parameters...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} and <b>hyperglycaemic</b> hyperosmolar syndrome are rare, {{but potentially}} fatal complications of antipsychotic-associated hyperglycaemia. The mechanisms for this remain unclear, but are probably multifactorial. The suggested reasons include drug-induced weight gain and adiposity, {{development of the}} metabolic syndrome, antagonism of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) receptors, drug-induced leptin resistance, dyslipidaemia mediated pancreatic β-cell damage and hepatocyte transcription factor dysregulation. Patients with schizophrenia {{are known to be}} at a higher genetic risk of developing diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. This review emphasizes a rare case of hyperosmolar <b>hyperglycaemic</b> syndrome in a young man with schizophrenia and discusses proposed mechanisms for the development of antipsychotic-associated diabetes mellitus...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{probenecid}} on frusemide-induced diuresis and hyperglycaemia was studied in mice. Probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion of organic anions in the kidney, strongly reduced the diuretic response to frusemide (25 or 200 mg kg- 1 body weight). This effect of probenecid {{appeared to be}} dose-dependent up to 240 mg kg- 1 body weight, {{at least at the}} lower concentration of frusemide. Pretreatment with probenecid (240 mg kg- 1 body weight) potentiated the <b>hyperglycaemic</b> effect of frusemide (25 or 200 mg kg- 1 body weight). The results show that probenecid has opposite effects on frusemide-induced diuresis and hyperglycaemia in mice. It is suggested that the acute <b>hyperglycaemic</b> effect of frusemide is not directly linked to diuresis...|$|E

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The {{content of}} heparan {{sulphate}} is reduced in the endothelium under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions and {{may contribute to}} the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Heparanase- 1 (HPR 1) specifically degrades heparan sulphate proteoglycans. We therefore sought to determine whether: (1) heparan sulphate reduction in endothelial cells is due to increased HPR 1 production through increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; and (2) HPR 1 production is increased in vivo in endothelial cells under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> and/or atherosclerotic conditions. METHODS: HPR 1 mRNA and protein levels in endothelial cells were analysed by RT-PCR and Western blot or HPR 1 enzymatic activity assay, respectively. Cell surface heparan sulphate levels were analysed by FACS. HPR 1 in the artery from control rats and a rat model of diabetes, and from patients under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> and/or atherosclerotic conditions was immunohistochemically examined. RESULTS: High-glucose-induced HPR 1 production and heparan sulphate degradation in three human endothelial cell lines, both of which were blocked by ROS scavengers, glutathione and N-acetylcysteine. Exogenous H(2) O(2) induced HPR 1 production, subsequently leading to decreased cell surface heparan sulphate levels. HPR 1 content was significantly increased in endothelial cells in the arterial walls of a rat model of diabetes. Clinical studies revealed that HPR 1 production was increased in endothelial cells under <b>hyperglycaemic</b> conditions, and in endothelial cells and macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Hyperglycaemia induces HPR 1 production and heparan sulphate degradation in endothelial cells through ROS. HPR 1 production is increased in endothelial cells from a rat model of diabetes, and in macrophages in the atherosclerotic lesions of diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Increased HPR 1 production {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis...|$|E
30|$|The STAR GC {{protocol}} clinical {{provision of}} nutrition to <b>hyperglycaemic</b> patients {{was compared to}} nutrition rates of entire ICU cohorts surveyed in 158 ICUs in Cahill et al. [59]. Mean nutrition rates clinically achieved by the STAR variable nutrition protocol {{were significantly higher than}} the mean and best ICU surveyed, for the first 3  days of ICU stay. Overall, STAR’s protocol-driven changes in nutrition rate provide on average nutrition rates for <b>hyperglycaemic</b> patients which are equal to, or better than the mean of all ICU patients in 158 ICUs from 20 countries. More importantly, these outcomes show high nutrition delivery and safe, effective GC are not exclusive and that restricting nutrition for GC does not limit overall nutritional intake compared to other ICUs.|$|E
40|$|Methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea {{flower and}} leaf {{exhibited}} significant Anti <b>hyperglycaemic</b> activity in Alloxan–induced diabetic rats. The flower extract of Thespesia populnea has potent anti <b>hyperglycaemic</b> property compared to standard Glibenclamide. Alloxan induced diabetic rats showed {{significant increase in}} the level of blood sugar. Oral administration of flower extract and leaf extract at the dose of 400 mg/kg body weight showed the significant decrease (P< 0. 01) on blood sugar level in 10 to 15 days of treatment. The possible mechanism by which the plant extract decreases the blood sugar level may be by potentiation of insulin effect either by increasing the pancreatic secretion of insulin from β-cells of islets of langerhans or by increasing the peripheral glucose uptake...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} whether long lasting Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD) decreased <b>hyperglycaemic</b> potential of epinephrine. For 80 days a group of New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits received 120 g of standard commercial pellets, as Control, while another group received 30 g VLCD. At {{the end of the}} experiment 15 µl/kg BW epinephrine was administered as intravenous bolus to both groups. One hour after administration blood glucose level increased significantly both in the VLCD (p< 0. 05) and the Control (p< 0. 001) groups without significant differences between them. Glycogen in VLCD hepatocytes was reduced but not fully exhausted. We concluded that in VLCD <b>hyperglycaemic</b> effect of epinephrine remained almost unaltered compared to Control group and this prevented VLCD treated subjects from hypoglycaemia...|$|E
40|$|The HPLC and LC/MS {{analyses}} of the CNS from isopod crustacean the woodlouse, Porcellio scaber revealed a presence of the red pigment-concentrating hormone (Panbo-RPCH) in this species. It {{has been shown that}} this neuropeptide plays a role in mobilization of energy stores: topical treatments of P. scaber individuals by Panbo-RPCH in a concentration 20 pmol/μl increased the level of glucose in haemolymph about 4 times. Glucose was the main carbohydrate mobilized by the Panbo-RPCH treatment. Despite the demonstration of <b>hyperglycaemic</b> activity of Panbo-RPCH, no stimulatory effect of this hormone on the locomotory activity of P. scaber was observed.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: Islet vascularization, by {{controlling}} beta-cell mass expansion {{in response to}} increased insulin demand, is implicated in the progression to glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes. We investigated how hyperglycaemia impairs expansion and differentiation of the growing pancreas. We have grafted xenogenic (avian) embryonic pancreas in severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mouse and analyzed endocrine and endothelial development in <b>hyperglycaemic</b> compared to normoglycaemic conditions. Methods: 14 dpi chicken pancreases were grafted under the kidney capsule of normoglycaemic or <b>hyperglycaemic,</b> streptozotocin-induced, SCID mice and analyzed two weeks later. Vascularization was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively using either in situ hybridization with both mouse- and chick-specific RNA probes for VEGFR 2 or immunohistochemistry with an antibody to nestin, a marker of endothelial cells that is specific for murine cells. To inhibit angiopoietin 2 (Ang 2), SCID mice were treated with 4 mg/kg IP L 1 – 10 twice/week. Results: In normoglycaemic condition, chicken-derived endocrine and exocrine cells developed well and intragraft vessels were lined with mouse endothelial cells. When pancreases were grafted in <b>hyperglycaemic</b> mice, growth and differentiation of the graft were altered and we observed endothelial discontinuities, large blood-filled spaces. Vessel density was decreased. These major vascular anomalies were associated with strong over-expression of chick-Ang 2. To explore th...|$|E
