5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion.

Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|E

Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men.

Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee, which he suffered during a match with Mike Sharpe on July 20 in Worcester, Massachusetts (the fact was revealed by his wife Diana years later on the Hart & Soul documentary); despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned. Bret Hart later revealed {{in an interview that he}} doubted the legitimacy of the injury and that he believed Davey Boy in fact had a drug problem and that in the two months prior to their match he could not contact him to sort out what they were going to do at Wembley, and when they finally got to the stadium Smith revealed that he had not slept in over 48 hours.

Willow enjoys power she is unable to control. She steals to accomplish her vocational goals and rationalizes her amoral behavior. This also manifests itself in a competitive streak and she accuses others who share their concerns that she uses magic for selfish purposes of being jealous.

In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell.

[...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it".

He then finds the ring that Kat pawned and asks Jean if she or Charlie lent Kat money, but they did not, and the {{pawnbroker}} refuses to tell him who bought it. The next day, he is suspicious when Kat leaves the pub and tells Michael that she is untrustworthy. Michael says Kat would not cheat again, revealing he knew about the affair, but he does not know who Kat was seeing. Alfie is in turmoil when Michael advises him not to pursue his suspicions. Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) finds a key on the bar and leaves it in a glass, but Alfie later notices it has gone. As he hides a Christmas present in Kat's jewellery box, he finds the key hidden there with the ring. He then leaves, claiming he will be away overnight, and asks Jean and Roxy to look after the bar so Kat can have the night off. Roxy tells the three Branning brothers that Alfie is away, and shortly after, Kat receives a phone call. She heads out, unaware that Alfie is watching. Alfie watches Kat enter the bedsit and kicks the door open, where he sees lit candles and rose petals. He looks for Kat's lover but she is alone. He demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is seeing, reminding her that she claimed her lover lived miles away. Kat insists this was her only lie and says the affair is over but her lover kept pestering her and threatening to tell Alfie. Alfie brings out Kat's mother's ring and asks how her lover knew about it if she had not seen him. Kat reveals she had not seen him alone, so Alfie realises it is someone he knows. Alfie decides to stay until he arrives, but then sees a rental agreement. Kat quickly sets fire to it, but Alfie sees the name Mr Branning. She tells Alfie she refused to let the man in while he was in Germany, and refuses to reveal which brother it is. Alfie says she makes him sick and goes to The Queen Victoria to find out the truth. While Kat searches for her phone in the bedsit, all three Branning brothers deny everything to Alfie. Kat then phones one of them and Alfie answers. Kat panics and runs to the pub.

Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to let you go. I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes off running. Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage and he says he never had any kids.|$|E
