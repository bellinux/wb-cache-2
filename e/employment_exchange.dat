5|$|The 1930s saw the {{construction}} of the <b>Employment</b> <b>Exchange</b> and the planning of the new Council House, although this was not completed until 1956. As a centre of aircraft manufacturing, Bristol was a target for bombing during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. Bristol's city centre was severely damaged, especially in November and December 1940, when the Broadmead area was flattened, and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city. The original central area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park featuring two bombed-out churches and fragments of the castle. A third bombed church has been given a new lease of life as the St Nicholas' Church Museum. Slightly to the north, the Broadmead shopping centre was built over bomb-damaged areas. Clifton Cathedral, {{to the north of the}} city centre, was built during the early 1970s.|$|E

In the 1920s he worked in the construction trust, <b>employment</b> <b>exchange</b> office, department for refugee affairs at the State Labour Commissariat and other government institutions of the Azerbaijan SSR. In 1933 he was accused of being a secret member of Musavat and arrested.

25|$|A revolutionary {{government}} met for {{the first}} time in November 1918. Known as the Council of People’s Commissioners, it consisted of three Majority Social Democrats (Friedrich Ebert, Philipp Scheidemann, and Otto Landsberg) and three United Social Democrats (Emil Barth, Wilhelm Dittman, and Hugo Haase). The new government faced a social crisis in the German Reich following the end of the First World War, with Germany threatened by hunger and chaos. There was, for the most part, an orderly return of soldiers back into civilian life, while the threat of starvation was combated. Wage levels were raised, universal proportional representation for all parliaments was introduced, and a series of regulations on unemployment benefits, job-creation and protection measures, health insurance, and pensions saw the institution of important political and social reforms. In February 1918, workers made an agreement with employers which secured them total freedom of association, the legal guarantee of an eight-hour workday, and the extension of wage agreements to all branches of trade and industry. The People’s Commissioners made these changes legally binding. In addition, the SPD-steered provisional government introduced binding state arbitration of labor conflicts, created worker’s councils in large industrial firms, and opened the path to the unionization of rural labourers. In December 1918, a decree was passed providing relief for the unemployed. This provided that communities were to be responsible for unemployment relief (without fixing an amount) and established that the Reich would contribute 50% and the respective German state 33% of the outlay. That same month, the government declared that labour exchanges were to be further developed with the financial assistance of the Reich. Responsibility for job placement was first transferred from the Demobilization Office to the Minister of Labour and then to the National <b>Employment</b> <b>Exchange</b> Office, which came into being in January 1920.|$|E

2500|$|In some {{countries}} there are organizations which concern {{themselves with the}} competence, conduct and reliability of art models. An example is the Register of Artists' Models (RAM) in the United Kingdom. [...] Some basic training is offered to beginners and membership is by audition – to test competence, not to discriminate on grounds of physical characteristics. RAM also acts as an important <b>employment</b> <b>exchange</b> for models and publishes the 'RAM Guidelines', which are widely referred to by models and employers. A similar organization in the United States, the Bay Area Models Guild in California, was founded in 1947.

Subsidies were also provided for various industries (such as shipbuilding in Clydeside), which helped {{to prevent a}} number of job losses. It is estimated that, between 1964 and 1970, 45,000 government jobs were created outside London, 21,000 of which were located in the Development Areas.

50|$|Presently, {{there are}} 978 <b>Employment</b> <b>Exchanges</b> (EE) and University Employment Guidance Information Bureaus in India. These exchanges assist job seekers in finding jobs {{on the basis}} of their {{qualifications}} and experience. Prospective job seekers can pre-register themselves for various vacancies listed within the respective states. Registered candidates also have the option of updating their resume. Employers too can list their vacancies with the EEs and select candidates according to their requirement. The <b>Employment</b> <b>Exchanges</b> (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, makes it compulsory for all establishments with 25 or more employees to notify their vacancies to the respective State EEs. Despite such provisions the exchanges fell short of catering to the rising and changing aspirations of the country’s youth. Caught in a vicious cycle of decreasing job seeker registrations and vacancy notifications by employers, these exchanges needed a transformation for better delivery of employment services.|$|R
2500|$|From the outset, the Minister at Westwood taught {{children}} reading, {{writing and}} arithmetic in evening classes.

The law at that time allowed {{children and young people}} to work up to twelve hours a day in mills and factories, with breaks amounting to one and a half hours for meals. State education was not provided in England until 1870. Even then, insufficient school places meant that many children could not be taught. In 1870, there were 18,085 children of school age in Oldham of whom roughly half actually attended school. Just over 2,300 were taught in private schools. Records show that the Westwood Sunday School building was hired by day school teachers for private tuition.

2500|$|The {{closure of}} the canal {{provided}} {{an opportunity for the}} Glasgow - Clydebank railway, which brought workers from Glasgow to the adjacent Thompson shipyard, to extend the line to Dalmuir. This line opened in 1896, and destroyed the first section of the canal. By 1897, there was a small section of canal at the northern end, which ended where a railway siding of the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway crossed it. It had been shortened by the construction of another railway siding by 1919, although the towpath bridge was still evident. By 1937, there was no trace of the north end, as an <b>employment</b> <b>exchange</b> had been built over it. At the south end, the canal was truncated just below the first lock, where the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway crossed it. It remained in this state in 1919, but by 1939 had been reduced by half. A small part of it was still evident in 1985, but is no longer so.|$|E
