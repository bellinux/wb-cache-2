5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{new housing}} estates were built north-west of the town. This was {{followed}} by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s, which destroyed much of the old high street. There was speculation that the town's population could increase to around 55–60,000 by 1970. This did not happen: a decline in the linoleum industry in the mid-1960s led to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population,</b> from a peak of 53,750 in 1961 to 47,962 in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the army}} air base was {{reactivated}} as Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded {{to accommodate a}} Strategic Air Command B-52 Stratofortress wing. The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo's population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31, 1968, contributed to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> to 127,010 by 1970.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, {{there were}} roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, {{implying}} {{a population of}} about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> which stood at 17,480 residents, consisting of 16,722 Muslims, 54 Jews and 701 Christians.|$|E

5|$|Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, {{there was}} a {{significant}} economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era were found to be in a poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E
5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population.</b> A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with a population between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a Third Class city. A municipality with a population between 5,000 and 10,000 people is a Second Class city. And a municipality with a population over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or Third Class city. Municipalities with a population of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or Third Class city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.|$|E

25|$|In {{the very}} late {{part of the}} period sankin-kōtai, the law {{requiring}} the daimyōs to maintain dwellings in the capital was repealed {{which resulted in a}} <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> in Edo and a commensurate reduction in income for the shogunate.|$|E
25|$|The inner beltway {{communities}} of Capitol Heights, District Heights, Forestville, Suitland and Seat Pleasant border the neighboring District of Columbia's northeastern and southeastern quadrants.

A high percentage of its residents are African American.|$|E
50|$|During the {{following}} century, the town <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> and quietly shifted from an urban to a rural center until the 1950s, when migration of Altoonans {{from the north}} began to {{increase the size of}} Newry and gave it a more suburban character.|$|R

25|$|According to the 2011 census, Brno had 385,913 inhabitants. The largest {{ethnic groups}} were Czechs (51.6%), Moravians (18.7%), Slovaks (1.5%), Ukrainians (0.9%), Vietnamese (0.4%), and Poles (0.2%). Brno {{experienced}} the largest increase in population during the 19th century {{at the time}} of the industrial revolution. A slight <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> after 1989 was caused by suburbanisation.|$|E
25|$|Later MPPNB {{populations in}} the Southern Levant were already {{witnessing}} severe changes in climate {{that would have been}} exacerbated by large population demands on local resources.

25|$|The primary fear {{stems from}} house cats {{that have become}} feral or {{partially}} feral, {{but there has been}} no monitoring of these interactions. Pressure from competition over food, contact with house cats that have contracted feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and other contagious diseases, as well as <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> due to hybridization are all important issues with the Iriomote cat.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} native to a {{tropical}} climate. It inhabits rivers and may also colonized reservoirs. It grows to 17 cm total length.

5000|$|The {{species is}} <b>decreasing</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> {{due to the}} {{pollution}} and changes in land management. Construction noise has disturbed <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> southern Spain; the <b>population</b> <b>in</b> Andalusia <b>decreased</b> from 30,000 to 14,000 between 1994 and 2002. [...] Herders in Syria and Turkey light fires at cave mouths for their livestock disturbing the bats.|$|R
5000|$|Later <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> led to {{a number}} of these parishes being {{combined}} in the 20th century.

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1980s, the city shifted its {{economic}} base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine and biotechnology. Although Huntington successfully shifted the focus of its economy and remains a viable city, the population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 86,353 people {{lived in the city}} proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence caused a sharp <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> to just 51,475 in 2000.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{suitable}} habitats for gopher tortoise is the longleaf pine ecosystem, which provides suitable well-drained and sandy soils for tortoises to inhabit. Longleaf pine forests include abundant low herbaceous plant growth and open canopy/space for tortoise’s eggs to incubate. Since European settlement, longleaf pine decreased in area by an estimated of 96%, which has contributed to an 80% <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> densities of gopher tortoise. This {{means that there is}} only 4% of longleaf pine remaining.|$|E
25|$|The city of Saginaw was a {{thriving}} lumber {{town in the}} 19th century and an important industrial city and manufacturing center {{throughout much of the}} 20th century. However, by the late 20th century, Saginaw's industry and its once-strong manufacturing presence declined, leading to increasing unemployment, crime, and a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population.</b> Neighboring communities, such as Saginaw Charter Township, saw subsequent population increases while the city itself is projected to return to normal population growth after the decades-long structural changes to the economy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species is}} {{currently}} considered {{an endangered species}} because of the huge <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> {{over the past three}} generations. This decrease has been caused by changes in its habitat. Illegal logging in national parks, very heavy recreational tourism, stream pollution and sedimentation, stream diversion, and the introduced predatory fishes, like trout, have all had negative impacts of the mountain stream salamander. These negative impacts have all led to the death of the mountain stream species, which then leads to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the <b>population.</b> Because of this, the species is now protected by the Mexican law under [...] "Special Protection"(Pr).|$|R
50|$|In England {{this species}} has on average <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> by 70% {{within the last}} 25 years, with the biggest declines in the southeast.

25|$|In general, Aklan is {{sufficient}} in meat and other livestock and poultry products, {{though in the}} inventory of livestock and poultry in the year 2000, hog and chicken had a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> from 114,890 heads of hogs and 886,597 heads of chickens in 1999 to 95,950 heads of hogs and 782,820 heads of chicken in the 2000. The decrease in production were attributed to the following factors: high cost of feeds, feed supplements and biologics; livestock and poultry diseases; increasing price of chicks; and, high cost of labor.|$|E
25|$|The historians had {{defined the}} Greek Dark Ages, {{a period of}} general decline, {{in this case the}} {{disappearance}} of the palace economy and with it law and order, loss of writing, diminishment of trade, <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> and abandonment of settlements (destroyed or undestroyed), metals starvation and loss of the fine arts or at least the diminution of their quality, evidenced especially in pottery. By its broadest definition the dark age lasted between 1200 and 750, the start of the archaic or orientalizing period, when influence from the Middle East via the overseas colonies stimulated a recovery.|$|E
25|$|The English {{government}} {{handled the}} crisis well, {{and the country}} did not experience the extreme reactions that were seen elsewhere in Europe. The most immediate consequence was {{a halt to the}} campaigns of the Hundred Years' War. In the long term, the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>population</b> caused a shortage of labour, with subsequent rise in wages, resisted by the landowners, which caused deep resentment among the lower classes. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was largely a result of this resentment, and even though the rebellion was suppressed, in the long term serfdom was ended in England. The Black Death also affected artistic and cultural efforts, and may have helped advance the use of the vernacular.|$|E
