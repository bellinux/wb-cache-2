40|$|A typical {{example of}} a batch {{processor}} is the <b>diffusion</b> <b>furnace</b> used in wafer fabrication facilities (otherwise known as wafer fabs). In diffusion, silicon wafers are placed inside the furnace, and dopant is flown through the wafers via nitrogen gas. The higher the temperature, the faster the dopant penetrates the wafer surface. Then, {{a thin layer of}} silicon dioxide is grown, to help the dopant diffuse into the silicon. This operation can take 10 hours or more to finish processing, as compared to one or two hours for other wafer fab operations, according to Uzsoy [8]. Diffusion furnaces typically can process six to eight lots concurrently; we call the lots processed concurrently a batch. The quantity of lots loaded into the furnace does not affect the processing time. Only lots that require the same chemical recipe and temperature may be batched together at the <b>diffusion</b> <b>furnace.</b> We wish to control the production of a manufacturing system, comprised of a serial processor feeding the batch processor. The system produces different job types, and each job can only be batched together with jobs of the same type.

We evaluate the performance of our manufacturing system under several simple control policies under a range of loading conditions and determine which control policies perform better under which conditions. It is hoped that the results obtained from this small system could be extended to larger systems involving a batch processor, with particular emphasis placed on the applicability of such policies in wafer fabrication.

To do this, we evaluate the throughput of an industrial low-pressure <b>diffusion</b> tube <b>furnace</b> in order to realize uniform emitters. The low-pressure tube furnace is designed to obtain emitter standard sheet resistances of about 60 Ω/sq and wafer uniformity less than 3 %.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} the recent {{progress}} of {{the evaluation of the}} multi Si PERCT technology in an industrial pilot production of the Chinese cell manufacturer Lu’an. Our technology is an alternative to the AlOx based PERC technology for improving multi-crystalline solar cell efficiencies above 18. 5 % and it is based on standard mass production equipment and wafer quality. An additional unique feature of this technology is the manufacture of bifacial multi-crystalline solar cells with screen-printed finger grid on the rear side instead of a full area Al-BSF. The PERCT cell architecture is based on a “passivated emitter rear totally diffused (PERT) ” cell design for p-type wafers. The totally diffused BSF is realized by a cost effective and short BBr 3 boron diffusion step in a standard <b>diffusion</b> tube <b>furnace</b> - prior to the back side passivation and protection by a PECVD SiNx. RCT's multi PERCT technology upgrade is currently evaluated in an industrial pilot line of a Chinese cell manufacturer.

Accordingly an efficiency gain of 0. 52 % absolute was demonstrated on standard multi-crystalline wafer material. A unique feature of the PERCT technology is the opportunity to prepare bifacial cells on multi-crystalline wafer material.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the conversion efficiencies of silicon solar cells, advanced cell structures with selectively doped areas have received increasing interest. There is a strong need to separate the contacted diffusion profiles from the noncontacted. On the one hand, a high dopant concentration in the contact regime reduces the series resistance losses mainly due to lowered contact resistance. Additionally, recombination is reduced by shielding the minority charge carriers from surface at the contact. On the other hand, a low dopant concentration in the noncontact regime reduces the recombination losses and optimizes the spectral response of the cell.

The fabricated n-type Cz-Si MWT solar cells achieved conversion efficiencies up to 17. 7 %. One of the main challenges for further development is to decrease the dark saturation current density j 02 and to increase the shunt resistance RShunt above the current value of about 1 kΩcm 2 The H-pattern reference cells also show similarly low RShunt as well as high j 02 values and reach conversion efficiencies up to 17. 1 %.
