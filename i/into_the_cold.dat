5|$|The neo-noir film genre {{developed}} mid-way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War. This cinematological trend reflected much of {{the cynicism}} {{and the possibility of}} nuclear annihilation of the era. This new genre introduced innovations that were not available with the earlier noir films. The violence was also more potent than in earlier noir films.|$|E
5|$|Turkey {{itself was}} in no {{condition}} {{to fight against the}} Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus and Soviet-occupied Iran were already assembling for an invasion of Turkey. However, as the hostility between the East and West developed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, especially after the issuing of the Truman Doctrine in 1947, Turkey strengthened its ties with the West. The Soviet Union relinquished its claims over the lost territories, understanding that the newly formed NATO would intervene on Turkey's side {{in the event of a}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, {{mostly because of}} its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material away from the continuing fighting at the Western front {{that could have been}} used, instead, to bolster the Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing him to win the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War.|$|E

5|$|He {{had also}} {{continued}} to play chess, competing in the 1952 and 1956 Olympiads. This 1956 Olympiad trip to Moscow was risky, since Britain and the USSR, which had been allies during World War II, were by then locked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, and Milner-Barry's wartime codebreaking knowledge would have been {{of great interest to}} the Soviets; the very fact that Britain had broken German codes on a massive scale was kept secret until 1974, when Frederick Winterbotham's book The Ultra Secret was published. He placed second in the British Chess Championship at Hastings 1953 (finishing behind only Daniel Yanofsky), with a score of 8/11; this would be his best result in British Championships.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and fled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} {{system on the}} tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path. A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.|$|E

5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown.

25|$|The triple {{differential}} {{was used}} primarily on war-time and post-war British tanks, {{first on the}} Churchill tank and later on the Cromwell tank and its follow-on designs. It gave these designs unparalleled maneuverability {{and the ability to}} climb that was not matched by other designs until well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War. The basic version continued to be used on British designs until the TN 10 of the Conqueror, while a modified version, the TN 12, was used on the Chieftain. This system is generally not used today, in favour of improved hydrodynamic transmissions in the double differential, starting with the transmission in the Challenger.|$|E
25|$|In gas {{turbines}} and auxiliary power units. Ref. Figures 4.1â€“4.2 In their simple form, modern {{gas turbines}} {{operate on the}} Brayton cycle. (ref Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and centrifugal compressors are used to provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include centrifugal compressors include turboshaft, turboprop, auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied {{to all of the}} centrifugal compressors used in aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> geometry as required for manufacturing. This need arises from the impeller's deflections experienced from start-up to full speed/full temperature which can be 100 times larger than the expected hot running clearance of the impeller.|$|E

30|$|Thermal {{molecular}} jiggling (spontaneous erase), {{photon absorption}} (photolysis), or bindings with other molecules can erase {{the information in}} a metastable chemical (Fig. 1). This latter process is common in metabolic reactions where the partial loss of previously stored chemical energy occurs. In all of these cases, chemical (or physical) potential energy dissipates into low-level thermal quantum information, which eventually diffuses out of <b>the</b> world and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>colder</b> universe as heat through an increase in entropy. The irradiation of the quantum â€˜ashâ€™ of <b>the</b> â€˜deadâ€™ information <b>into</b> <b>the</b> universe makes such information irrecoverably lost to the world.|$|R
50|$|A Field-tube boiler (also {{known as}} a bayonet tube)is a form of {{water-tube}} boiler where the water tubes are single-ended. The tubes are closed at one end, and they contain a concentric inner tube. Flow is thus separated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>colder</b> inner flow down the tube and the heated flow upwards through the outer sleeve. As Field tubes are thus dependent on thermo-syphon flow within the tube, they must thus always have some vertical height to encourage the flow. In most designs they are mounted near-vertically, to encourage this.|$|R

500|$|In the {{northern}} hemisphere, once a cyclone occludes, a trough of warm air aloftâ€”or [...] "trowal" [...] for shortâ€”will {{be caused by}} strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately into its northwestern periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature.
