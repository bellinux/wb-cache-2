However, despite much in vitro success, there has been limited achievement in cellular applications potentially due to target accessibility.|$|R
40|$|We have reconstituted {{a highly}} {{purified}} RNA polymerase II transcription system containing chromatin templates assembled with purified histones and assembly factors, the histone acetyltransferase p 300, and {{components of the}} general transcription machinery that, by themselves, suffice for activated transcription (initiation and <b>elongation)</b> <b>on</b> DNA templates. We show that this system mediates activator-dependent initiation, but not productive <b>elongation,</b> <b>on</b> chromatin templates. We further report the purification of a chromatin transcription-enabling activity (CTEA) that, in a manner dependent upon p 300 and acetyl-CoA, strongly potentiates transcription elongation through several contiguous nucleosomes as must occur in vivo. The transcription elongation factor SII is {{a major component of}} CTEA and strongly synergizes with p 300 (histone acetylation) at a step subsequent to preinitiation complex formation. The purification of CTEA also identified HMGB 2 as a coactivator that, while inactive on its own, enhances SII and p 300 functions...|$|R
