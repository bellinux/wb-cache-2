5|$|Coronel was {{replaced}} by session musician Ron Leejack, and the group continued their efforts to finish the album. Some songs were completely re-recorded to accommodate Leejack's different playing style. The entire recording process, which followed a haphazard schedule, took nearly a year to complete. When the completed album was presented to Don Ellis, Epic's A director, he stated that <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> album and {{was not going to}} release it. The next day, Wicked Lester manager Lew Linet requested and received the group's release from Epic Records.|$|E

In 1942, Night Flight was pulled from {{circulation}} when MGM's agreement with Saint Exupéry expired.|$|E
25|$|Upset, Midas {{strove to}} divest himself {{of his power}} (the Midas Touch); <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be {{delivered}} from starvation. Dionysus heard and consented; he told Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. He did so, and when he touched the waters the power passed into them, and the river sands changed into gold. This was an etiological myth that explained why the sands of the Pactolus were rich in gold.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, he had {{directed}} {{about two-thirds of}} Zombi 3 in the Philippines before having to return abruptly to Italy due to a second bout of hepatitis. The film was finished by an un-credited Bruno Mattei. Fulci later said that <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> finished product and tried unsuccessfully to get his name removed from the credits.

25|$|From {{the outset}} his mother {{encouraged}} him {{to pursue a career}} in the army. At the age of 13 Durnford-Slater was sent to Wellington, a school with a long army tradition. Nevertheless, as a teenager Durnford-Slater professed that he had no desire to pursue a military career, indeed, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> training that he was required to undertake as part of the Officer Training Corps having difficulty learning drill and constantly drawing the ire of instructors for the poor state of his uniform.|$|E
25|$|After university, Dyke {{followed}} {{his first wife}} to Newcastle. He had become disillusioned with newspaper journalism, and tried for {{a job as a}} junior reporter at BBC Radio Teesside. He was unsuccessful, apparently because the interviewers felt no-one would understand his accent. Dyke instead found work covering rural affairs for the Newcastle Journal. He moved back to London with Christine in 1974 to become campaign officer for the Wandsworth Community Relations Council. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> job and left to campaign to be elected GLC councillor for Putney. Again he was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Harvey and Bryant's {{father were}} now dead, {{and he became}} {{increasingly}} lonely. From 1993 to late 1995, he visited various overseas countries fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> destinations he travelled to, as he found that people there avoided him {{just as they did}} in Tasmania. However, he enjoyed the flights, as he could speak to the people sitting adjacent to him who {{had no choice but to}} be polite. Bryant later took great joy in describing some of the more successful conversations he had with fellow passengers.|$|E

After he sent talent scout Henry Willson a picture of himself in 1947, Willson took Hudson on as a client and changed his name to Rock Hudson, although Hudson later admitted <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> name.

However, once the {{determined}} Tiger Mask recovered, he regained his NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi on June 2, 1983, making him a simultaneous NWA/WWF Jr. champion for the second time. By 1983, however, Sayama started feeling dissatisfied as <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> politics behind-the-scenes. As a result, he announced his retirement from active competition on August 12, 1983. It was a shock to the wrestling world, as Tiger Mask was going to retire while he {{was at the top of}} his game and as the holder of two Junior Heavyweight Championships. Both titles were declared vacant, as he became a trainer to martial arts fighters.|$|E

[...] In Buffalo, he would become known for his love of reading a broad range of books including those by Henry Thoreau, which led to chidings from Saban.|$|E
500|$|In post-production, Justman {{recommended}} {{adding an}} opening narration. Roddenberry agreed and wrote new lines for a Captain's log. Alexander Courage recorded {{the music for}} this episode on August 19, {{the same day as}} the [...] "Theme from Star Trek", using a 25-piece orchestra. While Roddenberry liked the theme, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> music created specifically for [...] "The Man Trap". Optical effects work was quicker than usual; Howard A.

500|$|Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht, an {{interrogator}} for the Gestapo and Jones' nemesis, {{who tries}} to torture Marion Ravenwood for the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. He is killed by the Ark's supernatural powers. Lacey was cast as he reminded Spielberg of Peter Lorre. Spielberg had originally offered the role to Roman Polanski, who was intrigued at {{the opportunity to work}} with Spielberg but decided to turn down the role because he wouldn't {{be able to make the}} trip to Tunisia. Klaus Kinski was also offered the role, but <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> script, calling it [...] "moronically shitty".

500|$|During a 20-year playing career, Bradman {{consistently}} {{scored at}} a level that made him, in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull, [...] "worth three batsmen to Australia". A controversial set of tactics, known as Bodyline, was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring. As a captain and administrator, Bradman was committed to attacking, entertaining cricket; he drew spectators in record numbers. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> constant adulation, however, and it affected how he dealt with others. The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some teammates, administrators and journalists, who thought him aloof and wary. Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War, he made a dramatic comeback, captaining an Australian team known as [...] "The Invincibles" [...] on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England.|$|E
500|$|As {{the format}} of Inside No. 9 {{requires}} new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors {{who may have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to the writers, [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] starred Gemma Arterton and Conleth Hill. The flat in which the episode was filmed, with its boardgames and [...] "misery", was, for Shearsmith, similar to the flat once shared by the writers. The episode was filmed in winter, and Pemberton described a [...] "grim" [...] atmosphere during filming. He also said that <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> wig and beard he wore to play Migg, which irritated his skin. David Chater, writing in The Times, said that the hair meant Migg [...] "has an eerie resemblance to the Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz - only not nearly as benign".|$|E
