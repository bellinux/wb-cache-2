5|$|Although his Test {{career had}} finished, Loxton {{continued}} to play for his state. He had another disappointing season with the bat in 1951–52, scoring only 322 runs at 24.76 in nine matches. After winning the opening match of the season against Western Australia, he did not taste victory again until the final fixture of the summer against South Australia, in which he scored 71—his only fifty of the season—and took a total of 4/37 in an innings victory. Victoria lost three times and would have suffered a fourth defeat but for Loxton’s unbeaten 41 against Queensland, which helped them to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a draw with one wicket intact. He continued to take regular wickets, ending with 21 scalps at 31.00 for the season, including an innings best of 4/56, but he managed a total of only 4/249 against New South Wales, {{who went on to}} win the competition.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{in the three}} representative matches against India. Hassett made 53 in the first match in Mumbai, and although the Australians took a 192-run first innings lead, the hosts managed to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a draw. The second match in Calcutta was an evenly-contested draw, before India won the deciding match. Hassett top-scored with 143 in Australia’s 339, but the hosts took a first innings lead of 186 {{to set up a}} six-wicket win. Hassett ended with 235 runs at 47.00 in the three international matches, but did not taste victory in any of his seven matches on Indian soil. He scored 57 as Australia defeated Ceylon by an innings in Colombo before returning to Australia mid December. As time had passed, the players had become increasingly tired by the long campaign, and morale began to drop as waited for their return to their families and civilian life.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Australia, {{he had a}} {{moderately}} successful Sheffield Shield season, accumulating 376runs at 31.33 with three half-centuries. New South Wales {{went on to win}} another title. The selectors named him to lead an Australian Second XI to New Zealand—while the first choice team toured the Indian subcontinent—hoping that he was still good enough to secure a long-term future in the Australian team. The four matches against New Zealand were closely contested. In the first match, Australia were 7/201 in pursuit of 22 for victory when time ran out. In the second fixture, Craig made 70 as the tourists struggled to 8/211 in pursuit of 262 for victory to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a draw. After narrowly escaping defeat in the first two matches, Australia won the third match by eight wickets. In the final match, Australia reduced New Zealand to 8/149 in pursuit of 284 when time ran out, sealing a 1–0 series win. Craig struggled with the bat, making 222 runs at 27.75 in the games against New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|On December 18, 2013, {{in a game}} at the Milwaukee Bucks, with 20 seconds {{remaining}} in overtime where the Knicks held a two-point lead, Bargnani received an offensive rebound and, instead of dribbling out the clock or getting fouled {{to go to the}} free throw line, inexplicably shot a three-pointer that missed. The game went into double overtime as a result, where the Knicks outscored the Bucks 13–7 to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a 107–101 win.|$|E
25|$|On {{the final}} morning, England batted {{steadily}} and their Test openers Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook took the score to 52 before leg spinner Cec Pepper removed both. Jack Robertson top-scored with 84 and his Middlesex teammate Edrich scored 50 as England moved to 5/286 {{late in the}} day, an overall lead of 98. It appeared that England {{would be able to}} <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a draw, but they lost their last five wickets for eight runs to be all out for 294. Pepper took 4/80 and Ellis and Price two wickets each.|$|E
25|$|In a semi-final of the Duleep Trophy in 1974–75, {{after the}} first two days had been washed out, Salgaonkar {{destroyed}} the East Zone batting, taking 6 for 39 and dismissing East Zone for 83. East Zone just managed to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a draw. He played without notable success for Rest of India against Karnataka in the Irani Cup, and then, in his last match for West Zone, he took three expensive wickets against the touring West Indies cricket team, dismissing Alvin Kallicharran twice. In a Ranji Trophy match in 1974–75 at Nasik he bowled a ball that broke Sunil Gavaskar's finger.|$|E

50|$|In {{what may}} have been the most talked about game all pre-season, the Florida Gators and Tennessee Volunteers met in Gainesville, Florida.

25|$|For {{the second}} {{straight}} game West Virginia made a double-digit second-half lead interesting by coughing up the football. And for {{the second straight}} game the Mountaineers were able to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a victory by defeating No. 21 Cincinnati 28–23 to keep its Big East title hopes alive. Pat White finished the game with 295 yards of total offense, rushing 27 times for 155 yards and two touchdowns and completing 13 of 19 passes for 140 yards. Sophomore safety Boogie Allen recovered a Cincinnati onside kick to save the Mountaineers' win. The team wore white jerseys and blue pants.|$|E
25|$|In Dubai, Sunline {{showed her}} {{customary}} pace {{to lead the}} field in the Duty Free (1,800 metres), but her breakaway tactics were not aided by a home straight of 600 metres. Jim And Tonic (a French globetrotter) and Fairy King Prawn loomed up to Sunline with 200 metres to run, and, after a tough run, she did well to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> third. Sunline returned to Australia to contest the All Aged Stakes against a sub-standard field, on a wet track at Randwick. Starting a hot favourite, Sunline was inexplicably - although narrowly - beaten by El Mirada and Final Fantasy, and immediately spelled.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Jews {{had become}} {{embroiled in a}} civil war of their own, {{splitting}} the resistance in Jerusalem between several factions. The Sicarii led by Menahem ben Judah could <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> long; the Zealots led by Eleazar ben Simon eventually fell under the command of the Galilean leader John of Gush Halav; and the other northern rebel commander, Simon Bar Giora, managed to gain leadership over the Idumeans. Titus besieged Jerusalem. The Roman army was joined by the Twelfth Legion, which was previously defeated under Cestius Gallus, and from Alexandria Vespasian sent Tiberius Julius Alexander, governor of Egypt, to act as Titus' second in command.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} {{managed to}} <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> nine days, {{until it was}} decided to withdraw back across the Rhine by rafts and boats. At 10:00 on the last day, the Germans launched an assault with infantry and tanks on the south-east portion of the perimeter. The assault penetrated the perimeter and threatened to cut off the division from the river. British counter-attacks, supported by artillery fire from south of the river, stopped the German assault. To prevent the Germans learning about the evacuation, the plan was kept secret until the afternoon, and some men (mainly wounded) remained behind to give covering fire through the night. By 05:00, 2,163 men had been rescued and the evacuation was ended.|$|E
25|$|Surrey lost wickets {{regularly}} in the reply on day two, Scott Newman resisting with 40, but by stumps on day two they were 93 for 3 - rain having limited the day's play to 40 overs, yet a result looked very probable. However, day three was rained off, and an unbeaten century from Rikki Clarke sent Surrey into a good position at 292 for 6, where they declared to leave Nottinghamshire 203 runs from 40 overs. Nottinghamshire made a good attempt at chasing it, but lost five wickets quickly for 90 runs to Azhar Mahmood and Mohammad Akram. David Alleyne and Mark Ealham dug in before two quick wickets fell, but Ryan Sidebottom shut up shop with Smith to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the draw.|$|E
25|$|England {{won their}} first match, a 20–2 victory over France in Leeds in March. In June the Lions {{suffered}} their first defeat in just their second match of the tournament, losing 12–7 against a strong Wales side in Brisbane. A little later England managed to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a draw against Australia in Sydney, {{the final score}} being 10–10. And they also picked up a point in Auckland, drawing 17–17 against New Zealand. At the end of October, after the domestic season had finished, England beat the Welsh 22–16 in Warrington and then crossed the English Channel to thrash a French side 48–2 in Bordeaux. Bradford played host the England versus New Zealand match, in which England won comfortably 27–12.|$|E

With about 11 minutes to go, Jeff Garcia {{returned}} to the game, hoping to spark Tampa Bay's offense, and <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the win. He was unable to do much against the Redskins' well-rested and fired up defense, however, and Tampa Bay ended up having to punt. Josh Bidwell pinned the Redskins at their own 9-yard line, and Campbell drove them to the Tampa Bay 32-yard line. Ronde Barber stopped the threat when he intercepted the ball at the 28-yard line. With {{less than a minute}} to go, Campbell drove the Redskins to the Tampa Bay 16-yard line, but Brian Kelly intercepted the pass in the end zone with 17 seconds remaining, to clinch the victory for the Buccaneers.|$|E
25|$|Bragg {{responded to}} a request by Stevenson for {{reinforcements}} by sending Col. J.T. Holtzclaw's brigade {{under the condition that}} it be used only to cover a Confederate withdrawal from Lookout Mountain, ordering Stevenson at 2:30p.m. to withdraw to the east side of Chattanooga Creek. Stevenson was reluctant to break contact until his troops on the summit could escape on the Summertown Road into the Chattanooga Valley. The brigades of Walthall, Pettus, and Moore were ordered to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the afternoon. For hours through the afternoon and into the night, the six Alabama regiments under Pettus and Moore fought sporadically with the Union troops through dense fog, neither side able to see more than a few dozen yards ahead nor make any progress in either direction.|$|E
25|$|The four parties, {{supported}} by some Social Democrats who had remained in Berlin, offered fresh elections, a cabinet reshuffle and an amnesty {{for all participants}} in the putsch, if Kapp and Lüttwitz were to resign.

They suggested to Schiffer, {{in the absence of}} Ebert in charge of the government's affairs, that he appoint Seeckt as head of the Reichswehr, which Schiffer did in the name of Ebert. When Lüttwitz offered his resignation on 18 March, Schiffer accepted—again in Ebert's name—while granting him full pension rights. Schiffer also suggested Pabst and Lüttwitz should leave the country, until the National Assembly had decided on the question of an amnesty and even offered them false passports and money.|$|E

25|$|On Wednesday, 27 August, the Australians {{were at the}} Clifton College Close Ground and {{its strong}} {{associations}} with W. G.

This was another two-day match and another drawn two-day match, but it was Gloucestershire, not the AIF, who were cheated of time in this one. They won the toss and batted, scoring 281 (Charlie Townsend 63, Alf Dipper 61) and then reduced the AIF to 104 for six at close of play. On the second morning, the AIF were all out for 147 and asked to follow on. Gloucestershire's great left arm spinner Charlie Parker did the damage with seven for 70. In the second innings, the Australians were struggling against the medium pace of Dipper, bowling in tandem with Parker, but thanks to a determined effort by Bill Trenerry they managed to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the draw.|$|E

Gan Ning hurriedly {{requested}} for reinforcements, but the generals did not have enough men to spare to save him and believed it was not sagacious to send reinforcements because that would dilute the main army.
