5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes <b>it</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of the stomach and {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so <b>it</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E

5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to Î²-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: <b>it</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization {{and in the next}} step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E

5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. <b>It</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> a coenzyme in redox reactions, {{as a donor}} of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E

The library was opened in 1925, extended into the college's wine cellar in 1997, and now contains over 10,000 books. <b>It</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> a support to the central university library, providing access to core textbooks.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} a fast tissue {{and might be}} in {{supersaturated}} state in the early phase of decompression. <b>It</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> a gas reservoir and feeds any local bubble which will grow.

5|$|The {{preferred}} habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, {{and include}} evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense canopies.

It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip {{to the base of the}} crown); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, <b>it</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.|$|E

5|$|West of Lockport, NY31 crosses NY270 and NY93. Continuing {{into the}} city, NY31 meets NY78 (Transit Street) at an {{intersection}} partially located over the Erie Canal. NY31 heads eastward through Lockport, intersecting the northern terminus of NY77 {{at the eastern}} edge of the city. While NY77 continues along the right-of-way of NY31, NY31 exits, following a northeasterly alignment through Gasport to Middleport, where <b>it</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> the western and southern terminus of NY31E and NY271, respectively.

A similar format is used in Kings Island and Kings Dominion theme parks, albeit with a replica of the Eiffel Tower at the end in both parks. In each instance, the International Street section was created while the park was owned by Kings Entertainment Company, then transferred to Paramount Parks, and finally to the current owners, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, <b>it</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E

After one more intersection, I-680 exits Santa Clara County and enters Alameda County.|$|E
5|$|BS Fire Emblem: Archanea Senki-hen, {{commonly}} referred to as BS Fire Emblem, is an episodic tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and released in 1997 following the release of Genealogy of the Holy War. <b>It</b> <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> a prequel to the events of the first Fire Emblem title and Mystery of the Emblem. The four episodes of BS Fire Emblem were broadcast between September and October 1997 on the Satellaview peripheral service, a system where short games were downloaded via satellite at given times of day. While it employs the same tactical gameplay as the mainline titles, it throws waves of enemies at the main party during a three-hour time limit. BS Fire Emblem was directed and designed by Kaga, while the music was composed by Tsujiyoko in her role as composer and sound director. The character artwork was done by Rika Suzuki, a newcomer to the Fire Emblem series who would later go on to create character illustrations for Fire Emblem Awakening. It was the first title in the Fire Emblem series to include voice acting, created using livestreaming during the original broadcast. The game used the technology created for Mystery of the Emblem.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} Burger King's franchises have {{banded together to}} form the Burger King National Franchise Association (BKNFA or NFA).

In 2001, the group announced a plan to purchase Burger King from then-parent Diageo after the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. The NFA believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands. The deal collapsed when the NFA was unable to put together an acceptable financing package.|$|E
