5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to <b>his</b> <b>report,</b> mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel.
