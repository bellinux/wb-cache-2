5|$|A {{statement}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and {{a detailed}} White Paper {{was published in}} December. In November 1960 a Bill based on that report was introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords, where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (particularly at the Committee stage) owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered {{a job as a}} Law Lord. After a period of contemplation (he worried that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary and the Bar approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court. During his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. During his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords Denning frequently expressed dissenting opinions. Denning did not enjoy his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords and clashed frequently with Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge. Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 {{majority}} in the state Senate and a 61–39 majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> The pro-Relief majority in the state Senate subsequently elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate, which had the inadvertent effect of weakening the faction's cause <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E

In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E
