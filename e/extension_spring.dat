The most common causes of injury from garage door systems include falling doors, pinch points, improperly adjusted opener force settings and safety eyes, attempts at do-it-yourself repair without the proper knowledge or tools, and uncontrolled release of spring tension (on <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> systems).|$|E
5000|$|An <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> {{counterbalance}} system {{consists of}} a pair of stretched springs running parallel to the horizontal tracks. The springs lift the door through a system of pulleys and counterbalance cables running from the bottom corner brackets through the pulleys. When the door is raised, the springs contract, thus lifting the door as the tension is released. Typically these springs are made of 11 gauge galvanized steel, and the lengths of these springs are based on the height of the garage door in question. Their lifting weight capacity can best be identified by the color that is painted on the ends of the springs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extension</b> garter <b>springs</b> {{are on the}} {{opposite}} side of the spring spectrum. Although they are also a type of coiled <b>spring,</b> <b>extension</b> garter <b>springs</b> exert inward radial forces that move toward the center. <b>Extension</b> <b>springs</b> store potential energy in their extended form and want to contract. Thinner wire and a greater number of coils allow <b>extension</b> <b>springs</b> to be able to contract quickly, which is essential when dealing with pressurized fluids and gases. <b>Extension</b> garter <b>springs</b> act against forces from the center, so they may be placed on the outside of a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape. They act similar to a bracelet, which is extended to fit around the hand and then snaps back into shape on the wrist. <b>Extension</b> garter <b>springs</b> are more common than compression garter springs because they use less material (smaller circumference and thinner wire) and they respond to changes quicker and more efficiently.|$|R

This thesis investigates the energy absorption of a multi-body system impacted by a suddenly contracting pretensioned helical <b>extension</b> <b>spring.</b> The system {{consists of a}} helical <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> and other common components used in a consumer application. Impact tests were performed on the system with varying input energies; resulting damage included plastic and brittle failure. Impact tests were also performed on individual components from the system to characterize {{the amount of energy}} each component absorbed given a specific energy input. Component models were created by carrying out regression analysis on the results from each of the components, including the helical <b>extension</b> <b>spring.</b> Through inverse prediction, component models were used to determine the amount of energy each component absorbed during system tests. System models were created, estimating the amount of energy transfered from the helical <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> to each of the components in the system. Further analysis of the data from a prior study on the energy absorption of helical extension springs was also conducted. The energy absorption models developed in this thesis provide an understanding of the energy being absorbed in the system due to an impact event. The system models predicted energy absorption between 88 and 120 percent of the initial potential energy stored in the helical <b>extension</b> <b>spring.</b> Energy absorptions of over 100 percent indicate that the component models have over-predicted the amount of energy actually absorbed. The helical <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> was found to absorb between 37 and 68 percent of its own potential energy during coil impact...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The static {{balancing}} {{of the weight}} forces is necessary to any mechanical system which is not working in horizontal plane. The effect is the decrease (until to vanishing) of the acting power. From practical point of view two main ways of {{static balancing}} could be taken into consideration: by mass redistribution of components or/and by adding counterweights, and by elastic forces of the springs or of the gases. The first solution is not always possible due to the dimensions of mechanical systems and due to increasing of the dynamic stresses of components. Second solution {{is more and more}} used to various mechanical systems. The complexity of balancing systems with springs comes from the need of using zero-free length springs. In any case the mathematical model has not a unique solution. Present paper is an extension of a paper of first author [1] and is presenting a method to find the optimum solution of the simplest elastic system which is using a real helical <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> with finite-free length. Design variables are the position of springâ€™s joints, as well as the constructional parameters of a <b>extension</b> <b>spring.</b> Finally some examples are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} study {{which deals with}} the weight {{reduction}} for tensile <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> by changing the solid spring to hollow one. The springs which are generally used are in solid form due to which the weight of entire body in which the spring is attached gets increased. The forces which can be act on spring may be linear push or linear pull or radial type. This spring deflect by pulling and regain its shape when pulling is neglect. The weight of tensile spring is reduced by changing crossection of tensile spring from solid to hollow crossection and keeping all the other parameters same. For this research, Modeling of hollow and solid tensile spring has been done {{with the help of}} CREO 2. 0. The analytical part of hollow and solid coil spring has been done on HYPERMESH 13. We conclude the results for two different material viz. SS 304 and ASTM A 231 and found that the percentage of change in the stresses while comparing the solid spring to the hollow spring for both materials are acceptable. So it is possible to use hollow <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> in place of solid one, which reduce the weight of the spring and also by which we can reduce the material usage required for manufacturing the spring and the overall cost as wel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the ways}} of {{employing}} energy storage devices in hybrid powered orthoses have been discussed. Since these devices have many unrivalled advantages, they are environmentally safe, they store kinetic energy as potential energy and release it when it is needed {{and they do not}} need external power supply. In this paper an energy storage device (linear <b>extension</b> <b>spring)</b> has been implemented in FES-cycling, the efficiency has been calculated for different spring positions and different spring constants. It was clear that FES-cycling efficiency increases when the spring constant increases, then the pedal, spring and the overall powers were calculated, and it appears that by leaning the spring position the overall power will be always positive, and the spring absorbs the exceeded pedal energy and releases it when the pedal power is negative. This study highlights the importance of using energy storage devices to improve FES-cycling performance, which has been proven that such improvement is highly related to the mechanical design of the bicycle...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{elaborate}} design optimization technique of coil spring sets with genetic algorithm. Attention is focused on reducing the weight and stresses keeping into considerations the various critical points. The spring is designed to operate with tension load, so the spring stretches as the load is applied to it. The aim of the present work is to design the <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> for various material like steel, stainless steel, music wire (High carbon steel), oil Tempered (High carbon steel) for same loading condition, since each material has different compositions and properties. Optimization of spring helps in selecting most appropriate and cost effective material for spring. On applying the GA, the optimum parameter of spring have been obtained, which contribute towards achieving the minimum weight. A reduction of 7 % weight is achieved when stainless steel spring is replaced with other spring stated here, under identical condition of design parameters and optimization.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we {{investigate}} a modified pseudo-rigid-body (MPRB) modeling approach for compliant mechanisms with fixed-guided beam flexures {{by considering the}} nonlinear effects of center-shifting and load-stiffening. In particular, a fixed-guided compliant beam is modeled {{as a pair of}} fixed-free compliant beams jointed at the inflection point, where each fixed-free beam flexure is further modeled by a rigid link connected with an <b>extension</b> <b>spring</b> by a torsion spring, based on the beam constraint model (BCM). Meanwhile, the characteristic parameters of the proposed MPRB model are no longer constant values, but affected by the applied general tip load, especially the axial force. The developed MPRB modeling method is then applied to the analysis of three common compliant mechanisms (i. e. compound parallelogram mechanisms, bistable mechanisms and 1 -DOF translational mechanisms), which is further verified by the finite element analysis (FEA) results. The proposed MPRB model provides a more accurate method to predict the performance characteristics such as deformation capability, stiffness variation, as well as error motions of complaint mechanisms with fixed-guided beam flexures, and offers a new look into the design and optimization of beam-based compliant mechanisms...|$|E

Each instrument shares the same basic principle of operation involving the use of a closed coil helical <b>extension</b> <b>spring,</b> which is partly filled with the test powder. Particle size distribution data is obtained by stretching the spring to known lengths and measuring the mass of the discharged particles from the springâ€™s coils. In the case of the Handheld SPS, aimed at on the spot quality control applications, the test particles are discharged from the spring using manual shaking. In the case of the PSPS on the other hand, the particles are discharged using pulsating pressurised air. The design, development and evaluation of two methods for the in-situ measurement of the sample mass within the PSPS are discussed. These include a full-bridge strain gauge assembly and the investigation of the correlation between the minimum fluidisation velocity and the mass of the test sample within the spring. The strain gauge proved to be a successful method producing a mass resolution of Â± 1...|$|E

50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf <b>springs,</b> <b>extension</b> <b>springs,</b> and {{compression}} springs. The most widely used application are for engine valve springs (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue.

In aftermarket high performance valve spring applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications.
