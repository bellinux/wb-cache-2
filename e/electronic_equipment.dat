The volcano's remoteness limits opportunities for its study, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory relies heavily on satellites for monitoring.

5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score.

Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the <b>electronic</b> <b>equipment</b> that Horner required.|$|E

In this context, the paper aims to tackle the role of consumer behaviour in e-waste management system in Romania. In this sense, the paper is structured into three sections. The first section of the paper is devoted to the interdisciplinary literature review on attitude and behaviour towards environment, especially regarding the waste problem.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} Wireless {{security}} system for <b>electronic</b> <b>equipments</b> using inertial MEMS sensor which is implemented using an embedded microcontroller. Equipment security is an emerging field in the today’s electronic world. Securing sensitive <b>electronic</b> <b>equipments</b> and expensive equipments have become vital these days due to increased number of thefts. Especially when the sensitive equipment is stored and accessed via networked environment, considerable attention {{must be taken to}} ensure equipments are not accessed by unauthorized users. To safeguard the equipments, an intelligent system can be designed using microcontroller along with a MEMS sensor to detect the physical displacement of the equipment. By getting an external interrupt when unauthorized person try to access the device the system would alarm and will alert the owners to detect the theft. Since this system is useful to detect and avoid thefts, it is also called as Anti theft system. In this paper we have proposed a method using MEMS sensor and a micro controller for protecting <b>electronic</b> <b>equipments</b> (which are operating from remote locations) from the intruder and transfer the message instantaneously to the authorised person. 1...|$|R
