5|$|Chirocephalus diaphanus is a Mediterranean species, which {{reaches its}} {{north-western}} limit in Great Britain, and {{is missing from}} <b>Fennoscandia.</b> Its distribution in Western Europe extends almost continuously from Great Britain to the Iberian Peninsula, and as far east as the Rhine in Germany. A single occurrence of C. diaphanus is known from the Benelux countries, in pools in South Limburg, Netherlands. Further east, it occurs south of 47°N in the Apennine and Balkan peninsulas, reaching the Black Sea in Romania; an isolated population exists {{at the mouth of}} the Vistula river in Poland. In the Mediterranean Sea, populations exist on Sicily and Crete.|$|E
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} Caspian Sea region in the east, and reach north to central <b>Fennoscandia.</b> Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern crested newt and the marbled newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|The German army {{attacked}} Russia on 18 February. The offensive {{led to a}} rapid {{collapse and}} retreat of the Russian troops and to signature of the first Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the Bolsheviks on 3 March 1918. Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine were transferred to the German power sphere. The Civil War of the Finns opened an easy access with low costs to <b>Fennoscandia,</b> where the geopolitical status altered as a British Naval squadron invaded the harbour of Murmansk on the northwestern coast of Russia by the Arctic Ocean on 9 March 1918. General Erich Ludendorff wanted both to chain Petrograd through Narva - Viipuri and German-led monarchy for Finland.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} partly migratory, northernmost populations deserting their {{breeding}} areas in winter. Birds winter in Europe and Asia {{south of the}} breeding range. Birds in northern <b>Fennoscandia</b> and Russia vacate their territories between late August and early November, with most leaving in late September to mid-October as the first cold weather arrives. Adverse conditions may lead to disorientation, large numbers gathering on ships on overcast or wet nights. Large influxes include 15,000 birds on the Isle of May in October 1982, and nearly 21,000 birds through a single site in Latvia during September and October 1983. Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe. The spring passage is much lighter than in autumn, suggesting high mortality on migration.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tree}} sparrow has been {{expanding}} its range in <b>Fennoscandia</b> and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E
25|$|The area {{traditionally}} {{inhabited by}} the Sami people {{is known in}} Northern Sami as Sápmi, and typically includes the northern parts of <b>Fennoscandia.</b> Previously the Sami have probably inhabited areas further south in <b>Fennoscandia.</b> A few Stone Age cultures in the area have been speculated {{to be associated with}} the ancestors of the Sami.|$|E

25|$|Having lived {{side-by-side}} with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's {{animals and}} plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man.

25|$|Archeological {{evidence}} suggests that people along the southern shores of Lake Onega and around Lake Ladoga reached the River Utsjoki in Northern Finnish Lapland before 8100 BC. However, these people did not speak sami. According to the comparative linguist Ante Aikio, the Sami proto-language developed in South Finland or in Karelia around 2000–2500 years ago, spreading then to northern <b>Fennoscandia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{the last}} ice age, parts of the Norwegian coast line became free of ice in about 11,000 BC, which coincides with the {{formation}} of the Salpausselkä I ridge system in Finland. But it was not until around 7000 BC that all of <b>Fennoscandia</b> was free of ice. The land mass had been pressed downwards by the weight of the ice and was still partially under water.|$|E
25|$|The term {{is often}} defined {{according}} to the conventions of the cultures that lay claim to the term in their own use. When a speaker wants to explicitly include Finland alongside Scandinavia-proper, the geographic terms Fenno-Scandinavia or <b>Fennoscandia</b> are sometimes used in English, although these terms are hardly if at all used within Scandinavia. More precisely, and subject to no dispute, is that Finland {{is included in the}} broader term 'Nordic countries'.|$|E
25|$|While {{the term}} Scandinavia is {{commonly}} used for Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the term the Nordic countries is used unambiguously for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). Scandinavia can thus be considered {{a subset of the}} Nordic countries. Furthermore, the term <b>Fennoscandia</b> refers to Scandinavia, Finland and Karelia, excluding Denmark and overseas territories; however, the usage of this term is restricted to geology, when speaking of the Fennoscandian Shield (Baltic Shield).|$|E
25|$|Kvenland, {{known as}} Cwenland, Kænland and similar terms in medieval sources, {{is an ancient}} name for an area in Scandinavia and <b>Fennoscandia.</b> A {{contemporary}} reference to Kvenland is provided in an Old English account written in the 9th century. It used the {{information provided by the}} Norwegian adventurer and traveller named Ohthere. Kvenland, in that or close to that spelling, is also known from Nordic sources, primarily Icelandic, but also one that was possibly written in the modern-day area of Norway.|$|E
25|$|Wolverines inhabiting the Old World (specifically, <b>Fennoscandia)</b> hunt more {{actively}} than their North American relatives. This {{may be because}} competing predator populations in Eurasia are not as dense, making it more practical for the wolverine to hunt for itself than to wait for another animal to make a kill {{and then try to}} snatch it. They often feed on carrion left by wolves, so changes in wolf populations may affect the population of wolverines. They are also known on occasion to eat plant material.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} of {{interest}} to entomologists due to the variety of subspecies, often only restricted to a specific valley in the Alps. The beautiful Apollo butterfly has long been prized by collectors, who aim to possess {{as many of the}} variants as possible. While over-collecting is believed to have caused populations to decline in some areas, such as in Spain and Italy, habitat change is thought to be a far more significant threat to this species' survival. Plantations of conifers, the succession of suitable habitat to scrubland, agriculture, and urbanization have all reduced the habitat of the Apollo butterfly. Climate change and acid rain have also been implicated in this species decline in <b>Fennoscandia.</b> In addition, motor vehicles have been cited as a cause of Apollo butterfly mortalities; vehicles on a motorway system near Bolzano in South Tyrol, Italy, are said to have nearly wiped out a race of the Apollo.|$|E
25|$|The gross {{geography}} of Scania reflect more the preglacial development than the erosion and deposits {{caused by the}} Quaternary glaciers. In Swedish the word ås commonly refer to eskers but major landmarks in Scania like the Söderåsen are horsts formed by inversion tectonic activity along the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone in the late Cretaceous. The Scanian horsts run in a north-west to south-east direction, marking the southwest border of <b>Fennoscandia.</b> Tectonic activity of the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone during the break-up of Pangaea in the Jurassic and Cretaceous epochs {{led to the formation}} of hundreds of small volcanoes in central Scania. Remnants of the volcanoes are still visible today. Paralell with volcanism a hilly peneplain formed in northeastern Scania due to weathering and erosion of the basement rocks. The kaolinite formed by this weathering can be observed at Ivö Klack. In the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous a sea level rise led to the complete drowning of Scania. Subsequently marine sediments burried old surfaces preserving the rocky shores and hilly terrain of the day.|$|E
25|$|The moose (North America) or elk (Eurasia), Alces alces, is {{the largest}} extant species in the deer {{biological}} family. Moose are distinguished by the broad, flat (or palmate) antlers of the males; {{other members of the}} family have antlers with a dendritic ("twig-like") configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction {{in the size of the}} moose's range over time. Moose have been reintroduced to some of their former habitats. Currently, most moose are found in Canada, Alaska, New England, <b>Fennoscandia,</b> Baltic States, and Russia. Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation. The most common moose predators are the gray wolf along with bears and humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose are solitary animals and do not form herds. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, moose can become aggressive and move quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn features energetic fights between males competing for a female.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} Europe traces {{back to the}} formation of the Baltic Shield (<b>Fennoscandia)</b> and the Sarmatian craton, both around 2.25billion years ago, followed by the Volgo–Uralia shield, the three together leading to the East European craton (≈ Baltica) which became a part of the supercontinent Columbia. Around 1.1billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading {{to the formation of}} Pangea. Around 190million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Except for the {{subspecies}} bianchii {{which is}} largely all-year resident, and subspecies excubitor in the temperate European parts of its range with their mild maritime climate, {{the species is}} a short-distance migrant. The migrations are triggered by scarcity of food and therefore, according to prey population levels, the winter range might little extend south beyond the breeding range, or be entirely parapatric to it. The populations of the Central Asian mountains mostly migrate downslope rather than southwards. Females {{are more prone to}} migration than males; they do not appear to migrate, on average, longer or shorter distances than males, and consequently are the dominant sex {{in many parts of the}} winter range. Birds leave for winter quarters a more or less short time after breeding – July to October, with most birds staying to September – and return to nest mainly in March/April, but some only arrive in May. In recent decades, the number of birds remaining on the breeding grounds all year has been noted to increase e.g. in <b>Fennoscandia,</b> whereas for example borealis seems to be as rare a winter visitor in northern Ohio as it was a century ago.|$|E
500|$|The {{barn owl}} {{is the most}} {{widespread}} landbird species in the world, occurring in every continent except Antarctica.

500|$|The {{first floor}} is {{dedicated}} to displays that illustrate the formation and composition of amber. Amber in the area arose from deltaic deposits of rivers flowing from <b>Fennoscandia</b> in the Eocene Period, about 40 to 45 million years ago. The processes via which resin is changed into amber by microorganisms, oxidation, and polymerization are illustrated. Samples of microdrops and microicicles (i.e. [...] "amber within amber") are among the displayed items. The museum holds Europe's third largest amber specimen, the [...] "Sun Stone", of size 210x190x150 mm and weighing 3,526 grams, which has been stolen twice.

500|$|Carex binervis, the green-ribbed sedge, is a European {{species of}} sedge with an Atlantic distribution. It is found from <b>Fennoscandia</b> to the Iberian Peninsula, and occurs in heaths, moorland and other damp, acidic environments. It {{typically}} grows to {{a height of}} , and has inflorescences comprising one male and several female spikes, each up to [...] long. The utricles have two conspicuous green veins, which give rise to both the scientific name and the common name of the species. In the vegetative state, it closely resembles C.bigelowii, a species that usually grows at higher altitude. C.binervis was first described by James Edward Smith in 1800, and is classified in Carex sect. Spirostachyae; several hybrids with other Carex species are known.|$|E
500|$|In Swedish folk music, {{songs are}} monophonic, unemotional, and solemn in character, though working and festive songs {{might be more}} lively and rhythmic. Danish songs melodies tend to lean toward the major. In Icelandic folk music, the rímur, a form of epic poem {{dating back to the}} medieval era and Viking Age, is prominent. Faroese music {{contains}} dances directly descended from medieval ballad and epic poems, particularly from literature in the Icelandic tradition, and often follows unusual time signatures. Many Norwegian folk ballads follow a four-stanza structure known as stev. Stev alternate a trochaic tetrameter with a trimeter, and lines typically rhyme following an ABCB scheme, though stev are not standardized. Finnish folk music tends to be based on Karelian traditions and the meter and thematic material found in the Kalevala. These themes include magic, mysticism, shamanism, Viking sea voyages, Christian legends, and ballads and dance songs. The older runo song tradition follows meters such as , , or [...] Under Swedish and German influence, a newer, round-dance tradition based on the runo emerged – the rekilaulu – and these usually follow a [...] or [...] time. Sami music traditions (music from the Sami people throughout <b>Fennoscandia)</b> historically were rather insular, exerting little influence on the music surrounding cultures. Sami music is known for joiking, improvised singing particular to the performer. These songs are often sung accompanied by a drum.|$|E
