5000|$|It is {{generally}} believed that in northern latitudes, {{the north side}} of trees and rocks will generally have more luxuriant moss growth on average than other sides. This is assumed to be because the sun on the south side creates a dry environment. South of the equator the reverse would be true. However, naturalists feel that mosses grow on the <b>damper</b> <b>side</b> of trees and rocks. [...] In some cases, such as sunny climates in temperate northern latitudes, this will be the shaded north side of the tree or rock. On steep slopes it may be the uphill side. For mosses that grow on tree branches, this {{is generally}} the upper side of the branch on horizontally growing sections or near the crotch. In cool damp cloudy climates, all sides of tree trunks and rocks may be equally damp enough for mosses. And different species of mosses have different moisture and sun requirements so will grow on different sections of the same tree or rock.|$|E

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a major coal company, and a vibrating screen manufacturer conducted a cooperative study of vibrating screen noise. Rubber isolators reduced sound levels by 1 dB. Urethane screen panels did not reduce sound levels in this case. Drive noise {{was determined to}} be the dominant noise source on the screen. <b>Damped</b> <b>side</b> plates reduced vibration levels on the screen sides by 1 to 7 dB(A).

60|$|The sixth day came, and, oh! {{the great}} kraal of the Umpondwana was {{but as a}} hell wherein lost souls wandered in torment, for the sun beat down upon it {{fiercely}} and everywhere roamed or lay men, women and children overcome with the torture of thirst; indeed, of the last, some were already dead, especially those {{who were at the}} breast, for their mothers' milk was dry. Here three men had dragged an old wife from her hut, and were beating her to make her reveal the store of water which she was believed to have hidden; there others were cutting the throat of an ox that they might drink its blood, and yonder a little girl was turning stones to lick the <b>damp</b> <b>side</b> of them with her poor parched tongue.|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} hard to {{compress}} the story of a cold and luckless life, death, and burial into fewer words, or more impressive ones; at least, we found them impressive, perhaps because we had to re-create the inscription by scraping away the lichens from the faintly traced letters. The grave was on the shady and <b>damp</b> <b>side</b> of the church, endwise towards it, the head-stone being within about three feet of the foundation-wall; so that, unless the poor man was a dwarf, he must have been doubled up to fit him into his final resting-place. No wonder that his epitaph murmured against so poor a burial as this! His name, as well as I could make it out, was Treeo,--John Treeo, I think,--and he died in 1810, at the age of seventy-four. The gravestone is so overgrown with grass and weeds, so covered with unsightly lichens, and so crumbly with time and foul weather, that it is questionable whether anybody will ever be at the trouble of deciphering it again. But there is a quaint and sad kind of enjoyment in defeating (to such slight degree as my pen may do it) the probabilities of oblivion for poor John Treeo, and asking a little sympathy for him, half a century after his death, and making him better and more widely known, at least, than any other slumberer in Lillington churchyard: he having been, as appearances go, the outcast of them all.|$|R
50|$|This {{is exactly}} the same as the {{resonance}} frequency of an LC circuit, that is, one with no resistor present. The resonant frequency for an RLC circuit is the same as a circuit {{in which there is no}} damping, hence undamped resonance frequency. The peak resonance frequency, on the other hand, depends on the value of the resistor and is described as the damped resonant frequency. A highly damped circuit will fail to resonate at all when not driven. A circuit with a value of resistor that causes it to be just on the edge of ringing is called critically <b>damped.</b> Either <b>side</b> of critically <b>damped</b> are described as underdamped (ringing happens) and overdamped (ringing is suppressed).|$|R
50|$|A {{space is}} left in {{the centre of the}} {{water-tube}} banks for the firing chute. The firebox is top-fired (and lit) through this chute and there is no side firedoor. The lower part of the water-jacketed barrel surrounds the firebox. The narrow waterspace here encourages rapid steam raising. Firing is simple, with a thick fire relative to its area and fuel simply poured down. Beneath the grate is a water-filled ashpan, to prevent hot embers falling onto the road. Draught is controlled by a <b>damper</b> in the <b>side</b> of the ashpan, between the grate and the water tray.|$|R
40|$|A long-standing, though ill-understood {{problem in}} rocket dynamics, rocket {{response}} to random, altitude-dependent nozzle side-loads, is investigated. Side loads arise during low altitude flight due to random, asymmetric, shock-induced separation of in-nozzle boundary layers. In this paper, stochastic {{evolution of the}} in-nozzle boundary layer separation line, an essential feature underlying side load generation, is connected to random, altitude-dependent rotational and translational rocket response via a set of simple analytical models. Separation line motion, extant on a fast boundary layer time scale, is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Pitch and yaw responses, taking place on a long, rocket dynamics time scale, are shown to likewise evolve as OU processes. Stochastic, altitude-dependent rocket translational motion follows from linear, asymptotic versions of the full nonlinear equations of motion; the model is valid in the practical limit where random pitch, yaw, and roll rates all remain small. Computed altitudedependent rotational and translational velocity and displacement statistics are compared against those obtained using recently reported high fidelity simulations [Srivastava, Tkacik, and Keanini, J. Applied Phys., 108, 044911 (2010) ]; in every case, reasonable agreement is observed. As an important prelude, evidence indicating the physical consistency of the model introduced in the above article is first presented: it is shown that the study's separation line model allows direct derivation of experimentally observed side load amplitude and direction densities. Finally, {{it is found that}} the analytical models proposed in this paper allow straightforward identification of practical approaches for: i) reducing pitch/yaw response to side loads, and ii) enhancing pitch/yaw <b>damping</b> once <b>side</b> loads cease.

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} behaviour of a wing oscillating in the heave {{and pitch}} {{degrees of freedom}} is examined by means of wind tunnel experiment. The phenomena of interest are classical flutter and limit cycle oscillation. Classical flutter is normally associated with the exponential growth of the response amplitude. Linear flutter theory only predicts the critical flutter speed. Any excitation or disturbance beyond the critical speed is assumed to cause exponential growth in the response amplitude. In contrast, any limited amplitude oscillations occurring post-fultter suggest the existence of nonlinear properties in the system. Such properties can originate from the aerodynamic forces {{in the form of}} flow separation and reattachment. On the structural <b>side,</b> <b>damping</b> and stiffness can also contribute nonlinear properties. Furthermore, these nonlinearities can manifest themselves even at pre-flutter conditions, depending on the values of some governing parameter. The focus of the present work is the transformation of classical flutter into stall flutter as the equilibrium angle of attack of heaving and pitching wing is increased. The interaction of stall-related nonlinearity with structural nonlinearities is also of interest. The measured aeroelastic responses are analyzed and the bifurcation behavior of the dynamic system is characterized. Structural responses as well as flow field visualization through Particle Image Velocimetry show the origin of nonlinearity does not solely come from the manifestation of separation and the shedding of vortices, but from the structural nonlinearity which limits the response amplitude...|$|R
