5|$|German naturalist Ernst Friedrich Germar {{described}} the floury baker in 1834 as Cicada curvicosta. Germar based the description on two specimens {{now in the}} Hope Entomological Collections, Oxford, but did not <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> type specimen and their exact locations were not recorded. In 2003, {{one of the original}} specimens was designated the lectotype and the other the paralectotype.|$|E

5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The pyjama shark was {{originally}} described as Squalus africanus by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, in the thirteenth edition of Systema Naturae. He did not <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> type specimen. In 1837, Scottish physician and zoologist Andrew Smith created the new genus Poroderma for this species {{and the related}} leopard catshark (P. pantherinum, at the time believed to be multiple species). In 1908, the pyjama shark was made the type species of the genus by American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{published}} a formal description and {{name for the}} species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> type specimen (a specimen to {{be representative of the}} species) for the species, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), in reference to the shape of its infructescences.|$|E
50|$|A {{warrant officer}} (WO) is {{an officer in}} a {{military}} organisation who is <b>designated</b> <b>an</b> officer by a warrant, as distinguished from a commissioned officer who is <b>designated</b> <b>an</b> officer by a commission, and a non-commissioned officer who is <b>designated</b> <b>an</b> officer, often by virtue of seniority.|$|R

The Governor's four-year term begins on January 2, the day after the New Year's Day holiday.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} description, Hennig did not <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> holotype specimen. However, in a detailed monography on the osteology, systematic position and palaeobiology of Kentrosaurus in 1925, Hennig picked {{the most complete}} partial skeleton, today inventorised as MB.R.4800.1 through MB.R.4800.37, as a lectotype (see syntype). This material includes a nearly complete series of tail vertebrae, several vertebrae of the back, a sacrum with five sacral vertebrae and both ilia, both femora and an ulna, and {{is included in the}} mounted skeleton at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. The type locality is Kindope, Tanzania, near the Tendaguru hill.|$|E
5|$|President Fernando de la Rúa {{resigned}} {{after the}} December 2001 riots {{that had been}} caused by the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression. As his vice president Carlos Álvarez had resigned as well months before, Congress called for a special assembly to <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> new president. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá became president after being elected with 169 votes to 138. He {{was supported by the}} PJ and smaller right-wing parties such as Republican Force and Action for the Republic. The Unión Cívica Radical (UCR) and Alternative for a Republic of Equals voted against him. He was replaced in the governor's office by vice-governor María Alicia Lemme, and took office on December 23, 2001.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{decision}} {{to create a}} duchy and <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the comes civitatis (city count) was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count (comes) to duke (dux) and from county (comitatus) to duchy (ducatus) also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2015 {{wilderness}} designations, the White Cloud and Boulder mountains {{were part}} of the largest unprotected roadless area in the United States outside of Alaska. In the absence of Congressional action that would designate the Boulder-White Clouds region as wilderness, the area had been studied for possible protection as a national monument by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act. Former Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne initially studied the area for national monument status, but did not recommend it because Congressional action seemed likely. The 2015 bill passed after receiving increased attention when President Obama indicated he would <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> national monument in the area if the wilderness bill did not pass. Additionally, other large areas of the forest are parts of proposed wilderness areas, such as through the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. These other proposals have gained no support among Idaho's congressional delegation because the bills could place undue public use and development restrictions on Idaho's public lands.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1888, based on specimens he had originally collected {{as far back}} as 1869, in New York state, near Sand Lake, Albany, and Port Jefferson. In his 1888 publication he indicated that he had originally listed these collections as Boletus flavidus (now known as Suillus flavidus) in his 1869 Report of the State Botanist (published in 1872). However, as was pointed out nearly a century later in 1986, the 1869 report does not actually mention the species; rather, Peck's field notes that year (which served {{as the basis for the}} report) reference a collection at Sand Lake upon which the original (1888) description was most likely based. Because Peck failed to <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> type specimen, one of the Sand Lake specimens was lectotypified in 1986.|$|E

5|$|The National Historic Landmark Program is {{administered}} by the National Park Service, a branch of the Department of the Interior. The National Park Service determines which properties meet NHL criteria and makes nomination recommendations after an owner notification process. The Secretary of the Interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. Both public and privately owned properties can be designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NHL. When this is the case the Secretary of the Interior can only <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> site as eligible for designation.|$|E
