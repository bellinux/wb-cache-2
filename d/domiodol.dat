40|$|Thirty {{children}} (25 males, five females), {{mean age}} 9. 33 Â± 2. 57 years, with acute infectious pulmonary diseasesor acute flare-ups of chronic bronchitis, were randomly treated with either <b>domiodol</b> or placebo. The {{study was conducted}} between November 1986 and February 1987. <b>Domiodol</b> was administered orally for 14 days in doses of 0. 5 mg/kg three times daily. Subjective symptoms (cough, sputum viscosity, diMculty in raising sputum and sputum characteristics) were assessed semi-quantitatively. They were all reduced significantly in the group treated with <b>domiodol</b> compared to those given placebo. Spirometric measures of vital capacity and {{peak expiratory flow rate}} were also improved in patients given <b>domiodol</b> compared with placebo. Conversely, no differences were noted in forced expiratory volume in 1 s, Tiffenau index, or mid-expiratory flow. There were no clinical side-effects and no changes in any other parameters measured; in particular, levels of thyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone were unchanged. Thus, <b>domiodol</b> proved effective in reducing the symptoms of infection of the lower respiratory tract and in improving the consistency of mucus in children.
