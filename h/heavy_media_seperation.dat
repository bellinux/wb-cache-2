40|$|Chronic <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers {{have been}} found {{impaired}} cognitive performance on certain cognitive tasks (Ophir, Nass & Wagner, 2009). However, the poor performance {{may be caused by}} their breadth-biased style of cognitive control rather than a deficit in cognitive abilities such as the ability to filter out interference from irrelevant stimuli and representations in memory. In this study, a new media multitasking index was invented to differentiate <b>heavy</b> and light <b>media</b> multitaskers by adding three open ended questions to the Media Use Questionnaire used by Ophir, Nass and Wagner (2009). Also, four different cognitive tasks, which access the ability of attentional capture, attention allocation to infrequent information, task switching and crossmodal integration, were used to investigate whether the poor performance of <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers is general to a wider range of tasks. Preliminary results found that <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers showed better improvement in accuracy between the sound present condition and sound absent condition of Pip and Pop Task (Van der Burg, Olivers, Bronkhorst, & theeuwes, 2008). <b>Heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers appeared to have better ability of crossmodal integration than light medie multitaskers; hence, their poor performance is limited in only certain cognitive tasks...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{reprocessing}} of tailings {{from the}} Anjir Tange processing plant using a <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> cyclone was investigated. Gravity separation tests by the <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> cyclone and sink—float were performed in both industrial and laboratory scale for different size fractions. Finally, {{the efficiency of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> cyclone devices has been evaluated using by Tromp curves. The Tromp curve is an indicative of actual performance of the separation unit since it is independent of feed quality. In case of coal washing, the degree of misplacement is directly depended to the amount particles with a specific weight close to gravity of separation (near-gravity material). However, the coal containing high near-gravity material can be effectively processed by choosing the right process and correct operating parameters.|$|R

30|$|Gravity {{separation}} and flotation {{are the most}} common techniques in coal processing and recovery of coal from tailings in large scale (Wills 2011; John et al. 2002). <b>Heavy</b> <b>media</b> separation method is one of the gravity separation methods, which was patented in 1858 by Henry Bessemer (Napier et al. 2006). This method is so advantageous due to the high capacity and efficiency of separation. One of <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> separators is hydrocyclone which was developed in the 1950 s and in the chemical industries due to the simple design, suitable performance and high capacity (Delgadillo and Rajamani 2005). The <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> cyclone is used extensively in coal processing and in the primary treatment of metal ores such as Pb and Zn. The modern cyclone for coal preparation is the most effective option for size fraction of 0.5 – 50  mm (Chu et al. 2012). In this separator, the centrifugal force causes the heavy particles such as dust or ashes to move to the wall of the cyclone where the particles get down because of the axial velocity and discharge through the underflow of the cyclone (Chu et al. 2009). The <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> cyclones are installed inclined or upside down (Rayner and Napier-Munn 2002).|$|R

40|$|Chronic media {{multitasking}} {{is quickly}} becoming ubiquitous, although processing multiple incoming streams {{of information is}} considered a challenge for human cognition. A series of experiments addressed whether there are systematic differences in information processing styles between chronically <b>heavy</b> and light <b>media</b> multitaskers. A trait media multitasking index was developed to identify groups of <b>heavy</b> and light <b>media</b> multitaskers. These two groups were then compared along established cognitive control dimensions. Results showed that <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers {{are more susceptible to}} interference from irrelevant environmental stimuli and from irrelevant representations in memory. This led to the surprising result that <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers performed worse on a test of task-switching ability, likely due to reduced ability to filter out interference from the irrelevant task set. These results demonstrate that media multitasking, a rapidly growing societal trend, is associated with a distinct approach to fundamental information processing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Media multitasking, the {{concurrent}} {{use of multiple}} media forms, {{has been shown to}} be related to greater self-reported impulsivity and less self-control. These measures are both hallmarks of the need for immediate gratification which has been associated with fast, intuitive 2 ̆ 018 system- 12 ̆ 019 decision making, as opposed to more deliberate and effortful 2 ̆ 018 system- 22 ̆ 019 decision making. In Study 1, we used the Cognitive Reflection Task (CRT) to examine whether individuals who engage heavily in media multitasking differ from those who are light media multitaskers in their degree of system- 1 versus system- 2 thinking. In Study 2 we examined whether <b>heavy</b> and light <b>media</b> multitaskers differ in delay of gratification, using the delay discounting measure which estimates the preference for smaller immediate rewards, relative to larger delayed rewards in a hypothetical monetary choice task. We found that <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers were more likely than light media multitaskers to endorse intuitive, but wrong, decisions on the CRT indicating a greater reliance on 2 ̆ 018 system- 12 ̆ 019 thinking. <b>Heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers were also willing to settle for less money immediately relative to light media multitaskers who were more willing to wait for the larger delayed reward. These results suggest that <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers have a reactive decision-making style that promotes current desires (money, ease of processing) at the expense of accuracy and future rewards. These findings highlight the potential for <b>heavy</b> <b>media</b> multitaskers to be at risk for problematic behaviors associated with delay discounting 2 ̆ 013 behaviors such as substance abuse, overeating, problematic gambling, and poor financial management...|$|R
