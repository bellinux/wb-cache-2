40|$|A {{significant}} desert dust deposition event {{occurred on}} Mt. Elbrus, Caucasus Mountains, Russia on 5 May 2009, where the deposited dust later {{appeared as a}} brown layer in the snow pack. An examination of dust transportation history and analysis of chemical and physical properties of the deposited dust were used {{to develop a new}} approach for high-resolution "provenancing" of dust deposition events recorded in snow pack using multiple independent techniques. A combination of SEVIRI red-green-blue composite imagery, MODIS atmospheric optical depth fields derived using the Deep Blue algorithm, air mass trajectories derived with HYSPLIT model and analysis of meteorological data enabled identification of dust source regions with high temporal (hours) and spatial (ca. 100 km) resolution. Dust, deposited on 5 May 2009, originated {{in the foothills of the}} Djebel Akhdar in eastern Libya where dust sources were activated by the intrusion of cold air from the Mediterranean Sea and Saharan low pressure system and transported to the Caucasus along the eastern Mediterranean coast, Syria and Turkey. Particles with an average diameter below 8 μm accounted for 90 % of the measured particles in the sample with a mean of 3. 58 μm, median 2. 48 μm. The chemical signature of this long-travelled dust was significantly different from the locally-produced dust and close to that of soils collected in a palaeolake in the source region, in concentrations of hematite. Potential addition of dust from a secondary source in northern Mesopotamia introduced uncertainty in the "provenancing" of dust from this event. Nevertheless, the approach adopted here enables other <b>dust</b> <b>horizons</b> in the snowpack to be linked to specific dust transport events recorded in remote sensing and meteorological data archives...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiocarbon {{dates and}} glaciological {{features}} of the Ward Hunt area along northernmost Ellesmere Island suggest the following chronology, {{which is consistent with}} world-wide climatic oscillations: I) 10, 000 - 4100 B. P. : deglaciation, and develop-ment of several marine levels, particularly one now 40 m. above sea level, at 7500 f 300 B. P.; 2) 4100 - 2400 years B. P. : climatic deterioration, glacial readvance and forma-tion of ice shelves; 3) 2400 - 1400 years B. P. : general climatic amelioration; development of <b>dust</b> ablation <b>horizon</b> on Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, glacial retreat; 4) 1 4 0 0 B. P. - present: climatic deterioration, with renewed thickening of Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, and beginnings of growth of ice rises; the last-mentioned experienced maximum growth in the interval between 350 - 170 years ago; slight glacial readvance. The isostatic rebound curve for northernmost Ellesmere Island differs from that of the Tanquary Fiord area 80 miles (128 km.) to the south because of direring Pleistocene ice thickenesses. We estimate these to average at least 600 m. for the former area, and 1800 m. for the latter. R 6 SUM 6. Histoire holockne d’une portion de l’extrême-nord de l‘île d‘Ellesmere. Le...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} method for estimating accumulation and compaction rates of dry snow in Antarctica with {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR). Using {{an estimate of the}} emitted waveform from direct measurements, we apply deterministic deconvolution via the Fourier domain to GPR data with a nominal frequency of 500 MHz. This reveals unambiguous reflection horizons which can be observed in repeat measurements made one year apart. At two measurement sites near Scott Base, Antarctica, we extrapolate point measurements of average accumulation from snow pits and firn cores to a larger area by identifying a dateable <b>dust</b> layer <b>horizon</b> in the radargrams. Over an 800 m × 800 m area on the McMurdo Ice Shelf (77 ° 45 ´ S, 167 ° 17 ´ E) the average accumulation is found to be 269 ± 9 kg m− 2 a− 1 . The accumulation over an area of 400 m × 400 m on Ross Island (77 ° 40 ´ S, 167 ° 11 ´ E, 350 m a. s. l.) is found to be higher (404 ± 22 kg m− 2 a− 1 ) and shows increased variability related to undulating terrain. Compaction of snow between 2 m and 13 m depth is estimated at both sites by tracking several internal reflection horizons along the radar profiles and calculating the average change in separation of horizon pairs from one year to the next. The derived compaction rates range from 7 cm m− 1 at a depth of 2 m, down to no measurable compaction at 13 m depth, and are similar to published values from point measurements...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} investigated fission products are transported with water resulting from melting processes, and are sorbed on <b>dust</b> or dirt <b>horizons.</b> These products are, therefore, not suited for dating temperate glaciers. 210 Pb is also transported with water and displaced from its original deposition. However, despite large fluctuations, the specific activity of 210 Pb decreases with depth, and can be used to estimate accumulation rates and the age of the ice. The average annual accumulation rate amounts to about 80 cm water equivalent, and the deepest sample (81 m i. e. ab. 65 m w. e.) was deposited in the beginning of this century. These results agree with data obtained from other observations on this glacier and show that the 210 Pb_method is suitable to date temperate glaciers, if the ice cores cover a time interval of about 100 years (i. e. ab. 4 half-lives of 210 Pb). The surface activity of 210 Pb was found to be 5 ± 1 dpm per kg of ice in agreement with other locations in the Alps and with measurements of fresh snow...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the utility of}} the Rényi entropy (RE), a measure of the complexity of probability density functions, as a tool for finding physically meaningful patterns in geophysical data. Initially, the RE is applied to observational data of long-lived atmospheric tracers in order to analyse the dynamics of stratospheric transitions regions associated with barriers to horizontal mixing. Its wider applicability is investigated by testing the RE as a method for highlighting internal boundaries in snow and ice from ground penetrating radar (GPR) recordings. High-resolution 500 MHz GPR soundings of dry snow were acquired at several sites near Scott Base, Antarctica, in 2008 and 2009, with the aim of using the RE to facilitate the identification and tracking of subsurface layers to extrapolate point measurements of accumulation from snow pits and firn cores to larger areas. The atmospheric analysis focuses on applying the RE to observational tracer data from the EOS-MLS satellite instrument. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is shown to exhibit subtropical RE maxima in both hemispheres. These peaks are a measure of the tracer gradients that mark the transition between the tropics and the mid-latitudes in the stratosphere, also referred to as the edges of the tropical pipe. The RE maxima are shown to be located closer to the equator in winter than in summer. This agrees well with the expected behaviour of the tropical pipe edges and is similar to results reported by other studies. Compared to other stratospheric mixing metrics, the RE has the advantage that it is easy to calculate as it does not, for example, require conversion to equivalent latitude and does not rely on dynamical information such as wind fields. The RE analysis also reveals occasional sudden poleward shifts of the southern hemisphere tropical pipe edge during austral winter which are accompanied by increased mid-latitude N 2 O levels. These events are investigated in more detail by creating daily high-resolution N 2 O maps using a two-dimensional trajectory model and MERRA reanalysis winds to advect N 2 O observations forwards and backwards in time on isentropic surfaces. With the aid of this ‘domain filling’ technique it is illustrated that the increase in southern hemisphere mid-latitude N 2 O during austral winter is probably the result of the cumulative effect of several large-scale, episodic leaks of N 2 O-rich air from the tropical pipe. A comparison with the global distribution of potential vorticity strongly suggests that irreversible mixing related to planetary wave breaking is the cause of the leak events. Between 2004 and 2011 the large-scale leaks are shown to occur approximately every second year and a connection to the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation is found to be likely, though this cannot be established conclusively due to the relatively short data set. Identification and tracking of subsurface boundaries, such as ice layers in snow or the bedrock of a glacier, is the focus of the cryospheric part of this project. The utility of the RE for detecting amplitude gradients associated with reflections in GPR recordings is initially tested on a 25 MHz sounding of an Antarctic glacier. The results show distinct regions of increased RE values that allow identification of the glacial bedrock along large parts of the profile. Due to the low computational requirements, the RE is found to be an effective pseudo gain function for initial analysis of GPR data in the field. While other gain functions often have to be tuned to give a good contrast between reflections and background noise over the whole vertical range of a profile, the RE tends to assign all detectable amplitude gradients a similar (high) value, resulting in a clear contrast between reflections and background scattering. Additionally, theoretical considerations allow the definition of a ‘standard’ data window size with which the RE can be applied to recordings made by most pulsed GPR systems and centre frequencies. This is confirmed by tests with higher frequency recordings (50 and 500 MHz) acquired on the McMurdo Ice Shelf. However, these also reveal that the RE processing is less reliable for identifying more closely spaced reflections from internal layers in dry snow. In order to complete the intended high-resolution analysis of accumulation patterns by tracking internal snow layers in the 500 MHz data from two test sites, a different processing approach is developed. Using an estimate of the emitted waveform from direct measurement, deterministic deconvolution via the Fourier domain is applied to the high-resolution GPR data. This reveals unambiguous reflection horizons which can be observed in repeat measurements made one year apart. Point measurements of average accumulation from snow pits and firn cores are extrapolated to larger areas by identifying and tracking a dateable <b>dust</b> layer <b>horizon</b> in the radargrams. Furthermore, it is shown that annual compaction rates of snow can be estimated by tracking several internal reflection horizons along the deconvolved radar profiles and calculating the average change in separation of horizon pairs from one year to the next. The technique is complementary to point measurements from other studies and the derived compaction rates agree well with published values and theoretical estimates...|$|R
