5|$|<b>Essential</b> {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are <b>essential.</b> In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are <b>essential</b> for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of <b>essential</b> genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 <b>essential</b> genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 <b>essential</b> genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E

5|$|The 20S {{proteasome}} is both ubiquitous and <b>essential</b> in eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, {{including many}} archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S proteasome, whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an ATPase. The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome. In general, HslV is not <b>essential</b> in bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase, most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not <b>essential.</b>|$|E
