40|$|Prior studies {{indicate}} thoracic {{spinal manipulative therapy}} (SMT) improves shoulder pain and disability. However, {{these studies are limited}} by no control or sham-treatment group. A valid sham comparator for thoracic SMT is needed. Subjects (n = 69) without shoulder pain were randomized to one of three groups: thoracic SMT, sham-SMT, or sham-ultrasound; and told they were randomized to manual therapy, range of motion, or ultrasound respectively. Perceived effects of the treatment on shoulder motion, pain, and functional were questioned before and after treatment. Believability was assessed by asking if the subject believed they received the active or inactive <b>intervention.</b> <b>Shoulder</b> active range of motion (AROM) was measured with a digital inclinometer before and after treatment by a blinded examiner. Believability of treatment was not significantly different between the SMT and sham-SMT (p = 0. 12), but a greater proportion (p = 0. 03) believed they received the active treatment in the SMT group (78. 3 %) as compared to the sham-ultrasound (47. 8 %). No differences in perception of treatment effects between the treatment groups were detected (p >= 0. 1). Shoulder internal rotation AROM increased in the thoracic SMT group (mean difference - 3. 7 degrees; p = 0. 006), but did not change within the sham-SMT (p = 0. 44) or sham-ultrasound (p = 0. 18) groups. Shoulder flexion did not change within any group. These preliminary results indicate the sham-SMT is an adequate sham comparator for SMT with similar expectations and believability as SMT active treatment. the sham-SMT had an inert effect on shoulder AROM. Sham-ultrasound was not believable as an active treatment. Future studies need to validate these results in patients with shoulder pain. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Pain {{and neck}} & {{shoulder}} function after neck dissection: a systematic review Objective: To review systematically the published literature regarding {{pain in the}} shouldergirdle and neck and shoulder functioning in patients who underwent a neck dissection {{in the treatment of}} head and neck cancer. Data sourch: A search strategy was conducted in the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane library, Experta Medica and Pubmed. Review methods: Neck dissections performed in de included studies were classified. Studies were evaluated regarding experience of pain and functioning of neck and shoulders. Fysioning of neck and was evaluated according to the symptoms of the ‘shoulder syndrome’: posture, range of motion, strength, disability and electrophysiological evaluation. Also the development of the symptoms over time was evaluated. Results: The initial search returned 244 studies, with 13 studies meeting the in- and exclusion criteria. Studies showed that more extensive neck surgery is associated with more experience of pain and more restrictions in posture, reduced range of motion, less muscle strength, increased disability and worse electrophysiological evaluation compared to less extensive neck surgery. All outcomes showed the most severe disturbances in pain and function of neck and shoulders and less recovery over time after more extensive surgery. Over time patients with less extensive neck surgery showed more recovery. Conclusion: The literature indicated that more extensive surgery involves more pain and dysfunction of neck and shoulders compared to less extensive surgery. Less extensive surgery is associated with better recovery results compared to more extensive surgery. Range of motion of neck and shoulders after neck dissection in patients with cancer in the oral cavity: a research article Objective: To explore the influence of neck surgery on range of motion of neck and shoulders in patients with cancer in the oral cavity. Study design: Prospective cohort study Setting: University Medical Center Utrecht Patients and methods: Lateral flexion of the neck and forward flexion and abduction of the shoulder were measured at baseline, 4 to 6 weeks after intervention, 6 and 12 months after intervention in 93 patients who had neck surgery in the treatment of oral cancer. Results: After intervention lateral flexion of the neck decreased significantly in in the non-operated side of the (M) RND. Shoulder forward flexion and abduction decreased significantly after intervention in both (M) RND and SND in the operated sides and in the non-operated side in SND. After <b>intervention</b> <b>shoulder</b> abduction in the operated side improved significantly in (M) RND and SND. 12 Months after intervention values of range of motion were still lower compared to baseline measures.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{efficacy}} of common <b>interventions</b> for <b>shoulder</b> pain. DESIGN: All randomised controlled trials of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular and subacromial glucocorticosteroid injection, oral glucocorticosteroid treatment, physiotherapy, manipulation under anaesthesia, hydrodilatation, and surgery for shoulder pain that were identified by computerised and hand searches of the literature and had a blinded assessment of outcome were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Methodological quality (score out of 40), selection criteria, and outcome measures. Effect sizes were calculated and combined in a pooled analysis if study population, end point, and intervention were comparable. RESULTS: Thirty one trials met inclusion criteria. Mean methodological quality score was 16. 8 (9. 5 - 22). Selection criteria varied widely, even for the same diagnostic label. There was no uniformity in the outcome measures used, and their measurement properties were rarely reported. Effect sizes for individual trials were small (range - 1. 4 to 3. 0). The results of only three studies investigating "rotator cuff tendinitis" could be pooled. The only positive finding was that subacromial steroid injection is better than placebo in improving the range of abduction (weighted difference between means 35 degrees (95 % confidence interval 14 to 55)). CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence to support or refute {{the efficacy of}} common <b>interventions</b> for <b>shoulder</b> pain. As well {{as the need for}} further well designed clinical trials, {{more research is needed to}} establish a uniform method of defining shoulder disorders and developing outcome measures which are valid, reliable, and responsive in affected people...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures–Surgical (ASERNIP-S) {{undertook}} to systematically review the literature regarding arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) using a holmium:YAG laser {{for patients with}} impingement syndrome, {{with respect to the}} safety and efficacy of the procedure. Methods: Studies on ASD with a holmium:YAG laser were identified using MEDLINE (1984 to July 2000), EMBASE (1974 to August 2000) and Current Contents (1993 to week 33 2000). A number of search terms were used: (laser and shoulder) and (surgery or arthroscop* or acromioplasty or orthopaed* or orthoped* or subacromial decompression or impingement syndrome). The Cochrane Library was searched from 1966 to issue 3 2000, using the search terms ‘shoulder and surgery’. Human studies were included for patients with impingement syndrome but without full-thickness rotator cuff tears or rheumatological disorders, and where shoulder pain had been experienced for more than 3 months. A surgeon and reviewer independently assessed the retrieved articles for their inclusion in the review. Results: Seven papers were identified that related to ASD with a holmium:YAG laser. None of the papers for review offered high-quality evidence. There were no properly designed randomized controlled studies. The highest level of evidence came from time series studies. No quantitative analysis could be undertaken for this review. Conclusions: Given the extremely low level of evidence available for this procedure it was recommended that further research be conducted to establish the safety and efficacy of the technique. This reinforces the conclusion reached in the Cochrane review of <b>interventions</b> for <b>shoulder</b> pain where insufficient evidence was found to either support or refute the efficacy of other <b>interventions</b> for <b>shoulder</b> pain.

40|$|Shoulder pain is {{a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} complaint in the community, which can arise from diverse causes. Regardless of the cause, mild cases can often be effectively treated conservatively, with options including rest, physiotherapy, pain relief and glucocorticoid injections. If conservative strategies fail after a 3 - 6 month period then surgery might be considered. Generally, the proportion of patients with shoulder pain who require surgery is small. When surgery is considered, a clear diagnosis and structural information from imaging are required. The indications for surgery, and success rate, depend on the specific diagnosis {{as well as on}} the individual clinical presentation. Evidence from case series suggest that surgical <b>interventions</b> for <b>shoulder</b> pain are effective when used appropriately. This article outlines the surgical management of the most common painful conditions that affect the shoulder, including impingement, rotator cuff tear, frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and calcific tendonitis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of hand position changes on electro-myographic activity of shoulder stabilizers during push-up plus exercise (PUPE) performed on both stable and unstable surfaces. [Subjects] This study was performed on a cohort of 20 normal adults divided into an unstable surface group (USG) (n= 10) and a stable surface group (SSG) (n= 10). [Methods] A sling device was used to provide an unstable surface, and a push-up bar was used to provide a stable surface. PUPEs were performed with hands in various positions: the neutral position (NP), the internal rotation position (IRP), or the external rotation position (ERP). Electromyography was used to determine and analyze the electromyographic activity of the upper trapezius muscle (UT), the lower trapezius muscle (LT), the serratus anterior muscle (SA), and the pectoralis major muscle (PM). [Results] Comparison of the results within the USG and SSG showed significant differences depending on the hand position used during the exercise. Comparison between the USG and SSG showed that the ERP hand posture resulted in significant differences in electromyographic activity of the SA in the USG.

40|$|Multiple disease-specific {{systematic}} reviews on {{the effectiveness}} of physical therapy <b>intervention</b> for <b>shoulder</b> dysfunction have been inconclusive. To date, there have been two systematic reviews that examined manual therapy specifically but both considered effects within diagnoses. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the effectiveness of manual therapy to the glenohumeral joint across all painful shoulder conditions. A search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Randomized Controlled Trials for articles dated 1996 to June 2009 was performed. Inclusion for review were manual therapy performed to the glenohumeral joint only; non-surgical painful shoulder disorders; subjects 18 - 80 years; and outcomes of range of motion, pain, function, and/or quality of life. Quality assessment was performed using the PEDro scale with subsequent data extraction. Seventeen related articles were found with seven fitting the inclusion criteria. The average PEDro score was 7. 86, meeting the cutoff score for high quality. Significant heterogeneity in outcome measures prohibited meta-analysis. Five studies demonstrated benefits utilizing manual therapy for mobility, and four demonstrated a trend towards decreasing pain values. Functional outcomes and quality-of-life measures varied greatly among all studies. Manual therapy appears to increase either active or passive mobility of the shoulder. A trend was found favoring manual therapy for decreasing pain, but the effect on function and quality of life remains inconclusive. Future research utilizing consistent outcome measurements is necessary...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Neck and {{shoulder}} complaints {{can be a}} direct result of a neck dissection. METHODS: Maximal active lateral flexion of the neck, forward flexion and abduction of the shoulder, and self-perceived function were determined in 145 patients treated for oral cancer. RESULTS: No short-term influence of radiotherapy was found on measured range of motion and self-perceived neck {{and shoulder}} function (p >. 05). One year after a bilateral neck dissection, patients showed deteriorated lateral flexion of the neck, whereas patients treated with a unilateral modified radical neck dissection still reported pain during neck movements. Maximal forward flexion of the shoulder recovered to the level of healthy controls, but maximal abduction was still reduced in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Neck dissection, tumor site, and extensive reconstruction are related to deterioration of shoulder function shortly after <b>intervention.</b> Maximal active <b>shoulder</b> abduction was affected most.

40|$|Background: Neck pain is {{increasingly}} becoming a common problem. Cervicobrachial disorder is a dysfunction of nerve {{root of the}} cervical spine due to its compression which leads to ischemic changes that cause sensory and motor dysfunction. Many studies {{has been done on}} SLR test which affects upper limb sensitizing response by means of doing ipsilateral and bilateral SLR. The study revealed that the abduction ROM for shoulder was greater during contra lateral SLR with ULTT- 2 a when compared to ipsilateral SLR. Methods: 30 subjects (18 males and 12 females) were included in this study. The ULTT- 2 a is performed on each subject, following this ipsilateral and contra lateral SLR was performed. The sensitising response perceived by the subjects was recorded. Outcome measures were Range of Motion and sensation description. After the <b>intervention</b> the <b>shoulder</b> abduction and straight leg raising ranges were measured. Analysis was performed using independent t-test. Result: Significant difference was found in shoulder abduction (p 0. 11). There was no difference in sensitizing response (Tingling, Burning, Sharp shooting) during ipsilatral and contra lateral straight leg raise. Conclusion: This study concludes that in order to obtain the same sensitizing response during ULTT- 2 a of contra-lateral SLR as during ULTT- 2 a of ipsilateral SLR, the angle of SLR and shoulder abduction during ULTT- 2 a of contra lateral SLR will be greater. This finding will be proved beneficial in the treatment of patients with cervico brachial disorders...|$|R
40|$|Background: Surgical <b>interventions</b> at the <b>shoulder</b> may alter {{function}} of the shoulder complex. Clinically, the outcome can be assessed by universal goniometry. Marker-based motion capture may not resemble these results due to differing angle definitions. Methods: The clinical inspection of bilateral arm abduction for assessing shoulder dysfunction is performed with a marker based 3 D optical measurement method. An anatomical zero position of shoulder pose is proposed to determine absolute angles according to the Neutral- 0 -Method as used in orthopedic context. Static shoulder positions are documented simultaneously by 3 D marker tracking and universal goniometry in 8 young and healthy volunteers. Repetitive bilateral arm abduction movements of at least 150 ° range of motion are monitored. Similarly a subject with gleno-humeral osteoarthritis is monitored for demonstrating the feasibility of the method and to illustrate possible shoulder dysfunction effects. Results: With mean differences of less than 2 °, the proposed anatomical zero position results in good agreement between shoulder elevation/depression angles determined by 3 D marker tracking and by universal goniometry in static positions. Lesser agreement is found for shoulder pro-/retraction with systematic deviations of up to 6 °. In the bilateral arm abduction movements the volunteers perform a common and specific pattern in clavicula-thoracic and gleno-humeral motion with maximum shoulder angles of 32 ° elevation, 5 ° depression and 45 ° protraction, respectively, whereas retraction is hardly reached. Further, they all show relevant out of (frontal) plane motion with anteversion angles of 30 ° in overhead position (maximum abduction). With increasing arm anteversion the shoulder is increasingly retroverted, with a maximum of 20 ° retroversion. The subject with gleno-humeral osteoarthritis shows overall less shoulder abduction range of motion but with increased out-of-plane movement during abduction. Conclusions: The proposed anatomical zero definition for shoulder pose fills the missing link for determining absolute joint angles for shoulder elevation/depression and pro-/retraction. For elevation-/depression the accuracy suits clinical expectations very well with mean differences less than 2 ° and limits of agreement of 8. 6 ° whereas for pro-/retraction the accuracy in individual cases may be inferior with limits of agreement of up to 24. 6 °. This has critically {{to be kept in}} mind when applying this concept to <b>shoulder</b> <b>intervention</b> studies...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Evidence for {{effective}} management of shoulder impingement is limited. The present study aimed {{to quantify the}} clinical, neurophysiological, and biomechanical effects of a scapular motor control retraining for young individuals with shoulder impingement signs. METHOD: Sixteen adults with shoulder impingement signs (mean age 22  ±  1. 6 years) underwent the intervention and 16 healthy participants (24. 8  ±  3. 1 years) provided reference data. Shoulder function and pain were assessed using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and other questionnaires. Electromyography (EMG) and 3 -dimensional motion {{analysis was used to}} record muscle activation and kinematic data during arm elevation to 90 ° and lowering in 3 planes. Patients were assessed pre and post a 10 -week motor control based intervention, utilizing scapular orientation retraining. RESULTS: Pre-intervention, patients reported pain and reduced function compared to the healthy participants (SPADI in patients 20  ±  9. 2; healthy 0  ±  0). Post-intervention, the SPADI scores reduced significantly (P < . 001) by a mean of 10 points (± 4). EMG showed delayed onset and early termination of serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscle activity pre-intervention, which improved significantly post-intervention (P < . 05). Pre-intervention, patients exhibited on average 4. 6 - 7. 4 ° less posterior tilt, which was significantly lower in 2 arm elevation planes (P < . 05) than healthy participants. Post-intervention, upward rotation and posterior tilt increased significantly (P < . 05) during 2 arm movements, approaching the healthy values.

Methods: A retrospective study conducted on 14 patients who undergone an MRI with a 1. 5 T unit MAGNETOM Symphony (Siemens), for their shoulder pain, where the diagnosis might be Muscle tears like, subscapularis, infraspinatus,supraspinatus and teres minor muscles; subacromial or subdeltoid bursitis and labral tears were included. All the subjects were then continued with usual physical therapy treatments for four weeks depending on their diagnosis which includes; advice, stretching, mobilization and strengthening exercises, manual therapy, massage, strapping, and electrotherapy. The outcome measures documented from the case sheet were; Visual Analogue Scale grade and passive range of motion of shoulder external / internal rotation and abduction. Results: Paired t test was used to compare the PROM between pre rehabilitation and post rehabilitation testing and the non parametric test, Mann Whitney U test was used for the comparison of VAS. All patients showed a significant improvement in VAS and PROM of abduction, internal and external rotation following physical therapy (P≤ 0. 05).

The accident occurred several years ago with surgical <b>intervention</b> including a <b>shoulder</b> allograft and arthrodesis {{as well as a}} transradial amputation. Because of the presence of a complete brachial plexus injury it is difficult to decipher the rationale behind a transradial amputation. Many of us have fit individuals who had suffered these type of injuries and have opted for transhumeral amputations. Difficulty arises from attempting to accommodate the non-functional articulation, namely the elbowjoint. Past prosthetic fittings have been with a conventional, elbow disarticulation style prosthesis with external locking hinges and voluntary opening terminal device.

METHOD: MEDLINE, AMED and Embase in addition to unpublished literature databases were searched from 1950 to August 2011. Studies were included if they were randomized or non-randomized controlled trials comparing USG vs LSG injections {{for the treatment of}} adults with shoulder pathology. Two reviewers independently performed data extraction and appraisal of the studies. Meta-analyses were performed where possible and when inappropriate a narrative review of the data was presented. RESULTS: Six papers including 307 patients were reviewed; 142 received LMG injections and 165 received USG injections. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of USG for pain at 6 weeks (standardized mean difference 1. 03; 95 % CI 0. 12, 1. 93; P = 0. 03). There was no statistically significant difference between the injection methods with respect to shoulder function (standardized mean difference 0. 33; 95 % CI - 0. 59, 1. 25; P = 0. 48). There was a significant difference between <b>interventions</b> for <b>shoulder</b> abduction at 6 weeks in favour of the USG method (mean difference 2. 81; 95 % CI 0. 67, 4. 95; P = 0. 01).

40|$|This study {{explores the}} effect of slow-stroke back massages on anxiety and {{shoulder}} pain in hospitalized elderly patients with stroke. An experimental quantitative design was conducted, comparing the scores for self-reported pain, anxiety, blood pressure, heart rate and pain of two groups of patients before and immediately after, and {{three days after the}} intervention. The intervention consisted of ten minutes of slow-stroke back massage (SSBM) for seven consecutive evenings. One hundred and two patients participated in the entire study and were randomly assigned to a massage group or a control group. The results revealed that the massage intervention significantly reduced the patients' levels of pain perception and anxiety. In addition to the subjective measures, all physiological measures (systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate) changed positively, indicating relaxation. The prolonged effect of SSBM was also evident, as reflected by the maintenance of the psycho-physiological parameters three days after the massage. The patients' perceptions of SSBM, determined from a questionnaire, revealed positive support for SSBM for elderly stroke patients. The authors suggest that SSBM is an effective nursing <b>intervention</b> for reducing <b>shoulder</b> pain and anxiety in elderly patients with stroke.

Overview of Literature: Intraoperative monitoring during cervical spine surgery is not a universally accepted standard of care. This {{is due in part to}} the paucity of literature regarding the impact of monitoring on patient management or outcome. Methods: SSEP for tibial, median, and ulnar nerves were monitored in 809 consecutive cervical spine operations performed by a single surgeon. The average patient age was 52 years (range, 2 to 88 years), with 472 males and 339 females. Cases were screened for significant degradation or loss of SSEP data. Specific attention was paid to 1) what interventions were performed in response to the SSEP degradation with subsequent improvement, and 2) whether SSEP changes corresponded with postoperative neurological deficits. Results: Seventeen of 809 patients (2. 1 %) had SSEP degradation that met warning criteria and therefore prompted <b>intervention.</b> Release of <b>shoulder</b> tape (8) or traction (4) most often resulted in SSEP improvement. Failure of SSEP data to return to within acceptable limits of baseline was associated with neurological deficit (p= 0. 04). Two patients awoke with new postoperative neurological deficits, which resolved in 6 hours and 2 months respectively. Patients with ossification of the posterio...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionShoulder work-related {{musculoskeletal}} disorders represent a major occupational health problem. The most common shoulder disorder {{described in the}} literature is the subacromial impingement syndrome. This pathomechanism is generally associated with an abnormal superior humeral head migration during arm elevation. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of a specific closed-chain humeral head centering exercise on shoulder pain and function at workplace. Materials and methods 20 subjects with impingement symptoms have performed 5 dynamic humeral head centering sessions with the help of a specific device (Scapuleo™, Europhyseo). Shoulder pain and function were evaluated at baseline, after the first exercise session (immediate effects) and after the last exercise session (<b>intervention</b> program effects). <b>Shoulder</b> pain was assessed by means of visual analog scale. Shoulder function was evaluated using analytic active range of motion tests (modified Yocum test; arm abduction) and functional test (repetitive pointing task). ResultsAfter the first training session, shoulder pain significantly decreased (P< 0. 01). One-session effect was also observed on shoulder range of motion during both modified Yocum test (P< 0. 001) and arm abduction (P< 0. 01). Finally, all dependent variables were significantly improved at the end of the intervention program. DiscussionThe results of this study could be explained by humeral head centering improvement and rotator cuff muscles recruitment. Immediate and apparent beneficial effects induced by this intervention program fitted health and performance issues, essential for individuals as for companies. This study underlined the relevance of specific therapeutic exercises in work-related musculoskeletal management at the workplace...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a little}} hamlet which straggled {{along the side of}} a creek formed by the {{discharge}} of a small brook into the sea, and was hidden from the castle, to which it had been in former times an appendage, by the <b>intervention</b> of the <b>shoulder</b> of a hill forming a projecting headland. It was called Wolf's Hope (i.e. Wolf's Haven), and the few inhabitants gained a precarious subsistence by manning two or three fishing-boats in the herring season, and smuggling gin and brandy during the winter months. They paid a kind of hereditary respect to the Lords of Ravenswood; but, in the difficulties of the family, most of the inhabitants of Wolf's Hope had contrived to get feu-rights to their little possessions, their huts, kail-yards, and rights of commonty, so that they were emancipated from the chains of feudal dependence, and free from the various exactions with which, under every possible pretext, or without any pretext at all, the Scottish landlords of the period, themselves in great poverty, were wont to harass their still poorer tenants at will. They might be, on the whole, termed independent, a circumstance peculiarly galling to Caleb, who had been wont to exercise over them the same sweeping authority in levying contributions which was exercised in former times in England, when [...] "the royal purveyors, sallying forth from under the Gothic portcullis to purchase provisions with power and prerogative, instead of money, brought home the plunder of an hundred markets, and all that could be seized from a flying and hiding country, and deposited their spoil in an hundred caverns." ...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{shoulder}} impingement is {{the most}} common pathology of all shoulder pain referrals. Impingement syndrome can cause functional disability and reduce quality of life and may {{contribute to the development of}} rotator cuff disease. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of a motor control based exercise <b>intervention</b> for <b>shoulder</b> impingement patients. Methods: sixteen young adults with shoulder pain (mean age 24. 61. 6, range 18 - 34 years, 11 males) were recruited from the local community. Inclusion criteria were: current shoulder pain severe enough to limit activity for more than one week and impingement signs. Diagnostic ultrasound imaging was used to exclude participants with complete rotator cuff tears. Mean duration of shoulder symptoms was 16 months (range 4 - 36 months). Physical screening of pain participants was conducted in order to derive a clinical presentation of shoulder impingement using three clinical tests; Hawkins-Kennedy, Neer’s and Painful Arc. A 10 week motor control retraining package was targeted at correcting movement impairments of the scapula by re-educating muscle recruitment. There were two components to the package: 1) Motor control exercises to correct alignment and coordination, which involve a) controlling scapular orientation during active arm movements; b) muscle-specific exercises for trapezius and serratus anterior; 2) Commonly used manual therapy techniques to reduce joint and muscle restrictions. Participants underwent three data collection sessions; pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and six months post-intervention (13 participants completed post). The and Disability Index (SPADI); other questionnaires included the Disabilities of Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Short-Form 36 (SF- 36), visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain. Results: the SPADI scores improved on average by 10 (7) and 13 (6) points at the 10 week and 6 months assessments respectively. These changes were statistically significant (p< 0. 001) and reachedthe Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). Pain scores on the 10 -point VAS also reduced immediately after and 6 months postintervention with a mean reduction of 3. 4 (1. 5) and 4. 3 (2) respectively. DASH improved by 9. 2 (10. 3) at 10 weeks and 11. 8 (6. 3) at 6 months, whilst small improvements were also seen in the OSS (4. 74) and SF- 36 physical scores (3. 84. 9). Immediately postintervention the physical tests for impingement syndrome were negative for 15 / 16 participants. Conclusions: the present findings suggest that a 10 week programme of specific motor control exercises can improve function and pain in young adults with shoulder impingement. Improvements persisted at 6 months but effectiveness in the longer-term needs to be examined and compared with other exercise interventions in a randomized controlled trial involving a wider age range of shoulder impingement patients.

40|$|M. Ed. The {{educational}} system in South Africa {{has been in}} a process of massive restructuring since the advent of democracy. Globally, the move towards an inclusive system of education which is based on a more humanistic philosophy, has also impacted on the changes. Although these changes are imperative, the fiscal realities in which this is taking place has necessitated a plan of action which has to take this into account. The number of psychologists who have been employed by the Department of Education to form part of the Education Support Services (ESS), has decreased in proportion to the population they are required to serve. In addition, the release of Education White Paper No 6, makes allowance for all learners to attend mainstream schools. Direction and guidelines are provided in this study which call for a dynamic approach for addressing barriers to learning and for providing support for learners in need. There is however the reference to the establishment of district, provincial and school support teams, as well as the strengthening of Education Support Services. The White Paper acknowledges the large number of Learners with Special Educational Needs (LSEN) who are not receiving the necessary support and intervention. The idea of an inclusive system of education, places the responsibility for primary <b>intervention,</b> on the <b>shoulders</b> of the educators. At the same time, in adapting to meet these challenges, the whole school developmental approach is necessary, in any effort towards the development of a support system, at school level. School Based Support teams are expected to facilitate primary intervention in terms of addressing barriers to learning. Although the role and functions have been identified, not much attention has been given to the problems or barriers which impact on educators or the needs that have to be addressed, to make it possible to provide support for learners and educators. In addition, information regarding the support strategies that have to be employed as well as the processes relating to setting up such support structures is necessary. The researcher {{has been a part of}} the district support services for a number of years and thus identified the need for a study to look into the practical implementation of support at school level in the light of fiscal constraints. A qualitative study has thus been undertaken in an attempt to gain an understanding of the current situation as perceived by educators. The methods used have included the use of questionnaires, individual interviews and focus group interviews. Educators from eight schools participated in the study comprising two from each of the former education departments. These educators (which included 1 principal) were members of the school based support teams (SBSTs) in their respective schools. The idea was to obtain views from a broad cross section of educators. This had to be valid and ethically appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Shoulder {{disorders}} {{are a common}} health problem in western societies. Several treatment protocols {{have been developed for}} the clinical management of persons with shoulder pain. However available evidence does not support any protocol as being superior over others. Systematic reviews provide some evidence that certain physical therapy interventions (i. e. supervised exercises and mobilisation) are effective in particular shoulder disorders (i. e. rotator cuff disorders, mixed shoulder disorders and adhesive capsulitis), but there is an ongoing need for high quality trials of physical therapy interventions. Usually, physical therapy consists of active exercises intended to strengthen the shoulder muscles as stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint or perform mobilisations to improve restricted mobility of the glenohumeral or adjacent joints (shoulder girdle). It is generally accepted that a-traumatic shoulder problems are the result of impingement of the subacromial structures, such as the bursa or rotator cuff tendons. Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in shoulder muscles may also lead to a complex of symptoms that are often seen in patients diagnosed with subacromial impingement or rotator cuff tendinopathy. Little is known about the treatment of MTrPs in patients with shoulder disorders. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether physical therapy modalities to inactivate MTrPs can reduce symptoms and improve shoulder function in daily activities in a population of chronic a-traumatic shoulder patients when compared to a wait-and-see strategy. In addition we investigate the recurrence rate during a one-year-follow-up period. Methods/Design This paper presents the design for a randomized controlled trial to be conducted between September 2007 – September 2008, evaluating the effectiveness of a physical therapy treatment for non-traumatic shoulder complaints. One hundred subjects are included in this study. All subjects have unilateral shoulder pain for at least six months and are referred to a physical therapy practice specialized in musculoskeletal disorders of the neck-, shoulder-, and arm. After the initial assessment patients are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control-group (wait and see). The primary outcome measure is the overall score of the Dutch language version of the DASH (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire. Discussion Since there is only little evidence for the efficacy of physical therapy <b>interventions</b> in certain <b>shoulder</b> disorders, there is a need for further research. We found only a few studies examining the efficacy of MTrP therapy for shoulder disorders. Therefore we will perform a randomised clinical trial of the effect of physical therapy interventions aimed to inactivate MTrPs, on pain and impairment in shoulder function in a population of chronic a-traumatic shoulder patients. We opted for an intervention strategy that best reflects daily practice. Manual high velocity thrust techniques and dry-needling are excluded. Because in most physical therapy interventions, blinding of the patient and the therapist is not possible, we will perform a randomised, controlled and observer-blinded study. Trial Registration This randomized clinical trial is registered at current controlled trials ISRCTN 75722066. </p...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Rehabilitation Science. Advisor: Paula M. Ludewig, PhD. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 247 pages, appendices 1 - 25. The elderly population {{are at risk}} of having shoulder pain and dysfunction. One possible contributor to shoulder impairment is abnormal scapulothoracic and glenohumeral motion. Comparing the elderly and young age groups based on changes in kinematics and thoracic posture during completion of day-to-day functional tasks is not well understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare three-dimensional shoulder kinematics, thoracic posture and shoulder strength between asymptomatic elderly and young individuals. Subjects included 50 asymptomatic right dominant, gender and BMI matched individuals equally divided into young (20 to 40 years) and elderly (above 65 years) groups. A 3 D electromagnetic motion capture system was used to record scapulothoracic and glenohumeral angular positions during scapular plane abduction, forward reach, reaching the back, reaching the wallet and touching the head tasks. Kinematics were computed at 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of the humeral angular motions. A 3 D CT based reconstructed anatomical model was animated based on group mean motion data to compute the minimum linear distance from rotator cuff footprints to potential impinging structures. Thoracic posture in static and dynamic conditions was measured for flexion-extension. Isometric shoulder strength was measured in four directions with a portable dynamometer and strength ratios were computed. Significant kinematic differences between groups were present for humerothoracic elevation range of motion, scapular internal rotation during scapular plane abduction, scapular upward rotation during forward reach, glenohumeral external rotation during forward reach, scapular internal rotation during reaching the back, scapular posterior tilt during reaching the back and scapular internal rotation during reaching the wallet. The mean differences between groups were less than 8 ° with the exception of glenohumeral external rotation (< 19 °) during the forward reach task. Overall, relative to the number of comparisons, few group differences existed for the tested conditions and those that were different had small magnitude. It was believed that these differences represent natural consequences of aging even in the absence of shoulder pain or dysfunction. Minimum linear distance was reduced in the elderly for forward reach and reaching the wallet tasks. It was believed, however, that position was the issue during reaching the wallet task since both groups had submillimeter minimum distances for that task. Significant dynamic thoracic flexion-extension differences between groups existed for reaching the back and reaching the wallet tasks. However, the magnitudes of the differences between groups were less than 2 °, so it was thought that these differences were not clinically meaningful. Significant reduction in shoulder strength for the elderly group was evident in flexion, abduction, external rotation and internal rotation directions, but strength ratios were similar for both the groups. Based on the findings it was assumed that forward reach and possibly reaching the wallet tasks may benefit from further investigation due to the possibility of higher potential for rotator cuff compression in the elderly group. Maintaining strength ratios may be protective for developing rotator cuff disease. Modification of the forward reaching and reaching the wallet tasks may be considered while planning <b>shoulder</b> <b>intervention</b> strategies for the elderly...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acute {{anterior}} dislocation is the commonest type of shoulder dislocation {{and usually}} results from an injury. Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and {{more susceptible to}} redislocation, especially in active young adults. Objectives: To compare methods of conservative (non-surgical) management versus no treatment or different methods of conservative management after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>Interventions</b> include methods of postreduction immobilisation and rehabilitation. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the National Research Register (UK), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing various conservative interventions versus control (no or sham treatment) or other conservative interventions applied after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Data collection and analysis: All authors selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Main results: One flawed quasi-randomised trial was included. A "preliminary report" gave the results for 40 adults with primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder treated by post-reduction immobilisation with the arm in either external or internal rotation. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the two groups in the failure to return to pre-injury sports by previously active athletes, in redislocation or shoulder instability. Similar numbers of participants of the two groups removed their immobiliser before one week had passed. Authors' conclusions: There is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform the choices for conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Sufficiently powered, good quality, well reported randomised controlled trials with long-term surveillance of conservative management are required. In particular, trials examining the type and duration of immobilisation would be useful. Plain language summary: Non-surgical management after non-surgical repositioning of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder: Acute anterior shoulder dislocation is an injury where the top end of the upper arm bone is pushed out of the joint socket in a forward direction. Afterwards, the shoulder is less stable and prone to redislocation, especially in active young adults. Initial treatment involves putting the joint back; this is called 'reduction'. 'Closed reduction' refers to cases where this is done without surgery. Subsequent treatment is often conservative (non-surgical), and generally involves placing the injured arm in a sling or other immobilising device followed by exercises. After a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials that compared different methods of conservative management for these injuries, we included only one small trial. This compared immobilisation of the arm in either external rotation (where the arm was orientated outwards with the forearm away from the chest) or internal rotation (the usual sling position where the arm rests against the chest) following closed reduction. Preliminary results for 40 adults showed no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} in terms of previously active athletes' return to pre-injury sports, nor in redislocation or shoulder instability. Similar numbers of participants in each of the two groups removed their immobiliser before one week had passed. This multicentre trial was flawed by its use of inadequate methods of allocating patients to the trial intervention groups and its inadequate assessment of outcome. In conclusion, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform the choices for conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder...|$|R
