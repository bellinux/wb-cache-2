50|$|A belt weigher replaces a short {{section of}} the support {{mechanism}} of the belt, which might be one or more sets of <b>idler</b> <b>rollers,</b> or a short section of channel or plate. This weighed support is mounted on load cells, either pivoted, counterbalanced or not, or fully suspended. The mass measured by the load cells is integrated with the belt speed to compute the mass of material moving on the belt, after allowing for {{the mass of the}} belt itself. Belt weighers generally include the necessary electronics to perform this calculation, often {{in the form of a}} small industrialized microprocessor system.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{established}} to develop a process for the selection, design, installation, test and evaluation of mass-flow rate measurement systems for root crop harvesting. Also to assess consistency and precision of the weighing systems incorporated with crop feed arrangements, laboratory and field studies were carried out. Experiments were conducted to evaluate conveyor belt weighing systems using an experimental apparatus and commercial potato harvester. Two weighing systems were evaluated: (a) cantilever transducers fitted to the conveyor belt mechanism and (b) a load cell system supporting the total weight of the conveyor and crop. The results of laboratory studies with sugar beet/potatoes showed that the standard cantilever transducers gave the smallest percentage of the mean experimental error ranged from 1. 56 % and standard deviation from 1. 43 kg (connected to one <b>idler</b> <b>roller)</b> to 2. 42 % and 2. 61 kg (connected to three <b>idler</b> <b>roller)</b> with an appropriate values equal to 1. 03 % and 0. 54 kg (connected to two <b>idler</b> <b>roller).</b> The load cell supporting system also gave the smallest persentage of the mean experimental error ranged from 2. 07 % and standard deviation fro...|$|R

40|$|High {{incidence}} of injuries {{caused by the}} manual handling of heavy <b>idler</b> <b>rollers</b> {{is a major concern}} for the Australian mining industry. Consequently, major mining industry stakeholders called for the development of light weight <b>idler</b> <b>rollers.</b> As a result this project was designed to develop a light weight idler roller using pultruded continuous glass fibre, vinyl ester composite circular hollow section. Current literature on the subject highlighted the need for non-ferrous light weight <b>idler</b> <b>rollers</b> but offers no real solution. A rigorous test regime, including physical static and dynamic testing in conjunction with finite element analysis, was used to analyse a designed light weight composite prototype idler roller. The main empirical finding of the project was the possibility of producing shaftless lightweight composite <b>idler</b> <b>rollers</b> for use in the mining industry. The conceptual shaftless composite rollers are estimated to be 40 - 60 % lighter than traditional steel rollers. The light weight of the concept idler roller, combined with the possibility of manufacturing <b>idler</b> <b>rollers</b> that are dimensionally suitable for mining, addressed the concerns of the Australian mining industry and answered the call to develop a light weight conveyor belt idler roller. ...|$|E
40|$|The University of Newcastle has {{undertaken}} a systematic research program to identify, model and measure key design elements {{to reduce the}} energy consumption of belt conveyors. Research outcomes include the development of theoretical models to accurately predict the main resistances of belt conveyors, in parallel with developing extensive test facilities to verify the new models and to provide industry with data {{that can be used}} directly in the design process. This paper discusses the application of these models and test results for conveyor design, demonstrating the advantages of informed component selection to not only reduce energy consumption, but also total cost of ownership. In particular, the combination of design parameters is discussed in relation to the rotating resistance of <b>idler</b> <b>rollers,</b> conveyor belt indentation rolling resistance and conveyor belt and bulk material flexure resistance. Through a combination of theoretical models and measured data, trends are identified to assist in the design of energy efficient belt conveyor systems...|$|E
40|$|An {{emergency}} {{situation in a}} continuous transport system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered. This situation can be brought about by various factors. In technological equipment of environmental continuous belt conveyor systems and pipe conveyors various adverse critical conditions may arise, which may result {{in the creation of}} an {{emergency situation}}. In particular, both conveyor and supporting rollers being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an emergency situation. Any damage to them can lead to a reduction or a complete standstill of the continuous transport process, which impedes upon the subsequent production operations. This contribution describes the possibility of the measurement and assessment of normal contact forces, which are applied by the conveyor belt to the supporting rollers on the hexagonal <b>idler</b> <b>roller</b> support of the pipe conveyors. This allows an early prediction of the critical condition and thus any developing emergency situation can be forestalled...|$|R
50|$|Boddington Bauxite Mine in Western Australia {{is officially}} {{recognised}} {{as having the}} world's longest and second-longest single belts with a 31 km belt feeding a 20 km (12.5 miles) long belt. This system feeds bauxite through the difficult terrain of the Darling Ranges to the Worsley Alumina refinery. The longest single-belt international conveyor runs from Meghalaya in India to a cement factory at Chhatak Bangladesh. It is about 17 km long and conveys limestone and shale at 960 tons/hour, from the quarry in India to the cement factory (7 km long in India and 10 km long in Bangladesh). The conveyor was engineered by AUMUND France and Larsen & Toubro. The conveyor is actuated by three synchronized drive units for a total power of about 1.8 MW supplied by ABB (two drives at the head end in Bangladesh and one drive {{at the tail end}} in India). The conveyor belt was manufactured in 300-meter lengths on the Indian side and 500-meter lengths on the Bangladesh side, and was installed on-site by NILOS India. The <b>idlers,</b> or <b>rollers,</b> of the system are unique in that they are designed to accommodate both horizontal and vertical curves along the terrain. Dedicated vehicles were designed for the maintenance of the conveyor, which is always at a minimum height of 5 m above the ground to avoid being flooded during monsoon periods.|$|R
50|$|The general lay out of {{the vehicle}} mimicked that of the Vickers vehicle it was based on. The {{suspension}} was made out of Horstmann suspensions resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. This design, exclusively used on lightweight vehicles, was also used on the Light Tank Mk VI of the Royal army and was invented by Sidney Horstmann. Apart from being relatively easy to build, compact and lightweight, it had the advantage of having a long travel, and of being easy to replace when damaged in the field. The drive sprocket was in the front, but there were no <b>idlers</b> or return <b>rollers.</b> Motor power {{came in the form of}} a Meadows 5 cylinder gasoline engine, producing 51 hp, coupled with a four speed preselector gearbox. Steering was a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The traverse of the turret was man powered by the three man crew. The T-13s were not equipped with a radio.|$|R
40|$|T-slide linear {{actuators}} use gear bearing differential epicyclical transmissions (GBDETs) to directly drive a linear rack, which, in turn, performs the actuation. Conventional systems use a rotary power source {{in conjunction with}} a nut and screw to provide linear motion. Non-back-drive properties of GBDETs make the new actuator more direct and simpler. Versions of this approach will serve as a long-stroke, ultra-precision, position actuator for NASA science instruments, and as a rugged, linear actuator for NASA deployment duties. The T slide can operate effectively in the presence of side forces and torques. Versions of the actuator can perform ultra-precision positioning. A basic T-slide actuator is a long-stroke, rack-and-pinion linear actuator that, typically, consists of a T-slide, several idlers, a transmission to drive the slide (powered by an electric motor) and a housing that holds the entire assembly. The actuator is driven by gear action on its top surface, and is guided and constrained by gear-bearing idlers on its other two parallel surfaces. The geometry, implemented with gear-bearing technology, is particularly effective. An electronic motor operating through a GBDET can directly drive the T slide against large loads, as a rack and pinion linear actuator, with no break and no danger of back driving. The actuator drives the slide into position and stops. The slide holes position with power off and no brake, regardless of load. With the T slide configuration, this GBDET has an entire T-gear surface on which to operate. The GB idlers coupling the other two T slide parallel surfaces to their housing counterpart surfaces provide constraints in five degrees-of-freedom and rolling friction in the direction of actuation. Multiple GB <b>idlers</b> provide <b>roller</b> bearing strength sufficient to support efficient, rolling friction movement, even in the presence of large, resisting forces. T-slide actuators can be controlled using the combination of an off-the-shelf, electric servomotor, a motor angle resolution sensor (typically an encoder or resolver), and microprocessor-based intelligent software. In applications requiring precision positioning, {{it may be necessary to}} add strain gauges to the T-slide housing. Existing sensory- interactive motion control art will work for T slides. For open-loop positioning, a stepping motor emulation technique can be used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this investigation, a {{computational}} {{finite element}} procedure for the deformation and stress {{analysis of the}} chain links of tracked vehicles is presented and {{used to examine the}} validity of using the static approach in the design and stress analysis of tracked vehicles. The contact forces resulting from the interaction between the track links and the vehicle components (sprocket, <b>idler,</b> and the <b>rollers)</b> as well as the interaction between the track links and the ground are evaluated using continuous force models, which are used to define generalized contact forces associated with the deformation degrees of freedom of the track links using the virtual work. The dynamic forces including the contact forces used in the finite element procedure developed in this investigation are evaluated using a 54 -body vehicle model in which the track is modeled as a closed kinematic chain with 42 degrees of freedom. It is demonstrated in this study that the effect of the contact forces is more significant as compared to the effect of the rigid-body inertia forces of the chain links, and consequently, it is assumed that the deformation of the track links does not {{have a significant effect on}} the overall motion of the vehicle. In the finite element computational procedure used in this study, three-dimensional solid elements are used to discretize the links of the track chain. The numerical results presented in this investigation demonstrate that the use of the static analysis may lead to low estimates of the stresses of the track links as compared to those obtained by a dynamic stress analysis that takes into consideration the time history of the forces...|$|R
