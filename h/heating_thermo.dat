40|$|This study {{presents}} a Multi-Chip-Module-based (MCM) micro-system suited for irrigation control and management applications. The micro-system includes the soil moisture sensor and an analogue-to-digital converter with signal processing circuitry. The same basic fabrication concepts and materials which made microelectronics successful {{are now being}} adapted to making low-cost, small, and high-performance sensor systems with integrated electronics on the same micro-system. Since this sensor has low-cost fabrication for mass production, a network could be implemented {{in order to achieve}} an accurate measurement of the soil moisture at the plant root level. A dual-probe heat-pulse technique is used (measurement of the maximum temperature rise at some distance from the heater, after applying a heat-pulse) to determine the volumetric heat capacity and, hence, the water content of the soil. The sensor module is about 30 mm long, 6 mm wide, and 0. 8 mm in height; the probe pitch is 3 mm allowing small-scale spatial measurements of soil moisture, which can be made near the soil surface where large root densities are found. The heater uses a nickel-chrome resistor for resistive <b>heating</b> (<b>thermo</b> resistive effect – Joule heat).

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{different}} degradation mechanisms of the stainless steel in a travelling grate in a Grate-Kiln iron ore pellet indurator. The travelling grate is a conveyor belt that transports green-body pellets to a rotary kiln while the pellets are being dried and pre-heated to a temperature of 900 - 1100 °C by recycled hot air. After unloading of the pellets to the rotary-kiln for further sintering, the travelling grate is cooled in room temperature while returning to the loading zone of the wet pellets. The steel was tested during thermal cycling in a test-rig, in order to simulate the influence of thermo mechanical fatigue and oxide spallation. The influence of erosion-deposition was investigated in a modified horizontal industrial combustion kiln at 800 °C, with slag and coal from production used as erosive media and combustion fuel, respectively. The influence of minor alloying additions of Mn, Si and Ti on the microstructure was explored by eight different casted alloy compositions. Isothermal heat treatments were performed at 800 °C during 200 hours on steel immersed in deposits recovered from a travelling grate in production. The three main degradation mechanisms found in this work are thermal spallation, erosion-deposition and deposit induced accelerated corrosion (DIAC). Thermal spallation of the oxide layer {{is caused by the}} thermal expansion difference between the oxide and the metal during heating and cooling. It has been found that Ti improves the spallation resistance while Si reduces it. Spallation of deposits is another cause believed to increase the degradation. Erosion-deposition appears due to simultaneous erosion and deposition of particles on the travelling grate that causes erosion or deposition depending on the amount of alkali metals in the environment. The velocity of the particles also influences erosion and deposition in the way that higher velocities increase erosion. DIAC is proposed to form on the travelling grate due to the concentration of chloride- and sulphate containing alkali metals in the deposits.  Other than these major degrading mechanisms, minor degradation mechanisms such as internal oxidation, sigma formation, carburization and sensitization towards inter-granular attack have been found inside the steel during <b>heating.</b> <b>Thermo</b> mechanical fatigue (TMF) causes intergranular cracks in the material of the travelling grate. Casting issues such as micro-segregation have also been addressed in this thesis. A few different ways to improve degradation resistance have been proposed, such as homogenization heat treatments, optimization of process parameters and inhibitor solutions. ...|$|E

But now additionally the movement towards harsher application environments leads to new problems in automotive applications (also e-mobility) {{as well as in}} power applications for regenerative energy systems (solar, offshore, geothermal etc.).

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{extension}} of former works by the present authors, in which the influence of the chemical models by Gupta and by Park was evaluated on thermo-fluid-dynamic parameters in the flow field, including transport coefficients, related characteristic numbers and heat flux on two current capsules (EXPERT and Orion) during the high altitude re-entry path. The results verified that the models, even computing different air compositions in the flow field, compute only slight different compositions on the capsule surface, therefore the difference in the heat flux is not very relevant. In the above mentioned studies, ionization was neglected because the velocities of the capsules (about 5000 m/s for EXPERT and about 7600 m/s for Orion) were not high enough to activate meaningful ionization. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the incidence of ionization, linked to the chemical models by Gupta and by Park, on both <b>heat</b> flux and <b>thermo</b> fluid-dynamic parameters. The present computer tests were carried out by a direct simulation Monte Carlo code (DS 2 V) in the velocity interval 7600 - 12000 m/s, considering only the Orion capsule at an altitude of 85 km. The present results verified what already found namely when ionization is not considered, the chemical models compute only a slight different gas composition in the core of the shock wave and practically the same composition on the surface therefore the same heat flux. On the opposite, the results verified that when ionization is considered, the chemical models compute different compositions in the whole shock layer and on the surface therefore different heat flux. The analysis of the results relies on a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation of the effects of ionization on both chemical models. The main result of the study is that when ionization is taken into account, the Park model is more reactive than the Gupta model; consequently, the heat flux computed by Park is lower than the one computed by Gupta...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the most {{important}} sources among renewables to reach the global energy requirements without the concomitant production of greenhouses gases. Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems have been recognized as a promising technology thanks to the easy integration with Thermal Energy Storage (TES) devices, which allow to overcome the intrinsic unsteady nature of the solar energy. Gas–solid Fluidized Bed (FB) systems can play a key role when employed as solar receiver/reactor: the high thermal conductivity and diffusivity in such reactors can help in absorbing the concentrated solar energy ensuring low heat losses and in equalizing the <b>heat</b> received avoiding <b>thermo</b> mechanical stresses to both reactor walls and reactive materials. The work performed in this PhD Thesis was devoted to the investigation of gas–solid FBs as solar receiver/reactor in CSP systems. In particular, in the present PhD Thesis an integration between solar energy and conventional fossil fuels sources has been proposed. An integrated scheme of a continuous Calcium Looping (CaL) process for CO 2 capture from combustion flue gases of a power plant, based on FB technology and sustained by a CSP, was developed. Storage of the excess incident solar power during the daytime as calcined sorbent, which is eventually utilized in the CaL loop during the nighttime, was proposed to overcome the inherently unsteadiness of CSP systems. The potentialities of a similar integrated scheme were assessed by means of model computations to estimate the main features, performance, storage and energy requirements of the process. Model computations of a base case suggested that in order to couple a CSP with a 100 MWth combustion plant, the use of two storage vessels of nearly 2000 m 3 is required, together with the building of an heliostat field of 0. 26 sqkm. The heat recovery in the carbonator is of crucial importance and allows to largely increase the overall thermal throughput of the power plant. It was also highlighted that larger inlet Ca/C molar ratio could result into a higher CO 2 capture efficiency but at the expense of a larger energy requirement for the heliostat field. In order to study the practical feasibility of the process, directly irradiated FB systems were considered, as the direct heating configuration permits to obtain the high operating temperatures required to perform the calcination reaction. Initial studies were targeted at the comprehension of the heat transfer phenomena in directly irradiated FBs, with the aim of establishing the efficiency of the solar FB receiver. Experimental investigations were performed by mapping through a thermal infrared camera the surface of a fluidized bed subjected to a concentrated solar simulated radiation. Experimental results suggested that collection of incident radiation changes from a surface-receiver to a volumetric receiver paradigm as the gas superficial velocity is increased from fixed to bubbling fluidized bed conditions: this also results in a significant reduction of peak temperature and temperature fluctuations at the focal point of the receiver. A strong reduction of bed surface temperature has been obtained by exploring an uneven fluidization strategy and, in turn, by tailoring the hydrodynamics of the bed through injecting a chains of bubbles from a nozzle located in the proximity of the radiation focal point. A compartmental heat transfer model which provides a simple, though accurate, equation for predicting in-bed dispersion of radiative power and extent of temperature non-uniformity was also developed. Finally, a directly irradiated gas–solid FB reactor suitable for the investigation of thermochemical heat storage processes has been designed and operated to study the solar CaL process. Several calcination carbonation reactions were performed on an Italian Ca based sorbent (Massicci), and its CO 2 capture capacity was evaluated over repeated cycling. The operation of the directly irradiated FB reactor resulted into a continuous fluctuation of the bed surface temperature, with a mean over temperature value of over 100 °C. The CO 2 capture capacity of the investigated limestone showed a first initial decreasing trend followed by a stabilization at lower values, with a residual CO 2 capture capacity of about 6 %. According to the obtained results, the solar CaL process appears to be a practicable way toward the integration of conventional fossil fuels and energy sources, with the aim of both taking advantage of the solar energy and reducing CO 2 emissions...|$|R
