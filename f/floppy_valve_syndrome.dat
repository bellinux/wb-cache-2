40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the <b>floppy</b> <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{not fully}} solved. An almost invariable histological finding is the great accumulation of mucinous material in the valve leaflets and constitutes {{the basis of the}} valvular theory of the syndrome. The presence of a mucinous layer in normal valves [...] the zona spongiosa [...] is not well recognised. To establish the normal range of the extent of this zone, 50 excised mitral valves from patients aged 2 to 89 years and who {{died as a result of}} road traffic accidents or non-cardiac causes have been analysed by measuring the thickness of the zone in relation to the valve thickness. A range of 0 to 60 per cent was found and this was not influenced by age. The findings were compared with 50 patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from the <b>floppy</b> <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A value of over 60 per cent (range 62 to 94 %) was found in 43 patients. The increase in the extent of the mucinous material was considered to be a secondary change in the thickened fibrosa which normally accompanies the <b>floppy</b> <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Measurements of zona spongiosa falling within the normal range were found in seven patients. The clinical features, complications, and accompanying conditions have also been analysed. Chordal rupture had occurred in 20 patients, infective endocarditis in three, and calcification was found in four valves. In four patients the aortic valve was also involved and accompanying aortic root dilatation in an additional patient. It is suggested that these patients should not be included in the group of Marfan's forme fruste, nor in the typical floppy mitral valve syndrome. Apart from the valvular theory, the myocardial theory in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been discussed and the components ensuring normal mitral valve function have been reviewed. It is concluded that an inherent, prominent zona spongiosa predisposes to the <b>floppy</b> <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome,</b> particularly if any one of the components of normal valve function is abnormal...|$|E
50|$|Mitral valve {{prolapse}} (MVP; a.k.a. <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome,</b> systolic click murmur syndrome or billowing mitral leaflet) is a valvular {{heart disease}} characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet into the left atrium during systole. It is the primary form of myxomatous degeneration of the valve. There are various types of MVP, broadly classified as classic and nonclassic. In its nonclassic form, MVP carries a low risk of complications and often can be kept minimal by dietary attention. In severe cases of classic MVP, complications include mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, congestive heart failure, and, in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest.|$|R

In no patient was a <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve</b> considered to be the cause of death. Complications of <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve</b> (ruptured chordae tendineae, bacterial endocarditis, mitral regurgitation and fibrin deposits at the mitral valve-left atrial angle) occurred at approximately the same frequency as that reported in autopsy studies of isolated <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve.</b> In the specimens with <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve</b> and ventricular septal defect, 63 % also had Soppiness of the tricuspid valve, 16 % of the pulmonary valve and 5 % of the aortic valve. The anatomic basis for <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve</b> was considered to be spongiosal invasion and disruption of the fibrosa of the valve leaflet. In this study, spongiosal invasion of the fibrosa was fully developed by 3 months of age and {{there was no evidence that}} the incidence or severity of spongiosal invasion increased between the ages of 3 months and 88 years.

40|$|Human mitral <b>valves</b> (32 <b>floppy</b> and 17 rheumatic) {{obtained}} at surgery were analysed and compared with 35 normal (autopsy) valves. Total amounts of collagen, proteoglycan and elastin were increased approx. 3 -fold in <b>floppy</b> and rheumatic <b>valves.</b> The water content of rheumatic cusps {{was lower than}} normal. The most significant changes in <b>floppy</b> <b>valves</b> were the 59 % increase in mean value of the proteoglycan content, a large increase in the ease of extractability of proteoglycans from 26. 7 to 57. 2 % of the total and a 62 % increase in mean value of the elastin content in the anterior cusps. Normal human mitral valve cusps contained a mean proportion of 29. 3 (and chordae 26. 6) type III collagen (as % of total types III + I collagen), the values increasing significantly to 33. 2 and 36. 3 % respectively in chronic rheumatic disease. The ratio observed in <b>floppy</b> <b>valves</b> depended {{on the extent of}} secondary surface fibrosis, which could be demonstrated histologically; in valve cusps with considerable secondary fibrosis, the percentage of type III increased significantly (to 34. 4 %), whereas it decreased significantly (to 25. 2 %) when fibrosis was negligible.

40|$|A {{total of}} 30 surgically resected {{complete}} mitral valves were examined, without {{prior knowledge of}} the clinical history, to evaluate the reliability of gross inspection only for the correct morphological diagnosis. Twenty valves were rheumatic; 10 were obtained from patients with idiopathic mitral valve prolapse. Two groups were identified: group I correlated with a rheumatic history; group II showed <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valves,</b> which correlated with mitral valve prolapse. Hence, it is considered that the diagnosis of rheumatic or <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve</b> can be established accurately upon gross examination only. The rheumatic valve is fibrotic and firm, leading to thickening and fusion of leaflets and commissures. Narrowing and lowering of the "principal" ostium occurs. This results in a funnel-shaped valve, which is further accentuated by interchordal fusion. Rigidity is its hallmark. Chordal rupture is unlikely. Calcification can be found anywhere in the valve. Hooding is extremely unusual. The <b>floppy</b> <b>valve,</b> by contrast, shows laxity of leaflets, which {{may lead to the}} formation of dome-like deformities reaching above the level of the annulus. The chordae are often thin, attenuated, and may have ruptured. The distribution of chordae and mode of anchoring is often chaotic. Fibrosis occurs mainly at the anchoring sites of the chordae underneath or at the margin of the leaflet, or where previously ruptured, intertwined chordae are plastered underneath the dome. Fibrosis is further aggravated at the margins and atrial surface of the leaflets because of regurgitant friction. In spite of fibrosis, the <b>floppy</b> <b>valve</b> remains soft and flexible. Commissural fusion is absent. Interchordal fusion is not a characteristic feature of the <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve.</b> Gross inspection will not only correctly discriminate between a rheumatic and <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve,</b> but may also contribute {{to an understanding of the}} pathogenesis of the valve deformit...|$|R
40|$|The excised valves of 152 {{consecutive}} {{patients who}} underwent isolated primary mitral valve replacement between May 1979 and July 1983 were studied {{to determine the}} cause of primary (spontaneous) rupture of the chordae tendineae and estimate the prevalence of <b>floppy</b> mitral <b>valve</b> with underlying myxomatous disease. Of these 152 patients, 72 had nonrheumatic disease; 42 (28 % of the total group) had a <b>floppy</b> <b>valve,</b> and 39 of these valves had microscopic changes of myxomatous disease.

40|$|Interstitial deletions in {{chromosome}} 22 {{and features}} associated with CATCH- 22 syndrome {{have been reported}} in patients with conotruncal congenital head anomalies. Absent pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome</b> is characterized by absent or rudimentary pulmonary valve cusps, absent ductus arteriosus, conoventricular septal defect, and massive dilation of the pulmonary arteries. Because absence of the ductus arteriosus is a key element in the pathogenesis of this syndrome and aortic arch malformations are frequently seen in patients with CATCH- 22 syndrome, we hypothesized that patients with absent pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome</b> would have a high incidence of deletions in the critical region of chromosome 22.

In both cases, a large anechoic mass emerging from the right ventricle was visualized and identified as an aneurysmal dilatation of the pulmonary trunk with hypertrophy of the right ventricle. The diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome</b> and a secondary diverticular dilatation of the pulmonary artery was made.

40|$|Despite recent renewed {{interest}} in the detection of tricuspid valve regurgitation by echocardiographic and Doppler techniques, little morphologic information is available on dysfunctioning tricuspid valves. This report describes 45 necropsy patients with clinical and morphologic evidence of pure(no element of stenosis) tricuspid regurgitation and provides morphometric observations (anular circumference, leaflet area) of the tricuspid valve useful in determining the etiology of pure tricuspid regurgitation. Of 45 patients, 24 (53 %) had pure tricuspid regurgitation resulting from an anatomically abnormal valve (prolap 9 e in 7, papillary muscle dysfunction in 6, rheumatic disease in 5, Ebstein's anomaly in 3, infective endocarditis in 2, carcinoid tumor in 1), and 21 (47 %) had an anatomically normal valve with systolic pulmonary artery hypertension (cor pulmonary in 12, mitral stenosis in 9).

This study reviews our experience in managing absent pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome</b> in later presenting children, and techniques used for managing airway compression. Methods: This {{study is a}} retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent repair of absent pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome</b> from 2000 to 2012 at our institution. The primary endpoints were post-operative bronchoscopic and clinical evidence of persistent airway compression and need for reinterventions on the pulmonary arteries. Results: A total of 19 patients were included during the study period. The mean age at repair was 4. 1 ± 3. 0 years (range 10 months- 11 years). In all, seven patients had pre-operative bronchoscopic evidence of airway compression, which was managed by pulmonary artery reduction plasty in four patients and Lecompte manoeuvre in three patients. There were no peri-operative deaths. In patients with pulmonary artery plasty, two had no post-operative airway compression, one patient had improved compression, and one patient had unchanged compression. In patients managed with a Lecompte manoeuvre, two patients had no or trivial airway compression and one had improved compression.

40|$|From January 1981 through December 1991, 1120 {{consecutive}} aortic valves were surgically explanted {{and their}} gross anatomy and histology studied at our university. Rheumatic disease (65 %), dystrophic calcific valvular disease (23 %), noninflammatory {{disease of the}} aortic root and/or <b>floppy</b> aortic <b>valve</b> (6. 3 %), and endocarditis (5. 4 %) were the causes of valve dysfunction. Among the total population the male sex predominated. The male to female ratio was 2. 4 in the group with dystrophic calcific valvular disease and 1. 6 in the group with bacterial endocarditis. The mean age was 37 +/- 7. 5 years in the group with non-inflammatory disease of the aortic root and/or aortic cusps. In the group with dystrophic calcific valvular disease, the mean age was 62 +/- 6. 3 years. Among the 1120 patients, 717 (64. 03 %) underwent surgery for aortic stenotic-incompetence, 250 (22. 25 %) for isolated aortic stenosis, and 153 (13. 72 %) for isolated aortic incompetence. In 449 cases (40. 13 %) a mitral pathology was associated. Chronic rheumatic aortic disease usually caused stenotic insufficiency (92. 8 %). Dystrophic calcific aortic disease caused pure stenosis in 84. 8 % of the cases. Among these, 46 patients (18. 4 %) had a congenitally bicuspidal aortic valve. Pure aortic incompetence was caused by noninflammatory aortic root and/or cusp disease in 44 % of patients, infective endocarditis in 40 %, and rheumatic disease in 16 %. Patients with noninflammatory aortic root and/or cusp disease were divided into three groups: 29 patients with aortic root dilatation and normal cusps, 25 patients with aortic root dilatation and mixomatous infiltration of aortic cusps (<b>floppy</b> aortic <b>valve),</b> and 15 patients with <b>floppy</b> aortic <b>valve</b> and normal aortic root.

Controversy persists regarding the method of establishing right ventricle–pulmonary artery continuity. MethodsAnatomic and demographic parameters were evaluated for patients undergoing repair of tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome</b> from 1990 to 2005, as were perioperative and late postoperative parameters (airway complications, reoperation or catheter-based intervention, and mortality). ResultsTwenty-three patients underwent repair. Median age was 15 days (range 2 - 1154 days). Patients were followed up for 5. 3 ± 3. 9 years. Seventeen (85 %) required preoperative ventilatory assistance. One patient died within 24 hours; 1 patient died 8 months postoperatively. Four patients received valved homografts, and the remainder had valveless connections. All patients underwent reduction pulmonary arterioplasty and mobilization, unifocalization (in 3), and ventricular septal defect closure. Valveless connection recipients had a transannular hood. No patient underwent a Lecompte maneuver. Four patients underwent reoperation for conversion to valveless connection (n = 1), reduction arterioplasty (n = 1), and repair of pulmonary stenosis (n = 2). Three patients required catheter-based intervention, with balloon angioplasty (n = 3) and stent placement (n = 1); 2 now demonstrate equal quantitative lung perfusion.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{two decades of}} research, the precise {{relationship}} of anatomic mitral <b>valve</b> prolapse (<b>floppy</b> <b>valve)</b> to the neuroendocrine disorder (MVP syndrome) remains unclear. In all likelihood they are two separate genetic disorders which travel together in some fashion. Mitral valve prolapse is a common disorder but progressive mitral regurgitation usually occurs late in life and {{in only a few}} patients. Other complications such as bacterial endocarditis, stroke, and sudden death are far less common but can occur at younger ages. The neuroendocrine syndrome in civilian life is mainly seen in young females (interestingly the peak incidence years correspond to peak female sex hormone output) but can be seen in males when subjected to unusual stress such as military service. More recent echocardiographic studies have questioned whether all prolapsing valves are truly abnormal. It has been shown that echographic prolapse can be produced in normal subjects by reducing venous return and impaired venous return may be present in some patients with the MVP syndrome. However, clicks and murmurs are apparently not heard when normal valves prolapse. It is our opinion that the presence of a click or typical murmur requires some anatomic abnormality of the mitral valve. One wonders if minimal valve abnormality (noted and dismissed by Davies) is the valve abnormality present in many young females with MVP syndrome, and that it may remain a mild abnormality throughout life. Recent psychiatric studies suggest that MVP is present in 30 % of patients with Panic Disorder. It is not clear that this psychiatric syndrome is the same thing as the MVP syndrome. In Devereux's study, anxiety proneness was no different in the MVP cohort than in relatives without MVP. It is possible that diagnostic mixing of two similar but separate disorders has occurred, as has been the case since World War I. Perhaps the most important question is whether young patients with MVP syndrome and no echocardiographic criteria for "floppiness" will develop progressive mitral regurgitation or other complications in later life. In other words, how often is MVP syndrome in a young individual without echocardiographic evidence of a <b>floppy</b> <b>valve</b> a precourser to eventual progressive mitral regurgitation? Are there two different populations? Because of the long course of the disorder, several more years of observation (and, it is hoped, prospective longitudinal study) will be required to answer this question...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} patients presenting with Tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome</b> to a {{tertiary care}} hospital and their surgical management. METHODS: The retrospective {{study was conducted}} at Congenital Cardiac Services, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, and comprised data of Tetralogy of Fallot patients between April 2007 and June 2012. Data was analysed together with follow-up echocardiography. Variables assessed included demographics, imaging, operative technique, complications, post-operative recovery and follow-up echocardiography. SPSS 17 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 204 patients, 6 (3 %) had undergone surgical correction for Tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>syndrome.</b> All 6 (100 %) patients underwent complete repair. Median age for surgery was 8. 5 years (range: 0. 5 - 29 years). Of the different surgical strategies used, Contegra and Bioprosthetic valve placement had satisfactory outcome with minimal gradient at Right Ventricular Outflow Tract, good ventricular function and mild valvular regurgitation. One (16. 6 %) patient with Trans Annular Patch developed post-operative Right Ventricle Outflow Tract gradient of 80 mmHg with moderate pulmonary regurgitation. One (16. 6 %) patient with monocusp valve developed free pulmonary regurgitation at 6 months. The other 4 (66. 6 %) patients are currently free from any complications or re-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Early surgery is preferred in symptomatic patients. The repair depends upon achieving integrity of pulmonary circulation which is best achieved by using right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit or inserting a pulmonary valve...|$|R
