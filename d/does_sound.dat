500|$|Louise McCudden of Inthenews.co.uk, however, {{argued that}} {{although}} [...] "her voice sounds pleasant [...] the song itself {{is too long}} and becomes tedious fairly fast." [...] Vicki Lutas had a mostly negative review for the song saying [...] "at {{the end of the}} day it <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> like something you could have made up when you were at school", though she did praise the backing track for being [...] "dark, eerie and cold in a chilling way; in an infectious way". However she pointed out that [...] "the vocal arrangement and the actual vocals themselves do nothing more for the song", and respected that [...] "it's a brave song choice, but it's hap-hazard vocal line seems to scream... C-R-I-N-G-E.".|$|E
500|$|Mark Deming of AllMusic {{awarded the}} album {{three out of}} five stars, commenting on the band's musical shift; he wrote, [...] "By Shonen Knife's standards, Overdrive <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> {{like some sort of}} hard rock album, and the {{attempts}} to make like Kiss, Thin Lizzy, or Deep Purple come off better than one might expect, though Yamano's guitar skills are less impressive than those of the average metal axe slinger." [...] Deming complimented the charm of the album, but criticized Yamano's lyrics as [...] "run-of-the-mill", ill-fitting the change in musical direction. The site selected [...] "Black Crow", [...] "Ramen Rock", and [...] "Green Tea" [...] as album highlights. Joe Goggins of Drowned in Sound awarded the album 6 out of 10 stars, and complimented the band for successfully managing to release nineteen studio albums. However, he was slightly critical of the [...] "derivative" [...] nature of the band's sound, as well as their [...] "one-dimensional guitar playing and unrelentingly trivial lyrics".|$|E
500|$|On Slant Magazines [...] "Best of the Aughts" [...] list, {{the album}} was placed at numbersix out of one-hundred. Reflecting on the album's reception, Chater felt it was well {{received}} because [...] "It's light-hearted and fun to listen to and there is depth there as well. There are some sadder moments that I think has made it resonate and made it last. It <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> like a 23 year old kid in his bedroom making a record to me, but you can hear that innocence and joy in the discovery of finding all those sounds. So {{that was kind of}} infectious for people." [...] In October 2010, it was listed at No.10 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. Philip Sherburne, writing for Rhapsody, said that [...] "along with DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, this is one of plunderphonic music's greatest LPs." [...] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] {{has been}} mixed. Ruth Harrison from 'Female First' {{was impressed by}} the song after initially being worried that Cole {{would not be able to}} cope going solo. She said [...] "Whilst it <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> just a little bit Girls Aloud-y, we still love it, and can see it being a huge hit on the club circuit up and down the country ... we think this is going to send her well on her way to global superstardom." [...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic. Sara Scribner from Los Angeles Times said that A Thousand Leaves was a {{monotonous}} [...] "experimental, psychedelic record" [...] that felt [...] "like a passionless, less thoughtful shadow of [...] former self". J.D. Considine of Entertainment Weekly stated similar cons, calling the record [...] "the {{sort of thing}} that gives art rock a bad name." [...] Ben Ratliff of Rolling Stone found the songs to be unnecessarily long and sluggish, commenting that the album [...] "really <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> like a demo — eleven songs waiting for better organization and cliché removal". Similarly, Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club felt that the album rarely contained fully formed songs and that the band should start [...] "completing its ideas before recording them for posterity." [...] Orlando Weekly criticized Gordon's [...] "contrived and annoying" [...] vocal delivery, saying that many songs are [...] "merely lengthy feedback collages with pasted-on vocals and gobs of art-school pretension", but also admitted that the album contains some [...] "hidden gems" [...] like [...] "Sunday" [...] and [...] "Wildflower Soul".|$|E
500|$|... "Rude Boy" [...] was {{produced}} by Rob Swire and StarGate who co-wrote the song with Rihanna, Ester Dean, and Makeba Riddick. During an interview on the television show, [...] in February 2010, Carr asked Rihanna about the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "Come here Rude Boy, Boy, can you get it up?/Come here Rude Boy, Boy, is you big enough?" [...] Rihanna explained: [...] "When we wrote the song, {{it was kind of}} a freestyle...I liked the West Indian influence that the music had, and, I just went in the booth, they were already jotting down some ideas and, that came to me, I just ran in there with the, one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back to me like that, 'Come here Rude Boy, is you big enough'?, it <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> so disgusting!" [...] She also explained the development of the song, and said that those lyrics were originally going to be the introduction, but because of the song's infectious beat, Rihanna decided to make it the hook instead.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club praised Stefani's vocal delivery, saying her [...] "nasal voice suits the whiny sentiment {{of the subject}} matter" [...] and opining that she [...] "sounds most commanding in songs that flirt with blush-making drippiness". Nick Levine from Digital Spy rated [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{four out of five}} stars, and complimented its emotional nature, naming it a [...] "forgotten classic from an eighties movie soundtrack" [...] and deeming it [...] "the most affecting moment of Stefani's solo career to date". John Murphy from MusicOMH called the song [...] "rather nice" [...] and appreciated its lyrical content, although he commented that [...] "it <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> like Stefani covering a Keane song". Alex Miller from NME complimented Oxley's involvement in [...] "Early Winter" [...] and singled it out as [...] "one of the few potential hits" [...] from The Sweet Escape. Mark Pytlik from Pitchfork Media picked [...] "Early Winter" [...] as one of the highlights from the album and favoured Stefani's vocal delivery, noting that the song [...] "proves that Stefani still has the ability to elevate an otherwise ordinary rock song to another level". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine complimented [...] "Early Winter" [...] for being [...] "less forced and much less self-conscious" [...] in comparison {{to the rest of the}} songs on The Sweet Escape, and felt that [...] "it's refreshing to hear Stefani in her more natural habitat".|$|E
500|$|The third single {{from the}} album, [...] "One Thing", is an upbeat pop rock song. The song has a [...] "plucky" [...] guitar riff and a [...] "forceful" [...] chorus with Lewis Corner of Digital Spy dubbing it [...] "arena-ready". The song's melody {{has been noted}} for {{similarities}} between Backstreet Boys song [...] "I Want It That Way". The fourth song on the album and fourth single, [...] "More than This", is a pop ballad. [...] "More than This" [...] contains sounds of synthesizers. The fifth song on the album, title track [...] "Up All Night", is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song. Lyrically, the song is a party-anthem, with the Katy Perry name-check in the chorus being noted by various publications. The sixth cut, [...] "I Wish", is a mid-tempo pop ballad. The song's lyrical tone {{has been compared to}} Robyn's [...] "Dancing On My Own". The seventh song, [...] "Tell Me a Lie", is an uptempo pop rock song which features prominent guitar instrumentation and pulsating beats. The song was originally intended for Kelly Clarkson's album Stronger (2011). [...] Clarkson spoke to Capital FM on how she was proud of the end result. [...] "It's a really cute song, I love it. I loved that they liked it. They sound really great on it. I already have it – I'm so VIP with my copy on my computer! It <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> really good." ...|$|E
500|$|Carolyn Menyes of Music Times complimented the song's time {{signature}} {{for adding}} [...] "a {{bit of a}} waltz flavor, channeling the old school Ariana that fans first fell in love with", adding that [...] "a sultry, distorted guitar line and Grande's passionate, soaring vocals add a sense of texture and modernity that makes 'Dangerous Woman' feel as powerful as the title." [...] A writer of NME felt that Grande [...] "shows herself as someone who continues to be determined to challenge the norm." [...] The publication as well pointed out that [...] " [...] <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> empowered, even if it doesn't sound especially dangerous {{for her in the}} wake of her 2014 collaboration 'Love Me Harder' with The Weeknd." [...] Writing for Idolator, Robbie Daw, Carl Williot and Mike Wass reviewed [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] during their [...] "Pop Perspective" [...] article, with Daw calling it [...] "one walk of danger worth taking", Williot praising her vocal performance and highlighting the [...] "clever little flip of '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman'", and Wass naming it a [...] "decent song" [...] but noting that [...] " [...] still hasn't found her own lane." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy praised Grande's vocals, describing as [...] "angelic" [...] and completed writing it [...] "almost sound too pure over the seductive guitar line and prowling beat, which threatens to blindfold you and tie up your wrists within one listen.". Reviewing the album with the same name, the editor from Sputnikmusic described the song as [...] "the first moment that the album really shows flashes of becoming something special," [...] and continued, [...] "as it sways to a seductive beat that feels like it was extrapolated from the most revealing scene of a James Bond film." [...] Quinn Maryland of Pitchfork shared similar opinion, the reviewer described it as [...] "a slinky, empowered, Bond theme of a belter;" ...|$|E

2500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{gave the}} album 4 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Thanks to {{contributions}} from {{a clutch of}} au courant R producers, it <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> contemporary...her voice {{may not be as}} technically impressive as it was, but its new, more weathered tones have character, making an optimistic song like Million Dollar Bill really quite touching and a defiant one like 'For The Lovers' more dramatic. If a little too steady to be called a classic, I Look To You is certainly an accomplished, enjoyable return—don't call it a comeback—from an artist who sounds keen again, a lioness who's rediscovered her pride." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing the 20th Anniversary reissue, Michael Christopher of The Phoenix {{rated the}} album 3.5 out of 4 stars stating while the bonus track [...] "Piss" [...] doesn't match {{up to the}} rest of the material, the groove that flows through the {{original}} record is the muscle behind what mattered most. Denise Falzon of Exclaim! stated that the reissue sounds a little cleaner from the enhanced production quality.

2500|$|Rhapsody {{ranked the}} album #9 on its Rock’s Best Albums of the Decade list. Rhapsody's Justin Farrar wrote [...] "Maybe there's {{something}} anachronistic about {{a band that}} plays funk music {{in the 21st century}} as if Parliament (let alone hip-hop) had never happened. It <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> like Sharon Jones could have cut her record in 1967, not 2007. But when the music's this good, those concerns fly out the window. Jones pours everything she's got into this album, and her gruff, passionate, brassy style grabs you by the collar and doesn't let go until the end. The Dap-Kings restrain themselves behind her, shuffling and jangling but leaving her plenty of space to maneuver on a clutch of good, if not great, songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{concluding}} {{where to}} truly give Kelly credit as an innovator, a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball—and which {{came close to}} exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects—placed stress on the following: [...] "Kelly's hook slide <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> special, and players probably tried to copy it. [...] Also, {{he seems to have}} been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base (when the usually lone umpire wasn't looking), at least according to the newspaper record." [...] And, [...] "Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose. [...] Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s. [...] At the turn of the century, that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes." ...|$|E

Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it.

2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it <b>does</b> <b>sound</b> shockingly bad though." ...|$|E
