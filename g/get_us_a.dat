Collins told Hamar Greenwood after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: [...] "You had us dead beat. We could not have lasted another three weeks. When we were told of the offer of a truce we were astonished. We thought you must have gone mad". However he stated on the record that [...] "there will be no compromise and no negotiations with any British Government until Ireland is recognised as an independent republic. The same effort that would get us Dominion Home Rule will <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> republic." [...] At no time had the Dáil or the IRA asked for a conference or a truce.|$|E

6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} well," [...] said Roy, as they {{went up to the}} hut together, [...] "but it won't do {{much in the way of}} <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> supply of meat or fish." ...|$|R
5000|$|....'What the fuck's {{happening}}? When's {{the album}} coming out? When are you gonna <b>get</b> <b>us</b> some gigs? What's happening about <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> agency?' All we'd get was bullshit about the sleeve, you know, photographs and all that. When {{we got back}} from Rockfield with the masters, of course, we got the big: 'Oh, great, fantastic', but in the ensuing weeks it was just excuses and bullshit..|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} on teacher labor markets is quite large and expanding; yet, {{as in most}} areas of education research, our knowledge is full of holes and only <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> little ways towards identifying productive policy directions. As such, {{there is plenty of}} room for new research – describing labor market dynamics, developing and substantiating theories about the mechanisms driving the trend...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said {{practical}} Beth. [...] "Every merchant in Millville and Huntingdon {{will naturally}} advertise in our paper, and we'll make the major <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> lot from New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is for us," [...] said Jess quickly. [...] "We {{are going}} home. I saw Hans Coetzee yesterday, and {{begged him to}} try and <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> pass, and I suppose he has." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not, indeed? He was {{entitled}} to have everything mended after <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> such <b>a</b> good dinner at Bologna. By-the-bye, you never paid him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] said Jack, {{when our}} repast was about concluded, [...] "as {{you are going}} to leave us soon, you had better arrange with the king about <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> {{interpreter}} and supplying <b>us</b> with <b>a</b> few men to carry our goods. I think you said there was once a man in the tribe who spoke a little English. Have you found out whether he is alive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not if {{he knows}} it. But I don't know--What do you say, March? What's the reason you couldn't <b>get</b> <b>us</b> up <b>a</b> paper on the strike?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear TOOTLE-TUM, {{what shall}} we do? Come, <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> meal, or, in truth, If you don't, we shall have to eat you, Oh, adorable friend of our youth! Thou beloved little friend of our youth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{answered}} Miriam, looking {{about her}} to see that Phoebe {{was not in the}} room, [...] "that it would be very nice if you could <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> new man. We like the woman well enough, but the man is awful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} had better not, Bill. I have got sixpence. We will put that by, with the sixpence we saved the other day, for the hostler. We haven't given him {{anything}} for some time. Your eightpence will <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good breakfast in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you said}} {{anything}} they'd say we did it," [...] responded Snap. [...] "Ham {{would do anything}} to keep out of trouble and <b>get</b> <b>us</b> into <b>a</b> muss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too bad we can't {{have some}} venison," [...] he sighed to his brother. [...] "But I reckon my first big game {{is going to}} <b>get</b> <b>us</b> into <b>a</b> whole lot of trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only Robert began just now, [...] "Poor Jenny, she {{has been}} the cause of <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> into <b>a</b> very awkward scrape," [...] but then Ada came {{to tell me about}} you, and I came away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] Harry Shepherd said enthusiastically; [...] "we'll stick together, {{and you see}} how we'll get on; {{and look}} here, I vote we each pay threepence a week, that will <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> room at two bob, and candles. Then we can work a' night wi'out being disturbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The ex-king reflected. 'That's {{about the}} best thing that could have happened,' he said. 'Where are the bombs? In that farm-house on the {{opposite}} hill-side! Why! the place is in sight! Let us go. I'll dress. Is there any one in the place, Firmin, to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> cup of coffee?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course, that is {{the first}} thing," [...] Nat said. [...] "And when you go {{anywhere}} to get provisions, Dinah, {{it would be a good}} thing if you could <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> few yards of cord; it would be very handy for tying up faggots, and would be useful in all sorts of ways." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We've {{almost gone}} {{backwards}} in this album. It's <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> back to <b>a</b> more primal sound - guitars, bass, drums and Shirley's voice".|$|R

Clavering, I say I'm come {{to have some}} wine with you; hay! old boy--hay, old corkscrew? <b>Get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> bottle of the yellow seal, you old thief--the very best--a hundred rupees a dozen, and no mistake." ...|$|E

"It's a big, hot, dusty wilderness, Tom, and we've {{seen all}} they've {{got to show}} us here before," [...] {{she said to her}} long-suffering husband, as she stood in the {{vestibule}} of a fashionable hotel. [...] "Say, we'll pull out to-day and catch the Schroeders' party meditating around Wordsworth's tomb. Young man, will you kindly <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> railroad schedule?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{going to}} come hard, but we might put it over. Our pay was pretty good and the {{construction}} boss could <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> check as we go on if the work was approved. Of course, if we were pushed, we could sell out the Bluebird. The assay's all right {{and one or two}} of the big syndicates are looking up copper. Still I don't want to sell." ...|$|E
50|$|Katherine Pollard—Discovered short {{sequences}} of human DNA that have evolved rapidly since {{the human and}} ape lines diverged millions of years ago. Most of these fast-evolving sequences are genes that actually control other genes nearby. Many are located near genes that are active in the brain, and one {{appears to have a}} role in how the wrist and thumb develop in the fetus. These discoveries give us new insight not only into the evolutionary history of our species, but also into how genes control embryonic development—which <b>gets</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> step further to unraveling how to interrupt congenital defects.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2008, the Ottawa Citizen {{and others}} {{reported}} that the ruling federal Conservatives had issued a talking points memo regarding the cancellation of the PromArt program, funding international promotional tours by Canadian artists. The memo justified the cancellation {{on the grounds that}} its recipients included, among other notables, [...] "a rock band that uses an expletive as part of its name", apparently referring to Holy Fuck. The band took offense at this suggestion. In an interview, the band said regarding their name: “It’s been pretty annoying, but it’s <b>gotten</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> lot of publicity, so we can’t complain about that." ...|$|R

"Content am I," [...] said Bucklaw; [...] "Scotland {{has little}} left that I care about; and if {{carrying}} the Master with us will <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> better reception in France, why, so be it, a God's name.
