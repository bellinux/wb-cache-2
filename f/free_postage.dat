2500|$|The Confederate States Congress was {{sometimes}} unruly. The journal clerk {{shot and killed}} the chief clerk, and Henry S. Foote was attacked with [...] "fists, a Bowie knife, a revolver and an umbrella". In a Senate debate, Benjamin H. Hill threw an inkstand at William Lowndes Yancey, and Yancey and Edward A. Pollard had such fierce attacks on one another that newspapers would not publish the exchange for fears of their personal safety. Military glory redounded to those on the battlefield, but Congress and Congressmen were held in contempt, in some part due to members habit of berating one another in personal terms. Nevertheless, one historian of the Confederacy assessed the Congress as [...] "better than its critics made it." [...] The Confederacy lived out its existence during wartime, and virtually all of Congressional action addressed that fact. While it {{took an interest in}} military affairs, it never followed the U.S. Congress' example of harassing either the President, his cabinet, or military commanders. Despite Jefferson Davis' bitter Congressional critics, he dominated the Congress throughout most of the war until near the very end. Davis vetoed thirty-nine bills in total, deemed unconstitutional or unwise, and these were upheld in the Congress for all but the bill for <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> for newspapers addressed to soldiers.|$|E

50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the {{official}} portmanteau was used to carry the mail (two items: letters and newspapers) on New England stagecoaches that traveled the post roads. Before 1789 newspapers were mostly excluded from the mail and the official portmanteau. After the 1st United States Congress (1789-1791) the postmaster general allowed printers <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> to communicate reports and articles of newspapers with other publishers in other towns and cities to distribute Congressional information. This came about because of complaints to Thomas Jefferson. Congressmen then mailed issues of Congressional newspapers to their home districts. The congressional privilege was expedited using a special signature or marking called franking which allowed this <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> for their newspapers and other mailings.|$|E
50|$|On April 1, 1898, Mulock {{introduced}} {{an amendment to}} the Post Office Act that made Canada the first country in the world to give franking privileges, i.e. <b>free</b> <b>postage,</b> for Braille materials and books for the blind. He also initiated a program to provide Post Office employment for the deaf.|$|E

50|$|In 1764 an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} to prevent abuses which {{included}} a penalty of transportation for seven years for anyone convicted of counterfeiting hand writing in order to send mail <b>free</b> of <b>postage.</b> By the 1830s around five million franks were used annually. The system eventually ended {{with the introduction of}} the Uniform Penny Post in 1840.|$|R
50|$|Member's floor speeches {{were not}} meant to be persuasive, but for {{publication}} in partisan newspapers. The real audience was the constituents back home. Congressional caucuses organized and funded political campaigns, publishing pamphlet versions of speeches and circulating them by the thousands <b>free</b> of <b>postage</b> on the member's franking privilege. Party congressional committees stayed in Washington during national campaigns, keeping an open flow of subsidized literature pouring back into the home districts.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{news was}} {{considered}} crucial to an informed electorate, the 1792 law distributed newspapers to subscribers for 1 penny up to 100 miles and 1.5 cents over 100 miles; printers could send their newspapers to other newspaper publishers for <b>free.</b> <b>Postage</b> for letters, by contrast, cost between 6 and 25 cents depending on distance.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} banks {{had not been}} slow {{to respond to the}} challenge of competing with National Giro and had developed their own credit transfer service known as Bank Giro, primarily aimed at the same utilities that the Giro had attracted. It still mainly required a visit to a bank branch and there was no <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> for the remitter.|$|E
50|$|After the {{surrender}} of the Japanese Occupation forces {{at the end of}} World War II, Singapore and Malaya were administrated by the British Military Administration (BMA). <b>Free</b> <b>postage</b> was implemented for a short period from 17 Sept 1945 till 18 Oct 1945. On 19 Oct 1945, Straits Settlements stamps overprinted B.M.A. MALAYA were issued for postal use. These stamps were used till 1948, when the first Singapore stamps were issued.|$|E

Sincerely do I congratulate you upon having made such progress with Skelton, a writer deserving of far greater attention than his works have hitherto received. Your edition will be very serviceable, and may be the occasion of calling out illustrations, perhaps, of particular passages from others, beyond what your own reading, though so extensive, has supplied. I am pleased also to hear that 'Shirley' is out.|$|R

Here he superintended the {{progress}} of every pupil, and inspected the minutest details connected with the prosperity of the institution, besides giving lectures {{on the history of}} the arts and sciences.His writing and example given a new impulse to education throughout Prussia, and the government was so sensible of the value of his services that they allowed his extensive correspondence to pass <b>free</b> of <b>postage.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the {{assistance}} of friends and the Australian Natives' Association, Aston established the Victorian Association of Braille Writers in 1894. This organisation would eventually become the Victorian Braille Library. In 1895 a meeting called by Tilly Aston founded the Association for the Advancement of the Blind (now Vision Australia) to fight for greater independence, social change and new laws for blind people. They quickly won voting rights for blind people; <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> for Braille material in 1899 (a world first for Australia); and transport concessions for the blind.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{assemblies}} allow <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> (through franking privilege or prepaid envelopes) from {{a representative}} to a constituent, and often free telecommunications. Caseworkers may be employed by representatives to assist constituents with problems. Members of the U.S. Congress (both Representatives and Senators) working in Washington, D.C. have a governmentally staffed district office {{to aid in}} [...] "constituent services". Many state legislatures have followed suit. Likewise, British MPs use their Parliamentary staffing allowance to appoint staff for [...] "constituency casework". Client politics and pork barrel politics are associated with constituency work.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, National Giro renamed itself National Girobank {{to re-establish}} {{itself in the}} minds of the public as a bank, rather than some quasi non-bank. Its status as a bank had been fixed in law, but it had until now been {{reluctant}} to use the term. It also re-launched its ambition to be the People's Bank, and was the first bank to offer free banking to UK personal customers (provided the account was in credit. This included <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> for the remittance of documents to the Giro Centre as well as free cheques and deposits (the terms inpayments and outpayments were dropped).|$|E
5000|$|Holt {{was quite}} {{concerned}} about the postal system and gave extensive improvement suggestions to Samuel Adams on January 29, 1776, from the practical experience he gained as a deputy postmaster. Part of the letter suggested that the Continental Congress should adequately supply whatever was necessary to provide reliable postal service. Another suggestion Holt recommended was good delivery of all letters to and from soldiers on duty and that they might go <b>free</b> of <b>postage.</b> Holt in the [...] New York Journal or General Advertiser [...] newspaper {{was the first person}} in New York to recommend a newsdealers' system for the delivery of newspapers instead of using post riders, which was dangerous.|$|R
2500|$|An Individual {{who feels}} for {{the sufferings of}} the Brute Species, and laments, in common with every benevolent mind, the wanton cruelties which are so {{frequently}} committed with impunity on this unoffending part of God's Creation, earnestly appeals to the Public in their behalf. He suggests {{the formation of a}} Society by whose united exertions some check may, if possible, be applied to an evil, the toleration of which is equally repugnant to the dictates of humanity and to the spirit and precepts of the Christian religion. Persons whose sentiments accord with those of the Writer, on this subject, and who are willing to promote the object he recommends, are requested to address a few lines (<b>free</b> of <b>postage),</b> to [...] "Clerus", 25, Ivy-lane, Paternoster-row." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{railway station}} clerk was {{responsible}} for cancelling the stamps on correspondence with a date-stamp. Each station already had its own date-stamp (used to validate passenger railway tickets); this same date-stamp was used to cancel stamps on mail. Forty one railway stations {{are known to have}} cancelled mail though some of them handled very little mail. Inland mail to and from the Jamaica Government Railway could be sent <b>postage</b> <b>free</b> if it related to official business.|$|R
50|$|Woodgate created Vincent's {{very much}} in his own image. He wanted an elite social club of 'the picked hundred of the University, {{selected}} for all round qualities; social, physical and intellectual'. He loathed the Union, which he felt made only a pretence at selectivity, and finally he gathered forty {{of his friends and}} rented rooms at 90, High Street, above Vincent's, the printers and publisher's shop. If invited to subscribe, the 30 shillings per term included free beer, coffee and tea, none of which could be had at the Union, even for payment; and <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> on letters. Smoking was also allowed, again in contrast to the Union, and dogs were admitted to the clubroom, presumably to accommodate Woodgate's fox terrier, Jenny, a notorious shredder of trouser legs.|$|E
5000|$|He {{seems to}} have become an MP as much with the {{business}} advantages in mind as with any high political ambitions. Brooke quotes him as writing, shortly before he was first elected in 1774, [...] "I see many solid advantages accruing to my family from a seat in Parliament, the best of which, the article of franking right to <b>free</b> <b>postage,</b> valuable in those days of heavy postal rates, will save a very considerable expense in so extensive a business as that I am engaged in." [...] Although he supported the government, his first two speeches in the House of Commons were both attacks on {{the government for the}} way in which they had allotted subscriptions for government loans, in each case referring to occasions when his own firm had been excluded.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{communications}} system {{was a national}} network of partisan newspapers. Nearly all weekly and daily papers were party organs until the early 20th century. Thanks to the invention of high-speed presses for city papers, and <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> for rural sheets, newspapers proliferated. In 1850, the Census counted 1,630 party newspapers (with a circulation of about one per voter), and only 83 [...] "independent" [...] papers. The party line was behind every line of news copy, {{not to mention the}} authoritative editorials, which exposed the [...] "stupidity" [...] of the enemy and the [...] "triumphs" [...] of the party in every issue. Editors were senior party leaders, and often were rewarded with lucrative postmasterships. Top publishers, such as Horace Greeley, Whitelaw Reid, Schuyler Colfax, Warren Harding and James Cox, were nominated on the national ticket.|$|E
50|$|Ballots {{are sent}} out, usually, {{three weeks before}} the {{election}} date, after a voter's pamphlet has been distributed. To vote by mail, an individual marks the ballot for their choice of the candidates (or writes in their name), places the ballot in a secrecy envelope, seals it, places it in the provided mailing envelope, seals it and signs and dates the back of the mailing envelope. This envelope is then either stamped and mailed at any mailbox, or dropped off (<b>postage</b> <b>free)</b> at a local ballot collection center.|$|R
5000|$|These stamps {{were issued}} {{following}} a Commission of Inquiry which had carefully studied the postal systems of Europe and America. In {{the opinion of}} Geoffrey Clarke, the reformed system was to be maintained [...] "for {{the benefit of the}} people of India and not for the purpose of swelling the revenue." [...] The Commissioners voted to abolish the earlier practice of conveying official letters <b>free</b> of <b>postage</b> ("franking"). The new system was recommended by the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, and adopted by the East India Company's Court of Directors. It introduced [...] "low and uniform" [...] rates for sending mail efficiently throughout the country within the jurisdiction of the East India Company. The basic rate was 1/2 anna on letters not more than 1/4 tola in weight. The stamps were needed to show the postage was prepaid, a basic principle of the new system, like the fundamental changes of the British system advocated by Rowland Hill and the Scinde reforms of Bartle Frere. These reforms transformed mail services within India.|$|R
5000|$|Broome {{expressed}} an interest in promoting the welfare of animals by opposing acts of cruelty through publishing anonymously a sermon in 1801 [...] "Unjustifiableness of Cruelty to the Brute Creation." [...] Passages from this sermon were later reproduced in some of Broome's notes to the abridged version of Primatt's book. Broome's interest in creating an organisation to promote animal welfare and oppose cruelty was apparent in a letter of his that was published in The Kaleidoscope on 6 March 1821 that asked for information about the existence of an anti-cruelty organisation that may have been operating in Liverpool. Another piece of evidence concerns a notice that appeared in various newspapers and that was signed under the pseudonym [...] "Clerus": An Individual who feels for the sufferings of the Brute Species, and laments, in common with every benevolent mind, the wanton cruelties which are so frequently committed with impunity on this unoffending part of God's Creation, earnestly appeals to the Public in their behalf.

50|$|In 1852, a Postal Treaty {{was signed}} between Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. One {{practical}} {{effect of this}} Treaty {{was that in the}} free port on Tigre Island, near Amapala (Honduras), a postal employee exchanged mail between the three countries. Guatemala and El Salvador signed a further treaty in 1865 with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, providing for reciprocal exchange of mail andparcels, <b>free</b> <b>postage</b> on official and diplomatic mail, and other procedural matters. It is believed that El Salvador, as the other Central American countries, retained the 2 real rate for domestic and inter-Central American postage for letters of less than one-half ounce until the issuance of its adhesive stamps. It {{is important to note that}} mail to and from any Central American destination could be marked prepaid or collect, at the option of the sender.|$|E

5000|$|President Lincoln, in April 1864 [...] - [...] at {{the request}} of George Bancroft, a historian, wrote out a {{manuscript}} of the Gettysburg Address. Mr. Bancroft planned to include this copy in [...] "Autograph Leaves of Our Country's Authors," [...] which he planned to sell at a Soldiers' and Sailors' Sanitary Fair in Baltimore. As this copy was written {{on both sides of the}} paper, it proved unusable for this purpose, and Mr. Bancroft was allowed to keep it. This manuscript is the only one accompanied by a letter from Lincoln transmitting the manuscript and by the original envelope addressed and franked (i.e. signed for <b>free</b> <b>postage)</b> by Lincoln. This copy remained in the Bancroft family for many years until it was donated to the Carl A. Kroch Library at Cornell University by Nicholas H. Noyes and can be viewed by anyone who asks. [...] Out of five known manuscripts, Cornell's copy holds the distinction of being the only one owned by a private institution. Among historians, Cornell's manuscript is known as the Bancroft Copy.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the {{franking}} privilege predates {{the establishment}} of the republic itself, as the Continental Congress bestowed it on its members in 1775. The First United States Congress enacted a franking law in 1789 during its very first session. Congress members would spend much time [...] "inscribing their names on the upper right-hand corner of official letters and packages" [...] until the 1860s for the purpose of sending out <b>postage</b> <b>free</b> mail. Yet, on January 31, 1873, the Senate abolished [...] "the congressional franking privilege after rejecting a House-passed provision that would have provided special stamps for the free mailing of printed Senate and House documents." [...] Within two years, however, Congress began to make exceptions to this ban, including free mailing of the Congressional Record, seeds, and agricultural reports. Finally, in 1891, noting that its members were the only government officials required to pay postage, Congress restored full franking privileges. Since then, the franking of congressional mail has been subject to ongoing review and regulation.|$|R
40|$|With {{the final}} {{examinations}} {{no longer being}} the Presenting Complaint but rather, now falling under the more appropriate heading Past History, Dr. Ronnie Borg and I are happy {{to be back in}} the Editorial Board, again, as Secretary and Editor, respectively. Many new things are being put into effect to improve this publication and hoping that one day it achieves a standard comparable to other well established magazines abroad. We are introducing a cumulative index and a subject index which will aid readers trace specific articles of interest. They shall also provide details of material published so that future authors may have an insight to the topics yearning for attention that they may be subjects for discussion. A Guideline/or Authors is included in an attempt to standardise the presentation of material for publishing. We strongly advice all those who plan to write an article or two to read this section thoroughly before submitting any manuscripts. Material which does not conform to the criteria laid down may be refuted by the Board. Despite all efforts to ensure correctness of the printed articles, errors inevitably appear. We therefore hope to provide space for an Errata Corrigendum. Authors are requested to inform the Editor, in writing, of any misprints appearing in their articles so that these may be drawn, in successive issues, to the readers' attention. The Editorial Board requires more members to help in obtaining advertisements, distribution of the journal, posting of copies and proof-reading. All those who volunteer will be given appropriate remuneration for their time and fruitful efforts. Readers who would like to secure a copy of Medi-Scope each time it is published and to have it mailed (<b>postage</b> <b>free)</b> are to complete a subscription form available, at request, from the Editor. Having said all this I now leave you to our faithful contributors trusting you will find their articles of interest, intuitive and perhaps also of significant clinical value. N/...|$|R
