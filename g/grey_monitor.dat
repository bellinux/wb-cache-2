In the cockpit version, the seat rotated horizontally, and the cockpit rotated vertically. The rotating cockpit version also featured two speakers inside the cockpit at head-level, which produced excellent stereo sound that significantly added to the gameplay experience. Both cabinets contained a <b>grey</b> <b>monitor</b> frame with flashing lights at the top that indicated an enemy's [...] "lock" [...] on your craft.|$|E
50|$|The V. g. griseus {{subspecies}} (<b>grey</b> <b>monitor)</b> {{has five}} to eight narrow grey bands on its back, as well as 19-28 bands on its tail. Its tail is more rounded that {{those of the other}} subspecies, and the final size of the adult depends on which habitat they are living. Their coloration can be from simple grey (in desert-like ecosystems) to brilliantly colored (in areas with large amounts of plant growth). Their most common prey is lizards and snakes, but can also include ground-nesting birds and other small mammals.|$|E
50|$|A {{major threat}} to this species is habitat loss and disturbance. Human {{activity}} such as tourists walking through protected areas, pollution, unsustainable harvesting and urbanisation can destroy nesting sites. Plover populations can also be affected by rural human activity, for example fishermen walking through protected plover breeding sites, bringing large amounts of dogs with them- a known predator of plover eggs. Natural predators are also a problem, {{as many of these}} predators appear to thrive unnaturally well in the presence of plover breeding grounds, such as the brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) in Maio, Cape Verde, the White-tailed Mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda) in Saudi Arabia, and the <b>Grey</b> <b>Monitors</b> (Varanus griseus) in Al Wathba Wetland Reserve. It is thought that the high amount of prey available to these predators attracts them into the breeding grounds- an effect named the ‘honey pot’, Global warming and climate change also plays a role in the decline of areas available for plovers to breed and reside in. It is known that the Kentish plover prefers to build its nests on low-elevated land close to water, and a study untaken in Saudi Arabia discovered that 11% of nests in the study site were in fact below sea level, therefore rising sea levels are predicted to have disastrous consequences for these low-sitting nests,.|$|R

40|$|Transwaste Canterbury Ltd have {{committed}} to a comprehensive ecological restoration project {{as part of the}} mitigation for the establishment of the Canterbury regional landfill at Kate Valley for which a 35 -year resource consent has been granted. This project will be carried out in a designated Kate Valley Conservation Management Area (CMA) also known as Tiromoana Bush, which is located in the Motunau Ecological District in coastal North Canterbury. The proposed conservation, protection and restoration over a 35 -year period will result in a substantial increase in the overall biodiversity values in this area (Norton 2004). In particular, the restoration of Tiromoana Bush will result in the protection and enhancement of a substantial area of lowland forest which is a nationally rare and poorly represented vegetation type. Conservation management will involve removal of domestic stock, animal and plant pest control, and the establishment of restoration plantings (Norton 2004). It is proposed that population trends of common indigenous forest birds (particularly bellbirds 1 and <b>grey</b> warblers) are <b>monitored</b> from the outset of conservation management for the duration of this management. Methods to measure these population trends involve a standard five-minute bird count technique (after Dawson & Bull 1975) modified to include distance sampling of common indigenous forest birds (after Moffat & Minot 1994). Specialised methods to monitor kereru (after Mander et al. 1998; Handford 2002) will be trialled during seasons when kereru are present in the area. This report provides details of methods and results of a field monitoring survey carried out by the author 19 - 26 October 2005. A discussion of these methods and results, and recommendations for further monitoring etc are also provided. Power analysis will be completed prior to further monitoring to ensure that sufficient sampling is carried out to detect population trends of birds...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Bangla Trac communications limited is a sister concern of Bangla Trac. The company was incorporated on 18 September 2007. Bangla Trac own IGW license after taking a long run auction arrange by BTRC on 25, February 2008 and start their operation on 24 August 2008. After started the operation as IGW Bangla Trac established as {{a pioneer in the}} international incoming outgoing voice for the last six years. Bangla Trac followed hierarchical structure of organization. Through sophisticated services and contemplative practices, the company strives to provide improved and more efficient services to its clients every time. The company’s vision is to make progress possible through excellence in technology, integrity and unsurpassed customer services. According to BTRC guideline of IGW, Bangla Trac have to invoice ANS for international outgoing calls and ANS invoice to Bangla Trac for international incoming calls, which don’t have any direct connectivity. Bangla Trac deals with foreign partner for international incoming outgoing call termination, but customer support page is not adequate and updated it’s require to enhance the customer web portal for better service. Telecom billing is a complex process, where billing system need to collect calls data from switch process that data and charged them accordingly. Bangla Trac use CDR based billing for calculate international incoming outgoing calls. According to the licensing guide line we share 51. 75 % of our revenue with BTRC, 20 % with ANS and 15 % with ICX for incoming calls. Billing system collects CDR from the switch FTP location, process those CDR and calculate minutes for the partner. Billing department generate daily report for the management, department, partner, stake holder and for performance analysis. Daily report divided into the two parts like incoming and outgoing. In the incoming we added call summary of OS carrier, OS Carrier IP wise, ICX Wise and ANS wise. For outgoing we generate call summary of OS carrier, ICX carrier and destination wise. Performance of the individual carrier can be measure from the daily incoming and outgoing report. More than 7 M Bangladeshi people live in the foreign country, for that nearly 50 M incoming minutes and 1 M outgoing minutes terminate and originate from Bangladesh. These incoming outgoing calls generate huge revenue. But Bangladesh government cannot take advantage from this due to lack of proper surveillance. If the government increases their actions against <b>grey</b> termination, <b>monitor</b> ICX, IGW periodically then I think the revenue will be double. Authority should decrease the outgoing call rate so that our people can communicate with their relative with low cost. Debakor NathM. Business Administratio...|$|R
40|$|Squirrel pox virus (SQPV) and {{adenovirus}} produce pathological {{disease in}} native red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris). SQPV {{in particular is}} {{a significant factor in}} regional population declines and is generally prevalent in the UK's introduced grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) population as an asymptomatic infection. Despite the role of the grey squirrel as a virus reservoir and potential inter-specific infection pathways being highlighted, there remains a paucity of field study data with known relative inter-specific infection rates and quantified frequency of interactions. Intriguingly, whilst captive zoological red squirrel collections are often present within woodland habitat containing wild grey squirrels, clinical pox cases are rarely observed unless red squirrels are released from the enclosures. In 2011 we <b>monitored</b> <b>grey</b> squirrel activity on an enclosure containing red squirrels. Grey squirrels were present for a cumulative total of 47. 5 minutes within the twenty four hours of observation. A range of behaviours were recorded including feeding, and instances where discarded food fell into the red squirrel enclosures below. We interpret the value of these observations in the context of published theories of viral transmission. The local grey squirrels were subsequently culled and tested for evidence of both historical and current SQPV and adenovirus infections. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays did not amplify adenovirus DNA from grey squirrel blood samples, but positive results were recorded in faeces (3 / 18, 17 %) and (10 / 18, 56 %) in parallel spleen samples from the same animals. This variation in tissue specific detection rates suggests that previous long-term surveillance of adenovirus in wild grey squirrels focussing on blood samples may have significantly underestimated true infection rates. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) tests revealed exposure to SQPV by antibody presence in 33 % of the animals. Additionally, 22 % of the animals contained detectable levels of both viruses. In parallel with laboratory and field studies in 2011, we collated historical unpublished reports and archived data from a range of UK squirrel collections and highlight some key cases of infection. We recommend that further behavioural and viral screening studies are focussed within scenarios where captive red squirrels are sympatric with wild grey squirrels.
