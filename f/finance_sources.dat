40|$|Abstract Background Equitable {{financing}} is a {{key objective}} of health care systems. Its importance is evidenced in policy documents, policy statements, the work of health economists and policy analysts. The conventional categorisations of <b>finance</b> <b>sources</b> for health care are taxation, social health insurance, private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments. There are nonetheless increasing variations in the <b>finance</b> <b>sources</b> used to fund health care. An understanding of the equity implications would help policy makers in achieving equitable financing. Objective The primary {{purpose of this paper}} was to comprehensively assess the equity of health care financing in Malaysia, which represents a new country context for the quantitative techniques used. The paper evaluated each of the five financing sources (direct taxes, indirect taxes, contributions to Employee Provident Fund and Social Security Organization, private insurance and out-of-pocket payments) independently, and subsequently by combined the financing sources to evaluate the whole financing system. Methods Cross-sectional analyses were performed on the Household Expenditure Survey Malaysia 1998 / 99, using Stata statistical software package. In order to assess inequality, progressivity of each <b>finance</b> <b>sources</b> and the whole financing system was measured by Kakwani's progressivity index. Results Results showed that Malaysia's predominantly tax-financed system was slightly progressive with a Kakwani's progressivity index of 0. 186. The net progressive effect was produced by four progressive <b>finance</b> <b>sources</b> (in the decreasing order of direct taxes, private insurance premiums, out-of-pocket payments, contributions to EPF and SOCSO) and a regressive finance source (indirect taxes). Conclusion Malaysia's two tier health system, of a heavily subsidised public sector and a user charged private sector, has produced a progressive health financing system. The case of Malaysia exemplifies that policy makers can gain an in depth understanding of the equity impact, in order to help shape health financing strategies for the nation. </p...|$|E

The development of individual farming varies strongly between countries, regions and households. This paper uses household-level data from a 1996 survey in Romania to analyze which household and regional characteristics determine the shift to individual farming. Individual farming is influenced by several household characteristics, such as the human capital (education, age, farming experience), physical capital endowments (ownership of land, buildings, machinery, livestock) and access to other <b>finance</b> <b>sources</b> (off-farm wages, pensions). Furthermore, environmental factors, such as infrastructure, local access to inputs, and the pre-reform importance of individual farming in the region, all affect the development of individual farming...|$|E

In addition, we find evidence that in both countries foreign-owned companies find access to finance less of a constraint that companies with domestic ownership do, but curiously they do not access external <b>financing</b> <b>sources</b> as much as companies with domestic capital.

40|$|On the Polish {{financial}} market leasing belongs, besides credit, {{to the most}} popular and used external <b>finance</b> <b>sources.</b> It isn’t now situation for credit, which belonged to the classical external <b>finance</b> <b>sources</b> for many years ago. However leasing has been obtaining its position during the last ten years. Recently some important regulations concerning leasing were arranged in Poland and it would let leasing to develop further. With its development a new type of risk has appeared, i. e. a leasing risk. This article refers to the mortgage as the way to secure the leasing receivables of a leasing company. It is the similiar situation {{as in the case of}} other finance companies, for example bank and because of that this article has in the majority an universal character. However the leasing risk differs from the credit risk in some points. The most important point is the risk connected with the leasing object which a leasing company owns. It means among other things the buy risk which includes the price and undelivery risk. In case o f heavy and big machines and especially in case of technological lines the property they are installed and run play an significant part. Those can only be used in places they are installed without losing their value. Because of that the mortgage on the property secure not only the leasing receivables but the leasing object installed inside as well. The mortgage on the property can play the double part in case of leasing. For the efficiency of the second part is however the quickly execution process necessary.
