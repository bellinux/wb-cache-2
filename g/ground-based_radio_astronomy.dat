40|$|International audienceIn late 2007, Saturn {{electrostatic}} discharges (SED) were simultaneously observed {{at the radio}} telescope UTR- 2 and with the Cassini spacecraft. Observations at UTR- 2 were performed with a multichannel receiver in the frequency range 12 - 33 MHz, and those performed on Cassini-with a swept frequency receiver {{that is part of}} the RPWS (Radio and Plasma Wave Science) instrument in the frequency band 1. 8 - 16 MHz. We got a very good coincidence between data of UTR- 2 and Cassini. It is shown for the first time that <b>ground-based</b> <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> lets us detect Saturn's lightning with a high degree of reliability despite terrestrial interferences. This is the necessary basis for further detailed study of the temporal and spectral characteristics of the SEDs with ground based radio telescopes. Based on six observation sessions, several parameters of SEDs were determined, in particularly a correlation of 0. 77 ± 0. 15 between the average intensity of storms and the e-folding time.

40|$|The Spacelab- 2 Plasma Depletion Experiments were {{a series}} of studies to examine Shuttle-induced {{perturbations}} in the ionosphere and their application to <b>ground-based</b> <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy.</b> The Space Shuttle Challenger fired its orbital maneuvering subsystem engines, releasing large amounts of exhaust molecules that caused the electrons and ions in earth's upper atmosphere to chemically recombine, thereby creating so-called 'ionospheric holes'. Two burns conducted over New England produced ionospheric peak depletions ranging from 25 to 50 percent, affected the ionosphere over a 200 -kilometer altitude range, and covered 1 to 2 deg of latitude. Optical emissions associated with the hole spanned an area of several hundred thousand square kilometers. A third burn was conducted over a low-frequency radio observatory in Hobart, Australia, to create an 'artificial window' for ground-based observations at frequencies normally below the natural ionospheric cutoff (penetration) frequency. The Hobart experiment succeeded in making high-resolution observations at 1. 7 megahertz through the induced ionospheric hole...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe low {{frequency}} radio astronomy (decameter-meter range, frequencies of 10 - 300 MHz) currently demonstrates rapid progress {{all over the}} world. New generations of large antennas-LOFAR, LWA, MWA and others – have been created in many countries. At the same time Ukrainian radio astronomical systems UTR- 2 and URAN still remain {{the largest and most}} informative ones at the lowest frequency range available for the <b>ground-based</b> <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> (below 33 MHz), especially after their radical modernization during the most recent years. A great number of top priority results have been obtained {{on the basis of these}} radio telescopes. The results prove a high significance of the {{low frequency}} radio astronomy for astrophysics. Substantial part of these results have been obtained in the course of many year cooperation between Ukraine on one side and France, Austria, Germany and other countries on the other. Creation of new low frequency instruments GURT (Ukraine) and LSS/NenuFAR (France) for the wide frequency range of 10 - 80 MHz opens up new possibilities for research and fruitful cooperation...|$|E
40|$|The gas at the {{surfaces}} of molecular clouds in galaxies is heated and dissociated by photons from young stars both near and far. Hi resulting from the dissociation of molecular hydrogen H 2 emits hyperfine line emission at 21 cm, and warmed CO emits dipole rotational lines such as the 2. 6 mm line of CO(1 – 0). We use previously developed models for photodissociation regions (PDRs) to compute the intensities of these Hi and CO(1 – 0) lines {{as a function of}} the total volume density n in the cloud and the far ultraviolet flux G 0 incident upon it and present the results in units familiar to observers. The intensities of these two lines behave differently with changing physical conditions in the PDR, and, taken together, the two lines can provide a <b>ground–based</b> <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> diagnostic for determining n and G 0 separately in distant molecular clouds. This diagnostic is particularly useful in the range G 0 � 100, 10 cm − 3 � n � 10 5 cm − 3, which applies to a large fraction of the volume of the interstellar medium in galaxies. If the molecular cloud is located near discrete sources of far–UV (FUV) emission, the PDR–generated Hi and CO(1 – 0) emission on the cloud surface can be more easily identified, appearing as layered “blankets ” or “blisters ” on the side of the cloud nearest to the FUV source. As an illustration, we consider the Galactic object G 216 - 2. 5, i. e. “Maddalena’s Cloud”, which has been previously identified as a large PDR in the Galaxy. We determine that this cloud has n ≈ 200 cm − 3 and G 0 ≈ 0. 8, consistent with other data...|$|E

The low frequency limit for ground-based observations of these phenomena is given by the Earth's ionosphere, which limits ground based radio observations to frequencies ≥ 10 MHz. We give an overview and update {{on the status of}} a few representative <b>ground-based</b> <b>radio</b> arrays that have been used for planetary studies within the frequency range 10 – 200 MHz, and we discuss their potential for the four types of planetary radio emissions that can be observed within this frequency range: (1) synchrotron emission from Jupiter's radiation belts, (2) radio bursts caused by solar system planetary lightning, (3) Jupiter's magnetospheric emission, and (4) magnetospheric radio emission from extrasolar planets, for which we also give an update to previous predictive studies. Comparing the four emission modes with the characteristics of existing <b>ground-based</b> <b>radio</b> arrays, we show that the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) has the potential to bring considerable advances to those four fields of planetary radio science...|$|R
