25|$|The tunnel has two cells, {{each with}} two traffic lanes and two footpaths, and a central bore {{for use in}} an {{emergency}} only. Pedestrians and cyclists are expressly forbidden from using the tunnel. The exclusion of cyclists has been somewhat controversial as the <b>feeder</b> <b>road</b> is a dual-carriageway and so is open to cyclists, but the by-law is applied because of space limitations and the obvious danger of cyclists in an enclosed tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Between I-610 and I-45 west of downtown, {{the interstate}} {{contains}} {{at least five}} main lanes in each direction. Before 2008, this section had traditionally been the widest section of I-10 in the Houston area {{and the only one}} with a significant portion below grade. A project completed in 2014 added one extra auxiliary lane in each direction between Shepherd Drive and Taylor Street. In addition, the eastbound <b>feeder</b> <b>road</b> that ends at Studemont was extended to Taylor Street. As I-10 travels through downtown, it junctions with I-45 and I-69/US59. Both interchanges feature left exits, allowing several lane shifts for through traffic. I-10 provides access to Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros, and also runs through the campus of the University of Houston–Downtown.|$|E
25|$|A {{report from}} 1982 {{recommended}} that construction {{be carried out}} in two phases. First a road departing from the E18 at Jessvoll near Drammen through Røyken and then under the fjord before terminating at an intersection with the E6. The second phase would see {{the construction of a}} road from the tunnel through Hurum to Verket, in a new subsea tunnel under the Drammensfjord near Svelvik and then through a tunnel to Sande, where it would intersect with the E18. Cost estimates for the tunnel ranged between NOK200 and 360 million. The plans were based on partially using part of National Road 154 in Buskerud for part of the <b>feeder</b> <b>road.</b> Cost estimates for the auxiliary road system was estimated at between NOK340 and 400 million, depending on the amount of reused road and the standard chosen.|$|E
25|$|From {{the western}} suburb of Katy to downtown, I-10 {{is known as}} the Katy Freeway in Houston. This section was widened in 2008 to as many as 26total lanes, {{counting}} the six lanes of the access road, which are not limited-access and therefore not technically part of the freeway itself but are directly adjacent. Between the West Beltway and the West Loop, the minimum lane count is 22total lanes. In this section, the width is 24lanes at multiple locations and up to 26lanes east of Gessner Road (12main lanes, eightlanes of access roads, and sixmid-freeway HOT/HOV lanes). From the Fort Bend county line to I-610, there is a minimum of four main lanes in each direction. The maximum number of undivided lanes at any point on the freeway is nine in the eastbound direction approaching Antoine Drive (though this includes one exit-only lane); {{this is one of the}} widest sections of undivided highway in a single direction in the world. The widest right-of-way, , occurs at the Katy Freeway's intersection with Bunker Hill; at that point, the expansion plans called for six main lanes plus two toll lanes in each direction along with 10lanes on the feeder/frontage roads. The actual striping after construction delineates 29lanes, including all 26 of the planned lanes plus an additional lane in each direction to enter or exit the toll lanes and one more turn lane on the eastbound <b>feeder</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

As of December 2012, only the <b>feeder</b> <b>roads</b> have been constructed, with space reserved in the median for future freeway mainlanes. Unlike most new freeway extensions in the Houston area built in recent decades, the Crosby Freeway is not tolled.

Passing several strip malls, the route expands to eight lanes, entering an intersection with NY5 (Main Street).

NY78 and Transit Road continue north, crossing under NY324 and condense down to four lanes once again.
