50|$|According to an {{estimate}} by <b>Eurocheque</b> International, in 1989 around 32 million <b>Eurocheque</b> cards had been issued by some 9,000 banks in 20 countries.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, French banks {{withdrew the}} <b>Eurocheque</b> symbol from their credit cards. In the same year, {{the use of}} the Uniform <b>Eurocheque</b> format became universal.|$|E
50|$|On 3 February 1988, <b>Eurocheque</b> International {{became a}} {{cooperative}} society established under Belgian law, having previously been {{a de facto}} association, rather than a legal entity. The shareholders were the Association of Swedish Banks, Associazione Bancaria Italiana, Groupement des cartes bancaires 'CB' (France), Comunidade Portuguesa <b>eurocheque,</b> Bank of Cyprus, Caisse d'épargne de l'État du grand-duché de Luxembourg, Agrupació Andorrana <b>Eurocheque,</b> PBS-Pengeinstitutternes BetalingsSystemer (Denmark), Apacs (United Kingdom), Telekurs (Switzerland), Suomen Pankkiyhdistys (Finland), Association of Norwegian Banks, Stichting Bevordering Chequeverkeer (Netherlands), Irish Clearing House, Jugobanka United Bank (Yugoslavia), Association of Austrian Banks and Bankers, <b>Eurocheque</b> Belgique sc, GZS-Gesellschaft für Zahlungssysteme GmbH (Germany).|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{with the}} {{abolition}} of <b>Eurocheques</b> in Germany and other European countries, the cheque guarantee system also ended in those countries and many retailers stopped accepting cheques altogether. In 2011 {{after many years of}} decline, the Payments Council ended the UK cheque guarantee system, leaving Ireland as the last country to still operate a cheque guarantee card scheme.|$|R
50|$|Eurocheques were {{particularly}} popular in German-speaking countries, {{where they were}} often issued as standard domestic cheques. They usually had {{to be accompanied by}} a cheque guarantee card in order to be accepted in payment at a point of sale. The <b>Eurocheque</b> guarantee card also had the functionality of an ATM card. In some countries, such as Austria and Germany, virtually all <b>Eurocheque</b> cards were co-branded with the logo of the respective domestic debit card system and were actually debit cards. After its phase-out, virtually all of these <b>Eurocheque</b> cards were replaced by Maestro cards. Therefore, Maestro is very often considered to be the successor to the <b>Eurocheque</b> system.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, the 'uniform Eurocheque' and 'uniform <b>Eurocheque</b> {{guarantee}} card' were introduced, providing single {{designs that}} could be used by all banks within the system. Previously all Eurocheques had carried the <b>Eurocheque</b> symbol, but differed in their designs.|$|E
50|$|For a {{transitional}} period another pictogram, the ec electronic cash pictogram, {{is still to}} be found as an acceptance mark on debit cards issued by the German credit services sector and on POS terminals. This mark was used during the transition from <b>Eurocheque</b> (payment via certified cheque) to payment via ec-card (card based payment with PIN). After {{the abolition of the}} <b>Eurocheque,</b> the allocation of ec-cards by the German credit services sector was suspended and the trademarks for <b>Eurocheque</b> were sold to MasterCard.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Eurocard International N.V., <b>Eurocheque</b> International C.V. and <b>Eurocheque</b> International Holding N.V. {{merged into}} a single company, Europay International S.A., and were {{relocated}} to Waterloo, Belgium. This location also housed the Europe, Middle-East and Africa region of MasterCard International, and {{the seat of the}} Eurocard-MasterCard joint-venture, Maestro International.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, the MasterCard-affiliated Maestro brand (which is a {{debit card}} {{rather than a}} charge card) {{replaced}} the European <b>Eurocheque</b> brand for payment cards in 2002. Many <b>Eurocheque</b> cards, particularly in such countries as Austria and Germany, were charge cards branded with the <b>Eurocheque</b> logo. In addition, the European Eurocard, issued as the competitor for American Express was, and in some countries (such as the Nordic countries) still is, a charge card. Therefore, the majority of MasterCards in these countries still are charge cards. Visa charge cards are also available in Europe.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, British banks {{withdrew the}} <b>Eurocheque</b> symbol from their credit cards.|$|E
50|$|On 1 September 1992, <b>Eurocheque</b> International C.V. and <b>Eurocheque</b> International Holding N.V. {{merged with}} Eurocard International N.V. {{into a single}} company, Europay International S.A., {{incorporated}} under Belgian law. Europay relocated to Waterloo, Belgium, where they shared the same address as the Europe, Middle East and Africa region of MasterCard International, and {{the headquarters of the}} Eurocard-MasterCard joint-venture, Maestro International.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eurocheque</b> International C.V. {{was formed}} in 1974 to process {{payments}} made using Eurocheques.|$|E

5000|$|When the <b>Eurocheque</b> {{system was}} disbanded {{at the end}} of 2001, the cards could no longer use the <b>Eurocheque</b> brand. However, German banks {{continued}} to use the EC logo, which was simply re-interpreted as [...] "electronic cash". Consequently, the cards were colloquially known as EC card (German EC-Karte). However, the ATM network still did not have a trade name and was generically called [...] "Deutsches Geldautomaten-System".|$|E

50|$|Originally, German banks {{formed an}} interbank network {{connecting}} virtually all German ATMs. The network used <b>Eurocheque</b> guarantee cards as ATM cards {{and did not}} have a name or trademark of its own. In 1991, the electronic cash debit card service was introduced using the same cards, replacing the Geldkarte ATM and POS scheme on the territory of East Germany. The cards used for all three payment methods were simply known as <b>Eurocheque</b> card (German Euroscheck-Karte).|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} {{to end the}} <b>Eurocheque</b> guarantee {{from the end of}} 2002 was taken by Europay's board on 22 April 2001.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eurocheque</b> was {{a type of}} cheque used in Europe {{that was}} {{accepted}} across national borders and which could be written {{in a variety of}} currencies.|$|E
50|$|Although still {{accepted}} as payment {{by a few}} bodies, the practice of issuing Eurocheques ceased on 1 January 2002, following the decision to withdraw the <b>Eurocheque</b> guarantee.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} {{to end the}} issuing of Eurocheques was taken because increasing numbers of retailers and banks started to decline payment by <b>Eurocheque</b> and because the use of cash machines and credit cards by international travellers grew within Europe. The relatively high cost of processing Eurocheques, together with the costs resulting from fraud, were also among the factors. In advance of the move, the European Commission expressed concern that [...] "the benefits of the existing <b>eurocheque</b> system, in particular its standardised cheque format and its clearing facilities in all European countries should not be lost." ...|$|E
50|$|Europay International was {{the owner}} of the {{following}} payment brands: Eurocard (charge card), <b>Eurocheque</b> (paper-based pan-European cheque system), ec travellers' cheque (paper-based European travellers' cheques), Clip (European e-purse based on CEPS).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eurocheque</b> was {{launched}} in 1969 with the participation of banks in 14 countries: Belgium, France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and West Germany (which issued and accepted Eurocheques) together with Denmark, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and Sweden (which accepted Eurocheques).|$|E
50|$|Europay International was {{the name}} of the entity created by the merger of Eurocard International and <b>Eurocheque</b> International. The merged entity was {{headquartered}} in Waterloo, Belgium, on the same premises as EPSS (European Payment Systems Services) and MasterCard EMEA (the MasterCard region comprising Europe, the Middle East and Africa).|$|E
50|$|Debit cards {{have enjoyed}} wide {{acceptance}} in Germany for years. Facilities already existed before EFTPOS became {{popular with the}} <b>Eurocheque</b> card, an authorization system initially developed for paper checks where, in addition to signing the actual check, customers also needed to show the card alongside the check as a security measure. Those cards {{could also be used}} at ATMs and for card-based electronic funds transfer (called Girocard) with PIN entry. These are now the only functions of such cards: the <b>Eurocheque</b> system (along with the brand) was abandoned in 2002 during the transition from the Deutsche Mark to the euro. As of 2005, most stores and petrol outlets have EFTPOS facilities. Processing fees are paid by the businesses, which leads to some business owners refusing debit card payments for sales totalling less than a certain amount, usually 5 or 10 euro.|$|E
5000|$|In Germany and Austria, Maestro {{replaced}} the <b>Eurocheque</b> system. Austrian Maestro cards are virtually always pure Maestro cards. German Maestro cards, however, are {{in most cases}} co-branded with the German Girocard logo. These co-branded cards work like normal Maestro cards within the Maestro network and as Girocards within the Girocard network, but they cannot be used as Maestro over the telephone or on the internet.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, the <b>Eurocheque</b> {{system was}} phased out and {{replaced}} with domestic clearing systems. Old eurocheques could still be used, but they were now processed by national clearing systems. At that time, {{a number of countries}} took the opportunity to phase out the use of cheques altogether. As of 2010, many countries have either phased out the use of cheques altogether or signalled that they would do so in the future.|$|E
5000|$|Eurocheques were {{originally}} introduced in 1969 {{as an alternative}} to the traveler's cheque and for international payments for goods and services. They were rapidly adopted for domestic use in a number of countries, to the extent that their use for international payment rarely accounted for more than 5% of total <b>Eurocheque</b> transactions. The charges for clearing Eurocheques were substantially lower than those for cross-border use of domestic cheques.|$|E
50|$|Electronic cash is {{the debit}} card {{system of the}} German Banking Industry Committee, the {{association}} which represents the top German financial interest groups. Usually paired with a Transaction account or Current Account, cards with an Electronic Cash logo are only handed out by proper credit institutions. An electronic card payment is generally made by the card owner entering their PIN (Personal Identification Number) at a so-called EFT-POS-terminal (Electronic-Funds-Transfer-Terminal). The name “EC” originally comes from the unified European checking system <b>Eurocheque.</b> Comparable debit card systems are Maestro and Visa Electron. Banks and credit institutions who issue these cards often pair EC debit cards with Maestro functionality. These combined cards, recognizable by an additional Maestro logo, {{are referred to as}} “EC/Maestro cards”.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the four}} largest bank card issuers (American Express, Discover Card, MasterCard, and Visa) all offer debit cards, {{there are many}} other types of debit card, each {{accepted}} only within a particular country or region, for example Switch (now: Maestro) and Solo in the United Kingdom, Interac in Canada, Carte Bleue in France, EC electronic cash (formerly <b>Eurocheque)</b> in Germany, UnionPay in China, RuPay in India and EFTPOS cards in Australia and New Zealand. The need for cross-border compatibility and the advent of the euro recently led to many of these card networks (such as Switzerland's [...] "EC direkt", Austria's [...] "Bankomatkasse" [...] and Switch in the United Kingdom) being re-branded with the internationally recognised Maestro logo, {{which is part of the}} MasterCard brand. Some debit cards are dual branded with the logo of the (former) national card as well as Maestro (for example, EC cards in Germany, Switch and Solo in the UK, Pinpas cards in the Netherlands, Bancontact cards in Belgium, etc.). The use of a debit card system allows operators to package their product more effectively while monitoring customer spending.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia, cheques {{have almost}} {{completely}} vanished {{in favour of}} direct bank transfers and electronic payments. Direct bank transfers, using so-called giro transfers, have been standard procedure since the 1950s to send and receive regular payments like rent and wages and even mail-order invoices. In the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, all kinds of invoices are commonly accompanied by so-called acceptgiros (Netherlands) or Überweisungen (German), which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payee's account details and the amount payable. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank, which will then transfer the money. It is also very common to allow the payee to automatically withdraw the requested amount from the payer's account (Lastschrifteinzug (German) or Incasso (machtiging) (Netherlands)). Though similar to paying by cheque, the payee only needs the payer's bank and account number. Since the early 1990s, this method of payment has also been available to merchants. Due to this, credit cards are rather uncommon in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and are mostly used to give access to credit {{rather than as a}} payment mechanism. However, debit cards are widespread in these countries, since virtually all Austrian, German and Dutch banks issue debit cards instead of simple ATM cards for use on current accounts. Acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late 1990s, because of the abolition of the <b>Eurocheque.</b> Cashing a foreign bank cheque is possible, but usually very expensive.|$|E

Cryptography {{is an art}} {{or science}} used {{to take care of}} {{security}} and data secret or information in order not to know by one who have no business. Reverse of cryptography is cryptanalysis, that is art or science to solve encoding secret without passing the way of which ought to. DES algorithm represent one of the symmetry cryptography algorithm used to protect data in the field of banking, that is to make encoding in card of an ATM. The Objective of this thesis writing is to know the determination process of PIN in ATM card which is using DES algorithm and can solve encoding secret of DES algorithm at ATM card using probability theory. ATM which is discussed in this thesis is ATM <b>Eurocheque.</b> Research method which is used in writing of this thesis is literature study and simulation. As for stages, steps taken is beforehand formulate process of encryption and decryption data use DES algorithm later, then application of DES algorithm in security system of ATM that is to determine four PIN digit in ATM. The next step is using theorys in probability conducted cryptanalysis in security system of ATM. From the analysis in this thesis, it can be concluded that DES algorithm which is used in the security system of ATM is still open opportunity to cryptanalys to conduct cryptanalysis on that system. By knowing the magnetic stripe data in an ATM, a cryptanalys can guess four PIN digit which used by the consumer of an ATM by using probability theory. ...|$|E
