25|$|The two armies stood face to <b>face</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, {{with neither}} of them willing to {{initiate}} the attack. At last, Kopek launched an attack, and scattered Malik Kafur's soldiers. However, Malik Kafur soon rallied his men, and completely routed the Mongol army. Kebak was taken captive, {{when he was about}} to be killed by the Delhi soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Wolf was {{an active}} agent in his father's {{financial}} transactions, and shared his dignity as court factor. He later experienced great reverses of fortune, however. Having invested {{a large part of}} his wealth in loans to the Bavarian government, the stipulated terms of repayment were not kept, and bankruptcy stared him in the <b>face.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> time he was able to pay only half of the interest on the 150,000 florins which Samson Wertheimer had donated to charity, and of which Wolf was trustee. On his father's donation of 22,000 florins in favor of the German Jews in Palestine he did not pay any interest after 1733. His embarrassment was ended by Elector Maximilian, who liquidated his debts. In his will (1762) Wolf declared that, although entailing a great loss upon him, he accepted this liquidation in order to do justice to his creditors. Further, he enjoined his children to pay in full his father's donation of 22,000 florins, although in 1759 he (Wolf) had returned to the Frankfurt congregation 10,000 florins which it had contributed to this fund.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{did meet}} each other on one occasion, purely by chance, in August 1879, while Tchaikovsky was staying at the Meck estate at Simaki. He had gone for his daily walk in the forest {{somewhat}} earlier than usual, unaware that she was late for her daily drive through that same area {{with the rest of}} her family. As a result, they came face to <b>face</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments; he tipped his hat politely, she was nonplussed, but no words were spoken. [...] He wrote to her the same evening to apologise for the inadvertent breach of their arrangement. She responded, saying there was nothing to apologise for, and she even invited him to visit her home to see her new paintings, but at a time when she would be away.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{materials}} used for masks include wax, fired clay, leather, cloth, wire mesh, sheet metal, rubber tires, cardboard and paper mache. Masks of wax {{are made in}} the Mexico City area, which perfectly fit the wearers <b>face</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very realistic appearance. Other areas to use wax in this way include Villa de Zaachila, San Bartolo Coyotepec and Zapotec communities near the city of Oaxaca [...] These masks are made by molding the wax to the wearer’s own face. Tools used by wood mask makers include machetes, knives and blades, often fashioned by the craftsman himself. Other tools can include chisels, pliers and more with sandpaper or pumice stone for smoothing. Sometimes the masks are covered in plaster to achieve a smooth finish. Lacquer is used on masks in locations in Michoacán and Guerrero, where the technique is applied to a number of other items as well.|$|E
2500|$|After the nWo disbanded again, Steiner joined The Millionaire's Club {{in their}} feud with Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff's New Blood stable, turning <b>face</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brief time. At Spring Stampede, he competed {{in a tournament}} for the United States Championship, {{defeating}} The Wall by disqualification when he blinded him, which caused Wall to accidentally chokeslam the referee through a table instead. He then defeated Mike Awesome by submission with his finisher, the Steiner Recliner before ultimately winning the tournament after defeating Sting in the finals, albeit due to interference from Sting's previous opponent Vampiro. [...] Steiner would also feud with Tank Abbott and his brother, a now-heel Rick. [...] Steiner would turn heel again on former nWo teammate Kevin Nash at Bash at the Beach by helping Goldberg defeat him in a match where fellow nWo alumnus Scott Hall's contract was on the line, joining the New Blood in the process. [...] On November 26, 2000 at Mayhem, Steiner defeated Booker T to win the World Heavyweight Championship, becoming a Triple Crown Champion in the process. In January 2001, Steiner became the centerpiece of Ric Flair's Magnificent Seven stable. He feuded with Booker T over several months and pay-per-views until losing the World Heavyweight Championship back {{to him on the}} final episode of Nitro on March 26, 2001. After WCW was purchased by the WWF, Rechsteiner, unlike many of his colleagues, did not join the WWF and instead opted to wait until his contract with AOL Time Warner expired later that year before seeking other opportunities.|$|E
