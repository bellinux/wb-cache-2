The potential of DSM has already been demonstrated for peak shaving, but not <b>for</b> <b>balancing</b> RES. This paper illustrates the general and financial potential of DSM, describes the current practice and discusses some important aspects when using DSM <b>for</b> <b>balancing.</b> To conclude, the balancing potential of domestic freezers has been analyzed.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{is carried out}} <b>for</b> <b>end-plate</b> joints <b>for</b> rectangular hollow sections (RHS) in axial tension. Two designs of the plate are considered; one with bolts on two {{opposite sides of the}} RHS, and one with bolts on all four sides. The objectives are to determine how well the yield line mechanisms model the capacity and how the stiffness of the joint is predicted by the component method. Supplementary finite element simulations of the tests are added to support the discussion. Results show that the failure mechanisms assumed in EN 1993 - 1 - 8 <b>for</b> extended <b>end-plates</b> can be identified in the laboratory tests, and they yields quite reasonable predictions of the capacity. The initial elastic stiffness of the joints is overestimated if the standard T-stub analogy is applied; therefore a modified approach is suggested. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems there {{must always be}} a balance between supply and demand of power. Any imbalance {{will result in a}} frequency deviation. To reduce the imbalance to zero, ancillary services <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> management are in use. Ancillary services <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> management are characterized by their deployment time and their capacity. These ancillary services as well as the requirements <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> management can be characterized in the frequency domain. Actors, that are responsible <b>for</b> maintaining the <b>balance</b> in the system, can use the characterization in the frequency domain to define their needs for reserve capacity. This paper describes a method for spectral analysis of the required and available reserve capacity...|$|R
