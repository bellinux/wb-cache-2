5|$|The {{developers}} {{created the}} game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use. The memory limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand-animated. To animate the birds, Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge's book Animals In Motion as a reference. Given the limited memory, {{she had to}} balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, Newcomer finalized {{the look of the}} platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Though Newcomer prioritized the wing flap, other sound effects like those related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> were considered important as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{lifecycle}} of Lucilia sericata {{is typical}} of flies in the family Calliphoridae in that the egg hatches into a larva that passes through three instars, enters a prepupal and then a pupal stage before emerging into the adult stage or imago. The female lays a mass of eggs in a wound, a carcass or corpse, or in necrotic or decaying tissue. The eggs hatch in about 9 hours in warm, moist weather, but may {{take as long as}} three days in cooler weather. In this, they differ from the more opportunistic Sarcophagidae, that lay <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> or completely hatched larvae. A single female L. sericata typically lays 150−200 eggs per clutch and may produce 2,000 to 3,000 eggs in her lifetime. The pale yellow or grayish, conical larvae, like those of most blow flies, have two posterior spiracles through which they respire. These larvae are moderately sized, ranging from 10 to 14 millimeters long.|$|E

500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until <b>hatching.</b> <b>Eggs</b> are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup of the outer shell, called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its zinc chelate, which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable bird egg (as opposed to a non-viable egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the albumen (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The albumen protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E

2500|$|When snails {{are raised}} indoors under {{controlled}} conditions, reproduction {{varies according to}} the geographic origin of the breeding stock. For example, one researcher found that H. aspersa snails from Brittany seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at 70°F and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The Center for Heliciculture once recommended 65–75% humidity {{during the day and}} 85–95% at night at 68°F. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For H. aspersa, the optimum temperature for <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> seems to be [...] at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at [...] and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{his tenure}} at the Fish Commission, McDonald invented and {{designed}} a number of innovative fish hatching apparatuses and appliances. McDonald's most prominent apparatus was a fish ladder that enabled salmon and other migrating fish species to ascend the rapids of watercourses, thus increasing {{the extent of their}} spawning grounds. In 1871, McDonald devised [...] "automatic hatching jars" [...] which revolutionized the field of fish farming and were widely utilized by the United States Fish Commission, several state commissions, and commissions in Europe and Japan. The hatching jar apparatus enabled the [...] "vast extension" [...] of the propagation of shad accomplished in the 1880s and 1890s and rendered the work of the Fish Commission practicable commercially. In 1880, he designed a cod box that produced the tidal motion necessary for the hatching of floating eggs. McDonald further perfected his design of the cod box in 1888. In the winter of 1883, McDonald developed a tidal apparatus for the hatching of floating halibut eggs and those of other marine species. The vast production and distribution of fish eggs by the Fish Commission was possible through the utilization of this tidal apparatus. Through the usage of this apparatus, the process of <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> was made cheaper and increased the fish farming output capacity of the commission.|$|E
6000|$|Bread I {{at first}} made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I baked before my fire {{out of doors}} on a shingle {{or the end of}} a stick of timber sawed off in {{building}} my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last found a mixture of rye and Indian meal most convenient and agreeable. In cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an Egyptian his <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs.</b> They were a real cereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making, consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the dough which, it is supposed, taught the leavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter, till I came to [...] "good, sweet, wholesome bread," [...] the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the spiritus which fills its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved like the vestal fire--some precious bottleful, I suppose, first brought over in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land--this seed I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I discovered that even this was not indispensable--for my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process--and I have gladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential ingredient, and after going without it for a year am still {{in the land of the}} living; and I am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottleful in my pocket, which would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal-soda, or other acid or alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to the recipe which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. [...] "Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito, aquae paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu."

When you have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover," [...] that is, in a baking kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this staff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of it for more than a month.|$|E
