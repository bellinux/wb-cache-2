40|$|Crystallization {{of honey}} {{is a common}} process of the honey industry. Liquid honey is {{preferred}} {{by most of the}} consumers and by food companies for ease of handling. Honey is commonly heated during pasteurization in order to liquefy it and inhibit any microbial growth. However, heating can degrade the main quality parameters of honey. A better method compared to expensive and time-consuming heating is desirable to pasteurize, accelerate the liquefaction and retard the crystallization process in honey. The present thesis documents the work done at investigating the effect of the ultrasounds (US) in honey liquefaction, quality alteration and honey decontamination. Firstly, in Chapter 1, the effect of different combinations of US treatment (power, temperature and duration) on honey liquefaction were evaluated by studying the rheological properties of honey; viscosity behaviour, crystal content, tendency to re-crystallization and thermal properties.

40|$|Honey is a {{supersaturated}} sugar solution, {{with the}} least soluble sugar, glucose crystallising as D-glucose monohydrate at room temperature or in cold conditions, in most floral types of honeys. Crystallisation is an undesirable characteristic during the handling, processing, storage and production of liquid honey. Honey that naturally crystallises during the production process is termed candied honey or granulated honey. The fundamental changes that occur in crystals at the microscopic level is not well understood, particularly why different honeys crystallise at different rates, how crystals grow with time, and why and how different sized crystals are produced in different floral types of honey. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the crystallisation process in different floral types of Australian honey was gained through the first detailed, microscopic study of the natural, D-glucose monohydrate crystallisation process in Australian honeys. Here, crystallisation studies of different samples of different floral types of Australian honey were carried out at the optimum crystallisation temperature of 14 °C. Firstly, an image analysis method was developed for viewing individual crystals at the microscopic level. Secondly, samples of different floral types of honey were monitored for crystal formation and growth, with honey types selected for a replicated study. Thirdly, honey samples were liquefied using heat to dissolve crystals, and centrifuged to remove any nuclei that may affect crystallisation, prior to storage at 14 °C. Here, the method for preparing the microscope slides containing one small drop of liquefied honey was critical. The cover slip must be sealed to prevent adverse effects of air and moisture movement. In this replicated study, crystal formation and crystal growth were monitored successfully at regular intervals during storage at 14 °C, for selected honeys such as canola, Salvation Jane, spotted gum, red gum, and yellow box honeys, and a reworked mixed floral honey. Both needles and the uniquely shaped plate crystals form, including the conversion of needles to plates given the correct supersaturation conditions. The amount of supersaturation {{in any part of}} the honey drop can explain the type of crystal formations produced. Fourthly, fructose, glucose and moisture contents were determined for the honey samples used in the replicated study, so as to identify a correlation between the three crystallisation indices suggested by White et al. (1962) for predicting crystallising tendency, and the microscopic and normal visual observations of honey crystallisation. The granulating indicator of glucose/water ratio was able to explain most of the microscopic and visual observations of crystallisation in these honey samples. Direct heating of honey for long periods is the present method used to dissolve D-glucose monohydrate crystals during the honey packing process. However, this is a time consuming, energy inefficient, and not a cost effective means for liquefying candied honey. Therefore, an alternate novel means for liquefying candied honey using a shorttime high power ultrasound treatment, rather than the standard heat treatment, was studied in depth, with a view to producing data {{that could be used for}} the scaling-up for industrial application within the Australian honey industry. In this part of the project, the effect of high power ultrasound on cavitation of sugar solutions was initially studied so as to better understand the effect of ultrasound on honey. An experiment was carried with the aim of developing a method to determine cavitation by way of measuring the size of the cavitation bubbles generated by ultrasound. A literature method was tested to explore the possibility of measuring the cavitation bubble size by laser diffraction instrument, Malvern Mastersizer/E. The data of bubble fields were analysed and percentage frequency by volume versus particle size plots, and percentage undersize by volume versus particle size plots were obtained. The results of this experiment for pure water and fructose solutions showed that the size of the bubbles generated by ultrasonication is more than 600 µm, which is the maximum measurable limit of the Malvern Mastersizer/E. Therefore, the experimental setup with Malvern Mastersizer/E can not be used for measuring cavitation bubbles generated by ultrasound. Another literature method for measuring cavitation was trialled; this involved calculating the cavitational yield by measuring the amount of iodine liberated by ultrasonication in aqueous potassium iodide solutions, as measured by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. However, the sensitivity of the spectrophotometer used was low and unable to measure the absorbance of 0. 1 - 0. 2 x 10  3 mg/mL iodine solutions, which is in the range of iodine produced by the ultrasonication of aqueous potassium iodide solutions. Therefore, the study of the effect of high power ultrasound on cavitation of sugar solutions was not continued further. Next, three major experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the effect of ultrasound on the liquefaction of candied honey, and for controlling crystallisation. A computer-controlled bench-top ultrasound processor was used. Firstly, an experiment was undertaken to select the type of ultrasonic sonotrode, from the three sonotrodes that were available, that better liquefies a sample of candied Salvation Jane honey. The 40 mm diameter sonotrode operated at a 12 µm amplitude optimally liquefies candied Salvation Jane honey. Secondly, six ultrasound energy levels were used with the selected 40 mm diameter sonotrode operated at a 12 µm amplitude, to determine the optimum energy requirement for liquefying candied Salvation Jane honey. The specific energy input required for complete liquefaction of 1 kg of candied Salvation Jane honey is 0. 126 kWh, which is the basic design criteria required for the design of an industrial scale ultrasound processing system. The hydroxymethylfurfural concentration, and the <b>diastase</b> and invertase <b>activities</b> of ultrasound treated Salvation Jane honey were determined and compared with standard heat-treated Salvation Jane honey. There is no detrimental effect on <b>diastase</b> and invertase <b>activities</b> due to ultrasound treatment. In addition, the hydroxymethylfurfural concentration of ultrasound-treated honey was lower than that for heat-treated honey. These findings suggest that the ultrasound treatment needed to liquefy honey does not affect the chemical quality parameters relative to that produced by a heat treatment similar to that used in the honey industry. Thirdly, a study to see if ultrasound treatment of honey delays the crystallisation of liquefied honey. Here, candied reworked mixed honey (a very fast crystallising honey) was completely liquefied by the optimum ultrasound treatment conditions. The rate of crystallisation for ultrasound-liquefied honey was compared to that for heat-liquefied honey, when both were stored at the optimum crystallisation temperature of 14 °C. Interestingly, ultrasound treatment delays the crystallisation in comparison with the standard heat treatment. Crystallisation is a desirable character in the creamed honey production process. Creamed honey is a rapidly crystallised honey that requires honey blends involving two types of honey: fast crystallising honey types and highly flavour honey types. Creamed honey is used as a spread and its spreadability is determined by the size of the D-glucose monohydrate crystals and how uniform is their size distribution. Currently, there can be variation in the quality of creamed honey produced by industry due to a lack of understanding concerning the creamed honey process. To study this process, a differential scanning calorimetric method was optimised for determining the crystalline D-glucose monohydrate content in creamed honey. Next, a laboratory creamed honey process was successfully developed and optimised based on the universally used Dyce method, resulting in the production of laboratory creamed honey that had a similar amount of D-glucose monohydrate crystals to that of commercial creamed honey. Application of short-time high power ultrasound in the creamed honey production was then studied, so as to optimise process parameters with the view of enhancing nucleation rates. The theory is that high-power ultrasound will reduce the size of the existing crystals and increase nucleation by incorporating cavitation bubbles, which act as nuclei in crystallisation. Due to the increase of number nuclei, a large number of fine crystals should be formed rapidly, producing high quality creamed honey. A more stable and smoother textured creamed honey then results from uniform crystal growth. Therefore, short-time high power ultrasound was used to treat starter (seed) honey prior to adding it to honey blends (canola/red gum and alfalfa/blue gum honeys), while the honey blends with added untreated seed honey were ultrasound treated during the crystallisation period. Comparison of the crystalline D-glucose monohydrate content of ultrasound treated laboratory creamed honeys with untreated laboratory creamed honeys showed that there was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in the crystalline D-glucose monohydrate contents. However, conditioning (storing at 30 °C) of the laboratory creamed honeys produced a small change in the crystal content, finally producing a crystal content similar to that of commercial creamed honey. In addition, conditioning led to a softening and improvement in the spreadability of the laboratory creamed honeys. In conclusion, this study shows that high power ultrasound can be used to effectively liquefy candied honey while not effecting honey quality parameters, without the need for the long heat treatment that is presently used in the honey industry. In addition, ultrasound treatment converts candied honey to a liquid honey that is more stable to crystallisation during storage, than is liquid honey produced from candied honey by heat treatment. Further, liquefaction of candied honey by high-power ultrasound treatment has the potential to reduce the handling and energy costs for beekeepers and honey packers, which would produce great benefit for the Australian honey industry...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{proposes to}} study a {{possible}} correlation between some qualitys parameters of honey and pollution level with heavy metals of the origin areas. In this end, 21 samples of different honey types (Linden tree, Acacia, Multifloral) were collected and analyzed in terms of: acidity, coefficient of <b>diastase</b> <b>activity</b> andconcentration of heavy metals. Experimental data did not indicate a direct correlation between the acidity of honey samples and pollution level of the origin areas honey, but indicate a high acidity of multifloral honey comparatively with monofloral one. Also, the Acacia honey proves to be more acidic than the Linden Tree. No direct correlation between the coefficient of <b>diastase</b> <b>activity</b> and the pollution level can be established. Regarding the concentrations of heavy metals significant exceeds of MAL in cases of Pb and Zn have been recorded both in monofloral and multifloral honey coming from Baia Mare and also exceeds of Cu and Cd in monofloral honey.

40|$|Summary Twenty-four {{samples of}} Apis mellifera honey and twenty-four samples of Melipona subnitida (Jandaira) honey were {{collected}} in the northeast of Brazil. Moisture, hydroxymethylfurfural, free acidity, insoluble solids in water, <b>diastase</b> <b>activity,</b> ashes, electrical conductivity, proteins, lipids, total carbohydrates, energy and sugars were the parameters analysed. The efficiency of the qualitative tests (Fiehe’s test, Lugol’s reac-tion, Lund’s reaction) was tested. Pollen types and the corresponding plant species were identified in all samples (3 in Apis and 1 in Melipona). Apis mellifera honey samples demonstrated parameters in accor-dance with the Brazilian Legislation, while the Melipona subnitida honey samples displayed moisture (24. 80 %) and <b>diastase</b> <b>activity</b> (null) in discordance with the established by the regulation for Apis mellif-era honeys. Apis honey samples presented higher values of electric conductivity (284. 00 lS cm 1) than the obtained from the Jandaira honey samples (102. 77 lS cm 1) {{as well as a}} darker colour (26. 67 mmPfund) when compared with Jandaira honey (7. 00 mmPfund). The concentration of the glucose, fructose and sucrose was higher in the Apis honeys than in the Jandaira honey.

40|$|Royal jelly (RJ) {{is used as}} a revitalizing tonic. In {{order to}} avoid {{rejection}} to its acid taste, it is added to honey. There are regulations for honey and for royal jelly separately but not for the mixture. The objective of this work is, therefore, to verify if the same methods used for pure honey quality control can be used for honey mixed with royal jelly and also the presence of RJ through 10 -HDA determination. The methods used were: moisture, reducing sugars, apparent sucrose, ash, hydroxymethylfurfural, insoluble solids, <b>diastase</b> <b>activity,</b> acidity and 10 -HDA. Samples were prepared by adding 0 - 100 % of RJ in honey. The results showed that the ash method was the only suitable one to all the samples. The acidity analysis (direct titration) was suitable to 0 - 30 %RJ samples; the reducing sugar analysis was suitable to 0 - 20 % RJ samples. Concerning moisture analysis the refractometric method is suitable to 0 - 10 % RJ and the Infra Red method is suggested to be used for samples with more than 10 % RJ. The methods for <b>diastase</b> <b>activity,</b> HMF, apparent sucrose and insoluble solids were inadequate for all samples with RJ.

40|$|Fast {{evaluation}} of honey quality is a topical and significant {{problem of the}} food industry, bee keepers and consumers. In this work, 22 samples of commercially available honey aromas (with methyl and ethyl esters of phenylacetic acid predominated), 13 samples of authentic honey collected directly from bee keepers (characterised by high content of benzaldehyde, 2 -phenylethanol, hotrienol and 2 -phenylacetaldehyde) and 63 honeys purchased from an outdoor market were evaluated based on volatiles profiles determined through solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) and then suspicious samples were identified. The results were statistically processed and compared with results of a sensory analysis. Six honeys, which differed significantly in volatiles profiles (outliers detected by Factor Analysis), selected volatile substance representation (furan- 2 -carbaldehyde, 1, 4 -dimethylpyrazole, benzaldehyde, 2 -phenylacetaldehyde) and honey aroma intensity and pleasantness were subjected to targeted analyses (i. e. determination of 5 -(hydroxymethyl) - 2 -furaldehyde, <b>diastase</b> <b>activity,</b> unauthorized additive presence).
