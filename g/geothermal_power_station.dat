500|$|Realizing {{that the}} only way to save Atlantis is to move the city out of the satellite's range, McKay and Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) decide to use their one Zero Point Module and the <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> found in [...] "Submersion" [...] to power the stardrive. Lorne (Kavan Smith) and a {{squadron}} of F-302s are sent to temporarily block the beam using a large moon fragment, so that shield power can be redirected into the stardrive. However, the beam resumes as the city lifts off, briefly grazing the central tower before the shield can be restored. Weir is severely injured and is taken to the infirmary by Beckett's replacement, Jennifer Keller (Jewel Staite). Atlantis jumps into hyperspace, but the stardrive unexpectedly shuts down well before they reach their destination. McKay realizes that they are marooned in deep space, with only 24 hours before the shield runs out of power and the city's occupants are exposed to space.|$|E

50|$|The Wairakei ring {{is a set}} of {{transmission}} lines north of Lake Taupo linking Wairakei with Whakamaru. These lines connect several hydro and <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> into the national grid, enabling their power to be exported to the major centres of electricity demand. A number of new <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are being built or are planned for the area, and a higher capacity line is needed to transport their power to market.In December 2008 Transpower submitted a Grid Upgrade proposal to the Electricity Commission to build a new double circuit 220 kV line that will help facilitate the connection of up to 1000 MW of new generation expected in the region over the next 5-7 years. The Commission announced their intention to approve the investment on 20 February 2009. Transpower aims to complete the project by mid-2013. The existing Wairakei to Whakamaru B line will be decommissioned and removed. The estimated cost of the project is $141 million.|$|R

The largest transmission route is to New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, approximately 200 km to the north - three 220 kV circuits connect Whakamaru to Otahuhu in southern Auckland, with an additional circuit serving Otahuhu via Hamilton.|$|R
50|$|Development of new <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> {{essentially}} stopped {{since the}} mid 1990s, mainly due to the strong resistance from local communities. Most of the potential sites are located in government-protected areas and in tourist destinations, thanks {{to the presence of}} traditional hot springs or onsen. Local communities in these areas are often dependent on revenue from tourists visiting onsen, and are opposed to geothermal developments because of the negative impact that the industry may have on the scenery and the resulting damage to the tourism industry and the local economy.|$|R
50|$|Of other {{renewable}} energy sources, Japan has partially exploited geothermal energy. The country had six <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> {{with a combined}} capacity of 133 megawatts in 1989. By 2011, the country had 18 geothermal plants. Japan has the third largest geothermal reserves in the world, and geothermal energy in particular is being heavily focused on {{as a source of}} power following the Fukushima disaster and subsequent shut down of all nuclear reactors. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is currently exploring over 40 locations to see if geothermal energy plants would be compatible.|$|R
