5|$|The {{earliest}} known embryos, from China's Doushantuo Formation, appear just {{a million}} years after the Earth emerged from a global glaciation, suggesting that ice cover and cold oceans may <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> emergence of multicellular life. Potentially, complex life may have evolved before these glaciations, and been wiped out. However, the diversity of life in modern Antarctica has sparked disagreement over whether cold temperatures increase or decrease the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E

5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Nevertheless, none of these measures appear to <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} appear to <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> final destruction and {{collapse of the}} Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{after all}} seven books had been published, Graeme Davis {{regarded}} Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the weakest of the series, and {{agreed that the}} plot structure {{is much the same}} as in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has an {{authorised}} {{strength of}} 1,500 regular personnel and 1,500 reservists. It has never reached these totals as funding shortfalls <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> reserve component from being formed and the Army's two regular battalions have remained under-strength. While all the F-FDTL's personnel were initially FALINTIL veterans the force's composition {{has changed over}} time and few soldiers from the insurgency remain due to the force's narrow age requirement. After the F-FDTL's 1st Battalion was established in 2001 recruitment was opened to all East Timorese above the age of 18, including women. Few women have joined the F-FDTL, however, and as at February 2010 only seven percent of new recruits were female.|$|E

5|$|The details {{surrounding}} Warkworth Castle's {{role in the}} English Civil War are unclear, but {{the conflict}} resulted in further damage to the structure. Initially held by Royalist forces, the castle was still important enough that when the Scots invaded in 1644 they forced its surrender. Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, supported Parliament, which may <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> Scots from doing much damage to the castle. Parliamentarian forces took over the castle in 1648; when they withdrew they removed the castle's doors and iron {{so that it could}} not be reused by the enemy. They may also have partially demolished some of the castle, and may be responsible for its present state. Algernon Percy unsuccessfully applied for compensation in 1649 for the damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Operation Matterhorn was not successful. The nine raids {{conducted}} against Japan via {{bases in}} China succeeded only in destroying Ōmura's aircraft factory. XXBomber Command lost 125 B-29s {{during all of}} its operations from bases in India and China, though only 22 or 29 were destroyed by Japanese forces; {{the majority of the}} losses were due to flying accidents. The attacks had a limited impact on Japanese civilian morale but forced the Japanese military to reinforce the home islands' air defenses {{at the expense of other}} areas. These results did not justify the large allocation of Allied resources to the operation, however. Moreover, the diversion of some supply aircraft flown between India and China to support XXBomber Command's efforts may <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Air Force from undertaking more effective operations against Japanese positions and shipping. The official history of the USAAF judged that the difficulty of transporting adequate supplies to India and China was the most important factor behind the failure of Operation Matterhorn, though technical problems with the B-29s and the inexperience of their crews also hindered the campaign. The adverse weather conditions common over Japan also limited the effectiveness of the Superfortresses, as crews that managed to reach their target were often unable to bomb accurately due to high winds or cloud cover.|$|E

5|$|Teaching {{commitments}} left MacLaren {{unavailable for}} the start of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July. Although he had only batted once in the season, he was chosen to play in the second Test match of the summer between England and Australia, a selection made controversial by his lack of cricket. As the Test was played at Old Trafford, the England team was chosen by the Lancashire committee, who recognised that MacLaren would attract spectators as a local player. He was dismissed by the first ball he faced in the first innings, and scored 15 runs in the second as England were defeated. Shortly after the Test, he scored 226 against Kent to take Lancashire to a draw in a match they seemed likely to lose. This was enough for him to retain his place in the team for the final Test match, where he scored 20 and 6. He batted effectively for the rest of the season, finishing with 713 runs for Lancashire at 54.85. Critics praised his batting, but his absences may <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> team from winning the Championship; they finished second. In all first-class matches, he scored 922 runs at 36.88.|$|E
5|$|By {{winning the}} PCC Northern Division, Oregon {{earned the right}} to play the winner of the Southern Division in a best-of-three playoff series, with the games held at McArthur Court. In {{addition}} to the PCC championship, the winner would gain a berth in the first NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which the National Association of Basketball Coaches would run. The series was slated to be held between March 10–13, but a tie between California and Southern California for first place in the Southern Division necessitated a one-game playoff. Rumors began that the PCC championship series would be postponed by one week, which would <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> winner from competing in the NCAA Tournament; the event was scheduled to begin on March 20. In response, Oregon declared that they would not play if the series was scheduled to end after March 14. Despite the school's claim, it agreed to a rescheduling approved by PCC member schools, in which the series was set for March 16–18. Hobson declared that Oregon would accept an invitation to the NCAA Tournament, following hints that the PCC champion might be passed over for a bid in favor of a PCC team that did not receive a shortened rest between games. California won the Southern Division playoff 42–36 over Southern California to become the Webfoots' opponent in the PCC championship series. Dick later noted that he considered it vital for Oregon to sweep the Golden Bears in two games, to avoid an overnight trip to San Francisco for the NCAA Tournament and secure an off day in the Webfoots' schedule.|$|E
5|$|On several {{occasions}} {{over the course}} of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family. When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war. During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom. Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murdersthe shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft IIIin time to <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>the</b> killings. He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.|$|E
