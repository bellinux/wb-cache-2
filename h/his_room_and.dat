5|$|On 9 January 1999, the Marquess {{complained of}} a stomach ache and dizziness, and {{spent most of}} the day in bed. The {{following}} morning, his butler went into <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> found he was not breathing. Along with Whitby, they attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and called an ambulance. This arrived about 11:30am, when paramedics concluded he had died.|$|E
5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> {{focused the}} rays of {{sunlight}} coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15pm, and observed {{for half an hour}} until sunset at 3:53pm.|$|E

5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|In {{her plan}} {{to kill her}} husband she found an ally in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and spatharius (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then {{recruited}} the king's cubicularius (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on June 28, care was taken to leave {{the door open and}} unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Ryan {{goes to the}} {{basement}} to check on Gloria, but is electrocuted by the Boogeyman while standing in a puddle of water. Laura finds a file on her brother {{and those of other}} patients with bogyphobia (phobia of the Boogeyman). She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading them to believe that Laura is hallucinating.

5|$|Few records exist of Thomas Coke's early years, {{although}} {{it is known that}} he was educated in Longford, Derbyshire, before going to a school in Wandsworth run by French refugees. In 1765 he was sent to Eton College, where he was joined by William Windham, a close friend in his later life. Coke was apparently happy at Eton, and was excellent at field sports; on one occasion 70 snipes he had killed were found in <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> on another he narrowly avoiding being punished for shooting a pheasant in Windsor Park. He was not particularly interested in his academic studies, {{but by the time he}} left Eton in 1771 Coke had developed a close circle of friends and connections from the landowning class, and practical skills to deal with his future estates. After leaving school he undertook a Grand Tour of Europe, financed by his father and his great-aunt (who offered him £500 not to go to a university, regarding them as dens of vice). Coke visited France and Italy, where he witnessed the marriage of the Young Pretender to Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern; Louise apparently fell in love with Coke, preferring the similarly-aged Englishman to her 52-year-old alcoholic husband.|$|E
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E

5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and {{is confined to}} the couch for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his things. At school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up pulling his prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off of her seat and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign exchange program. They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown {{a picture of a}} lovely château in the heart of France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E

Believing Kenneth might be a serial killer, he tells Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and they decide to investigate Kenneth's bedroom. At Kenneth's apartment, they discover a bug bomb in <b>his</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> reaching the conclusion that Kenneth is trying to poison them and they run out of his apartment. They forget {{to close the door}} and the bug bomb ends up killing the bird. When they tell Kenneth about his bird, he is more upset by the fact that Tracy and Jenna did not trust him, than the death of his bird. Tracy and Jenna, feeling horrible about what they have done, arrange a surprise for Kenneth at his apartment. When Kenneth goes home, he finds an entire collection of birds.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes to <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> puts her hand on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program.

5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E
5|$|After {{a medical}} exam, Mulder {{finds out that}} Orison has three times the bloodflow {{capacity}} of the brain due to a hole in he has drilled into his own head, allowing him to perform mental tricks by hypnotizing people. Orison hypnotizes the security guard in <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> easily escapes. Meanwhile, at Orison's apartment, a prostitute escapes when Pfaster attacks her for wearing a wig. Orison then finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint. In the woods, Orison digs a grave for Pfaster, who morphs into a demonic beast and kills him, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, telling them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully, who tells him {{that the only reason}} he was not given the death penalty was because she asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song on his radio and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he goes over to her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from the closet and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into <b>his</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E
