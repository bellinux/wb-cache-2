40|$|Structural {{analyses}} in the Lake Edison area of {{the central}} Sierra Nevada, California, show that prominent north-northeast–trending lineaments represent traces of joints and faults that have accommodated slip within a 4. 8 -km-wide right-lateral north-northwest–trending monoclinal <b>kink</b> band. The kilometer-scale <b>kink</b> band formed in Cretaceous granitic rocks, and the closely spaced, mineralized joints and faults formed at 79 Ma. Joints and faults strike ∼ 070 ° within the <b>kink</b> band and 020 °– 030 ° outside the <b>kink</b> band. A kink-band kinematic model indicates that ∼ 3. 7 (+ 2. 1,− 1. 9) km of right-lateral displacement was accommodated across the <b>kink</b> band and {{that as much as}} 148 m of left-lateral slip on faults within the <b>kink</b> band occurred. A sensitivity study on four model parameters varied the angle made by the inner and outer limbs of the <b>kink</b> band, the number of faults within the <b>kink</b> band, and the kink-band width and length. This analysis yields estimates for right-lateral displacement across the <b>kink</b> band and left-lateral slip on faults within the <b>kink</b> band that fall into the range constrained by geologic relationships. <b>Kinking</b> may have been the last stage of right-lateral deformation, which started with development of the Rosy Finch shear zone. The presence of curved lineaments in the southern Sierra Nevada indicates that kilometer-scale <b>kink</b> bands may exist elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada batholith. Such arc-parallel <b>kinking</b> has been described in several other transpressive settings, and kilometer-scale <b>kink</b> bands may be a process by which late-stage, arc-parallel deformation is accommodated in convergent margins...|$|R

5|$|Davies {{travelled}} to United Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California on 11 April 1969, {{to produce}} American pop band The Turtles' LP Turtle Soup with engineer Chuck Britz. While in Los Angeles, Davies helped negotiate {{an end to}} the concert ban placed on the <b>Kinks</b> by the American Federation of Musicians in 1965. Although neither the <b>Kinks</b> nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, {{at the time it was}} widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. After negotiations with Davies, the Federation relented, opening up an opportunity for the group to return to touring in America. Once the main sessions for the Turtles LP were completed, Davies returned to England. While Davies was abroad, the other members of the band had been rehearsing and practising for the upcoming album, as well as lead guitarist Dave Davies' solo album, nicknamed A Hole in the Sock of. When Ray returned, the <b>Kinks</b> regrouped at his house in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, to rehearse the upcoming album Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Ray Davies {{released}} the solo album Storyteller, a companion piece to X-Ray, in 1998. Originally written {{two years earlier}} as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother. Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network VH1 launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled VH1 Storytellers. Dave Davies spoke favourably of a <b>Kinks</b> reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both of the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again. However, hopes for a reunion were dashed when in June 2004 Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily impairing his ability to speak and play guitar. Following Dave's recovery, the <b>Kinks</b> were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005, with {{all four of the}} original band members in attendance. The award was presented by The Who's guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, a longtime <b>Kinks</b> fan and friend of Ray Davies. The induction helped fuel sales for the group; in August 2007, a re-entry of The Ultimate Collection, a compilation of material spanning the band's career, reached number 32 on the UK Top 100 album chart and number one on the UK Indie album chart.|$|E

Based on Stroh formalism, a system of singular integral equations governing the <b>kinking</b> crack with small <b>kink</b> length is given in a simple, straightforward form. The explicit expressions of the stress intensity factors, T-stresses, and energy release rates at the <b>kinked</b> crack tip {{are presented}} in terms of some nondimensional coecients together with the stress intensity factors, T-stresses, and the coecients of the third term acting on the main crack tip prior to crack <b>kinking.</b> The nondimensional coecients depend on <b>kink</b> angle and material constants, but not on <b>kink</b> length. The energy release rate ratio which may characterize the competition along dierent crack growth directions is provided. The role of T-stresses and the third-term applied at the main crack field are determined which can be significant in the <b>kinking</b> and {{the stability of the}} <b>kinked</b> crack.

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as <b>kinks,</b> steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We study {{radiation}} and energy balance for an antiplane fault containing a <b>kink.</b> A semi-infinite crack {{with a sharp}} rupture front propagates along the flat portion of a <b>kinked</b> crack. At time t 0, the crack reaches the <b>kink</b> located at the origin of coordinates and continues propagating beyond the <b>kink</b> at a different speed. We com-pute the exact solution for this problem using a Chaplygin transformation, {{a variation of the}} well-known Cagniard–de Hoop method. We first establish an integral equation for the computation of stress intensity factor after the <b>kink</b> and then we solve numeri-cally for the velocity and stress field around the crack. We find that the propagation of the crack across the <b>kink</b> produces a sharp change in energy balance that in turn pro-duces a circular SH wave centered at the <b>kink</b> that we call the <b>kink</b> wave. Across the wavefront of this wave there is a sudden jump in particle velocity and radial stress. At the same time, a local stress concentration appears on the external side of the <b>kink.</b> We establish an exact energy balance for this problem in terms of energy rates per unit crack advance. Radiated energy is shown to maintain the balance between elastic en-ergy released by the bulk and energy used to make the crack advance. The <b>kink</b> wave-front is the boundary between a field dominated by the initial flat portion of the crack and a region dominated by radiation from the <b>kink...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>kinked</b> crack, {{which is}} {{reflecting}} {{back into the}} first medium at the interface of two bonded anisotropic media under antiplane shear loading, is analyzed by using the singular point method of complex potential functions.

The vertex of the <b>kinked</b> crack has the different stress singularity {{from that of the}} tips of the <b>kinked</b> crack. Taking account of this stress singularity of the vertex as well as the stress singularity of the <b>kinked</b> crack tips, the singular integral equations are solved numerically.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the ϕ 4 <b>kink</b> {{scattering}} from a spatially localized PT-symmetric defect {{and the effect}} of the <b>kink’s</b> internal mode (IM) is discussed. It is demonstrated that if a <b>kink</b> hits the defect from the gain side, a noticeable IM is excited, while for the <b>kink</b> coming from the opposite direction the mode excitation is much weaker. This asymmetry is a principal finding of the present work. Similar to the case of the sine-Gordon <b>kink</b> studied earlier, it is found that the ϕ 4 <b>kink</b> approaching the defect from the gain side always passes through the defect, while in the opposite case it must have sufficiently large initial velocity, otherwise it is trapped by the loss region. It is found that for the <b>kink</b> with IM the critical velocity is smaller, meaning that the <b>kink</b> bearing IM can pass more easily through the loss region. This feature, namely the “increased transparency” of the defect as regards the motion of the <b>kink</b> in the presence of IM is the second key finding of the present work. A two degree of freedom collective variable model offered recently by one of the co-authors is shown to be capable of reproducing both principal findings of the present work. A simpler, analytically tractable single degree of freedom collective variable method is used to calculate analytically the <b>kink</b> phase shift and the <b>kink</b> critical velocity sufficient to pass through the defect. Comparison with the numerical results suggests that the collective variable method is able to predict these parameters with a high accuracy...|$|R
5|$|Ray Davies {{travelled}} to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate {{an end to}} the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, {{opening up}} an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the <b>Kinks</b> recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The <b>Kinks</b> embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.|$|E
