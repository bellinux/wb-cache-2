2500|$|Once Leonardo DiCaprio {{agreed to}} do the film, it went almost {{immediately}} into production. DiCaprio said that he saw his character as [...] "unheroic" [...] and [...] "slightly cowardly" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "willing to be just a product of his environment". DiCaprio prepared for the role by watching several documentaries about the 1950s and the origin of suburbs. He said that the film was not meant to be a romance and that he and Winslet intentionally avoided films that show them in romantic roles since Titanic. Both DiCaprio and Winslet were reluctant to make films similar to Titanic because [...] "we <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be a fundamental mistake to try to repeat any of those themes". To prepare for the role, Winslet read The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan.|$|E

He couldn't {{understand}} a word said by the man in whose yard he found himself when he climbed the bank after his long swim across the Big River. But he didn't have to understand words to know that he had found a friend. So he allowed the man to drive him gently over to an open shed where there was a pile of soft hay and there he lay down, so tired that it seemed to him he couldn't move another step.|$|E
5000|$|Rory Gallagher, {{who wrote}} the song, is a bit mental. [...] I was playing four-hour gigs to drunken {{tourists}} and I just wasn't getting anything out of it.

Things you wonder about, things you have yet to make up your mind about. There's more to deal with than just your fundamental street wisdom. Dreams. Nightmares.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was a year}} later, {{at the age of}} six, that Vai {{experienced}} {{his first}} introduction to the guitar, remembering that, [...] "I saw this nine-year-old boy playing the guitar in my grade school auditorium, and that was another epiphany that I had.

5000|$|Obsolete was {{initially}} released {{in a standard}} format in July 1998. Bell explained, [...] "We wanted the album to come as the concept and the whole story.

We <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would either be a single later on or a B-side or an extra track later on somewhere else. Initially it just didn't fit with the concept."

I knew in my mind, as little as I knew, that that was a hit song. I <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> So, we went right in the studio and started working on it, and I played the lead guitar and everything." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{uniqueness}} of their act made them an immediate success in New York. Their style became the [...] "next big thing" [...] in live comedy. Charles H. Joffe, their producer, remembers {{that sometimes the}} line to their show went around the block. That partly explains why Milton Berle, a major television comedy star, tried three times without success to see their act. Critic Lawrence Christon recalls his first impression after seeing their act: [...] "You <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was a defining moment. They caught the urban tempo, like Woody Allen did." [...] They performed nightly to mostly sold-out shows, in addition to making various TV and radio appearances and appearing in TV commercials.|$|E
