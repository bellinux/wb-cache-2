5|$|As Sylvester himself observed, Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{seems to}} be unique in having such quickly growing values, while simultaneously having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number. This sequence provides an example showing that double-exponential growth <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to cause an integer sequence to be an irrationality sequence.|$|E

5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Enough</b> from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E

Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die Another Day, the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence {{by having the}} opening shot be sighted through the barrel. Beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me, the teasers emphasised not only action sequences but stunts, a practice that prevailed until Casino Royale. The sequence for The World <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Enough</b> is unusually long: at over fourteen minutes it is {{two to three times}} the length of most others.|$|E
5|$|The World <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Enough</b> (1999) is {{the nineteenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film was directed by Michael Apted, with the original story and screenplay written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein. It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The title is taken from {{a line in the}} 1963 novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service.|$|E

5|$|The World <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Enough</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered {{superior to its}} PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold {{more than one million}} copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate {{much faster than}} the amount of visible matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together by huge quantities of dark matter. Similarly, clusters of galaxies {{do not appear to}} have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E

5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} {{independent}} environmental consulting group FishBio {{showed that the}} artificial spring pulse flows from New Melones Dam do fairly little to support salmon and steelhead out-migration in the Stanislaus River. Rather, the fish take their cues from increased water flow due to rainfall, as they naturally would have before the many dams on the Stanislaus River were built. In the spring of 2016 about 12,500 juvenile salmon migrated downriver to the sea during April and May, but less than 1percent migrated during the pulse flow. In years of drought when the lake level is low, releasing water during the spring creates consequences {{later in the year}} – because there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> cold water left for the autumn spawning run.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{literary}} critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's psychological struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's theories on psychoanalysis. Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being disappointed that his traditional religious upbringing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to overcome the temptations of the modern world. Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same}} time being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11 attacks, Madonna {{was in an}} introspective {{mood and}} started writing songs for her next studio album, American Life, with {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film Swept Away in Malta, and also starred in the West End play, Up For Grabs. In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, Die Another Day, directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, The World <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Enough</b> (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States.
