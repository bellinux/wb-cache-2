40|$|Prions are {{comprised}} principally of aggregates of a misfolded host protein and cause fatal transmissible neurodegenerative disorders of mammals, such as variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans and {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} in cattle. Prions pose significant public health concerns through contamination of blood products and surgical instruments, and can resist conventional hospital sterilization methods. Prion infectivity binds avidly to surgical steel and can efficiently transfer infectivity to a suitable host, and much research has been performed to achieve effective prion decontamination of metal surfaces. Here, we exploit the highly sensitive Standard Steel-Binding Assay (SSBA) to perform a direct comparison {{of a variety of}} commercially available <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagents</b> marketed for the removal of prions, alongside conventional sterilization methods. We demonstrate that the efficacy of marketed prion <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagents</b> is highly variable and that the SSBA is able to rapidly evaluate current and future <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagents...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of nucleic acid cross contamination {{in the laboratory}} resulting in false positive results of diagnostic samples is seriously problematic. Despite precautions to minimize or even avoid nucleic acid cross contaminations, it may appear anyway. Until now, no standardized strategy is available to evaluate the efficacy of commercially offered <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagents.</b> Therefore, a protocol for the reliable determination of nucleic acid decontamination efficacy using highly standardized solution and surface tests was established and validated. All tested sodium hypochlorite-based reagents proved to be highly efficient in nucleic acid decontamination even after short reaction times. For DNA Away, a sodium hydroxide-based decontamination product, dose- and time-dependent effectiveness was ascertained. For two other commercial <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagents,</b> the phosphoric acid-based DNA Remover and the non-enzymatic reagent DNA-ExitusPlus™ IF, no reduction of amplifiable DNA/RNA was observed. In conclusion, a simple test procedure for evaluation of the elimination efficacy of <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagents</b> against amplifiable nucleic acid is presented...|$|E

In March 2001, we investigated a pseudo-outbreak of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in three smear negative clinical specimens and would like to present our experience in this communication. Methods : All suspected cases were confirmed by checking the drug susceptibility and DNA fingerprints using spoligotyping as well as restriction fragment length polymorphism.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{studies on}} the interactions of technetium- 99 (Tc) with different organic compounds and soil minerals under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. The report is divided into four parts and includes (1) effect of natural organic matter (NOM) on the complexation and solubility of Tc, (2) complexation between Tc and trichloroethylene (TCE) in aqueous solutions, (3) adsorption of Tc on soil samples from Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP), and (4) adsorption and separation of Tc on activated carbon. Various experimental techniques were applied to characterize and identify Tc complexation with organic compounds and TCE, including liquid-liquid extraction, membrane filtration, size exclusion, and gel chromatography. Results indicate, within the experimental error, Tc (as pertechnetate, TcO{sub 4 }) {{did not appear to}} form complexes with groundwater or natural organic matter under both atmospheric and reducing conditions. However, Tc can form complexes with certain organic compounds or specific functional groups such as salicylate. Tc did not appear to form complexes with TCE in aqueous solution. Both liquid-liquid extraction and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gave no indication Tc was complexed with TCE. The correlations between Tc and TCE concentrations in monitoring wells at PGDP may be a coincidence because TCE was commonly used as a <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagent.</b> Once TCE and Tc entered the groundwater, they behaved similarly because both TcO{sub 4 }{sup {minus}} and TCE are poorly adsorbed by soils. An effective remediation technique to remove TcO{sub 4 }{sup {minus}} from PGDP contaminated groundwater is needed. One possibility is the use of an activated carbon adsorption technique developed in this study...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: PCR {{amplification}} of minute {{quantities of}} degraded DNA for ancient DNA research, forensic analyses, wildlife studies and ultrasensitive diagnostics is often hampered by contamination problems. The extent {{of these problems}} is inversely related to DNA concentration and target fragment size and concern (i) sample contamination, (ii) laboratory surface contamination, (iii) carry-over contamination, and (iv) contamination of reagents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we performed a quantitative evaluation of current decontamination methods for these last three sources of contamination, and developed a new procedure to eliminate contaminating DNA contained in PCR reagents. We observed that most current decontamination methods are either not efficient enough to degrade short contaminating DNA molecules, rendered inefficient by the reagents themselves, or interfere with the PCR when used at doses high enough to eliminate these molecules. We also show that efficient <b>reagent</b> <b>decontamination</b> {{can be achieved by}} using a combination of treatments adapted to different reagent categories. Our procedure involves γ- and UV-irradiation and treatment with a mutant recombinant heat-labile double-strand specific DNase from the Antarctic shrimp Pandalus borealis. Optimal performance of these treatments is achieved in narrow experimental conditions that have been precisely analyzed and defined herein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There is not a single decontamination method valid for all possible contamination sources occurring in PCR reagents and in the molecular biology laboratory and most common decontamination methods are not efficient enough to decontaminate short DNA fragments of low concentration. We developed a versatile multistrategy decontamination procedure for PCR reagents. We demonstrate that this procedure allows efficient <b>reagent</b> <b>decontamination</b> while preserving the efficiency of PCR amplification of minute quantities of DNA...|$|R

40|$|Background: Flucloxacillin is {{a widely}} used {{antibiotic}} but data are lacking on {{the risks associated with}} occupational exposure. Aim: To evaluate flucloxacillin stability; to identify an effective decontamination reagent for flucloxacillin; and to identify glove material that will prevent flucloxacillin permeation. Method: <b>Decontamination</b> <b>reagents</b> used for flucloxacillin wipe sampling and degradation/stability tests included: isopropanol 50 % and 70 %, ethanol 60 % and 100 %, benzalkonium chloride 0. 1 % (Pine O Cleen), sodium hypochlorite 0. 5 % (Chloroclens), sodium hydroxide 0. 03 M and distilled water. Short term (0 to 90 minutes) and daily degradation (0 to 6 days) of flucloxacillin in these media and flucloxacillin recovery from surface wipe sampling was investigated using high pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Flucloxacillin permeation was tested using disposable, powder-free latex and nitrile gloves in a disposable test cell to which solution was applied {{on one side of the}} glove material and wiped from the other side after 3 hours. Results: This analytical method for assessing flucloxacillin contamination has a limit of detection of 0. 1 microg/mL. Distilled water was the most suitable solvent as degradation of flucloxacillin was minimal. Sodium hypochlorite 0. 5 %, followed by sodium hydroxide 0. 03 M and benzalkonium chloride 0. 1 %, were the most effective <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagents.</b> No permeation of flucloxacillin was detected through the latex or nitrile gloves after a 3 hour period. Conclusion: A method for assessing occupational exposure to flucloxacillin is described in this paper. Sodium hypochlorite 0. 5 % was the most effective decontamination reagent for flucloxacillin. Both the latex and nitrile gloves prevented flucloxacillin permeation for up to 3 hours. Su-Gil Lee, Ganyk J. Jankewicz, Nae-Woo Le...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Engineering: Chemical) [...] Tshwane University of TechnologyDue {{to the impact}} of the rapidly growing demand for energy worldwide, as well as {{concerns}} over global warming, there has been a resurgence of interest in nuclear energy in the developed world. However, further deployment of this otherwise cleaner source of energy in other lesser developed regions is hindered by concerns over accumulation of radioactive waste from nuclear reactor operation and fuel processing. In fuel processing, the problem is the volume of effluent waste generated which mainly consists of toxic organic compounds. The use of <b>decontamination</b> <b>reagents</b> such as CCl 4 together with phenolic tar results in wastewater with a high content of chlorophenols. Chlorophenols are compounds of serious environmental concern due to their toxic and carcinogenic impacts. In this study, the extent of dehalogenation of toxic aromatic compounds was evaluated using a photolytic advanced oxidation process (AOP) followed by biodegradation in the second stage. A hard-to-degrade toxic pollutant, 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP) was used as a model compound representing recalcitrant aromatic pollutants in wastewater streams from the nuclear industry. A two stage photo assisted AOP/bioreactor system demonstrated great potential in the removal of toxic 4 -CP simulated nuclear process water wastewater. Adding hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as a catalyst further improved the dehalogenation rate but the effect was limited by the scavenging of (OH•) radicals under high concentrations of H 2 O 2. High degradation rate was achieved in the UV/H 2 O 2 advanced oxidation system as opposed to direct UV photolysis. A Monod-like model was used to evaluate the biodegradation kinetics over a wide range of initial concentrations. The model revealed that 4 -CP degradation process followed quasi-second order kinetics. This study demonstrates the potential of enhanced biological treatment of nuclear wastewater using a cleaner and energy effective technology...|$|E
40|$|Chemical-Metallurgical Processing. A {{direct-cycle}} pyrometallurgical fuel-processing {{plant is}} being constructed {{in conjunction with}} EBR-II. The gamma- irradiation testing of the 175 -watt white fluorescent mercury vapor lamp was continued to an integrated exposure of 2 x 10 /sup 9 / rad. Irradiation tests of Shell APL grease were completed, and the estimated useful life of this grease in the Air and Argon Cells is 2 and 3 years, respectively. Tests of the three - types of d-c motors used in the operating manipulator of the Argon Cell indicate an expected useful cell operating life of 2 to 3 years. Continued irradiation tests of mineralinsulated cable show no catastrophic breakdown of the electric insulation even after an accumulated gamma dose of 8. 4 x 10 /sup 9 / rad. The scheme currently under consideration for processing melt-refining residues involves a reduction of skull oxides by a solution of Mg in liquid Cd. Molten salt fluxes had variable effects on the rate of oxide reduction in dilute Mg systems. Work was continued on development of processes for EBR-II blanket materials. A large-scale metal-distillation unit to demonstrate metal distillation at rates up to 100 kg/hour is under construction. Two medium carbon steel thermal-convection loops were built and operated to ascertain the extent of corrosion under adverse thermal conditions. Data were obtained for the solubilities of V, Fe, and Ni in liquid Cd at temperatures from 400 to 650 deg C. Corrections were made to data on the solubility of Th in liquid Zn. Solubilities of U in Si-free Zn [...] Mg solutions {{were found to be}} significantly higher than when silicon was present. The peritectic temperature in the U [...] Cd system was found to be 474 plus or minus l deg C. The activity coefficient of U in Al at 4. 8 % U and 686 deg C is estimated to be 1. 25 x 10 /sup - 3 /, based on a distribution coefficient of U between Cd and Al and the activity coefficient of U in pure Cd. The free energy of formation of UPb/sub 6 /, determined by galvanic cell measurements, varied between [...] 14. 8 to [...] 10. 0 kcal/mole at temperatures of 400 to 800 deg C. Oxygen and fluorine bomb calorimetry are being used to obtaan heats of combustion and heats of formation for sulfur and fluorine compounds of such elements as Mo, W, B, and Zr. Fuel Cycle Applications of Volatility and Fluidization Techniques. Several schemes involving the volatility of UF/sub 6 / were proposed for processing irradiated fuels. These include a direct fluorination process, the Aqueous Dissolution Fluorination (ADF) Process and the Fused Fluoride Volatility Process. The Direct Fluorination Process involves direct fluorination of oxide-matrix fuels with fluorine or other fluorination agents to produce volatile UF/sub 6 / and PuF/sub 6 /. Additional studies were made in the Fused Salt Fluoride Volatility Process for the recovery of U from U [...] Zr [...] matrix fuels. Additionsl studies of a one-step fluid-bed process for the conversion of UF/sub 6 / to UO/sub 2 / were made in the newly installed 3 -inch Monel reactor. Reactor Safety. The program to clarify the factors governing the pyrophoric characteristics of the metals U, Zr, Th, and Pu was continued with studies of ignition phenomena and the combustion process.
