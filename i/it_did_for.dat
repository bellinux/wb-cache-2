5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks. Newell {{said that they would}} have liked to bring the service to the console through the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which would have allowed Valve to provide the same feature set that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the PlayStation 3, but later said that {{cross-platform}} play would not be present in {{the final version of the}} game. Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E

25|$|Under his son, Henry VIII of England, the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 were passed, {{integrating}} Wales with England {{in legal}} terms, abolishing the Welsh legal system, and banning the Welsh language from any official role or status, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time}} define the England-Wales border and allowed members representing constituencies in Wales to be elected to the English Parliament.

25|$|This {{region is}} home to the Maracanã stadium (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest {{capacity}} football venue, able to hold nearly 199,000 people, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the World Cup final of 1950. More recently its capacity has been reduced to conform with modern safety regulations and the stadium has introduced seating for all fans. Currently undergoing reconstruction, it has now the capacity for 90,000; it will eventually hold around 80,000 people. Maracanã was the site for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football competition of the 2007 Pan American Games; hosted the final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the football matches of the 2016 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Félix Houphouët-Boigny, {{the son of}} a Baoulé chief, became Ivory Coast's {{father of}} independence. In 1944, he formed the country's first {{agricultural}} trade union for African cocoa farmers like himself. Angered that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, they united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphouët-Boigny soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the French Parliament in Paris. A year later, the French abolished forced labour. Houphouët-Boigny established a strong relationship with the French government, expressing a belief that the Ivory Coast would benefit from the relationship, which <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> many years. France appointed him as a minister, the first African to become a minister in a European government.|$|E

25|$|John Milton (9 December 1608 – 8 November 1674) was an English poet, prose writer, polemicist {{and civil}} servant for the Commonwealth of England.

25|$|During Franco's years, Spanish law {{discriminated}} {{strongly against}} married women. Without her husband's approval, {{referred to as}} the permiso marital, a wife was prohibited from almost all economic activities, including employment, ownership of property, or even travel away from home. The law also provided for less stringent definitions of such crimes as adultery and desertion for husbands than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> wives. Significant reforms of this system were begun shortly before Franco's death, and they have continued at a rapid pace since then. The permiso marital was abolished in 1975; laws against adultery were cancelled in 1978; and divorce was legalized in 1981. During the same year, the parts of the civil code that dealt with family finances were also reformed.|$|E
25|$|NY439 was {{assigned}} in 1949 as an eastward continuation of New Jersey Route28 (later Route439) across the Goethals Bridge and Staten Island. The route {{began at the}} Goethals Bridge and, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the entirety of its existence, followed Forest Avenue, Victory Boulevard, and Bay Street to the Staten Island Ferry terminal in St. George. At the time, it continued across The Narrows to Brooklyn {{by way of the}} Bay Ridge Ferry. Once in Brooklyn, it was routed on Bay Ridge Avenue (69th Street), 4th Avenue, and Shore Road Drive. The designation ended at exit1 of the Belt Parkway. NY439 was also the planned number for the proposed North Shore Expressway across Staten Island's North Shore; however, the highway was never constructed.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of Barton's release, the Northwood-based Pentium 4 had become more than {{competitive}} with AMD's processors. Unfortunately for AMD, a simple increase in size of the L2 cache to 512kB did not have nearly the same impact as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Intel's Pentium 4 line, as the Athlon architecture {{was not nearly as}} cache-constrained as the Pentium 4. The Athlon's exclusive-cache architecture and shorter pipeline made it less sensitive to L2 cache size, and the Barton only saw an increase of several percent gained in per-clock performance over the Thoroughbred-B it was derived from. While the increased performance was welcome, it was not sufficient to overtake the Pentium 4 line in overall performance. The PR also became somewhat inaccurate because some Barton models with lower clock rates were being given higher PR than higher-clocked Thoroughbred processors. Instances where a computational task did not benefit more from the additional cache {{to make up for the}} loss in raw clock speed created situations where a lower rated (but faster clocked) Thoroughbred would outperform a higher-rated (but lower clocked) Barton.|$|E
500|$|The {{end of the}} gas boom was {{especially}} difficult for the smaller communities in the county, since {{the loss of a}} single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> a town with many businesses.

In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE award, which he too received: [...] "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from {{it so much that}} I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency."

As a result of the Polish–Lithuanian diplomacy, the council, though scandalised by Włodkowic's questioning of the legitimacy of the monastic state, denied the Order's request for a further crusade and instead entrusted the conversion of the Samogitians to Poland–Lithuania.|$|E
