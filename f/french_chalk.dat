40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} geological/technical challenges affecting engineering projects in chalk with flints either for hydrocarbon/water exploration or infrastructural development is encountering flints, which mostly result in excessive wear or damage to cutting tools or drilling/tunnelling equipment. Overcoming this requires a regional understanding of the engineering properties of flints which are linked to various factors including the genesis/diagenesis of flints. To date, the genesis of flints remains debatable and the controls on engineering properties of flints on a regional basis have not been systematically investigated. This study sets to investigate: the genesis of flints, the engineering properties of flints across various geographical locations, the variations in these properties with colour, structures, origin, and morphology of flints, and the tectonic history of the host chalk. To achieve these objectives a series of physicomechanical and petrophysical tests on flints and associated structures sampled from the Danish, English and <b>French</b> <b>chalks</b> have been carried out. A drillability test focusing on the grey and dark brownish grey flints using a standard tricone bit to reflect the rock mass characteristics of flint has been conducted. Petrographic studies comprising scanning electron microscopy, scanning electron microcopy-cathodoluminescence and X-ray diffraction have then been applied to analyse the genesis, diagenesis, microstructures, microtexture, and mineral phase/composition of flints. Results support the biogenic origin of flints through a calcite-silica replacement process and illustrate that engineering properties of flints correlate with colour, origin, and the diagenesis of flints, plus the properties and tectonic history of the host chalk. This study demonstrates that physicomechanical properties of flints are controlled by their micro-structures/texture/fractures, structures, calcite inclusions and mineral compositions. The dark brownish grey flints with finer microtexture are the strongest, stiffest, densest, hardest, most abrasive and least porous materials with extremely high potentials to cause drill wear. By comparison, the grey flints located in a highly tectonized zone behave differently and are the weakest, less dense, less abrasive and the most porous flints with relatively lower potentials to cause drill wear. These findings offer new contributions {{to the understanding of the}} material properties of flints applicable to drillability prediction, tool wear evaluation and drilling/tunnelling system specifications in chalk with flints...|$|R

6000|$|Clive {{used to give}} droll {{accounts}} of the young disciples at Gandish's, who were of various ages and conditions, and in whose company the young fellow took his place with that good temper and gaiety which have seldom deserted him in life, and have put him at ease wherever his fate has led him. He is, in truth, as much {{at home in a}} fine drawing-room as in a public-house parlour; and can talk as pleasantly to the polite mistress of the mansion, as to the jolly landlady dispensing her drinks from her bar. Not one of the Gandishites but was after a while well inclined to the young fellow; from Mr. Chivers, the senior pupil, down to the little imp Harry Hooker, who knew as much mischief at twelve years old, and could draw as cleverly as many a student of five-and-twenty; and Bob Trotter, the diminutive fag of the studio, who ran on all the young men's errands, and fetched them in apples, oranges, and walnuts. Clive opened his eyes with wonder when he first beheld these simple feasts, and the pleasure with which some of the young men partook of them. They were addicted to polonies; they did not disguise their love for Banbury cakes; they made bets in ginger-beer, and gave and took the odds in that frothing liquor. There was a young Hebrew amongst the pupils, upon whom his brother-students used playfully to press ham sandwiches, pork sausages, and the like. This young man (who has risen to great wealth subsequently, and was bankrupt only three months since) actually bought cocoa-nuts, and sold them at a profit amongst the lads. His pockets were never without pencil-cases, <b>French</b> <b>chalk,</b> garnet brooches, for which he was willing to bargain. He behaved very rudely to Gandish, who seemed to be afraid before him. It was whispered that the Professor was not altogether easy in his circumstances, and that the elder Moss had some mysterious hold over him. Honeyman and Bayham, who once came to see Clive at the studio, seemed each disturbed at beholding young Moss seated there (making a copy of the Marsyas). [...] "Pa knows both those gents," [...] he informed Clive afterwards, with a wicked twinkle of his Oriental eyes. [...] "Step in, Mr. Newcome, any day you are passing down Wardour Street, and see if you don't want anything in our way." [...] (He pronounced the words in his own way, saying: [...] "Step id, Bister Doocob, ady day idto Vordor Street," [...] etc.) This young gentleman could get tickets for almost all the theatres, which he gave or sold, and gave splendid accounts at Cavendish's of the brilliant masquerades. Clive was greatly diverted at beholding Mr. Moss at one of these entertainments, dressed in a scarlet coat and top-boots, and calling out, [...] "Yoicks! Hark forward!" [...] fitfully to another Orientalist, his younger brother, attired like a midshipman. Once Clive bought a half-dozen of theatre tickets from Mr. Moss, which he distributed to the young fellows of the studio. But, when this nice young man tried further to tempt him on the next day, [...] "Mr. Moss," [...] Clive said to him with much dignity, [...] "I am very much obliged to you for your offer, but when I go to the play, I prefer paying at the doors." ...|$|E

In this paper, a classification of flints (sampled from the English, <b>French</b> and Danish <b>Chalk)</b> which correlates with the abrasivity and hardness of flints is proposed. The results showed lighter/grey flints (with more calcite) have lower potential to cause drill bit wear as indicated by hardness and geotechnical wear indices than dark flints.

60|$|SECTION LXI. Ever {{since the}} period of the Renaissance, however, the truth has not been accredited; the painter of {{religious}} subject is no longer regarded as the narrator of a fact, but as the inventor of an idea. [Footnote: I do not mean that modern Christians believe less in the facts than ancient Christians, but they do not believe in the representation of the facts as true. We look upon the picture as this or that painter's conception; the elder Christians looked upon it as this or that, painter's description of what had actually taken place. And in the Greek Church all painting is, to this day, strictly a branch of tradition. See M. Dideron's admirably written introduction to his Iconographie Chrétienne, p. 7:--"Un de mes compagnons s'étonnait de re trouver à la Panagia de St. Luc, le saint Jean Chrysostome qu'il avait dessiné dans le baptistère de St. Marc, à Venise. Le costume des personnages est partout et en tout temps le même, non-seulement pour la forme, mais pour la couleur, mais pour le dessin, mais jusque pour le nombre et l'épaisseur des plis."] We do not severely criticise the manner in which a true history is told, but we become harsh investigators of the faults of an invention; so that in the modern religious mind, the capacity of emotion, which renders judgment uncertain, is joined with an incredulity which renders it severe; and this ignorant emotion, joined with ignorant observance of faults, is the worst possible temper in which any art can be regarded, but more especially sacred art.

50|$|This {{method of}} typographic {{engraving}} {{was brought to}} a practical form and patented in 1860 by an American wood engraver, Mr. de Witt Clinton Hitchcock. The first step in his process is to reduce <b>French</b> <b>chalk</b> or talc to an extremely fine state of division by repeated grindings, elutriations, and siftings. After this is complete, a layer of the material (over an eighth of an inch in thickness) is forced down upon and made to adhere to a thick zinc plate, the necessary pressure being obtained {{by means of an}} hydraulic press, the platen of which is faced with a polished steel plate, so as to communicate a good surface to the layer of compressed <b>French</b> <b>chalk.</b> The device is now drawn reversed on the prepared block with an ink consisting of a weak solution of glue colored by lamp black or some other pigment. In drawing on the prepared block, care must be taken not to damage the somewhat tender surface of the compressed chalk and the safest instrument with which to apply the glutinous ink is a fine sable brush, but an ordinary pen may be employed if the operation of drawing is performed with caution. A pad of silk velvet or a fitch brush may be used for rubbing the block so as to leave the lines in relief, and it is quite sufficient to continue the friction until a depth equal to the thickness of an ordinary playing card is produced, the spaces corresponding to any extended whites of the engraving being then cut out by means of a tool. A 10% solution of sodium silicate may be used for hardening the block and, when dry, nothing remains but to take a mould from it and to reproduce it in metal.|$|E

At launch, a slow-burning fuse was lit; its length was calibrated to the estimated time to arrive over German-controlled territory. At first, the balloon rose rapidly and expanded in size until an internal cord tightened, preventing further increase in altitude beyond 25000 ft by releasing some gas; the balloon would then begin a slow descent due to the hydrogen gradually leaking away. After a while, the slow burning fuse would release a bung in a can of mineral oil; as the oil slowly dripped out, the balloon's payload would lighten, arresting its descent. The same slow-burning fuse was also used to release the balloon's weapon.|$|E
5000|$|In the humorously opinionated (and {{exceedingly}} rare) book The Shove Ha'penny Board Displayed (Christophers, London 1934), author Trelawney Dayrell-Reed {{asserts that}} the best boards are made of unvarnished walnut or mahogany. In parts of Southern England, primarily Somerset, Dorset and Hampshire, the board is made of slate and lubricated with arrowroot powder or <b>French</b> <b>chalk,</b> which makes the polished ha'pennies glide with a very light touch. The five-coin turns are alternate, and the coins are cleared between turns {{so there is no}} nudging of opponents' coins. Indeed, both players use the same coins, and it is a serious mistake to move the coins back {{to the bottom of the}} board before one's opponent has had a chance to check the scoring, as they may be distracted by drinking and so suspect one of cheating. Sometimes teams compete, playing in sequence, but scoring is as for single players. Experienced players (including Dayrell-Reed) conclude that merely placing the coins between the lines is too easy so that to score they must be placed almost exactly in the center of the bed. An exact placement by a single shove, rather than by nudging into position by subsequent shots, is called a 'flopper' and will command applause, especially if it is a winning shot. In competition games a scoring placement is judged by a referee. In times past considerable sums could be wagered on games of shove ha'penny, and influencing the referee - whether actual or suspected - could result in sudden and violent confrontations. Because of this some public houses have a strong antipathy to games of shove ha'penny and will only allow trusted locals to play, sometimes keeping the board in a back room and denying its existence to strangers. This is particularly common in the case of the 'Dorset long board', making it difficult even for a shove ha'penny enthusiast to ascertain how many pubs still have this archaic board.|$|E

Tool manufacture is one aspect in which improvement is desirable. The use of thermo- and setting-plastics for drop-hammer and double-curvature panel drill jigs is examined aver a wide technical and economic field, in order to establish a sound foundation for investigating the suitability of plastics for tooling. Tools were designed to isolate the variable parameters and a study of their behaviour has commenced, dth the assistance of high-speed filming, to ascertain the limitations of the various materials. Casting resins are preferable for both punches and dies although the laminated form, in addition to being the better type for pcnel drill jigs, appears to be the most satisfactory die material available at present. It was concluded that plastics facilitate easier and cheaper tool production titan is practicable with zinc and, for the tools produced, reduce the necessary time cycle of production by about 80 per cent with a corresponding reduction in the man. - hours required. In the tests made to develop suitable plastic tools, attention was concentrated on the development of a suitable slightly flexible punch, and a rigid diet following the most promising indications of this work.

During the relatively warm year of 1975, the migration activity of E. berilloni was stronger than in 1974. Upstream migration was concentrated in early summer, while drift fluctuated during the year. Most animals migrated during the night, although the diel variation in drift was quite different from that in upstream migration. Water temperature and its diel fluctuations have a large effect on non-accidental migration. Changes in chemical composition of the water seem to be important as well. Light conditions have only a slight influence on migration patterns. Physical disturbance of the riverbed (for instance by wading cows or the scouring effect of spates) influences migration rather negatively. The mean size of migrating animals was larger than the average size of the standing crop. Upstream migrants were larger during hours of high upstream migration activity, while the animals that drifted in peak hours were usually smaller than those drifting in hours of low activity. Both up- and downstream migration proved to be a constant behaviour; most drifters of a particular night drifted again the following night and most upstream migrants moved again upstream after they had been marked. In particular our results on microgeographic and seasonal variation show clearly that a quantitative approach to migration would have been premature. Secondly, they make a direct correlation between production and drift unrewarding. The continuous measurement of migration showed that for this type of investigation field work is preferable to laboratory experimentation, since it gives more reliable results than those achieved under laboratory conditions...|$|E
