50|$|AM {{transmissions}} {{cannot be}} ionospherically propagated {{during the day}} due to strong absorption in the D-layer of the ionosphere. In a crowded channel environment, {{this means that the}} power of regional channels which share a frequency must be reduced at night or directionally beamed in order to avoid interference, which reduces the potential nighttime audience. Some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in North America; these are called clear-channel stations. Many of them can be heard across much of the country at night. During the night, absorption largely disappears and permits signals to travel to much more distant locations via <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflections.</b> However, fading of the signal can be severe at night.|$|R
50|$|During {{times of}} strong <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflection,</b> {{especially}} at night, {{it was possible}} that the receiver would see reflections from the ground after one reflection.

5000|$|Teak caused {{communications}} impairment over {{a widespread}} {{area in the}} Pacific basin. This {{was due to the}} injection of a large quantity of fission debris into the ionosphere. The debris prevented normal <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflection</b> of high-frequency (HF) radio waves back towards Earth, which disrupted most long-distance HF radio communications. The nuclear detonation occurred at 10:50 UTC on 1 August 1958 (which was 11:50 p.m., Johnston Island local time, on 31 July 1958).|$|E
30|$|The MREs are {{produced}} by multiple <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflections,</b> which are indicative of an enhancement in reflection coefficient. Enhancement is possible, when reflection occurs from concave isodensity contours, such as those associated with an upwelling (Tsunoda 2009; Thampi et al. 2012). Enhancement should be strongest, when the radius of curvature of the reflecting surface is approximately equal to the height of reflection. We can {{see that this is}} the case for the upwelling shown in Figure  1, where we have scribed a circular arc for comparison. Hence, it should be apparent that the zonal wavelength of an LSWS would be about 300  km, when MREs are observed. And, indeed, the median patch size, from TEP experiments, is 380  km (Röttger 1973). Estimates of patch size or spacing, by other means, are also about 400  km (Aarons et al. 1978; Tsunoda and White 1981).|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the weak turbulence of whistler {{waves in the}} in low-β inner magnetosphere of the Earth. Whistler waves with frequencies, originating in the ionosphere, propagate radially outward and can trigger nonlinear induced scattering by thermal electrons provided the wave energy density is large enough. Nonlinear scattering can substantially change {{the direction of the}} wave vector of whistler waves and hence the direction of energy flux with only a small change in the frequency. A portion of whistler waves return to the ionosphere with a smaller perpendicular wave vector resulting in diminished linear damping and enhanced ability to pitch-angle scatter trapped electrons. In addition, a portion of the scattered wave packets can be reflected near the ionosphere back into the magnetosphere. Through multiple nonlinear scatterings and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflections</b> a long-lived wave cavity containing turbulent whistler waves can be formed with the appropriate properties to efficiently pitch-angle scatter trapped electrons. The primary consequence on the Earth's radiation belts is to reduce the lifetime of the trapped electron population. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, 4 table...|$|R

5000|$|Shortwave radio {{frequency}} energy {{is capable of}} reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflection</b> back to the earth by the ionosphere, (a phenomenon known as [...] "skywave propagation"). A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a skip zone (see first figure on that page) where reception fails. With a fixed working frequency, large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night.|$|E
5000|$|Frequency of optimum {{transmission}} (FOT), in {{the transmission}} of radio waves via <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflection,</b> is the highest effective (i.e. working) frequency that is predicted to be usable for a specified path and time for 90% of {{the days of the}} month. The FOT is normally just below the value of the maximum usable frequency (MUF). In the prediction of usable frequencies, the FOT is commonly taken as 15% below the monthly median value of the MUF for the specified time and path.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the causes}} of intersymbol {{interference}} is multipath propagation in which a wireless signal from a transmitter reaches the receiver via multiple paths. The causes of this include reflection (for instance, the signal may bounce off buildings), refraction (such as through the foliage of a tree) and atmospheric effects such as atmospheric ducting and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflection.</b> Since the various paths can be of different lengths, this results in the different versions of the signal arriving at the receiver at different times. These delays mean that part or all of a given symbol will be spread into the subsequent symbols, thereby interfering with the correct detection of those symbols. Additionally, the various paths often distort the amplitude and/or phase of the signal, thereby causing further interference with the received signal.|$|E
40|$|The IONORT-ISP system (IONOspheric Ray-Tracing – IRI-SIRMUP-PROFILES) was {{recently}} developed and tested {{by comparing the}} measured oblique ionograms over the radio link between Rome (41. 89 ºN, 12. 48 ºE), Italy, and Chania (35. 51 ºN, 24. 02 ºE), Greece, with the IONORT-ISP simulated oblique ionograms (Settimi et al., 2013). The present paper describes an upgrade of the system to include: a) electron-neutral collision have been included by using a collision frequency model that consists of a double exponential profile; b) the ISP three dimensional (3 -D) model of electron density profile grid has been extended down to the altitude of the D-layer; c) the resolution in latitude and longitude of the ISP 3 -D model of electron density profile grid has been increased from 2 °x 2 ° to 1 °x 1 °. Based on these updates, a new software tool called IONORT-ISP-WC (WC means with collisions) was developed, and a database of 33 IONORT-ISP-WC synthesized oblique ionograms calculated for single (1 -hop paths) and multiple (3 -hop paths) <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflections.</b> The IONORT-ISP-WC simulated oblique ionograms were compared with the IONORT-IRI-WC synthesized oblique ionograms, generated by applying IONORT {{in conjunction with the}} International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 3 -D electron density grid, and the observed oblique ionograms over the aforementioned radio link. The results obtained show that (1) during daytime, for the lower ionospheric layers, the traces of the synthesized ionograms are cut away at low frequencies because of HF absorption; (2) during night-time, for the higher ionospheric layers, the traces of the simulated ionograms at low frequencies are not cut off (very little HF absorption); (3) the IONORT-ISP-WC MUF values are more accurate than the IONORT-IRI-WC MUF values...|$|R

The sequential appearance of first the groundwave signal, and then the <b>ionospheric</b> single-hop <b>reflection</b> signal, permits us to construct the energy-reflection ratio. We infer the energy reflection's statistical variation with solar zenith angle, angle-of-incidence, frequency, and propagation azimuth. There is also a marginally-significant response of the energy reflectivity to solar X-ray flux density. Finally, we review the relationship of our results to previous published reports...|$|R
40|$|The {{nighttime}} <b>ionospheric</b> absolute <b>reflection</b> {{height of}} low-frequency (LF) radio waves at oblique incidence has been measured continuously since late 1982 using 1. 8 kHz sideband phase {{comparisons between the}} sky wave and the ground wave of a commercial 177 kHz LF transmitter. The dataset allows the analysis of long-term trends and other regular variations of the reflection height. Beside the clear signal of the 11 -year solar cycle a quasi-biennial oscillation is visible in LF reflection heights, which is correlated to the equatorial stratospheric wind field.

50|$|The above {{discussion}} merely {{illustrates a}} simple picture of mode and ray theory. More detailed treatments require a large computer program. In particular, {{it is difficult}} {{to solve the problem of}} the horizontal and vertical inhomogeneities of the waveguide. The effect of the Earth's curvature is, that near the antipode the field strength slightly increases. Due to the influence of the Earth' magnetic field, the medium becomes anisotropic so that the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflection</b> factor in reality is a matrix. This means that a vertically polarized incident wave after reflection at the ionospheric D-layer converses to a vertically and a horizontally polarized wave. Moreover, the geomagnetic field gives rise to a nonreciprocity of VLF waves. Waves propagating from east to west are more strongly attenuated than vice versa. There appears a phase slipping near the distance of the deep interference minimum of eq. (3). During the times of sunrise and/or sunset, there is sometimes a phase gain or loss of 360° because of the irreversible behavior of the first sky wave.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} allow a good night-time {{transmission}} without causing too many problems with electromagnetic influence, a cross-dipole antenna with a radiation maximum pointing vertically into the sky was built in early 2006. This antenna, {{which is one of}} the few applications of circular polarisation for broadcasting, is mounted on 5 guyed masts. The central mast of this antenna is grounded. It carries the feeder cables running to the dipole, while the masts at the edge are standing on insulators and grounded via inductances in such way that they radiate as low a frequency as possible. In this way, undesired parasitic radiations, which are the cause of electromagnetic influence, are suppressed. It is also interesting to know that the radiated wave must be right-hand polarized, otherwise the signal reflected on the ionosphere would be 20 dB less strong. In spring 2006 this new antenna went into service. It is used only for night-time transmissions, as the desired <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflection</b> occurs only at night. During the day the old mast is used.|$|E
5000|$|Microwaves {{propagate}} {{entirely by}} line of sight; groundwave and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflection</b> (skywave or [...] "skip" [...] propagation) do not occur. [...] Although {{in some cases}} they can penetrate building walls enough for useful reception, unobstructed rights of way cleared to the first Fresnel zone are usually required. Wavelengths are small enough at microwave frequencies that the antenna can be much larger than a wavelength, allowing highly directional (high gain) antennas to be built which can produce narrow beams. Therefore, they are used in point-to-point terrestrial communications links, limited by the visual horizon to 30-40 miles (48-64 km). Such high gain antennas allow frequency reuse by nearby transmitters. The wavelength of SHF waves allows strong reflections from metal objects the size of automobiles, aircraft, and ships, and other vehicles. Thus, the narrow beamwidths possible with high gain antennas and the low atmospheric attenuation as compared with higher frequencies make SHF the main frequencies used in radar. Attenuation and scattering by moisture in the atmosphere increase with frequency, limiting the use of high SHF frequencies for long range applications.|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 The HF (high frequency) radar at Kodiak Island, Alaska, {{is part of}} the SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) {{network of}} radars {{designed}} to detect echoes from ionospheric field-aligned density irregularities. Normal azimuth scans of the radar begin on whole minute boundaries leading to 12 s downtime between each scan.

40|$|The {{change of}} <b>ionospheric</b> {{absolute}} <b>reflection</b> heights h of low-frequency (LF) radio waves at oblique incidence {{in the course}} of the day is measured at Collm Observatory (51. 3 ° N, 13. 0 ° E) using 1. 8 kHz sideband phase comparisons between the sky-wave and the ground wave of a commercial 177 kHz transmitter (Zehlendorf, reflection point at 52. 1 ° N, 13. 2 ° E). Plasma scale height estimates H are calculated from the decrease/increase of h in the morning/evening. The day-to-day variations of H are compared with those of daily mean temperatures at 90 km, measured with a VHF meteor radar (36. 2 MHz) at Collm and using the amplitude decay of meteor reflections. A good qualitative correspondence is found between the two data sets. Since mesospheric long-period temperature variations are generally accepted to be the signature of atmospheric planetary waves, this shows that LF reflection height measurements can be used for monitoring the dynamics of the upper middle atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the main {{processes}} in positive ground flashes and the distant lightning environment for {{both positive and negative}} ground flashes. It presents the characteristics of the preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs), the characteristics of the electric field pulses observed during leader propagation, and the characteristics of the electric fields produced by the first and the subsequent return strokes. It also features the observations of distant positive and negative ground flashes at distances up to 1000 km. The results were based on electric field measurements conducted remotely during summer thunderstorms in Sweden in 2014. We found {{that the majority of the}} positive ground flashes were preceded by PBPs. Some were preceded by more than one PBP train, and the parameter values for the subsequent PBP trains were found to be smaller than the values for the first PBP train. Three types of PBPs were also identified. The results suggest that the PBPs in positive ground flashes during summer thunderstorms in Sweden are weak, and the inverted dipole charge cloud configuration is consistent with our observation. A small percentage of these positive ground flashes were observed to be preceded by pronounced leader pulses. The presence of these pulses suggests that the leaders propagate in a stepped manner. We inferred that these pulses were due to the upward-connecting negative leader since their characteristics were similar to those of a negative stepped leader. On the basis of the leader pulses’ time of initiation and the average speed of the leader, we estimated the distance travelled by the leader. One case of positive return stroke preceded by negative leader pulses was also observed, and the occurrence of these pulses was the first in positive ground flashes to be reported. The majority of these positive ground flashes were found to be single-stroke. Comparison between the first and the subsequent return strokes showed that the average durations of the subsequent stroke parameters were smaller than that of the first strokes. The distances reported by the lightning location system suggest that the subsequent strokes probably created new terminations to ground. Two possible reasons were given to explain the reason for the shorter duration of the subsequent return strokes parameters compared to the first strokes. Finally, observations of distant positive and negative ground flashes showed that the electric field waveforms have a typical shape, like a distorted ‘W’ (or distorted ‘M’ for negative ground flashes) followed by small oscillations. These small oscillations were more pronounced in negative ground flashes, especially at a greater distance. The heights of the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>reflections</b> estimated for both ground flashes were found to likely correspond to a D-layer of the ionosphere. Two possible reasons were suggested for the small oscillations observed in the waveforms...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{investigates the}} base heights of the ionosphere (h′F) when spread-F is recorded at Brisbane, Australia, for 2 separate periods, namely July and August 1966 when spread-F occurs frequently and September and October 1966 when {{the activity is}} much lower. It is found that for July and August there is little tendency for spread-F to occur preferentially when the base height is above the average for the period. However, for the September-October period, spread-F occurs more often (by a factor of 2 or 3 depending on the geomagnetic activity) when the base height is above rather than below the average height. Also, this analysis shows that the overall spread-F occurrence (for both periods investigated) decreased to some extent following increased geomagnetic activity. This suppressed activity in the hours following geomagnetic activity is confirmed by superposed-epoch analyses using K indices (for Macquarie Island) as controls. It is suggested {{that the results of}} all the analyses might be explained by invoking a transition height in the ionosphere (controlled by the neutral-particle density of the upper atmosphere). <b>Ionospheric</b> off-vertical <b>reflections</b> from above this height would be recorded as spread-F traces in this model.
