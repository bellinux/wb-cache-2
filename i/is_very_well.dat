5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey {{for a week or}} more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E

25|$|Based {{on their}} reactivity, another {{distinct}} {{advantage of these}} two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity. The reaction <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> established, and enantioselective variants (catalytic and stoichiometric) have also been achieved. From a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint, this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes (scheme 22). Danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol. Diastereoselectivity is established by 1,3 interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure.|$|E

25|$|Arctia caja <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> {{adapted to}} cold {{temperate}} climates, and {{is closely related}} to many other tiger moths both molecularly and genetically. Although it has variable patterning, it is still quite genetically and molecularly similar to other species that have been separated from A. caja due to appearance, such as A. intercalaris, A. martinhoneyi, A. thibetica, A. brachyptera, and A. opulenta. Evidence for combining some of these species does not seem strong enough to create conclusions in that regard.|$|E
