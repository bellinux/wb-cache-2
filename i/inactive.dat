5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the <b>inactive</b> character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an <b>inactive</b> character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E

5|$|In {{the outer}} Solar System, comets remain frozen and <b>inactive</b> and are {{extremely}} {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of <b>inactive</b> comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan and {{a second}} round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft were traded to the Green Bay Packers for Mike McKenzie on October 4, 2004. After the trade, O'Sullivan was <b>inactive</b> for 11 games as the third quarterback. He then played the first regular season game of his career on January 2, 2005 in the season finale, {{when he took a}} knee twice to end the game. He was also <b>inactive</b> for the team's Wild Card Round playoff game. He re-signed with the Packers on April 22, 2005. He was {{released}} by the team on September 3, 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{proboscis}} is an infolding of {{the body}} wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when <b>inactive.</b> When muscles in {{the wall of the}} rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out to attack the animal's prey along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which attaches {{to the back of the}} rhynchocoel, and which can stretch up to 30 times its <b>inactive</b> length and then retract the proboscis.|$|E
5|$|A new owner, Michael Duane Roberts, {{bought the}} Vortex Mine in 2008. Its {{operations}} {{were designed to}} be environmentally friendly, using methods such as recycling all water and not using other chemicals. Roberts died in a mining accident in 2012. , there was also mining activity by individual hobby miners on small parcels at Sapphire Village, but the Roncor mines remained <b>inactive.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the 2001 UK census, the {{industry}} of employment of Salford's residents aged 16–74 was 18.0% retail and wholesale, 14.4% property and business services, 12.3% manufacturing, 11.7% {{health and social}} work, 8.6% education, 7.3% transport and communications, 6.8% hotels and restaurants, 5.8% construction, 4.4% finance, 4.2% public administration, 0.6% energy and water supply, 0.3% agriculture, 0.1% mining, and 5.7% other. Compared with national figures, Salford had a relatively low percentage of residents working in agriculture. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 4.4% students were with jobs, 9.1% students without jobs, 6.3% looking after home or family, 11.2% permanently sick or disabled, and 4.8% economically <b>inactive</b> for other reasons. The proportion of students economically active in Salford was higher than the City of Salford and England averages (3.0% and 2.6% respectively); {{the same is true}} for economically <b>inactive</b> students (5.1% in City of Salford and 4.7% in England). The rest of the figures were roughly inline with national trends.|$|E
5|$|After Betsy, {{two other}} hurricanes {{came close to}} being seeded. Hurricane Faith was {{considered}} a likely candidate, but it stayed {{out of range of}} the seeding planes. That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, but there were no seedings. Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were <b>inactive.</b> Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.|$|E
5|$|After O'Sullivan {{was cut by}} the Bengals, the San Diego Chargers claimed him off waivers on September 6, 2010. He was <b>inactive</b> as the Chargers third {{quarterback for}} six games.

5|$|Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, {{mostly by}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, {{as well as}} an <b>inactive</b> benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution to the effects of alprazolam.|$|E
5|$|Although the North Indian Ocean is a {{relatively}} <b>inactive</b> basin, extremely high population densities in the Ganges and Ayeyarwady Deltas mean that the deadliest tropical cyclones {{in the world have}} formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|An uncompetitive {{inhibitor}} cannot bind to {{the free}} enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most effective at high substrate concentration. In {{the presence of the}} inhibitor, the enzyme-substrate complex is <b>inactive.</b> This type of inhibition is rare.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter {{in a state of}} {{dormancy}} known as hibernation. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the <b>inactive</b> state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 UK census, Salford had 173,117 {{residents}} aged 16 to 74. 4.7% {{of these}} people were students with jobs, 4.1% looking after home or family, 6.9% permanently sick or disabled and 2.9% economically <b>inactive</b> for other reasons. The City of Salford has {{a high rate of}} people who are permanently sick and disabled, 70% higher than the national average of 4.0%.|$|E
5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically <b>inactive</b> Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic inactivity occurs because the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{problems}} with her powerplant kept her initial service relatively brief and <b>inactive.</b> Assigned to duty with North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Dictator cruised on the Atlantic coast from 15 December 1864 until placed {{out of commission}} on 5 September 1865 at the League Island Navy Yard. She remained in ordinary there until 1869.|$|E
5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in <b>inactive</b> forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell {{membranes}} allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated {{in much the same way}} as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as <b>inactive</b> glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|Despite the announcement, {{the ambitious}} project became <b>inactive</b> and was finally {{scrapped}} after no worthy design was accepted and {{not nearly enough}} of the S$250,000 funds had been raised. In 1985, the alumni announced that the funds collected earlier would be rediverted to other projects, such as providing scholarships.|$|E
5|$|Due to Cold War disagreements, the Military Staff Committee never {{succeeded in}} its {{intended}} purpose. Although it formally still meets every two weeks, {{it has been}} effectively <b>inactive</b> since 1948. Thus, article 47, and the references to it in articles 26, 45 and 46 can be deleted.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Luongo was <b>inactive,</b> {{with the}} {{exception}} of two international tournaments, the 2004 World Cup and the 2005 World Championships. With the NHL set to resume in 2005–06, Luongo was without a contract. After negotiations failed, the Panthers filed for arbitration on August 11, 2005. The process awarded Luongo a one-year, $3.2million contract on August 25.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} crossback stingaree {{is usually}} <b>inactive</b> {{and can be found}} {{partially}} or completely buried in sand on the sea floor. It is a carnivore and adults forage for crustaceans, polychaete worms and other small invertebrates on the seafloor. Juveniles feed on smaller crustaceans such as isopods, amphipods and shrimps.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in <b>inactive</b> form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of <b>inactive</b> precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
