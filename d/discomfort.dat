40|$|Introduction: Eye <b>discomforts</b> and {{headache}} are {{prevalent among}} computer users. The aim of {{present study was}} to determine eye <b>discomforts</b> and headache associated with computer use among dormitory students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences.. Material and Method: In this cross – sectional study, data were collected using MIRTH (Musculo skeletal Injury Reduction Tools for Health and Safety) questionnaire. The results were Analyzed using SPSS Software and with descriptive statistical indexes as well as correlation test.. Result: of the 744 distributed questionnaires, 631 students completed the questionnaire (84. 4 %). The mean age for the studied population was 22. 72 ± 3. 6 years. The relative frequency of eye <b>discomforts</b> for the female and male student was 76. 38 % and 70. 11 % respectively. The correlation test showed significant relationship between eye <b>discomforts</b> as well as headache with gender, work hours’ with a computer per day and glass use (P-V < 0. 05). Also, the correlation between eye <b>discomforts</b> and headache was statistically significant (P-V < 0. 01).. Conclusion: Eye <b>discomforts</b> and headache relating to the computer uses are prevalent among students. The condition is more prevalent among females and prolonged computer users. Interventional and training programs should be considered to prevent and reduction of related problems...|$|R

40|$|A survey {{study to}} {{investigate}} the relation between video display terminal (VDT) task and input device location and the perceived upper extremity <b>discomforts</b> of Thai VDT users was conducted. Six categories of VDT task and three input device locations (as indicated by the layout sfyle) were considered in the study. Questionnaires were sent to 153 Thai VDT users to collect information on their VDT tasks, VDT workstation, keyboard-mouse (K-M) layout style, and perceived physical <b>discomforts.</b> The {{results showed that the}} upper extremity <b>discomforts</b> were apparently high in certain combinations of dominant VDT task and K-M layout style. Additionally, it is observed that users who perform different dominant VDT tasks could be grouped according to the input device most fiequently used (i. e., keyboard or mouse). After regrouping VDT users according to the dominant input device, high physical <b>discomforts</b> are found among "mouse " users and the K-M layout style in which the mouse is placed on a different surface level from the keyboard. In conclusion, VDT users who perform dominant VDT tasks that require an extensive use of the mouse tend to experience high upper extremity <b>discomforts</b> especially when they place the mouse far from the body...|$|R

5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle.

Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{was performed to}} find out the way in which students at the University of Split spend their leisure time and what was the portion of sporting activities in it in relation to self-appraisal of their health status. A sample of 449 subjects (mean age 21 years; 380 female and 69 male students) was surveyed by questionnaire. The results of the t-test showed statistically significant gender differences in criterion variables. The students with longer sport experience felt far less health-related <b>discomforts</b> than the others. The female students with more leisure time self-evaluated their health as better. The sport experience of men was longer than the experience of the women, and they preferred sport games and resistance training in gyms. The self-perceived health evaluation of men was generally higher than the self-perception of health in women, except for anger, which was lower in female students. The female students listed numerous health-related <b>discomforts</b> and medical conditions, among which particularly conspicuous was the general feeling of being tired connected with a sequence of psychosomatic <b>discomforts</b> (tension, feeling restless, back pain and leg pain). The <b>discomforts</b> and medical conditions reported by the young female students are comparable to those already reported by the general population of older people. They were caused primarily by hypokinesis and stress, or vice versa, the majority of <b>discomforts</b> and medical conditions were induced by insufficient physical activity, that is, by a sedentary lifestyle, which draws attention to the necessity for intervention in the leisure time of the young, especially college or university students...|$|R
