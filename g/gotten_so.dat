5|$|Pepper Rodgers {{was hired}} soon after Fulcher quit. Rodgers was hired {{away from the}} UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher, simply could not return Tech to its {{national}} prominence of Dodd's era, and after six seasons, Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and barely a 50% winning percentage. Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school, and Athletic Director Doug Weaver, replaced him with Bill Curry. Homer Rice became Athletic Director, and attempted to reinvigorate Tech's program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. The Georgia Tech football program reached its lowest point in modern history after the hiring of Bill Curry, who had no experience as a head coach, but was a refreshing change after the flamboyant Rodgers. Curry's first two Tech teams from 1980–1981 went 2-19-1 with the only bright spots being a brilliant 24-21 victory over Bear Bryant's Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3-3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field. Things had <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> bad, they could only get better. He slowly rebuilt the team, restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base, and in 1985 Tech won 9 games, including a 17-14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl.|$|E

However, the die is still rapidly deteriorating, and polishing it cannot avoid the problem of wear.

25|$|In recent years, {{medical records}} have changed considerably. Although many {{physicians}} and hospitals still maintain paper records, {{there is a}} drive for electronic records. Filing cabinets are giving way to desktop computers connected to powerful servers, where patient records are processed and archived digitally. This digital format allows for immediate remote access by any physician who is authorized to review the patient information. Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources {{but also as a}} working platform. Technology has <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> sophisticated that MT services and MT departments work closely with programmers and information systems (IS) staff to stream in voice and accomplish seamless data transfers through network interfaces. In fact, many healthcare providers today are enjoying the benefits of handheld PCs or personal data assistants (PDAs) and are now utilizing software on them.|$|E
500|$|... "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] {{was written}} {{alongside}} [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] and [...] "Cabin Fever" [...] in February and March 2008. [...] Its title {{is derived from}} the 1933 science fiction novel of the same name by H.G. Wells. [...] Co-executive producer/writer Drew Goddard called the episode [...] "maybe my favorite thing I've done on Lost, and I've been lucky with all the episodes I've <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> far". [...] Shooting began on March10 and continued through March25, alongside filming of [...] "Something Nice Back Home". [...] The scene in which Ben confronts Widmore was actually filmed in London, because actor Alan Dale was unable to fly to Hawaii as he had been appearing in a production of the play Spamalot. [...] Several crew members and Michael Emerson flew to London to film the scene. [...] A scene in which Claire has a prophetic vision was produced; however, it was cut due to runtime constraints.|$|E

[...] Television Blend's Steve West commented that the episode was the worst of the Animation Domination lineup that week and further elaborated that the cultural references [...] "are always a year behind, and the smart writers who used classic American culture to bring wit to the series have been replaced by those who want to mimic South Park and Family Guy. They fail miserably, and it's <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> bad that I now no longer care about the relationship between Marge and Homer." ...|$|E

Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common experience. You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E

[...] During Operation Steel Curtain, insurgents forced their way into peoples' houses and held them hostage while engaging in gun battles with American forces, who often destroyed the homes. One Sunni Iraqi family described how in 2006 they fled the sectarian violence in Baghdad to Hīt. During their yearlong stay in Hīt, they watched AQI fighters kidnap a man for talking back to them; the fighters later dumped the man's body on his doorstep. The family also watched an American patrol hit a mine in front of their house, and worried that the Americans would conduct reprisal killings on the family. [...] An Iraqi sheikh spoke about how he was accidentally shot and arrested by the Americans and thrown in Abu Ghraib prison where he was tortured. [...] After his release he was targeted by insurgents in Fallujah who thought he was an American spy.|$|E

[...] Hailing Pascal and Maximus as [...] "delightful supporting characters who continue yet another Disney custom without saying a word of dialogue", Leonard Martin of Indiewire compared Pascal to a [...] "comic Greek chorus" [...] while dubbing Maximus [...] "an extraordinarily expressive equine adversary ... who earns many of the movie's biggest laughs. Similarly, The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern wrote, [...] "No one voices Maximus ... but he steals every scene he's in", while calling Pascal [...] "endearing". The Quad-City Times Linda Cook reviewed, [...] "it's fun to watch the animal sidekicks express themselves, not through words, but facial expressions and body movements. The critters provide much of the comedy", while Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times penned, [...] "No talking animals here, although when they're as amusing as a loyal chameleon and a horse who's partly bloodhound and cop-flick action hero, they don't need to speak", joking that the Brothers Grimm [...] "probably wouldn't object." [...] ABC Online [...] "like the way the animals were used", explaining, [...] "They don't talk ... it really is funny", accrediting this to executive producer John Lasseter's influence on the film.

[...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked.

During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by The Band and their album Music from Big Pink, saying, [...] "What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing.
