5|$|Well you can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't {{attempt to make}} any evasive manoeuvres. And all they had was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> this, I would get one every time.|$|E
25|$|With a baby I {{would be}} {{accepted}} nowhere. And {{that would be}} in the best of cases; what <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not even get pregnant? Then our pure friendship would be destroyed by the intimate relationship, and our friendship is what is so terribly dear to me.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E

25|$|In June 2007, {{a federal}} judge ruled that Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman's father, could pursue the {{publishing}} rights to Simpson's book. In July 2007, a federal bankruptcy judge awarded {{the rights to the}} book to the Goldman family, who receive 90 percent of profits to help satisfy the $33.5million wrongful death civil suit judgment against Simpson. After Goldman had won the rights to the book, he arranged to publish it under the new title <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Did</b> It: Confessions of the Killer. The Goldman family's lawyers also announced intentions to pursue new publishing, film, or TV deals in order to receive some of $33.5 million awarded to them in the civil case.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Test Ray Illingworth {{was put in}} to bat, but Rowan refused {{his request}} for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later {{realised}} his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. Even John Snow applauded when he and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a very reasonable and fair man, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not agree with him' {{and that they could}} talk problems through. Brooks {{was the only one of}} the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{similarities}} {{begin with}} the first movement, which {{like that of the}} previous year´s cantata, is given to the bass as the vox Christi. The movement is the quotation of verse 7 from the gospel, beginning: [...] "" [...] (It is good for you that I leave; for <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not go, the Comforter would not come to you.) It is between aria and arioso. An oboe d'amore as the obbligato instrument plays extended melodies. Voice and oboe share the musical material, conveying [...] "the mood of grieving at parting".|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Thompson {{was cast}} in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl, co-starring Robert Lindsay. It {{provided}} a breakthrough in her career, as the production earned rave reviews. She {{played the role of}} Sally Smith for 15 months, which exhausted the actress; she [...] later remarked [...] "I thought <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the fucking [...] "Lambeth Walk" [...] one more time I was going to fucking throw up." [...] At the end of 1985, she wrote and starred in her own one-off special for Channel 4, Emma Thompson: Up for Grabs.|$|E
500|$|Jean's father, Albert Balukas, {{along with}} his partner, {{professional}} player Frank McGown, was the proprietor of a forty-eight-table pool hall called the Ovington Lounge in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York. Balukas's introduction to play was at 4 years of age, not {{on one of her}} father's tables but on a 4-1⁄2by9foot pool table in the cellar of her childhood home, purchased by her parents to keep her four billiards-playing brothers out of local pool rooms. In later years Balukas explained that she [...] "almost never went to the pool hall and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> go, I didn't play. I felt uncomfortable, and besides, girls didn't go in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what would it be like <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E

500|$|Wellington himself {{wrote in}} [...] back to London: [...] "I {{should not do}} justice to my own feelings, or to Marshal Blücher and the Prussian army, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{attribute}} the successful result of this arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I received from them. The operation of General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded".|$|E
500|$|Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear {{physicist}} assisting Bond in his mission. Richards {{stated that}} she liked the role because it was [...] "brainy", [...] "athletic", and had [...] "depth of character, in contrast to Bond girls from previous decades". Richards stated {{that a lot of}} viewers [...] "made fun of" [...] the character's attire but that [...] "These Bond girls are so outrageous and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> really look like a scientist, the Bond fans would have been disappointed." [...] Writer Ben Bussey stated in a Yahoo! Movies article that [...] "it's clear that Eon were never aiming especially high with this character" [...] since the company [...] "reportedly" [...] auditioned Geri Halliwell and Tiffani Thiessen for the role.|$|E
500|$|Eckhart {{has talked}} {{much about his}} beliefs, his way of life, and his future career ambitions. Talking to Entertainment Weekly {{regarding}} his Mormon faith, he revealed, [...] "I'm sure people think I'm a Mormon, but I don't know that I'm a Mormon anymore, you know? To be honest, to be perfectly clear, I'd be a hypocrite <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> say that I was, just because I haven't lived that lifestyle for so many years." [...] In other interviews, {{he has said that}} hypnosis helped him to quit drinking, smoking, and partying, and that he undertakes amateur photography in his spare time. In an interview with Parade magazine, Eckhart revealed that before he discovered acting, he wanted to become a songwriter.|$|E

500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E
500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Manoj and Babli {{began to}} show {{interest}} in each other. Manoj was {{two years older than}} Babli. All residents of their Karora village belong to the same clan of Banwala, a Jat community, and marrying within the clan is considered incest. Chanderpati recalled, [...] "We knew about Babli long before they decided to marry each other. She would call up often and I would sermonise to her about staying away from Manoj, fearing the fallout of such an alliance. They were, however, unconcerned and chatted for hours together. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> walk into the room while they were talking, Manoj would quickly disconnect the phone and run off to avoid any questioning." [...] She continued, [...] "I even went to Babli's house and told her mother that Manoj and Babli were seeing each other. I asked her to dissuade Babli or quickly marry them before the word spread." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the {{composer}} Edmund Rubbra, who studied under {{him in the}} early 1920s, Holst was [...] "a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of Prout and Stainer, but with a miniature score of Petrushka or the then recently published Mass in G minor of Vaughan Williams". He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. [...] "I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest—if I agreed!—that, given such and such a phrase, the following one {{would be better if}} it took such and such a course; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see this, the point would not be insisted upon... He frequently took away [...] his abhorrence of unessentials." ...|$|E
500|$|Then, on December 8, Milne held a {{press conference}} in which he defied {{suggestions}} that he would concede by officially announcing that he was asking state legislators to vote for him. He {{went on to say that}} he would not be [...] "pro-actively" [...] trying to convince legislators to vote for him, nor would he start [...] "twisting arms", but that his [...] "door is open" [...] and called on legislators to [...] "consider the record of the incumbent" [...] and what was [...] "best" [...] for Vermont. Shumlin responded that he was [...] "honored to have received the most votes in this election and would not want to serve as governor <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not." [...] He went on to say that he believed that [...] "the Legislature will honor the long democratic tradition of electing the candidate who received the most votes." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Iconic" [...] {{talks about}} {{taking control of}} your life and letting your inner fire burn and {{encourages}} listeners to pursue their dreams. During the song, she urges the listeners to [...] "making [...] voices heard before someone does it for [...] " [...] with her voice [...] "echoing like the announcer in the ring." [...] In another part, during the motivational encouragement, she informs that [...] "there's only two letters difference between 'I Can't' and 'Icon'," [...] while also inspiring the listeners {{to find their own}} greatness, singing: [...] "Just shine your light like a beautiful star / Show the world who you are." [...] Tyson opening speech talks about how he's ‘the best the world's ever seen' and that he [...] "worked hard and sweated [...] tears." [...] He later proclames: [...] "I'm never falling again and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I'll come back." [...] Chance, on the other hand, raps about idolatry.|$|E
