One can notice that measuring of environmental indicators related to <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviour</b> is complicated and demanding task. It is also important to define the main drivers of environmentally responsible development. The objective of this paper is to provide comparatives analysis of indicators of <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the Baltic States by comparing and assessing them in terms of the EU- 28 average and to present the main drivers of <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviour</b> in Lithuania. <b>Environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviour</b> is related to resource and energy savings, use of renewable energy sources, waste sorting and recycling, wastewater disposal etc. Comparative assessment of <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviour</b> indicators in the Baltic States indicated that all these indicators are bellow the EU-average, except the use of renewable energy sources. The main drivers of consumption behaviour in Lithuania were assessed by applying households surveys in order to define the major issues of concern and to develop relevant policies targeting these issues. Age, gender, education, and income of Lithuanian residents do not have impact on <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviour</b> in Lithuanian households (energy saving, buying energy efficient electric appliances, willingness to pay electricity from renewable energy sources use of biofuels).

We use a fixed effect panel data regression and check the robustness of our results with alternative econometric techniques. Findings. Although our findings do not support bidirectional hypothesis, they establish direction/causality from CFP to CER. As a result, environmental responsibility is a consequence of prior financial performance, which supports the slack resources hypothesis. Research implications.

40|$|The role {{of social}} {{marketing}} in encouraging <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> consumer <b>behaviour</b> is recognised. However, organisations {{account for a}} greater negative environmental impact. This study aims to identify how social marketers and organisations can reduce that impact by harnessing a valuable resource, that of employees’ <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> organisational citizenship <b>behaviours</b> (EROCBs). Findings from focus group interviews with employees of five large UK organisations show that individual personal factors such as environmental concern, values, beliefs, norms and habits formed from domestic behaviour are fundamental to EROCBs. An important role for internal social marketing (ISM) is highlighted in identifying environmentally concerned employees, or ‘internal customers,’ creating incentives and removing barriers to pro-environmental behaviour. The need to increase employees’ self - efficacy with respect to EROCBs is emphasised. Summary statement of contribution This paper {{is the first to}} explore the potential role of ISM in achieving social change through influencing employees’ EROCBs. The nature of these behaviours together with key drivers and constraints are identified.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of environmental education is to promote environmental friendly attitudes and <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In this study, whether the Hong Kong country parks can fulfil one of their purposes to provide environmental education to the young people and have positive influence on their environmental attitudes was examined. This study showed that the participation pattern {{of the young people}} in country parks was very low. Country parks are not fully utilized by youth and the aim of environmental education cannot be actualized among all the young people. Therefore, more actions, with the help of non-governmental organizations and promotion of ecotourism, are needed to attract more young participants to visit country parks. Environmental attitudes of participants from two samples were measured by using the New Environmental or Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale. It was found that frequent visitations to country parks can lead to more, but not significantly more, endorsement to pro-ecological worldview. Participating in environmental knowledge-based field studies courses also has similar impacts on environmental attitudes; however, to a smaller extent than that of visiting country parks. The study suggests a new direction for environmental education in Hong Kong. Adding more knowledge-based environmental education elements in the current natural settings of Hong Kong country parks will be more beneficial to young people to have better environmental friendly attitudes and <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviour.</b> published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E

The paper shows that the introduction of environmental policy may lead to a reduction of voluntary abatement and sometimes may increase emissions and environmental damage. The explanation is that voluntary abatement is socially rewarded and the reward depends on the general attitude of society towards voluntary abatement. So, if the government tightens environmental standards, the voluntary component of abatement is reduced and the social reward is negatively affected. Some considerations concerning optimal environmental policies are discussed towards the end of the paper. ...|$|E

For {{a number of}} years it has been widely {{recognised}} by governments and industry that current human activities degrade the environment and cause serious negative consequences for human population’s [Brundtland, 1987] and as such we need to identify more sustainable patterns of development. A reduction of the environmental impact of human activities by “factor 10 ” is now recognised as a key target [Simon, 1997]. Considerable research has been carried out to understand how socially and <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviours</b> can be integrated into the product development process. During the early 1990 ’s ‘green design’ was the main focus for improvements of this nature, i. e. design which focuses on single issues, {{such as the use of}} recycled materials. As understanding progressed green design was superseded by ‘ecodesign’, recognised as being a more holistic approach which tackles environmental issues at all stages of a product’s life cycle and encourages designers to think about new ways of doing things. Sustainable Design goes beyond the consideration of environmental issues and also recognises the importance of social and ethical issues in design. Literature in this field indicates that considerable and progressive body of research concerning the integration of sustainable design principles into product development exists [Fussler and James, 1996; Stevels, 1996], however there is very little evidence to indicate similar work existing in the field of packaging...|$|R
40|$|Few {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} roles and responsibilities {{of women in the}} farm enterprise or women's influence in the adoption of <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> farming practices; thus, women's role in the adoption of conservation practices has remained relatively unclear. A better understanding of women's role around the farm and in the adoption process could assist policy makers and conservation professionals who wish to impact farm-level decisions with their programs. The following study has empirically investigated midwestern women's environmental orientations and roles in the farm enterprise and household and whether these variables influence farm women to advocate the adoption of environmentally benign farming practices. The theoretical model used to guide the research was based on a combination of elements from social learning theory and gender socialisation theory. Questionnaires were distributed to farm women in Ohio and Minnesota to examine the factors that affect advocacy for <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviours</b> at the farm level. Discriminant analysis was used to test the theoretical model, which showed five variables as significant predictors of advocacy for environmentally benign agricultural practices. Although five variables were found as significant in the analysis, the measure of the strength of association between the dependent variable and the independent variables in the analysis was relatively low. Therefore, the theoretical model had limited utility for predicting which respondents would be advocates of soil and water conservation systems. Despite the limitations of the research model, future research should be conducted on farm women since the study has shown that some women are indeed influential in the process to adopt conservation production systems on their farms. adoption; farmers; farm women; gender; conservation; social learning; gender socialisation; environment; USA. ...|$|R

Present study evaluates a set of demographic variables as predictors for environmental literacy among 9 th grade students from Madeira Island (Portugal). Through a survey involving 491 students, gender, place of residence (rural and urban), 8 th grade Natural Sciences discipline performance, participation in school’s environmental activities and, indirectly, socio-economic status were evaluated in their association to environmental literacy and, particularly, to each of its three main components: knowledge, attitude and behaviour. The results confirm three stronger environmental literacy predictors: rural or urban residence, depending on the components considered, higher marks in 8 th grade Natural Sciences discipline and higher socio-economic status; and two weaker: female and participation in school’s environmental activities. Our findings found support in previous studies and underline the need to center socio-demographic factors in environmental education practices. Considering demographic variables as the reflex of environmental, economic and socio-cultural contexts, our results corroborate an environmental literacy’s construction framework on the light of Vygotsky’s socio-cultural theory of human learning, in which real learning contexts play a fundamental role. In fact, also in environmental literacy, learning occurs through the interaction with the social environment and, to be effective, needs real learning contexts.

This study considers individual, collective, and organizational variables together {{that contribute to the}} management of environmental waste. The main aim is to identify, through the development of a multilevel model, those predictive variables of recycling behaviour that help organizations to increase the recycling rates in their communities. Individual (age, gender, educational level, self-efficacy with respect to residential recycling, individual recycling behaviour), organizational (satisfaction with the quality of the service provided by a recycling company), and collective (community recycling rates, number of inhabitants, community efficacy beliefs) motivational factors relevant to recycling behaviour were analysed. A sample of 1501 residents from 55 localities was surveyed. The results of multilevel analyses indicated that there was significant variability within and between localities. Interactions between variables {{at the level of the}} individual (e. g. satisfaction with service quality) and variables at the level of the collective (e. g. community efficacy) predicted recycling behaviour in localities with low and high community recycling rates and large and small populations. The interactions showed that the relationship between self-efficacy and recycling is stronger in localities with weak community efficacy beliefs than in communities with strong beliefs. The findings show that the relationship between satisfaction with service quality and recycling behaviour is stronger in localities with strong community efficacy beliefs than in communities with weaker beliefs and a smaller population. The results are discussed accordingly in relation to theory and possible contribution to waste management.

40|$|Sports {{events have}} become more popular in Hong Kong country parks. The number of events has trebled {{in the past five}} years. This study investigates whether more events taking place in country parks will draw more people to visit the country parks to {{participate}} in the event and perhaps to also practice at the parks before the actual event. Further, with increased visits to the country parks and therefore coming into closer contact with nature, the participants maybe become more aware of the natural environment, which may then lead to enhanced environmental awareness and behaviour. This study focuses on a specific set of outdoor recreational activities, namely trail running, hiking and adventure racing events, and adopts a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Survey results indicate that there is a weak statistically significant positive correlation with country park visit and environmental behaviour, but not with attitudes; environmental attitude group “conservation priority” has statistically significant positive correlation with education and green consumerism and political activism; and frequency of visit, hours of visit and number of events joined bears a correlation with political activism, and participants who chose trail running, adventure racing and mountain biking as their favourite activities scored highest across these variables. Events that promote <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>behaviours</b> have a demonstrated potential in bringing about environmental behavioural change and this potential of using events to spread green messages should be further explored and utilised. Participants indicated greater concern for environmental issues related to the activities they participate in. Friends are a major motivation for country park visitation and event participation. Sports events may cause serious ecological damage to trails as participants prefer off-trail routes. Scientific data and baselines should be gathered to monitor the impact events have on the trails.

40|$|Through this {{descriptive}} exploratory study, {{the ways}} that wilderness recreation leaders experience nature are illuminated, deconstructing the assumed environmental benefits of and practices used in outdoor recreation (Haluza-Delay, 2001). This study also offers a foundation for advancing an environmental ethic among wilderness recreation leaders, participants, and organizations. With the continued degradation of and threats to natural environments, and the rising popularity of outdoor recreation participation, the outdoor recreation professional can be a leader in promoting human reconnections to the Earth (Henderson, 1999). Leaders of outdoor recreation experiences {{play an important role}} in encouraging these revived relationships to natural settings and can contribute to the necessary environmental consciousness shift needed within Western society (Hanna, 1995; Jordan, 1996). The purpose of this research was to describe the lived-experience in nature of wilderness recreation leaders. Specifically, a phenomenological method of inquiry was used to describe the meaning of nature, the connections and relationships to nature, and the behaviours and emotions experienced in nature by a group of wilderness canoe trip leaders employed by a residential summer camp. In addition to the implications of this research, achieving this outcome provides a rich descriptive understanding of wilderness leaders' experiences—a basis from which to extend future research endeavours and programmatic practices that promote effective environmental outcomes of outdoor recreation participation. Each of the five study participants was employed in the summer of 2003 by an Ontario residential summer camp organization that sponsors extended wilderness river canoe trips for youth. Two in-depth and semi-structured interviews were performed with each participant, asking them to reflect on the canoe trip that they led for the summer camp organization during 2003. Phenomenological data was analyzed according to Colaizzi's (1978) thematic analysis process. Consistent with van Manen's (1997) emphasis on phenomenological writing, the final result presents the essence of the nature experiences of wilderness recreation leaders in the format of a narrative description.

This is followed by testing of the structural models to test the hypothesised relationships of the constructs. Findings - The results suggest the substantive influence of social capital on environmental knowledge, pro-environmental attitudes and eco-capability. Both knowledge and attitudes have positive effects on eco-capability, which in turn positively shapes eco-behaviour. Research limitations/implications - Future studies can examine how social capital as a multi-dimensional construct impacts context-specific consumer behaviour. Practical implications - Social and environmental marketing may focus on social network activation to encourage eco-behaviours of consumers. Social implications - Findings highlight the role of social capital within one 2 ̆ 7 s community as a resource channel to encourage <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> consumer <b>behaviour.</b> Originality/value - The study extends the BPM by offering a social capital view as a more nuanced explanation of consumer eco-behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper falls within the {{theoretical}} framework of green marketing. It investigates the relationships that exist between the motives relating to aquacultural products marketed under the private label of a traditional retailer (Coop), the attitude towards their purchase, the perception of their quality, their reliability and the willingness to pay for them. Particular importance is given to the green motives, those that lead to a preference for a product made with specific renewable energies such as biogas. The structural equation models technique (SEM) is used to develop propositions representing a theoretical approach to the integration of green marketing, {{in the context of the}} process for purchasing Coop brand fish. With regard to distinguishing between the motives, we referred to the approach that sets out three different types of motive: clean, green and ethical. The resulting managerial implications make it possible to assess how much the different types of motive influence the choices of the consumers. Managers will benefit from the results of this paper by understanding better the benefits for consumers of aquacultural products from renewable energy such as biogas. The originality of the paper lies in its focusing on green purchase behaviour in a poorly investigated sector such as that of fish breeding. The paper contributes to an understanding of the factors that influence <b>environmentally</b> <b>responsible</b> purchase <b>behaviour</b> and their exact relationships, that are still unclear in literature. The fact that environmental issues and concerns are constantly changing implies that ongoing research into their influence on consumer behaviour is essential...|$|R
