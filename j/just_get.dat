5|$|It's like a 90's, throwback-type vibe, when I said 'I {{want it to}} {{look like}} this,' I said like a TLC, Fresh Prince type vibe. I was like, 'Let's <b>just</b> <b>get</b> really silly, 90's amazing outfits, and {{just go out and}} dance around and have fun.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They <b>just</b> <b>get</b> {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|The family becomes {{increasingly}} frightened and distrustful of him, especially when his latest advice leads Hayley {{to be attacked}} by a shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's suggestions are better than his own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more. Stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas to <b>just</b> <b>get</b> help, Stan instead throws a javelin that hits his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear. Buckle enters {{the house with a}} tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan, who later tells Buckle that he made the right call. Despite the whole ordeal, Stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis.|$|E

25|$|Ramsey was {{convinced}} the Germans were exhausted, and after Hurst scored a controversial and heavily debated goal, the game looked over. With seconds remaining, and England {{under the pressure}} of another German attack, the ball broke to Moore {{on the edge of his}} own penalty area. Teammates shouted at Moore to <b>just</b> <b>get</b> rid of the ball, but he calmly picked out the feet of Hurst 40yards(40m) upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4–2.|$|E
25|$|He has a {{youthful}} and somewhat 'girly' appearance (because {{of his long}} hair) which causes no end of teasing from Ryang when he visits earth in vol 5 to get the Scroll of Divination back from Bast. Now his only real concern is getting a new body, but Lady Samsin knows what he wants is impossible and should <b>just</b> <b>get</b> married. He is continuously losing his powers as an entire generation was delayed when Oran became incapable of marrying him. The king abducts Charon, who realized his plan to acquire a new body, and changes him into a form of a nine-tailed fox. He then holds a hunting competition for catching Charon in his fox form, then soon loses conscience as he has not married and reincarnated for too long.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} as manager at Rangers, Ally McCoist showed his players footage of a goal Hooper scored against them at Celtic Park. [...] "He makes a run from the halfway line on the left hand side.

500|$|Boddingtons largely eschewed {{above the}} line {{advertising}} until 1987, {{when it was first}} advertised on Granada television in the North West of England. The tagline from 1987 until 1991 was [...] "If you don't get Boddies, you'll <b>just</b> <b>get</b> bitter". Under Whitbread's custodianship the comedian Frankie Howerd fronted the campaign in a series of six television advertisements which mainly aired in the North West in 1990–1991. Lowe Howard-Spink was the advertising agency responsible for the Howerd advertisements.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the album's title, Lords said: [...] "I think that fire is {{something}} that's really representative of the record. It's really, really peaceful and you're drawn to it. But if you get too close, it can torch you and kill you. But if you <b>just</b> <b>get</b> close enough, it's warm and it's soothing, it's mesmerising and it's peaceful.

He felt that the record can be enjoyed by people of all ages due to the accessible nature of music, and concluded that Daft Punk [...] "could <b>just</b> <b>get</b> back on the spaceship that brought them here and go, and leave us.

500|$|Recorded at {{the third}} Nashville session, this song was the {{culmination}} of another epic of simultaneous writing and recording in the studio. Wilentz describes how the lyrics evolved through a surviving part-typed, part-handwritten manuscript page, [...] "which begins 'honey but it's just too hard' (a line that had survived from the very first New York session with the Hawks). Then the words meander through random combinations and disconnected fragments and images ('people <b>just</b> <b>get</b> uglier'; 'banjo eyes'; 'he was carrying a 22 but it was only a single shot'), before, in Dylan's own hand, amid many crossings-out, there appears 'Oh MAMA you're here IN MOBILE ALABAMA with the Memphis blues again'." ...|$|E

The challenge was to not <b>just</b> <b>get</b> existing fans of the franchise to buy The Oath of Vayuputras—that would happen anyway—but to expand the reader base. The campaign idea revolved around creating another 'first-of-its-kind' in book marketing, which this time around {{turned out to be the}} production of a world-class music video which is poised at reaching out to the masses through television, in a bid to garner greater awareness about the book." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Alive or Just Breathings release, {{the album}} having been written and {{recorded}} for two guitarists, the band decided {{to expand and}} become a fivesome; Dutkiewicz moved to guitar and former Aftershock drummer Tom Gomes filled in the vacant drummer position. [...] After Leach was married on April 20, 2002 and began touring again he fell into a depression. Leach left the band {{a few days before}} the band was meant to play a show and sent the band members an e-mail telling them he had quit.

500|$|Hunt {{described}} Bennett and Broncos teammate Darren Lockyer as {{the greatest}} influences on his league career. With Lockyer's move from fullback to five-eighth, Hunt had large shoes {{to fill in the}} position. Hunt proved to be a success for the Broncos; he played every game in 2004, missing just four minutes in total, and was the team's top try-scorer. Bennett remarked of him that [...] "Karmichael has an attitude just like Darren Lockyer where he can make a mistake and kiss it off and <b>just</b> <b>get</b> on with the game, It's a wonderful quality to have and you'd like every player to have it.

She asked me to 'stand by for emails explaining George Bush is a great statesman, torture is justified in many circumstances and those Iraqi insurgents should <b>just</b> <b>get</b> over it'." ...|$|E
500|$|The Rescue {{was written}} as a short vehicle to {{introduce}} Vicki {{as the new}} companion, replacing Carole Ann Ford (Susan) when Ford decided she wanted to leave the series, and is thus more character-driven than anything that had preceded it.

In contrast to Susan, Vicki is an Earth orphan from the future; the production team considered many names from here, some of them odd like [...] "Lukki" [...] and [...] "Tanni".
