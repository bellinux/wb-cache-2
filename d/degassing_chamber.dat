5000|$|TIBEAN or TWBA {{stands for}} the German „Tiefenwasserbelüftungsanlage" [...] which means „deep water {{aeration}} system". The TIBEAN - series are floating or submerse plants. They consist {{of one or more}} upstream pipes, where the water is aerated while rising up, a <b>degassing</b> <b>chamber</b> where the aerated water is freed of gases and one or more downstream pipes where the vented, degassed water is pumped back into the hypolimnion. In the <b>degassing</b> <b>chamber</b> additional nutrient absorbers and/ or nutrient precipitation devices can be implemented.|$|E
50|$|At {{the lower}} end of the plant {{atmospheric}} air is inserted into the water by an ejector. A mixture of water and oxygen is forced upwards in the upstream pipe. At the end of the upstream pipe the mixture flows into the <b>degassing</b> <b>chamber.</b> Residual gases are separated from the oxygenated water. The gas escapes into the atmosphere, the oxygenated water flows back through the downstream pipe. The outlet provides a laminar flow and a horizontal outflow into the hypolimnion.Thanks to the flow and mass transfer calculations which are performed in the context of the technical configuration, the optimal set-up can be determined.|$|E

Similarly the manufactures of transformer oil filtering machine requires a constant observation by human personnel to check the rise of foam level in the <b>degassing</b> <b>chamber.</b> The foam can cause the problems in working of the vacuum pump so {{it is important to}} safeguard it. For this purpose we developed an optical based systems which can overcome the system constraints like temperature, pressure and detect rise in foam automatically and activate the control system with the help of relay. The developed optical foam detection systems are non-intrusive, cheap and easy to implement...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to {{study the effects of}} enhanced surface structures on heat flux using spray cooling. The surface enhancements consisted of cubic pin fins machined on the top surface of copper heater blocks. The structure height, pitch, and width were parametrically vaned. Each copper block had a projected cross-sectional area of 2. 0 sq cm. Measurements were also obtained on a heater block with a flat surface for baseline comparison purposes. A 2 x 2 nozzle array was used with PF- 5060 as the working fluid. Thermal performance data were obtained under nominally <b>degassed</b> (<b>chamber</b> pressure of 41. 4 kPa) and gassy conditions (chamber with N 2 gas at 100. 7 kPa) with a bulk fluid temperature of 20. 5 C. Results for both the degassed and gassy cases show that structure width and separation distance have a dominant effect upon the heat transfer for the size ranges used. Cubic pin fin height had little impact upon heat flux. The maximum critical heat flux (CHF) attained for any of the surfaces was 121 W/sq cm, giving an enhancement of 51 % relative to the flat surface case under nominally degassed conditions. The gassy case had a maximum CHF of 149 W/sq cm, giving an enhancement of 38 % relative to the flat surface case...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to {{study the effects of}} enhanced surfaces on heat transfer during spray cooling. The surface enhancements consisted of cubic pin fins, pyramids, and straight fins (uniform cross sectional straight fins) machined on the top surface of copper heater blocks. Each had a cross-sectional area of 2. 0 square cm. Measurements were also obtained on a heater block with a flat surface for baseline comparison purposes. A 2 x 2 nozzle array was used with PF- 5060 as the working fluid. Thermal performance data was obtained under nominally <b>degassed</b> (<b>chamber</b> pressure of 41. 4 kPa) and gassy conditions (chamber with N 2 gas at 101 kPa). The results show that the straight fins had the largest enhancement in heat flow. Critical heat flux (CHF) for this surface showed an increase of 55 % in comparison to the flat surface for the nominally degassed condition. The cubic pin finned and pyramid surfaces provided slightly more than half the heat flux enhancement (30 % - 40 % greater than the flat surface) of the straight fins. The gassy case showed that the straight fins again provided the largest enhancement (48 %) in CHF relative to the flat surface. This was followed by the cubic pin fins, and pyramids which had increases of 31 % and 18 % respectively. No significant effect was observed in the surface temperature at which CHF occurs for either portion of the study...|$|R
40|$|IDEX Health and Science {{has created}} a {{thin-film}} composite membrane consisting of a carbon nanotube matrix impregnated with a fluorinated copolymer called Teflon® AF 2400. This membrane is being studied for use in <b>degassing</b> <b>chambers</b> of analytical instruments such as a High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) degassing modules. The level of impregnation of the Teflon® in the carbon matrix affects the diffusion properties which are crucial {{for the performance of}} the membrane. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) characterization techniques were used to measure the outer Teflon® and the inner carbon matrix layer thickness. The outer Teflon® and inner carbon matrix layer thicknesses ranged from 1. 92 to 28. 17 microns and 5. 07 to 41. 70 microns, respectively. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS) was used to measure the Teflon® fluorine concentration gradient across the composite membrane. Mechanical tensile testing was also performed on each sample to compare the mechanical properties of the membrane to the initial design parameters. Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS), Young’s Modulus (E), and Percent Elongation were collected for each membrane. IDEX Health and Science used the following processing parameters to create each membrane: (a) Concentration, (b) Density, (c) Time, and (d) Recoat. Statistical analysis indicated that time and recoat had the largest effect on maximum stress at maximum load. The results from SEM imaging, EDS scans, and tensile testing helped determine how well the Teflon® infiltrated the carbon matrix. The interactions between the four processing parameters provided IDEX Health and Science with information to determine the optimal set of processing parameters for generating the ideal membrane...|$|R
40|$|Methane is {{the major}} final product of {{anaerobic}} degradation of biomass in. Moreover, methane has a high greenhouse gas potential. Therefore {{it is important to}} gain a comprehensive picture of the methane cycle, while also knowing the methane flux from the sediment into the water column and further into the atmosphere. In order to determine the exact concentrations of methane in the boundary layer between the sediment and the water column, a diffusion based methane-sensor,, is presented in this work. The sensor consists of a steel cannula with two small holes at the tip, which are coated with a gas-permeable silicone tubing. Methane can therefore diffuse into the interior of the needle. With the help of a carrier liquid (distilled water), the methane sample is pumped to the gas chromatograph. Because of the GC can only register gases, the methane must be removed from the distilled water. This is done, by using a <b>degassing</b> <b>chamber.</b> The carrier liquid is pumped through a gas-permeable silicone tubing, so the methane diffuses into a carrier gas stream. The gas stream including the methane sample is then directed to the GC detector, where the methane is analyzed. The methane, which diffuses from the sediment into the needle, is pumped into some sort of coil to be stored until measurment in the laboratory. Several coils were tested for their methane permeability [...] In a next step, several methane samples are pumped in a row into the coil. In order to minimize mixing of the individual samples, several "stop liquids" with a lower solubility, than water, were pumped between the samples. Best performance was obtained with a steel coil and no stop liquid. However, the reproducibility of the system was low and severe losses of methane were observed. Thus the tested system is no option for storage of methane samples. ...|$|E

40|$|Phase change {{technology}} is a science that is continually finding new applications, from passive refrigeration cycles to semiconductor cooling. The primary heat transfer techniques associated with phase change heat transfer are pool boiling, flow boiling, and spray cooling. Of these techniques, spray cooling is the least studied {{and the most recent}} to receive attention in the scientific community. Spray cooling is capable of removing large amounts of heat between the cooled surface and the liquid, with reported heat flux capabilities of up to 1000 W/cm 2 for water. Many previous studies have emphasized heat flux as a function of spray parameters and test conditions. Enhanced spray cooling investigations to date have been limited to surface roughness studies. These studies concluded that surface tolerance (i. e. variations in machined surface finish) had an impact upon heat flux when using pressure atomized sprays. Analogous pool boiling studies with enhanced surfaces have shown heat flux enhancement. A spray cooling study using enhanced surfaces beyond the surface roughness range may display heat flux enhancement as well. In the present study, a group of extended and embedded surfaces (straight fins, cubic pin fins, pyramids, dimples and porous tunnels) have been investigated {{to determine the effects of}} enhanced surface structure on heat flux. The surface enhancements were machined on the top surface of copper heater blocks with a cross-sectional area of 2. 0 cm 2. Measurements were also obtained on a flat surface for baseline comparison purposes. Thermal performance data was obtained under saturated (pure fluid at 101 kPa), nominally <b>degassed</b> (<b>chamber</b> pressure of 41. 4 kPa) and gassy conditions (chamber with N 2 gas at 101 kPa). The study shows that both extended and embedded structures (beyond the surface roughness range) promote heat flux enhancement for both degassed and gassy spray cooling conditions. The study also shows that straight fins provide the best utilization of surface area added for heat transfer. An Energy conservation based CHF correlation for flat surface spray cooling was also developed. CHF predictions were compared against published and non-published studies by several researchers. Results for the correlations performance show an average mean error of ± 17. 6 % with an accuracy of ± 30 % for 88 % of the data set compared against...|$|R

Under acidic conditions found in high enthalpy hydrothermal systems, CO 2 is essentially inert and is not removed from the gas phase by interactions with hydrothermal liquids (e.g., Christenson et al. 2010). Carbon dioxide is not readily measurable using remote techniques (e.g., Schwandner et al. 2017), requiring in situ measurements. Diffuse CO 2 <b>degassing</b> using accumulation <b>chamber</b> methods can be useful to monitor (e.g., Chiodini et al. 2005; Notsu et al. 2006; Epiard et al. 2017), although time-consuming surveys are required in often dangerous conditions.|$|R

Molecular structural analyses have revealed that thin solid film evaporated from the molten L-Glu is mainly composed of L-Pygl due to intramolecular lactamization.

40|$|Many volcanoes {{express a}} variety of {{contrasting}} eruptive styles with behavioural transitions between explosive and effusive activities. Understanding eruptive mechanisms is of key importance but we currently have little insight into the behavioural controls for rhyolitic eruptions beneath ice. This paper addresses a subglacial rhyolitic eruption at Dalakvísl in South Iceland that involved both explosive and effusive activities. We present measurements of pre- and post-eruptive magmatic volatile contents that we use to track magma <b>degassing</b> from the <b>chamber</b> {{to the surface and}} reconstruct pressure conditions during the eruption. Explosive and effusive phases involve significant differences in: (1) pre-eruptive volatile contents; (2) the ‘openness’ of magma degassing; and (3) inferred confining pressure. This final factor is potentially associated with a jökulhlaup-induced decompression. Due to the combination of these factors Dalakvísl experienced a change from effusive to explosive behaviour, although we cannot currently resolve cause from effect.

40|$|Helium, Sr, and Nd isotopic {{ratios and}} major and trace element {{compositions}} have been {{measured on a}} suite of lavas from the intra-plate volcanos of the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile. Lavas from the islands of Mas Afuera and Mas a Tierra and from Monte Alpha and Friday seamounts have Sr and Nd isotopic ratios lying on the low ^(143) Nd/^(144) Nd side of the mantle array (^(87) Sr/^(86) Sr: 0. 7034 – 0. 7037; ^(143) Nd/^(144) Nd: 0. 51281 – 0. 51289). The homogeneity of these tracers suggests the involvement of a restricted range of mantle source compositions throughout Juan Fernandez volcanism. In marked contrast is the large range in ^ 3 He/^ 4 He, from 7. 8 to 18. 0 R_A. A bimodal ^ 3 He/^ 4 He distribution on Mas a Tierra is associated with two distinct volcanic lineages; ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratios of 14. 5 – 18. 0 R_A (n= 15) occur in alkalic and tholeiitic shield basalts, whereas post-shield basanites range from 11. 2 to 13. 6 R_A (n= 12). Elemental and isotopic systematics demonstrate a transition from an enriched (Loihi-like) plume source in the shield lavas to a more MORB-like source in the post-shield volcanics. The transition between these sources is much more pronounced in ^ 3 He/^ 4 He than in the other isotopic tracers. The predominantly tholeiitic basalts of Mas Afuera have exceptionally uniform isotopic and elemental characteristics; Sr and Nd ratios {{are similar to those}} of Mas a Tierra, but ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratios are lower and more uniform at 8. 3 ± 0. 5 R_A (n= 17). The dramatic distinction between Mas Afuera and Mas a Tierra helium is surprising given the great similarity between the two islands in other geochemical characteristics. Both the Mas Afuera and Mas a Tierra results demonstrate that helium records systematic processes not readily apparent from other isotopic or elemental indicators. Neither magma <b>chamber</b> <b>degassing</b> nor local metasomatic events are likely to be responsible. We suggest that the observed variations may be attributed to mixing of plume and asthenospheric sources in which the plume component is characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of volatiles or has suffered extraction of small degree partial melts prior to mixing...|$|R
40|$|A subseafloor replacement-style barite and sulfide {{occurrence}} was {{drilled in}} shallow waters at the Palinuro volcanic complex, the northernmost Aeolian arc volcano in the Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. Using a lander-type drilling device, 11 successful drill holes yielded {{a total of}} 13. 5 m of core from a sediment-filled depression located at a water depth of 630 to 650 m. The longest continuous drill core recovered consists of 4. 84 m of massive to semimassive barite and sulfides with abundant late, native sulfur overprint. Seafloor observations suggest that the hydrothermal system associated {{with the formation of}} the subseafloor barite and sulfide ore zone is still active, although black smoker activity does not occur on the seafloor. The recovered drill core shows that the subseafloor deposit is zoned with depth. The top of the mineralized zone is comprised of a variably silicified vuggy barite-sulfide facies that shows notable polymetallic metal enrichment, while the deeper portion of the mineralized zone is dominated by massive pyrite having distinctly lower base and precious metal grades. Metal zonation of the barite and sulfide deposit is related to the evolution of the hydrothermal fluids in space and time. The barite cap and the massive pyrite present in the deeper portion of the mineralized zone appear to have formed early in the paragenesis. During the main stage of the mineralization, the barite cap was brecciated and cemented by a polymetallic assemblage of barite and pyrite with minor chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite, trace famatinite, and rare cinnabar. Lower temperature precipitates formed during the main stage of mineralization include sphalerite, galena, pyrite, opal-A, and barite, which are associated with traces of Pb-Sb-As sulfosalts such as bournonite-seligmannite, or semseyite. A distinct mineral assemblage of fine-grained anhedral enargite, hypogene covellite, chalcopyrite, and galena is commonly associated with colloform sphalerite, galena, and pyrite as a late phase of this main stage. Colloform pyrite and marcasite are the last sulfides formed in the paragenetic sequence. The deposit is interpreted to have formed from fluids having an intermediate-sulfidation state, although excursions to high- and very high sulfidation states are indicated by the presence of abundant enargite and hypogene covellite. Laser ablation and conventional sulfur isotope analyses show that pyrite formed close to the seafloor within the zone of polymetallic metal enrichment has a variable sulfur isotope composition (δ 34 S = − 39 to + 3 ‰), whereas a more narrow range is observed in the massive pyrite at depth (δ 34 S = − 10 to 0 ‰). Similar variations were also documented for the late native sulfur overprint. Overall, the negative sulfur isotope ratios at depth, the intermediate- to very high sulfidation conditions during mineralization, and the abundance of native sulfur suggest contributions of magmatic volatiles to the mineralizing fluids from a <b>degassing</b> magma <b>chamber</b> at depth. Biological processes are interpreted to have played a major role during late stages of ore formation. The combination of a subseafloor replacement deposit with a massive to semimassive barite cap rock overlying massive pyrite, the intermediate- to high-sulfidation characteristics, and the strong biological influence on the late stages of mineralization are distinct from other modern seafloor massive sulfide deposits and represents a style of submarine mineralization not previously recognized in a modern volcanic arc environment. The barite and sulfide occurrence at Palinuro shares many characteristics with porphyry-related base metal veins and intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits, suggesting that metallogenic processes associated with arc-related magmatic-hydrothermal systems are not restricted to the subaerial environment...|$|R
40|$|The Ertsberg Intrusion (EI) {{is located}} {{approximately}} 1. 5 km {{southeast of the}} Grasberg super-porphyry Cu-Au deposit (GIC), in the Gunung Bijih (Ertsberg) Mining District, West Papua, Indonesia. Intrusion- and carbonate-hosted mineralization {{is associated with the}} 3. 28 - 2. 97 ± 0. 54 Ma multi-phase intrusive complex. The orientation of the intrusion-hosted mineralized zone is parallel to the direction of porphyry dike emplacement in the intrusive complex and to regional structures. Potassic, phyllic, propylitic and endoskarn alteration types are recognized in the EI, distributed over 7 vein types. Three vein stages initiate pre-porphyry dike emplacement, and mineralization occurs pre- and post-dike emplacement. Cu-Au mineralization is associated with pre-dike biotite-bornite-anhydrite veinlets (Stage III), and post-dike quartz-anhydrite-bornite+chalcopyrite//green sericite veins (Stage V), and quartz-anhydrite-chalcopyrite-pyrite//white sericite veins (Stage VI). Sulfides associated with each alteration type in the EI have d³⁴S values that range between - 3. 0 to 3. 6 ‰. Sulfate d³⁴S between alteration types are variable: potassic (9. 6 - 11. 1 ‰) and hydrolytic (10. 2 - 16. 6 ‰). The bulk isotopic sulfur (d³⁴S(SS)) composition for fluid in equilibrium Stage III veins is 7. 5 ‰, which is higher than would expected for an oxidized calc-alkaline fluid, thus I invoke the addition of heavy sulfur from the sedimentary anhydrite nodules in adjacent carbonate host rocks. There is an overall decrease in bulk isotopic sulfur (d³⁴S(SS)) composition for hydrothermal fluid throughout the span of hydrothermal activity. A <b>degassing</b> mafic magma <b>chamber</b> at depth, and/or the leaching of previously deposited sulfides are likely responsible for this decrease. Sulfide-sulfate equilibrium temperatures for potassic alteration in the EI average 574 °C, approximately 125 °C cooler than sulfide-sulfate equilibrium temperatures in the GIC. Calculated oxygen isotopic compositions for water in equilibrium with anhydrite from early potassic veins in both the Ertsberg Stockwork Zone and GIC suggest this component was derived from a non-magmatic source; the sedimentary anhydrite nodules are a probable source. The calculated oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions for water in equilibrium sericite from intermediate veins in the ESZ and GIC show the fluid was derived from a magmatic water and/or magmatic vapor; however, the water responsible for late hydrolytic alteration in both intrusive centers provides evidence for mixing of magmatic water (vapor) with meteoric water. Mass balance calculations using the EI volume estimate, and the known mineralization associated with the EI show that the EI has an insufficient volume of H₂O to account for the known volume of hydrothermal alteration and mineralization. Coupled with sulfur, oxygen and hydrogen isotope data, and Re-Os isotope source data, this suggests additional input of hydrothermal fluids from deeper magmatic and sedimentary sources, with moderate addition of meteoric water into the hydrothermal system during Stage VI vein formation...|$|R
