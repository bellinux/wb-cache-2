Rheological tests {{are performed to evaluate}} the penetrability and the thixotropic strength recovery of the suspensions. The results show that the initial viscosity and the yield stress are reduced significantly by adding 2 % sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) to 10 % bentonite suspensions. Moreover, the yield stress and the viscosity gradually increase with time due to the thixotropic nature of the bentonite suspensions. The shearing response of the permeated soil is observed by consolidated undrained triaxial tests on loose Ottawa sand specimens permeated with bentonite suspensions. The stress-strain response of the permeated specimens shows no <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>stress</b> after the undrained instability state as compared to the response of clean sand specimens. Additionally, the undrained shear response of the permeated sand specimens displays no cohesion and the same friction angle as clean sand.

To characterize the functional interdependency between the G-layer and the secondary cell wall, nanostructural characterization and mechanical tests were performed on native tension wood tissues of poplar (Populus nigra x Populus deltoids) and on tissues in which the G-layer was removed by an enzymatic treatment. In addition to the well-known axial orientation of the cellulose fibrils in the G-layer, it was shown that the microfibril angle of the S 2 -layer was very large (about 36 degrees). The removal of the G-layer resulted in an axial extension and a tangential contraction of the tissues.

This {{investigation}} aims {{to evaluate}} the changes in stress magnitudes and distributions on Partially Stabilized Zirconia (PS-ZrO(2)) dental implants and bridges and on the mandible caused by fibrous encapsulations during clenching.

Four 3. 26 mm diameter PS-ZrO(2) dental implants with lengths of 12 mm were modelled {{and placed in the}} second premolar and first molar region {{on both sides of the}} mandible model. A rigid zirconia bridge with a thickness of 0. 5 mm connects the PS-ZrO(2) dental implants placed in the second premolar and first molar. Four periodontal ligament (PDL) case studies were examined: PDL in the second premolars; PDL in the first molars; PDL in both the second premolars and first molars; and no PDL present. Results. The results reveal the magnitudes and distributions of stresses on the dental implants and connecting bridges were governed by the PDLs. A significant <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>stress</b> levels were recorded when the PDL encapsulates the roots of the dental implants. Of the four PDL case studies, it was found that when the PDLs are present in both the second premolars and first molars the lowest stress magnitudes are generated.

40|$|The {{stress-strain}} {{response of}} unfilled crosslinked elastomers subjected to loading/unloading deformation histories displays non-linear elastic and viscoelastic characteristics. In addition, filled elastomers exhibit {{a number of}} peculiar features {{referred to as the}} Mullins effect, including (i) a large stress-softening as the sample is deformed to the same strain in second and subsequent deformation cycles, (ii) a much larger hysteresis in the first deformation cycle as compared to an unfilled elastomer, (iii) a dramatic <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>stress</b> {{at the point where the}} loading is reversed and, (iv) complete recovery of the virgin sample-like behavior when strain in second cycle exceeds the previous maximum strain. Developing a constitutive model to describe all of these effects has proven to be a major challenge. One important reason for this has been a dearth of experimental data performed on a single well-characterized unfilled and filled system where the potentially relevant parameters that control the mechanical behavior were systematically varied. ^ A comprehensive data set has been obtained for both linear and non-linear mechanical experiments, including non-linear constant strain rate uniaxial deformation and non-linear creep/recovery for a wide range of temperatures, extension rates and stretch ratios on a styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) cured with dicumyl peroxide. The data set was analyzed using a series of non-linear viscoelastic constitutive models that employs an additive combination of hyperelastic and quasi-linear viscoelastic contributions; surprisingly the standard theory is unable to describe the data. Specifically, the standard theory predicts stiffer than experimentally observed response in constant strain rate experiments and softer than observed response in creep experiments. This indicates towards additional physical processes occurring in the material not accounted for by the standard viscoelastic constitutive models. ^ The mechanical behavior of carbon black filled crosslinked SBR systems were studied in order to determine the effects of the amount, dispersion and properties, the particle size, surface area, structure, of the carbon black on the stress-strain response of filled elastomers (i. e. Mullins effect), at various stretch ratios, temperatures and deformation rates. The traditional model for Mullins effect advanced in the literature has been a 2 ̆ 2 damage 2 ̆ 2 mechanism, where the stress-softening is postulated to be a due to the breakage of either filler-rubber bonds or filler-filler contacts. The experimental data conclusively shows that damage models are inconsistent; specifically, they cannot account for the dramatic <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>stress</b> occurring at load reversal. ^ In order to account for the stress drop on load reversal, a new physical mechanism is proposed for filled elastomers based on the idea that the material undergoes a jamming/unjamming transition in the course of deformation. From this perspective, the virgin material being pulled for the first time is in a jammed state, and the reversal of load leads to unjamming which persists until the previous maximum deformation is exceeded. All the experimental findings are consistent with this mechanism, including stress relaxation, cyclic deformation, dependence on carbon black properties and effect of the stretch ratio. A simple phenomenological model based on the jamming/ 2 ̆ 2 unjamming 2 ̆ 2 picture is developed. The jamming in the material is taken into account via introduction of two internal variables, one of them a structure variable which captures the memory of the deformation history. The evolution of the structure variable is governed by a relaxation equation which is highly asymmetric such that the rate of change of the structure variable depends on whether the system is being loaded or unloaded. This phenomenological model captures for the first time all the qualitative features of the Mullins effect. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{underlying}} microstructure {{and dynamics}} of a dense granular material as it evolves towards the “critical state”, a limit {{state in which}} the system deforms with an essentially constant volume and stress ratio, remains widely debated in the micromechanics of granular media community. Strain localization, a common mechanism in the large strain regime, further complicates the characterization of this limit state. Here we revisit the evolution to this limit state {{within the framework of}} modern percolation theory. Attention is paid to motion transfer: in this context, percolation translates to the emergence of a large-scale connectivity in graphs that embody information on individual grain displacements. We construct each graph G(r) by connecting nodes, representing the grains, within a distance r in the displacement-state-space. As r increases, we observe a percolation transition on G(r). The size of the jump discontinuity increases in the lead up to failure, indicating that the nature of percolation transition changes from continuous to explosive. We attribute this to the emergence of collective motion, which manifests in increasingly isolated communities in G(r). At the limit state, where the jump discontinuity is highest and invariant across the different unjamming cycles (<b>drops</b> <b>in</b> <b>stress</b> ratio), G(r) encapsulates multiple kinematically distinct communities that are mediated by nodes corresponding to those grains in the shear band. This finding casts light on the dual and opposing roles of the shear band: a mechanism that creates powder keg divisions in the sample, while simultaneously acting as a mechanical link that transfers motion through such subdivisions moving in relative rigid-body motion...|$|R

The constituent bodies and the interface weld have similar elastic and thermal expansion properties but different plastic properties. A Mode I crack is in parent sort alloy steel (ASTM 4340) which grows perpendicularly towards the ultra strong weld of maraging steel (MDN 250). A cyclic plastic or cohesive zone develops ahead of the crack tip under fatigue load. This zone penetrates into the weld, possibly crossing over into maraging steel, as the crack grows nearer to the weld which causes the <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>stress</b> intensity parameter at the crack tip from the applied value. The cohesive zone split across the weld interface is modeled in linear elastic regime {{with the help of}} Kolosov-Muskhelishvili complex potentials leading to a computational model for assessing the effect of the weld on the advancing crack. Paris law based on cyclic crack tip stress intensity parameter is used to estimate the crack growth rate. Theoretical assessment is substantiated with the help of experiments. Bimetallic compact tension specimens, prepared by electron beam welding of the steels, are subjected to high cycle fatigue load to measure crack growth rates in them. Results of the bimetallic specimens are analyzed and compared with those of the plain alloy steel specimen.

40|$|The {{addition}} of glucose to derepressed {{cells of the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae triggers activation of the cAMP pathway with a rapid <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>stress</b> resistance as a consequence. We have isolated the LRE 1 gene as a multicopy suppressor of glucose-induced loss of heat resistance. Overexpression of LRE 1 in a wild-type strain causes the same phenotype as observed in strains with reduced activity of the cAMP-PKA pathway: higher heat resistance and enhanced trehalose levels. Deletion of LRE 1 results in the opposite phenotypes. Epistasis analysis indicates that these effects are independent of cAMP and PKA, of the protein kinases Yak 1, Sch 9 and Rim 15 and of the transcription factors Msn 2 and Msn 4. Lre 1 has recently been isolated in a two-hybrid screen using the conserved protein kinase Cbk 1 as a bait. Cbk 1 controls the expression of CTS 1 (encoding chitinase) through the transcription factor Ace 2. We demonstrate here that overexpression of LRE 1 represses CTS 1 whereas deletion of LRE 1 induces the expression of CTS 1. Repression of CTS 1 results in deficient cell separation {{as a result of}} inefficient degradation of the chitin ring after cytokinesis. Neither deletion nor overexpression of LRE 1 has any effect on CTS 1 expression in a cbk 1 Delta mutant, indicating that Lre 1 inhibits Cbk 1. In addition, we show that increased trehalose accumulation and increased heat resistance caused by overexpression of LRE 1 are also the result of inhibition of Cbk 1, revealing a novel control pathway for certain targets affected by PKA. The yeast genome contains a homologue of LRE 1, YDR 528 w, which we have called HLR 1 (for homologue of Lre 1). Deletion and overexpression of HLR 1 causes similar but less pronounced effects compared with LRE 1. status: publishe...|$|E
5000|$|In the mid 1990s {{researchers}} at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) at Florida State University in Tallahassee Florida improved on this basic design and created what they {{refer to as the}} “Florida Bitter.” By elongating the mounting and cooling holes there is a substantial <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stresses</b> developed <b>in</b> the system and an improvement in cooling efficiency. As the <b>stresses</b> increased <b>in</b> the original bitter plates they would flex slightly causing the small circular cooling holes to move out of alignment reducing the efficacy of the cooling system. The Florida Bitter plates will flex less due to the reduced stresses, and the elongated cooling holes will always be in partial alignment despite any flexure the discs experience. This new design allowed for a 40 percent increase in efficiency and has become the design of choice for bitter plate based resistive magnets ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} spatiotemporal {{distribution in}} a kinematic slip {{model of the}} 2004 mid-Niigata (Chuetsu) earthquake, focusing {{on the relationship between}} rupture time and stress drop. Stress drop distribution is calculated from the final slip distribution inferred from waveform inversion. There are negative stress drop regions near the edges of inferred asperities. Rupture delays were detected in the mean slip rate time functions. Combining the above distribution, we found delayed rupture within regions of negative <b>stress</b> <b>drop.</b> <b>In</b> these negative <b>stress</b> <b>drop</b> regions, rupture prop-agation is expected to arrest because a positive stress drop promotes rupture. It should be em-phasized that our results were obtained without reconstructing the dynamic faulting process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental study}} on rockbursts {{that occur in}} deep underground excavations. To begin with, the boundary conditions for excavation in deep underground engineering were analysed and elastic adaptive boundary is {{an effective way to}} minimize the boundary effect of geomechanical model test. Then, in order to simulate an elastic adaptive loading boundary, Belleville springs were used to establish this loading boundary. With the aforementioned experimental set-ups and fabrication of similarity models for test, the phenomena of strain mode rockbursts were satisfactorily reproduced in laboratory. The internal stress, strain, and convergences of the openings of the model were instrumented by subtly preembedded sensors and transducers. Test results showed that, with an initial state of high stress from both upper layers’ gravitational effects and <b>in</b> situ <b>stress</b> due to tectonic movements, the excavation brings a dramatic rise <b>in</b> the hoop <b>stress</b> and sharp <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> radial <b>stress,</b> which leads to the splitting failure of rock mass. Finally a rockburst occurred associated with the release of strain energy stored <b>in</b> highly <b>stressed</b> rock mass. <b>In</b> addition, the failure of the surrounding rock demonstrated an obvious hysteresis effect which supplies valuable guide and reference for tunnel support. Not only do these results provide a basis for further comprehensive experiments, but also the data can offer assisting aids for further theoretical study of rockbursts...|$|R
