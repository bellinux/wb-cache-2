25|$|While {{he was in}} the Nice prison, Calderone became {{convinced}} {{that he was about to}} be killed by other Sicilian inmates. Suddenly, he began screaming for a prison guard and demanded to see the head of the prison. He said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to judge Giovanni Falcone. Calderone was moved to an insane asylum for his own protection.|$|E
25|$|As a {{conservative}} Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles {{that he felt}} might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to his wife first, {{to make sure it was}} all right with her. He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.|$|E
25|$|In episode 6, Dylan calls Brenda {{while she}} is talking to Kelly and Ryan. When Kelly finds out it's Dylan on the line, she talks to him. It turns out that Dylan wants {{to try to be}} a family again with her and Sammy. However, this would mean they would have to move away from Beverly Hills. After much thought, Kelly breaks up with Ryan, as she said that she needs to try to work things out with Dylan. Ryan asks Kelly why Dylan would call Brenda's phone, not hers, if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Kelly. Fearing Brenda and Dylan were {{secretly}} back together, Kelly confronts Brenda. After hearing Brenda say that her and Dylan's relationship is platonic, Brenda and Kelly make up. Kelly decides to try to repair her relationship with Dylan, while Brenda sadly deletes his number from her cell phone. It is implied {{that there may have been}} more to the story of Brenda and Dylan's relationship that she didn't share with Kelly, as Brenda shed some tears when deleting Dylan's phone number.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the signing}} of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which {{followed}} Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Israel, multiple Israeli heads of state have visited Egypt on numerous occasions. However, Sadat's successor, Hosni Mubarak, visited Israel only once—for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in 1995—and never participated in talks on Israeli soil. In 2008, while on the Knesset speaker's podium during its memorial for Rehavam Ze'evi, Lieberman raised the issue and said, [...] "Mubarak never agreed to come here as president. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us? Let him come here. <b>He</b> doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us? <b>He</b> can go to hell." ...|$|R
500|$|While Burger's Daughter {{was still}} banned in South Africa, a copy was smuggled into Nelson Mandela's prison cell on Robben Island, {{and later a}} message was sent out {{saying that he had}} [...] "thought well of it". Gordimer said, [...] "That means more to me than any other opinion it could have gained." [...] Mandela also {{requested}} a meeting with her, and she applied several times to visit him on the Island, but was declined each time. She was, however, at the prison gates waiting for him when he was released in 1990, and she was amongst the first <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. In 2007 Gordimer sent Mandela an inscribed copy of Burger's Daughter to [...] "replace the 'imprisoned' copy", and in it she thanked him for his opinion of the book, and for [...] "untiringly leading the struggle".|$|E
500|$|Several {{people were}} interviewed for the part, {{including}} Tom Jones, Robert Goulet, and Jerry Vale. Meanwhile, Behr {{and a friend}} attended a memorabilia show at the Beverly Garland Hotel in North Hollywood, where James Darren was signing autographs. Darren had not wanted to attend the event, but had been convinced otherwise. Behr thought he was so charming that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to him about the}} role on the spot, but his friend talked him out of it as he felt that Darren would think he was insane. Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr's prompting. Darren initially rejected the role, having heard that the part was a singer. Darren's agent went back to him three times and eventually convinced him to read the script, which is when {{he fell in love with}} the character. He later called it a [...] "dream come true".|$|E
500|$|The role of Linda was {{the first}} to be cast. Noé found Paz de la Huerta after holding auditions in New York City. [...] "I met Paz and I really liked her. She had the profile for the {{character}} because she likes screaming, crying, showing herself naked—all the qualities for it." [...] Due to a desire that Linda and Oscar should be believable as siblings, Nathaniel Brown, a non-professional, was cast because of his resemblance to Huerta. Noé feared that a professional actor would be frustrated by being shown almost exclusively from behind, but he felt that Brown, an aspiring director, would find it stimulating to merely be present on the set. Auditions were held for westerners living in Japan for other Tokyo-based roles. Cyril Roy went to an audition with a friend only because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with the director, whose previous films he admired. Roy was cast as Alex, since Noé found his talkative personality suitable for the role. Noé said about Brown and Roy: ...|$|E

500|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{has been}} {{assigned}} {{to set up the}} Halloween party by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who wants {{to live up to the}} expectations set by Robert California (James Spader). Robert arrives with his son Bert (David Mazouz) and remarks that the party is more tailored to kids than adults. In response, Andy asks Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) to take over and re-tailor the party, much to Erin's chagrin. Andy also tells her that he wishes to speak with her at the end of the day. Worried that he intends to fire her, she asks Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) to help her make the party more [...] "scary" [...] and [...] "sexy", and he gives her a tape to show everyone. Gabe explains to the camera crew that the video is a Cinema of the Unsettling movie, an avant garde film genre defined by its disturbing images and absence of plot. Disgusted by the video, the office staff demand an explanation from Erin. In desperation, she shows them her idea for making the party more [...] "sexy": a card game with photos of genitalia. This only makes them more outraged, and Andy and Robert talk with Erin in his office regarding the incident. Erin admits her fears about their planned talk at the end of the day. Andy tells her what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her about: he has reached a point in his romantic relationship where his girlfriend should be able to call him at the office, and that he wanted to clear this with Erin first since she handles all calls. Erin had not even known that he was dating someone, and is shocked to hear they have been out on 31 dates so far. Erin feels dejected and leaves.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, {{the band}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour. On March 13, 1992, at the Munich, Germany show at Nachtwerk, Pearl Jam played Ten in its entirety in order midway through its set. The band would only do this again in 2016 at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, as the arena management homaged the band's tenth straight sellout concert in the city. Following the European leg, Pearl Jam did another tour of North America. Goldstone noted that the band's audience expanded, saying that unlike before, [...] "everyone came." [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening {{and there was no}} stopping it. To play in the Midwest and be selling out these 500 seat clubs. Eddie could say <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Brett, the sound guy, and they'd carry him out there on their hands. You hadn't really seen that reaction from a crowd before..." [...] When Pearl Jam came back for a second go-around in Europe the band appeared at the Pinkpop Festival and the Roskilde Festival in June 1992. The band cancelled its remaining European dates in the summer of 1992 after the Roskilde Festival due to a confrontation with security at that event as well as exhaustion from touring. Ament said, [...] "We'd been on the road over 10 months. I think there just came a point about half way through that tour it was just starting to get pretty intense. I mean just being away from home, being on the road all the time and being lonely or being depressed or whatever." [...] The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry and Ice Cube, among others.|$|E

2500|$|Demonstrating {{early on}} a {{creative}} and quirky bent, in his junior year at Princeton, Kelley submitted a paper for a political science class about John F. Kennedy's plot to kill Fidel Castro, written as a poem. For his senior thesis, he turned the Bill of Rights into a play. [...] "I made each amendment into a character", he said. [...] "The First Amendment is a loudmouth guy who won't shut up. The Second Amendment guy, all <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about was his gun collection. Then the 10th Amendment, the one where they say leave the rest for the states to decide, {{he was a guy}} with no self-esteem."

2500|$|Embittered by his double rejection, Holdridge himself {{resigned}} from the American Rally on November 5, 1952, claiming that it was being devoted to [...] "Marxist principles". He returned to California and started [...] "The Holdridge Foundation" [...] out of his home in Sherman Oaks. In 1953, he used donations to it to publish his book of political allegory, The Fables of Moronia. Later that year, he announced to reporters that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to American GI's held by the North Koreans, who had refused repatriation, {{and that he had}} written to his old classmate, then President Dwight D. Eisenhower, about it. [...] This was one of the earliest of what would soon become a Holdridge trademark event; writing a public letter to a well-known figure about a controversial issue, then calling a press conference about it.|$|E
2500|$|Dayna Klein, a Federation {{employee}} who was five months pregnant, heard the shots being fired {{and as she}} went to the door of her office, Haq fired at her abdomen, but the bullet hit her raised arm. According to Klein, Haq then moved to another section of the building and Klein, bleeding profusely, crawled to her desk and dialed 911, despite Haq's threats to kill anyone who called the police. Haq eventually returned to Klein's office and discovered her on the phone, at which point he reportedly shouted [...] "Now since you don't know how to ... listen, now you're the hostage, and I don't give a [...] if I kill you or your baby."
