Materials and Methods: Sixty-one patients with ILD underwent transthoracic lung ultrasound for assessment of the presence of B-lines and the distance between them. These findings were compared with that of chest HRCT (ground glass, reticular, nodular or <b>honey</b> <b>combing)</b> and PFT as forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2). Results: All patients had diffuse bilateral B-lines.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) and {{pulmonary}} arterial hypertension (PAH) are common complications of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Echocardiography evaluates PAH, and chest sonography detects even mild ILC as ultrasound lung comets (ULC), i. e. multiple comet-tails fanning out from the lung surface and originating from subpleural interlobular septa thickened by fibrosis. Aim: to assess ILaD and PAH by integrated cardiac and chest ultrasound in SSc. METHODS: We enrolled 30 consecutive SSc patients (age= 54 +/- 13 years, 23 females) in the Rheumatology Clinic of Pisa University. In all, we assessed systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (SPAP), from maximal velocity of tricuspid regurgitation flow, and ULC score with chest sonography (summing the number of ULC from each scanning space of anterior and posterior right and left chest, from second to fifth intercostal space). All patients underwent plasma assay for anti-topoisomerase antibodies (anti-Scl 70), and antiicentromere associated with development of pulmonary involvement. Twenty-eight patients also underwent high resolution computed tomography, HRCT (from 0 = no fibrosis to 3 = <b>honey</b> <b>combing).</b> RESULTS: ULC number - but not SPAP - was correlated to HRCT fibrosis and presence Scl- 70 antibodies. ULC number was similar in localized or diffuse forms (16 +/- 20 vs 21 +/- 19, p=ns) and was unrelated to SPAP (r= 0. 216, p=ns). CONCLUSIONS: Chest sonography assessment and ULC allow a complete, simple, radiation-free characterization of interstitial lung involvement in SSc - all in one setting and with the same instrument, same transducer and the same sonographer. In particular, ULC number is associated with HRCT evidence of lung fibrosis and presence of Scl- 70 antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Interstitial {{lung disease}} {{is the leading}} cause of {{mortality}} and morbidity in patients with scleroderma. For this reason an early diagnosis of lung involvement is warranted. The best approach to detect pulmonary disease particularly alveolitis (inflammatory NSIP) as a reversible phase is controversial. The aim of this study is estimating the advantage of HRCT as a noninvasive screening test to detect the pattern of ILD related to systemic sclerosis. Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study, 52 patients with scleroderma who referred to rheumatologic medical center from 2010 to 2011 were evaluated for ILD by the use of history, physical examination, CXR and HRCT. Finally, all the data were analyzed using SPSS 13 software. Results: HRCT was normal in 21 patients (40. 4 %), and NSIP in 19 patients (36. 5 %) and UIP in 12 patients (23. 1 %) were reported. CXR was normal in 19 (36. 5 %) and mild reticular pattern in 15 (28. 8 %), overt reticular pattern in 14 (26. 9 %) and <b>honey</b> <b>combing</b> in 4 (7. 7 %) were seen.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features of idiopathic PAP. Material and Methods: HRCT images of 35 patients (mean age: 38 ± 14 years; 54. 3 % male) with idiopathic PAP (proved by bronchoalveolar lavage or biopsy) were reviewed by two experienced pulmonary radiologist and detailed findings were reported. Results: The predominant HRCT presentation of PAP was interlobular septal thickening (ILST; 100 %) and ground glass opacities (GGOs; 91. 7 %), resulting in crazy-paving pattern (83 %). All patients had diffuse bilateral lung involvement that was symmetric in 97 %. ILST and GGO without crazy-paving were seen in 17 % and 14. 7 %, respectively. The overall extent of parenchymal involvement was 50 to 75 % in 80 % of patients. Thirty three cases (94 %) had areas of geographic sparing within the affected lung. Peripheral sparing was seen in 85. 7 % of patients, including three patterns with some overlap: costophrenic angle (80 %), apices (60 %), and subpleural (57 %) sparing.

40|$|Introduction: The {{hypersensitivity}} pneumonitis (HP) or {{extrinsic allergic alveolitis}} (EAA) is a pulmonary disease that occurs in response to inhaled organic material,or even of simple chemicals, organic and inorganic with symptoms of cough,fever,chills,wheezing and shortness of breath. The prevalence and incidence of HP appear to vary considerably depending upon case definitions, intensity of exposure to inciting antigens, season, geographical conditions,proximity to certain industries, and host risk factors. It has been divided into three forms,acute,subacute and chronic depending on onset of symptoms,exposure of inciting agent and radiological and histopathological findings and choice of treatment. Case: 45 year old female,hypertensive. Admitted with complain of shortness of breath,cough for 2 weeks and fever for 3 days. Symptoms started after fumigation. No prior history of allergies,pets at home. On examination there O 2 sats= 95 % on RA. CXR showed bilateral peribronchial infiltrates. HRCT done which showed randomly distributed patchy areas of consolidation and ground glass opacification predominantly in bilateral lower lobes with preserved lung volume. With the suspicion of {{hypersensitivity pneumonitis}} she was started on oral prednisolone and later discharged home. Patient was noncomplaint to prednisolone. She got re-admitted after few months with worsening symtoms. Her RA sats were 85 %. However CXR showed no new change. Bronchoscopy done which showed normal airways,BAL was negative for any microbiological etiology. ANA profile was inconclusive. She was treated with prednisolone. CT chest with contrast showed improvement in patchy consolidation and ground glass opacification. PFT showed nonspecific airway disease. To get a diagnosis,surgical lung biopsy was done,tissue afb and fungus came out to be negative. Histopathology revealed heterogenicity with relatively preserved lung parenchyma with interstitial expansion due to fibrosis,acute on chronic inflammatory cells along with plasma cells and some evidence of <b>honey</b> <b>combing.</b> subpleural fibrosis seen. Patient was continued on steroids and clinical improvement seen,long term home oxygen therapy initiated along with pulmonary rehabilitation. Patient was later discharged to the outpatient service. Conclusion: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) is a syndrome caused by repeated inhalation of specific antigens from occupational or environmental exposure in sensitized individuals. Continous exposure to the anigen can led to fibrosis which can be irreversible and resistant to any treatment.

40|$|In {{systemic}} sclerosis (SSc), interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) and engagement of the vascular system lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate, in a consecutively included cohort of SSc (limited and diffuse) patients (n = 33), the T cell cytokine profile driving the disease in ILD and to explore the role of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) and its inhibitor: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP- 1) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading process leading to fibrous scarring and <b>honey</b> <b>combing.</b> Moreover, to characterize the role of nitric oxide (NO) in vascular engagement. Peripheral arterial changes cause Raynaud’s phenomenon and digital ulcers. Nitric oxide (NO) a main inducer of vasodilation is produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in response to changes in blood flow or by inflammatory cytokine inducible (i) NOS. In the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) NO activates guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP, causing relaxation. We showed elevated plasma nitrate, a degradation product of NO, and increased urinary excretion of nitrate and cGMP. Plasma nitrate correlated with elevated levels of endothelial adhesion molecules: endothelial (E) selectin and vascular adhesion molecule 1, indicating that the activated endothelium {{is the site of}} NO synthesis by iNOS. Endothelial staining for E-selectin and the finding of iNOS and eNOS in SSc skin biopsies supported this notion. In SSc increased vascular stiffness may limit the NO vasodilatory effects. We found normal endothelium-dependent (i. e. flow mediated (FMD%)) and endothelium-independent (i. e. nitroglycerin-induced (NTG%)) vasodilation in the brachial artery. Radial arterial wall stiffness measured as maximum increase in pulse pressure (dP/dtmax) was increased. FMD% and especially NTG% correlated negatively and dP/dtmax positively to measures of endothelial inflammation: plasma- nitrate and adhesion molecule levels. Thus inflammatory vascular wall changes may interfere with dilation as may the presence of nitrate tolerance. We found elevated alveolar MMP- 9 in both its pro- and active form in ILD. The levels correlated to decline in lung capacity, pointing at a causal relation. We suggest that neutrophils secrete MMP- 9, which may degrade collagen IV, (the main constituent of basal membranes), collagen V, gelatins, proteoglycans and elastin. MMP- 9 activity is partly regulated by the binding of pro- and active form to TIMP- 1. Alveolar TIMP- 1, which even stimulates fibroblast ECM synthesis, was increased independent of ILD. The inflammatory process in ILD is orchestrated by activated T helper (h) lymphocytes. We found a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 reaction in SSc alveolar T cells expressing messenger for interferon gamma (Th 1), IL- 6 and IL- 10 (both Th 2). No particular cytokine mRNA profile distinguished alveolar T cells in ILD. Neutrophils invaded the bronchial epithelium, which seemed otherwise inert as levels of inflammatory cytokine sensitive transcription factors and their nuclear translocation tended to be low. The neutrophil recruitment pathway is uncertain as chemoattractants and endothelial adhesion molecules were normally expressed. In conclusion, MMP- 9 probably causes degradation of lung tissue in ILD and may represent a future therapeutic target. Alveolar T cells show a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine profile independent of ILD. Neutrophils invade the bronchial epithelium. Activated endothelium produces increased amounts of NO and adhesion molecules and the level of activation influences brachial arterial FMD% and NTG% and radial arterial compliance. Nitrate tolerance may be present...|$|E
