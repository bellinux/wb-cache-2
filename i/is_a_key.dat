These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation.|$|E
5|$|Lyotropic mesophases are {{analyzed}} {{in a similar}} fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of mesogen in order to analyze that impact.|$|E

5|$|Phosphorylation: Ser118 of fsTnI, {{equivalent}} to Ser150 in cTnI, was reported as a phosphorylation substrate of AMPK. As AMPK <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> regulator of cellular energetics, phosphorylation of this site may provide an adaptive mechanism during energy deprivation in both skeletal and cardiac muscles.|$|E

5|$|A {{maximum of}} three Nobel laureates and two {{different}} works may be {{selected for the}} Nobel Prize in Physics. Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is long and rigorous. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> reason why it has grown in importance {{over the years to}} become the most important prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|As a drought-deciduous {{succulent}} tree, B. rupestris adapts {{readily to}} cultivation and is tolerant {{of a range}} of soils and temperatures. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets—also known as bottletree scrub—of the Queensland Brigalow Belt. Remnant trees are often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees.|$|E

5|$|As {{interactions}} between proteins are reversible, and depend {{heavily on the}} availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the {{interactions between}} specific proteins <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> element in effective pain management.|$|E

The town also has important links to Cambridge and the A14 via the B1050 to Bar Hill. The town centre traffic was bypassed in 1986, with the disused route of the former St Ives extension of the Great Eastern Railway being used to build the A141 to March and Guyhirn.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|Common ways to {{implement}} the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, and emphasizing 'good citizenship' and decision-making by young people in an age-appropriate manner. Weekly meetings often take place in local centres known as Scout dens. Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> element. Primary activities include camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports.|$|E

5|$|Copper is {{essential}} to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.|$|E
5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the gravitational force {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be the only source of gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E
