500|$|Among {{the major}} {{concerns}} were leaks; during the {{construction on the}} Romerike Tunnel, there was a one-year delay and severe cost overruns due to improper construction methods. One of the main aims in the Skaugum Tunnel project was therefore to avoid similar leaks, and the criteria were set to [...] per minute per [...] This was achieved by using sufficient time for the pre-injection, as well as continuous pregrouting through the entire tunnel. However, water still dripped into the tunnel, which caused several types of damage. In some places, it dripped onto the track causing it to rust, while in other places it fell onto electrical equipment. There were also issues with water running down the walls and collecting in the cable conduit, and the limestone in the water mixing with the ballast. By 2011, the emergency lighting system had to be replaced {{because of the high}} humidity. The National Rail Administration has stated that savings made by the specifications in the water and frost protection methods have caused high maintenance costs because the small leaks which are present <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> harm. In addition, areas with leaks suffer from icing. This has been part of a trend where older tunnels are nearly maintenance-free, while newer tunnels have incurred high maintenance costs.|$|E
