50|$|<b>Daggerboards</b> {{come in all}} {{different}} shapes and sizes, some curved or s- shaped. Curved <b>daggerboards</b> started to appear thirty to forty years ago. The first prototype was made in 1985 by Ian Farrier. The benefits of vertical lift generated by curved <b>daggerboards</b> are nominal. When actually sailing, curved <b>daggerboards</b> - {{not to be confused}} with hydrofoils - do not make a drastic change.|$|R
5000|$|The {{characteristic}} which differentiates <b>daggerboards</b> {{from other}} centerboards and swingkeels is that <b>daggerboards</b> are easily removable, {{even when the}} boat is under way. Centerboards and swingkeels, common alternatives to fixed keels, can pivot up and down but are fixed to the hull. The freedom of motion of dagger- and centerboards allows them to swing or slide up into the hull of the boat, which is advantageous when sailing in shallow waters. The pivoting centerboard or swingkeel can swing up when it strikes an object which helps prevents the sort of damage to which fixed keels or <b>daggerboards</b> are subject. <b>Daggerboards</b> can be raised and lowered as needed but will generally be damaged if not retracted before impact with the bottom or with floating objects.|$|R

2500|$|Development classes: Most dinghy {{classes have}} a fairly fixed layout of sails and hull design, and changes are very infrequent. However, some classes can compete and sail with less rigid {{definitions}} and measurements. This encourages experiment which often leads to innovation in techniques and construction. Examples are the International 14, National 12, the 18ft Skiff, the Puddle Duck Racer and the Moth. The International Moth is worth noting because of its use of lifting foils on the rudder and <b>daggerboard.</b> These generate enough lift to push the hull above the water, significantly reducing friction and allowing speeds in excess of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Most small monohull sailboats can {{normally}} be righted by standing or pulling {{down on the}} centreboard, <b>daggerboard</b> (or bilgeboard in a [...] ) to lift the mast clear of the water. Depending {{on the design of}} the hull, the boat's righting moment will normally take effect once the mast is around 30 degrees from horizontal and help pull the boat vertical. Righting a catamaran that is lying on its side involves using a righting line fed over the upper hull. The crew stands on the lower hull and pulls back on the righting line. In small catamarans such as the Hobie 16 it is imperative that at least one crew member assumes this task as soon as possible as there is a chance that the boat will turtle and then become extremely difficult to recover without assistance. Some monohulls and catamarans [...] use a small flotation device mounted {{at the tip of the}} mast or mainsail to ensure that the craft cannot assume an inverted position, or at least that a fully inverted position is not stable (i.e. it would come to a position where the mast is lying on the surface of the water, which would be preferable to fully inverted).|$|E
50|$|A <b>daggerboard</b> is a {{retractable}} centreboard used {{by various}} sailing craft. While {{other types of}} centreboard may pivot to retract, a <b>daggerboard</b> slides in a casing. The shape of the <b>daggerboard</b> converts the forward motion into a windward lift, countering the leeward push of the sail. The theoretical centre of lateral resistance is on {{the trailing edge of}} the <b>daggerboard.</b>|$|E

50|$|The F20 is a {{catamaran}} {{similar in}} design to Nacra's former 20 foot catamaran, {{however it is}} made out of carbon fiber and uses curved <b>daggerboards</b> as hydrofoils.|$|R
50|$|Its draft {{with the}} <b>daggerboard</b> and rudder down is 5 ft. Its draft with the <b>daggerboard</b> and rudder raised is 1 ft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>daggerboard</b> (or any keel) is to balance {{the force of the}} wind on the sails. Without a <b>daggerboard</b> or keel, a {{sailboat}} could not sail up-wind and would simply be blown sideways.|$|E
5000|$|Daggerboards {{are often}} made of wood; {{the problem with}} wood is that wood rots over time. Alternate {{materials}} for daggerboards are metal (aluminum/steel) and fiberglass. A <b>daggerboard</b> boat can be costly to manufacture. If not well-made, the <b>daggerboard</b> will transfer vibrations from the trunk through the hull.|$|E
5000|$|Since bulb keels {{work best}} on long, thin keels or <b>daggerboards,</b> they are {{generally}} not used on sailboats intended for shallow waters, but are most often found on offshore racing craft. <b>Daggerboards</b> built like bulb keels are {{often referred to as}} [...] "lifting keels", and they can be retracted into the boat to reduce the draft, and to allow the boat to be loaded onto a trailer. Lifting keels {{are also more likely to}} be found on craft built for speed, as a winch or a set of pulleys is required to provide purchase to lift the heavy keel.|$|R
50|$|The Dart 16 is {{a modern}} beach {{catamaran}} that is fast, affordable, and seaworthy.Like most Dart catamarans except for the Dart 20 EXP it lacks the main boom, as well as <b>daggerboards,</b> spreaders, and complicated trimming mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|ICAP Leopard 3 is a 30m IRC maxi yacht {{owned and}} skippered by Helical Bar plc CEO Michael Slade, who has owned maxi yachts for over 22 years. She {{features}} a canting keel, water ballast and twin <b>daggerboards</b> amidships.|$|R
50|$|Leeboards and centerboards, used to {{stabilize}} the junk and to improve its capability to sail upwind, are documented from a 759 AD book by Li Chuan. The innovation was adopted by Portuguese and Dutch ships around 1570. Junks often employ a <b>daggerboard</b> that is forward on the hull which allows the center section of the hull {{to be free of}} the <b>daggerboard</b> trunk allowing larger cargo compartments. Because the <b>daggerboard</b> is located so far forward, the junk must use a balanced rudder to counteract the imbalance of lateral resistance.|$|E

50|$|The Flying Phantom is a one-design {{catamaran}} {{capable of}} planing {{above the surface}} of the water due to curved <b>daggerboards</b> acting as hydrofoils. It is built by Phantom International, and is the boat used in the Red Bull Foiling Generation race series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{series was}} revived as heats of nine two-day events in eight venues in the {{run up to}} the 2017 America's Cup. The races used a single boat design, known as AC45f, {{which was based on}} AC45 with added {{hydrofoil}} <b>daggerboards</b> and rudders.|$|R
5000|$|The boat is {{distinctly}} {{recognized for}} its asymmetric [...] "banana" [...] shaped hulls, {{designed to work}} {{without the need for}} <b>daggerboards</b> so the catamaran could be run up the beach without worry. The rudders kick up automatically by lifting up on the tiller crossbar.|$|R

50|$|During a storm, daggerboards {{can help}} reduce the {{tendency}} of a small boat to tip over ("breach") due to waves. A catamaran in a storm would lift the leeward hull <b>daggerboard</b> and fully extend the upwind <b>daggerboard.</b> If there is no wind and an outboard motor is being used, lifting the daggerboards will ensure the least drag.|$|E

50|$|The Hobie Wildcat was {{introduced}} in 2009. Same as the Tiger, it is a Formula 18 boat and has the same measurements, weight, and sail area.The boat is optimized for racing, with wave-piercing bows, a flat bottom in the stern for better planing, and thin <b>daggerboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Multihull sailboats {{can also}} employ {{hydrofoils}} only to assist performance. Just as <b>daggerboards</b> and rudders are foils that enhance {{the control of}} a boat, assisting hydrofoils provide lift to the hull to reduce the wetted area without actually lifting the boat {{completely out of the}} water.|$|R
5000|$|... 1975 In the mid-70s two German A-Cat sailors, Bernd Breymann und Klaus Enzmann, {{were unhappy}} with the {{complicated}} transport and assembly of their boats. Klaus Enzmann build a first prototype without <b>daggerboards</b> or rudders, similar to the Spanish [...] "Patin-Vela", but {{with many of the}} successful details of the later boats.|$|R
50|$|Generally daggerboards {{are used}} on smaller rigs such as 10 to 40 feet for racing {{but there is}} a large number of custom and semi-custom {{catamaran}} builders who offer daggerboards as an option. <b>Daggerboard</b> rigs may be faster than fixed keels because fixed keels have so much hydrodynamic drag by the shape. Some makes which utilize a <b>daggerboard</b> design are: The Mirror Dinghy, Laser, Vanguard 15.|$|E
50|$|The rudder and <b>daggerboard</b> may be {{made from}} plywood or a {{composite}} of foam, glass fibre, and epoxy.|$|E
50|$|The hull {{design is}} a dual chine hull, with little freeboard. The boat {{incorporates}} an unconventional raking <b>daggerboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Hobie Pacific {{is based}} on the Hobie Tiger, but has skegs instead of <b>daggerboards,</b> a smaller rig, and no boom. The boat is {{intended}} to be easier to handle than a F18 boat, and targeted at sailing schools. Sail area is 211 sq ft, the optional spinnaker is 200 sq ft.|$|R
50|$|With the canting keel {{handling}} the ballast functions, lateral resistance and steering {{can be managed}} separately with a foil (or pair of foils, either {{on each side or}} fore and aft), such as <b>daggerboards.</b> This allows for much quicker maneuverability than traditional keelboats, with about half the weight usually required for ballast.|$|R
50|$|To {{make them}} easy to load and {{transport}} by trailer, most {{boats in the}} class have swing keel centreboards or <b>daggerboards.</b> Due to the limitations of trailer capacity, towing vehicle size and weight, as well as highway width limitations, most trailer sailboats are limited in size to about 22 to 26 ft in length.|$|R
