The plant comes up from a weedy-looking basal rosette of sharply lobed leaves. It produces long inflorescences hung with small yellow or pink bell-shaped flowers which dry and become light and papery. The <b>dry</b> <b>hanging</b> flowers make a rustling sound when a breeze comes through, giving the whispering bells its common name. The dry flower also contains a fruit about a centimeter wide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{current study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine the optimal wash-drying regimen {{and the effects of}} different washing procedures on the efficacy, and durability of four brands of newly introduced long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) under tropical conditions. Methods In the current study, the following four LLINs were tested: Olyset ®, PermaNet ® 2. 0, BASF ® and TNT ®. Nets were divided into three sets; one set was washed by hand rubbing and air-dried either hanging or spread on the ground in direct sunlight or hanging or spread on the ground under the shade. A second set was washed using the WHO protocol (machine) and the third set was washed by beating the nets on rocks. The biological activities of the nets were assessed by a three-minute bioassay cone test and the residual insecticide contents were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure. Results Nets that were <b>dried</b> <b>hanging</b> under the shade retained more insecticide, 62. 5 % and recorded higher mortality compared to nets which were dried lying on the ground in direct sunlight 58. 8 %, nets dried under the shade spread on the ground 56. 3 %, and 57. 8 % for nets <b>dried</b> <b>hanging</b> in direct sunlight. It was also observed that nets washed by the standard WHO protocol, retained more insecticide and were more effective in killing mosquitoes compared to nets washed by local methods of hand rubbing and beating on rocks. There were significant differences between drying regimens (p ® and TNT {{there were no significant differences}} observed between the four drying regimens (p = 0. 7944 and 0. 4703) respectively). For BASF and Olyset, the differences were significant (p 0. 0001). Conclusion The results of this study suggest that washing and drying regimen influence the insecticidal activity of LLINs. The standard WHOPES washing protocol underestimates the amount of insecticide washed from LLINs compared to the abrasive washing procedures that are used in the field. This suggests that there is need to educate net users to adopt a more gentle washing procedure while handling LLINs. The education should accompany net distribution campaigns. </p...|$|R

The western side of the Parana northward ceases to be inhabited; and hence the Indians sometimes come down thus far, and waylay travellers. The nature of the country also favours this, for instead of a grassy plain, there is an open woodland, composed of low prickly mimosas.

Finding time to hang a futon may also be difficult {{during the rainy season}} in Japan, since there are few sunny days and there are frequent and sudden periods of rain so a futon dryer can fulfill the function of keeping the futon dry and keeping the level of mites living in the futon down without needing to hang it out.|$|R
5000|$|Using a <b>dried</b> gourd <b>hanging</b> {{from the}} rafters, Dürer memorializes Jerome's courage, {{in the face}} of long brewing {{philological}} controversy with St. Augustine in his preference for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון (qiyqayown) encountered only this once, in the Book of Jonah. The Old Testament text closes abruptly (...) with an epistolary warning based on the emblematic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of Aesop's fables such as The Gourd and the Palm-tree. Jerome elected to use Hedera (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin cucurbita from which the related English plant name cucumber is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ [...] "I am the Vine you are the branches". In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by Dürer's time.|$|R

40|$|Household energy {{consumption}} {{accounts for the}} largest proportion for the emissions of greenhouse gas emissions. These gases are the main contributors to global warming. World leaders have set a goal to limit warming {{to a maximum of}} 2 ° C. This has been identified as the safe limit to ensure stability of life on the planet. One of the dilemmas on {{energy consumption}} relates to the 1. 3 billion people who have no access to energy in their households. One of the sustainable development goals from the UN is to cover the access to “renewable energy for all”. But, to do so, renewable energies have a long road ahead with many barriers. At the current rates of consumption we are already experiencing changes in the climate. To be able to minimize the emissions of these gases, there should be measures to encourage sustainable practices. Colombia, although contributing only 0. 35 % of the global CO 2 emissions, is a country with stable economic growth, which is increasing the amount of people in the middle income strata. This makes Colombia a country that will continue increasing its production, and therefore its greenhouse gas emissions. This thesis contributes in the understanding of how everyday practices affect consumption of energy, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions. To do so, it analyses the drying practice in the city of Barranquilla, within a Social Practice Theory approach. The theory of practice is a type of theory of culture. It explains actions in everyday life in terms of the dynamic of its elements: embodied knowledge and competences; the embedded knowledge of the material world; and the symbolic structures of social meanings. Social practice theory is able to analyze behaviors, not from an individual perspective, but by analyzing the practice itself. It considers the individual just a carrier of the practice. This thesis explains how a sustainable <b>drying</b> practice, <b>hanging</b> clothes to <b>dry,</b> is being replaced by an appliance that emits greenhouse gases: the tumble dryer. The research was done with a qualitative method, where 21 interviews were conducted in order to gain an understanding of drying practice in Barranquilla.

40|$|The southeastern part of Nigeria {{is one of}} {{the major}} hotspot of useful plant genetic resources. These endemic species are {{associated}} with a rich indigenous knowledge and cultural diversity in relation to their use and conservation. Sphenostylis stenocarpa (ex. A. Rich.) Harms., (African Yam Bean (AYB), is one such crop within the family of Fabaceae. Its nutritional and eco-friendly characteristics have value in ameliorating malnutrition, hidden hunger and environmental degradation inherent in resource-poor rural and semi-rural communities throughout Africa. However, lack of information from the custodians of this crop is limiting its sustainable development. Ethnobotanical survey on the diversity, uses, and constraints limiting the cultivation and use of the crop in South-eastern Nigeria are documented. Five-hundred respondents were randomly selected and data collected through oral interviews and focused group discussion (FGD). Semi-structured questionnaires (SSQ) were also used to elicit information from a spectrum of AYB users comprising community leaders, farmers, market women and consumers in these states. Results showed that the majority of the respondents lacked formal education and were of age group of 40 - 50 years while, female gender-dominated with limited access to land and extension officers. Seed coat colour largely determined utilization. Long cooking time, requirement for staking materials, aging of farmers and low market demand were among the major constraints limiting further cultivation and utilization of AYB. In-situ conservation is made by <b>hanging</b> <b>dried</b> fruits by the fireside, beside the house, storing in earthenware, calabash gourds, cans and bottles.

40|$|The Clay-with-flints has a patchy, but extensive, outcrop in {{southern}} England {{south of the}} limit of the Anglian ice sheets, and in northern France where it {{is referred to as}} the Argiles à silex. Since early Victorian times, when it was recognised that its principal components were clay and unworn flints, the deposit has been presumed to have been derived from the dissolution of large volumes of chalk. It was also recognised, however, that the clay contents of typical chalks were too low to have produced the clay-flint ratios of much of the Clay-with-flints. The additional clay, together with sand that could not have been derived from the Chalk Group, was therefore presumed to be of later origin. The solution hypothesis remained largely undisputed until the 20 th Century, even though there is no published example of an intermediate stage in the process in the form of a layer of partially dissolved chalk. The age of formation of the Clay-with-flints has long been the subject of dispute, partly because of the absence of palaeontological evidence, and partly because the name has been applied to a wide variety of lithologies including reworked and remobilised materials. Suggested ages range from Palaeocene in parts of northern France to Pleistocene in the London Basin. In east Devon and west Dorset, beds of partially dissolved in situ Upper Greensand and Chalk tens of metres thick are overlain by Clay-with-flints. They confirm the importance of large-scale solution as a contributing factor in the formation of the deposit in south-west England. The partially dissolved layers and the Clay-with-flints were folded and faulted in the Miocene, and they can be seen to pre-date Pleistocene erosional features including <b>hanging</b> <b>dry</b> valleys and frost-wedge pipes.

Others found three 7th Cavalry horses; letters written to and by 7th Cavalry personnel; officers’ clothing; a large amount of cash; jewelry; government-issued guns and ammunition.|$|R
