[...] In the 24-hour period ending {{at the dawn}} of 24 November, seven patients died, three of which were health workers. [...] Two of these were nurses who did not work in the isolation ward. [...] The thought of infections being passed to health workers who did not directly care for Ebola patients panicked many and the nurses mutinied. [...] The <b>day-shift</b> did not go to work; instead 400 health workers, nearly the entire staff of St. Mary's, gathered in the assembly hall of the nursing school. [...] When Lukwiya rushed down to ask what they wanted, at least one nurse yelled that the hospital should be closed. [...] Lukwiya silenced the nurses, most of whom he had trained himself, by stating that if the hospital closed he would leave Gulu and never return.

40|$|Background: Caring for {{a person}} with {{dementia}} can be physically and emotionally demanding, with many long-term care facility staff experiencing increased levels of stress and burnout. Massage {{has been shown to}} be one way in which nurses’ stress can be reduced. However, no research has been conducted to explore its effectiveness for care staff working with older people with dementia in long-term care facilities. Methods: This was a pilot, parallel group, randomized controlled trial aimed at exploring feasibility for a larger randomized controlled trial. Nineteen staff, providing direct care to residents with dementia and regularly working ≥ two <b>day-shifts</b> a week, from one long-term care facility in Queensland (Australia), were randomized into either a foot massage intervention (n= 9) or a silent resting control (n= 10). Each respective session lasted for 10 -min, and participants could receive up to three sessions a week, during their allocated shift, over four-weeks. At pre- and post-intervention, participants were assessed on self-report outcome measures that rated mood state and experiences of working with people with dementia. Immediately before and after each intervention/control session, participants had their blood pressure and anxiety measured. An Intention To Treat framework was applied to the analyses. Individual qualitative interviews were also undertaken to explore participants’ perceptions of the intervention. Results: The results indicate the feasibility of undertaking such a study in terms of: recruitment; the intervention; timing of intervention; and completion rates. A change in the intervention indicated the importance of a quiet, restful environment when undertaking a relaxation intervention. For the psychological measures, although there were trends indicating improvement in mood there was no significant difference between groups when comparing their pre- and post- scores. There were significant differences between groups for diastolic blood pressure (p= 0. 04, partial η 2 = 0. 22) and anxiety (p= 0. 02, partial η 2 = 0. 31), with the foot massage group experiencing greatest decreases immediately after the session. The qualitative interviews suggest the foot massage was well tolerated and although taking staff away from their work resulted in some participants feeling guilty about taking time out, a 10 -min foot massage was feasible during a working shift. Conclusions: This pilot trial provides data to support the feasibility of the study in terms of recruitment and consent, the intervention and completion rates. Although the outcome data should be treated with caution, the pilot demonstrated the foot massage intervention showed trends in improved mood, reduced anxiety and lower blood pressure in long-term care staff working with older people with dementia. A larger study is needed to build on these promising, but preliminary, findings. Griffith Health, School of Nursing and MidwiferyFull Tex...|$|R

The original plan by Mr.Davies, was to put two stopping dams in solid ground, and would allow for easy transportation of materials at a distance of less than 500 yards from the pit bottom. The revised plan Mr.Cocks ordered meant erecting three such dams in unstable ground, also providing air to the fire, and requiring a travelling distance of 1,300 yards for essential tools and equipment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{putative}} effect of type of shift and its interaction with leisure-time physical activity on cardiovascular risk factors in truck drivers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 57 male truck drivers {{working at a}} transportation company, of whom 31 worked irregular shifts and 26 worked on the <b>day-shift.</b> Participants recorded their physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire along with measurements of blood pressure, body mass index and waist-hip ratio. Participants also provided a fasting blood sample for analysis of lipid-related outcomes. Data were analyzed using a factorial model which was covariate-controlled for age, smoking, work demand, control at work and social support. RESULTS: Most of the irregular-shift and <b>day-shift</b> workers worked more than 8 hours per day (67. 7 % and 73. 1 %, respectively). The mean duration of experience working the irregular schedule was 15. 7 years. <b>Day-shift</b> workers had never engaged in irregular-shift work and had been working as a truck driver for 10. 8 years on average. The irregular-shift drivers had lower work demand but less control compared to <b>day-shift</b> drivers (p < 0. 05). Moderately-active irregular-shift workers had higher systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (143. 7 and 93. 2 mmHg, respectively) than moderately-active <b>day-shift</b> workers (116 and 73. 3 mmHg, respectively) (p < 0. 05) as well as higher total cholesterol concentrations (232. 1 and 145 mg/dl, respectively) (p = 0. 01).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze {{individual}} cortisol levels {{in relation to}} work conditions, sleep, and health parameters among truck drivers working day shifts (n = 21) compared to those working irregular shifts (n = 21). A total of 42 male truck drivers (39. 8 (+/-) 6. 2 yrs) completed questionnaires about sociodemographics, job content, work environment, health, and lifestyle. Rest-activity profiles were measured using actigraphy, and cardiovascular blood parameters were collected. Salivary cortisol samples were obtained: (i) at waking time, (ii) 30 ?min after waking, and (iii) at bedtime, during both one workday and one day off from work. Irregular-shift workers, compared to <b>day-shift</b> workers, showed significantly higher waist-hip ratio, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, tiredness after work, years working as a driver, truck vibration, and less job demand (p <. 05). High cortisol levels in irregular-shift workers were correlated with certain stressors, such as short sleep duration and low job satisfaction, and to metabolic parameters, such as total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), VLDL, and triglycerides. <b>Day-shift</b> workers had higher cortisol levels collected 30 ?min after waking (p =. 03) and a higher cortisol awakening response (CAR; p =. 02) during workdays compared to off days. Irregular-shift workers had higher cortisol levels on their off days compared to <b>day-shift</b> workers (p =. 03). In conclusion, for the <b>day-shift</b> workers, a higher cortisol response was observed on workdays compared to off days. Although no direct comparisons could be made between groups for work days, on off days the irregular-shift workers had higher cortisol levels compared to <b>day-shift</b> workers, suggesting a prolonged stress response in the irregular-shift group. In addition, cortisol levels were correlated with stressors and metabolic parameters.

40|$|Purpose: The study {{investigated}} {{the number of days}} off nurses working night shifts need to recover their sleep quality to the level of daytime workers during their days off. Methodology: This study included 30 <b>day-shift</b> nurses and 32 night-shift nurses. It was conducted as a randomized clinical trial in the medical and surgical wards of a medical center in northern Taiwan in May and June 2010 using sleep diaries and sleep parameters collected by actigraphy on different workdays and days off. Results: On workdays, the night-shift group had significantly less total sleep time (TST) on Day 5 and significantly lower sleep efficiency (SE) on Day 3 than the <b>day-shift</b> group. TSTs of the two groups on days off were higher than those on workdays. On the fourth consecutive day off, higher TST, a decrease in wake after sleep onset, and an increase in SE suggests that the night-shift group had recovered their sleep quality {{to the level of the}} <b>day-shift</b> group on their days off.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference in the level of fatigue induced by high-speed maritime craft operation between the day- and night-shift officers. The demographic and work-related factors that contribute to fatigue were also explored. A total of 93 high-speed maritime craft officers participated in the survey, of whom 35 worked a day shift (Mean age= 48. 3 years) and 58 worked a night shift (Mean age= 45. 8 years). Fatigue experience was measured with the Chinese version of the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory (SOFI-C) at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the work shift. Information on age, work experience, perceived voyage difficulty and duty schedule was obtained. The study found that the night-shift officers seemed to manifest an overall higher level of perceived fatigue than the <b>day-shift</b> officers, while the <b>day-shift</b> officers demonstrated a fatigue carry-over effect across the two workdays. Besides the shift pattern, age, experience in operating high-speed maritime craft and perceived voyage difficulty were the significant factors contributing to the officers’ fatigue experience. The finding that the fatigue experience associated with high-speed maritime craft operation has a rapid and accumulative nature suggests that different occupational safety and health guidelines should be devised for these two groups of officers.

40|$|Abstract Background Light {{and dark}} {{patterns}} {{are the major}} synchronizer of circadian rhythms to the 24 -hour solar day. Disruption of circadian rhythms {{has been associated with}} a variety of maladies. Ecological studies of human exposures to light are virtually nonexistent, however, making it difficult to determine if, in fact, light-induced circadian disruption directly affects human health. Methods A newly developed field measurement device recorded circadian light exposures and activity from <b>day-shift</b> and rotating-shift nurses. Circadian disruption defined in terms of behavioral entrainment was quantified for these two groups using phasor analyses of the circular cross-correlations between light exposure and activity. Circadian disruption also was determined for rats subjected to a consistent 12 -hour light/ 12 -hour dark pattern (12 L: 12 D) and ones subjected to a "jet-lagged" schedule. Results <b>Day-shift</b> nurses and rats exposed to the consistent light-dark pattern exhibited pronounced similarities in their circular cross-correlation functions and 24 -hour phasor representations except for an approximate 12 -hour phase difference between species. The phase difference reflects the diurnal versus nocturnal behavior of humans versus rodents. Phase differences within species likely reflect chronotype differences among individuals. Rotating-shift nurses and rats subjected to the "jet-lagged" schedule exhibited significant reductions in phasor magnitudes compared to the <b>day-shift</b> nurses and the 12 L: 12 D rats. The reductions in the 24 -hour phasor magnitudes indicate a loss of behavioral entrainment compared to the nurses and the rats with regular light-dark exposure patterns. Conclusion This paper provides a quantitative foundation for systematically studying the impact of light-induced circadian disruption in humans and in animal models. Ecological light and activity data are needed to develop the essential insights into circadian entrainment/disruption actually experienced by modern people. These data can now be obtained and analyzed to reveal the interrelationship between actual light exposures and markers of circadian rhythm such as rest-activity patterns, core body temperature, and melatonin synthesis. Moreover, it should now be possible to bridge ecological studies of circadian disruption in humans to parametric studies of the relationships between circadian disruption and health outcomes using animal models. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Police {{officers}} face many stressors {{that may}} negatively impact sleep quality. This study compares subjective sleep quality in police officers {{with that in}} control subjects not involved in police or emergency services. We {{examined the effects of}} critical incident exposure (trauma exposure) and routine (nontraumatic) work environ-ment stressors on sleep quality after controlling for the effects of work shift schedule. Methods: Subjective sleep disturbances were measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in police officers (variable-shift workers, N 551; stable <b>day-shift</b> workers, N 182) and peer-nominated comparison subjects (variable-shift workers, N 98; stable <b>day-shift</b> workers, N 232). The main predictor variables were 1) duty-related critical incident exposure to on-line policing and 2) work environment stress related to routine administrative and organizational aspects of police work. Results: Police officers on both variable and stable day shifts reported significantly worse sleep quality and less average sleep time than the two corresponding control groups. Within police officers, cumulative critical incident exposure was associated with nightmares but only weakly associated with poor global sleep quality. In contrast, the stress from officers ’ general work environment was strongly associated with poor global sleep quality. Sleep disturbances were strongly associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms and general psychopathology. Conclusions: A large percentage of police officers report disturbances in subjective sleep quality. Although the life-threatening aspects of police work are related to nightmares, the routine stressors of police service seem to most affect global sleep quality in these subjects. These findings may have implications for health and occupational performance. Key words: stress, psychological, sleep disorders, stress disorders, posttraumatic...|$|E

40|$|Both time of {{awakening}} {{and stress}} {{are thought to}} influence {{the magnitude of the}} cortisol awakening response (CAR), but the relative importance of these factors is unclear. This study assessed these influences in a combined within and between-subject design. Data were collected from 32 men and women working as station staff in the London underground railway system in three conditions: earlyshift days, <b>day-shift</b> days, and control days. Saliva samples were obtained on waking, 30 and 60 min later, together with measures of concurrent subjective stress, sleep quality the night before, and accumulated stress {{at the end of the}} day. Participants woke up more than 3. 5 h earlier on average on early-shift than <b>day-shift</b> or control days, and cortisol levels on waking were lower in the early-shift condition. The CAR (assessed both with increases from waking to 30 min and with area under the curve measures) was greater on early-shift days. However, respondents were more stressed over the hour after waking and reported more sleep disturbance on early-shift days; when these factors were taken into account, the difference in CAR related to experimental condition was no longer significant. Comparisons were also made between individuals who started their day-shifts in the morning and afternoon. The morning shift group woke an average of 2 h earlier than did the afternoon shift group, but did not differ on stress, sleep quality, or CAR. Stress assessed retrospectively at the end of the day was not associated with the CAR. We conclude that early waking, stress early in the day, and sleep disturbance often coincide, but need to be distinguished in order accurately to interpret differences in CAR magnitude...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{two-phase}} constructive heuristic method for generating an acceptable nurse schedule {{at the beginning}} of each month under real conditions. In the first phase, a schedule for the evening- and night-shift is determined according to the series of heuristic rules. In order to satisfy the required total skill levels for each shift, skilled nurses are assigned first, then the other nurses, for both evening- and night-shifts. In the second phase, given the evening- and night-shifts, the schedule for <b>day-shift</b> is determined in a similar way. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to the 3 -shift nurse scheduling problems with real data. The schedules obtained by the proposed method have acceptable quality and the computation time for solving an example is less than 1 second. Keywords: nurse scheduling, heuristic approach, skill level, standard shift pattern. ...|$|E
