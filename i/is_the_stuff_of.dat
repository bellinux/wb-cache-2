Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all".

40|$|Magical {{versions}} <b>of</b> mind reading <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>of</b> science fic-tion, but intuitive versions <b>of</b> mind reading <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>of</b> everyday life. People routinely {{wonder about}} what others think (e. g., “Is she telling the truth?”), and perhaps especially wonder what others {{think about them}} (e. g., “Does she find me intelligent, attractive, trustworthy?”). These inferences are often made {{with a great deal}} of confidence, but surprisingly little accuracy (Epley, 2008; Ickes, 2003; Kenny & DePaulo, 1993; Realo et al., 2003). The correlation, for instance, between how much people think others in a group like them and how much others actually like them may be no better than chance (Andersen, 1984; Kenny & DePaulo, 1993). Although considerable research has investigated why people have diffi-culty intuiting other minds (e. g., Nickerson, 1999), very little has been aimed at identifying strategies that might make peo-ple systematically better at such mind reading. The research we report in this article does exactly that. We suggest that people can have difficulty knowing how they are evaluated by others (often called metaperception; Kenny & DePaulo, 1993) at least partly because they construe themselves differently than they construe others. In particular, existing research demonstrates that people tend to evaluate themselves in relatively fine-grained, low-level, and contextu-ally based detail, whereas they tend to evaluate others in more generalized, high-level, and abstract detail (Chambers, Epley...|$|R
