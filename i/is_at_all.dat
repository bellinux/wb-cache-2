5|$|According to Twelvers, there <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times an Imam {{of the era}} who is the divinely {{appointed}} {{authority on}} all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali {{was the first of}} the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.|$|E
25|$|In I and Thou, Buber {{introduced}} his thesis on human existence. Inspired by Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity and Kierkegaard's Single One, Buber worked upon {{the premise of}} existence as encounter. He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of Ich-Du and Ich-Es to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and being through which an individual engages with other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the apostle Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus, a Jew). Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being—particularly how a person exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in I and Thou, a person <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times engaged with the world {{in one of these}} modes.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{research}} on Corinthian pottery {{was accomplished by}} Humfry Payne, who in the 1930s made a first stylistic classification which is, in essence, being used {{up to the present}} time. He classified the vases according to shape, type of decoration and image subjects, and only afterward did he make distinctions as to painters and workshops. He followed Beazley’s method except for attributing less importance to allocating painters and groups since a chronological framework was more important for him. Jack L. Benson took on this allocation task in 1953 and distinguished 109 painters and groups. Last of all, Darrell A. Amyx summarized the research up to that point in his 1988 book Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period. It is however a matter of scholarly dispute whether it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> possible in the case of Corinthian pottery to attribute specific painters.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these and many more names, we must mention the numerous religious who seek in the archives fresh material for general ecclesiastical history, or {{the history of their}} order, e. g. the Benedictines and the Bollandists. The writer has observed at work in the archives during the last twenty-one years Dominicans, Jesuits, Franciscans, Minor Conventuals, Capuchins, Trinitarians, Cistercians, Benedictines, Basilians, Christian Brothers, Lateran Canons Regular, Vallombrosans, Camaldolese, Olivetans, Silvestrines, Carthusians, Augustinians, Mercedarians, Barnabites, and others. Women have at times secured temporary admittance, though for intelligible reasons this privilege is now restricted. Since 1879 the archives have welcomed Catholics, Protestants, Hebrews, believers and infidels, Christians and heathens, priests and laymen, men and women, rich and poor, persons of high social standing and plain citizens, of every nation and language. The writer is acquainted with nearly all the great archives of Europe, and knows that none of them afford similar facilities to the historical student or extend him more courtesy. The number of visitors <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times higher than to other archives, while the freedom allowed {{in the use of the}} material is the most far-reaching known; practically nothing is kept hidden.|$|E

We are meant to feel confused by his actions, and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far, making us turn on our protagonist? There are so many questions that we have about this show, and that is a good thing. Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter.

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1883 season, {{a meeting}} of county representatives at Lord's was held, during which a {{proposal}} was made [...] "that the undermentioned counties agree among themselves not to employ any bowler whose action <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> doubtful." [...] The proposal was essentially a gentlemen's agreement to try and prevent unfair bowling, necessitated by the umpires' refusal to intervene. The resolution was signed by representatives from Derbyshire, Kent, Middlesex, Nottinghamshire, Surrey and Yorkshire, but those from Gloucestershire and Sussex refused to sign it, along with Alexander Rowley from Lancashire. During the meeting, Hornby defended Crossland's action, saying that [...] "he had never seen Crossland bowl otherwise than fairly." [...] As a result, Middlesex were joined by Nottinghamshire and Cambridge University in boycotting Lancashire in 1884. Crossland was strong again, and claimed ten wickets in a match on three occasions; first against Oxford University in late May–early June. In his next match, for the North against the South, he claimed seven wickets in each innings to record match figures of fourteen for 80. The crowd at Lord's followed the example previously set at the Oval, heckling Crossland throughout the match. He collected seven wickets in an innings again, in a match not classified as first-class against Leicestershire, and completed the ten-wicket haul with four wickets in the second innings. He faced the touring Australians twice during June, taking two wickets for the North, before collecting eleven wickets for Liverpool and District. The report in The Argus once again vilified Crossland, writing that [...] "owing principally to the successful throwing of Crossland" [...] the Australian first innings closed for 140.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E
