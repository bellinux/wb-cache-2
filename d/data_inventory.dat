The project activities were: Identification of regions to be modelled; EMEP/MSC-W model calculations and capacity building; GAINS model development and adaptation; Emissions & <b>Data</b> <b>inventories</b> and consistency checks; GAINS model scenario analysis. The project resulted in an updated GAINS Russia model, regionalised and sector-specific emission inventories, region-specific source-receptor calculations, and EMEP/MSC-W model training activities. Finally, regionalised emission abatement scenarios were analysed and showed large differences between regions in terms of potential emission reductions and emission abatement costs. The Russian Federation has now established analytical capacity related to the GAINS and EMEP/MSC-W models, the GAINS Russia model has been updated and improved, and a process for preparing input <b>data</b> <b>inventories</b> has been initiated.

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} interconnected economy, organizations are frequently operating beyond national borders. International partnerships, joint ventures, mergers, and acquisitions have expanded {{the labor market}} from a domestic to an international perspective. In this environment, multinational organizations demand cost-effective personnel selection tools to help them identify top talent from different countries, geographical regions, and cultures. The {{purpose of the current}} research was to evaluate the global utility of biographical <b>data</b> <b>inventories,</b> a standardized self-report selection method that asks job applicants questions about prior behaviors and experiences. Results from two studies involving participants from 7 country clusters, across four continents, and two different occupational groups, managers and manufacturing technicians, provided evidence to support the hypothesis that the validity of biographical <b>data</b> <b>inventories,</b> empirically keyed in the United States, generalizes to all country clusters examined. These results are important because they suggest that multinational organizations interested in deploying a single standardized selection system across geographical boundaries may want to consider including biographical <b>data</b> <b>inventories,</b> in addition to other commonly used instruments such as cognitive ability and personality assessments, to enhance the overall validity of their selection systems. This approach has the potential to reduce organizations’ costs related to developing, implementing, and maintaining selection processes while enabling them to manage their human capital efficiently by ensuring all new hires have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to succeed on the job and contribute to their strategic objectives...|$|R

40|$|Background: Clinical {{studies are}} a {{necessity}} for new medications and therapies. Many studies, however, struggle to meet their recruitment numbers in time or have problems in meeting them at all. With increasing numbers of electronic health records (EHRs) in hospitals, huge databanks emerge that could be utilized to support research. The Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) funded project ‘Electronic Health Records for Clinical Research’ (EHR 4 CR) created a standardized and homogenous inventory of data elements to support research by utilizing EHRs. Our aim {{was to develop a}} <b>Data</b> <b>Inventory</b> that contains elements required for site feasibility analysis. Methods:The <b>Data</b> <b>Inventory</b> was created in an iterative, consensus driven approach, by a group of up to 30 people consisting of pharmaceutical experts and informatics specialists. An initial list was subsequently expanded by data elements of simplified eligibility criteria from clinical trial protocols. Each element was manually reviewed by pharmaceutical experts and standard definitions were identified and added. To verify their availability, data exports of the source systems at eleven university hospitals throughout Europe were conducted and evaluated. Results: The <b>Data</b> <b>Inventory</b> consists of 75 data elements that, on the one hand are frequently used in clinical studies, {{and on the other hand}} are available in European EHR systems. Rankings of data elements were created from the results of the data exports. In addition a sub-list was created with 21 data elements that were separated from the <b>Data</b> <b>Inventory</b> because of their low usage in routine documentation. Conclusion: The data elements in the <b>Data</b> <b>Inventory</b> were identified with the knowledge of domain experts from pharmaceutical companies. Currently, not all information that is frequently used in site feasibility is documented in routine patient care. <br...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable forest {{management}} requires timely, detailed forest <b>inventory</b> <b>data</b> across large areas, which {{is difficult to}} obtain via traditional forest inventory techniques. This study evaluated k-nearest neighbor imputation models incorporating LiDAR data to predict tree-level <b>inventory</b> <b>data</b> (individual tree height, diameter at breast height, and species) across a 12 100 ha study area in northeastern Oregon, USA. The primary objective was to provide spatially explicit data to parameterize the Forest Vegetation Simulator, a tree-level forest growth model. The final imputation model utilized LiDAR-derived height measurements and topographic variables to spatially predict tree-level forest <b>inventory</b> <b>data.</b> When compared with an independent data set, the accuracy of forest inventory metrics was high; the root mean square difference of imputed basal area and stem volume estimates were 5 m 2 • ha– 1 and 16 m 3 • ha– 1, respectively. However, the error of imputed forest inventory metrics incorporating small trees (e. g., quadratic mean diameter, tree density) was considerably higher. Forest Vegetation Simulator growth projections based upon imputed forest <b>inventory</b> <b>data</b> follow trends similar to growth projections based upon independent <b>inventory</b> <b>data.</b> This study represents a significant improvement in our capabilities to predict detailed, tree-level forest <b>inventory</b> <b>data</b> across large areas, which could ultimately lead to more informed {{forest management}} practices and policies...|$|R

Several transportation planning techniques were tested with the model which included road and traffic <b>data</b> <b>inventory,</b> optimum pathing, road capacity analysis, traffic shift study modeling, and graphic presentation. The case study was targeted on road capacity analysis of urban arterial network as well as study of alternative traffic route for the urban route of State Road 32 in Muncie.
