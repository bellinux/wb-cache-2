This, along with other information that is available on the NDLERF website, will assist applicants to make a preliminary assessment on whether a proposed project is consistent with the NDLERF funding program. This information will also assist applicants to minimise the potential for delays in the assessment of grant applications caused by the provision of inappropriate or inadequate information. Applicants are encouraged to seek advice from local law enforcement representatives (for example, jurisdictional Drug and Alcohol Coordinators) regarding the suitability and/or feasibility of potential research prior to proceeding to application. Applicants from the law enforcement sector are also advised to contact their organisation’s representative on the NDLERF Board and/or their agency’s Drug and Alcohol Coordinator or Advisor prior to commencing the application process. The Secretariat is able to assist in locating the appropriate law enforcement contacts, and in questions regarding the application process. Applications for funding must be made on an NDLERF Application Form, which is available at www. ndlerf. gov. au/kit. php...|$|E

40|$|Aims and rationale: Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute (APHCRI) funded nine multi-institution centres of {{research}} excellence (MICREs) to address knowledge gaps in primary health care. Anecdotal evidence suggested that these MICREs were experiencing common problems. A {{study was conducted}} to document the challenges experienced and lessons learned by directors and managers of the nine MICREs to inform future such initiatives. The preliminary findings from the study will be presented and discussed. Methods: Qualitative interviews with Directors and Managers of the nine MICREs funded by APHCRI and other informants. Findings: Challenges were experienced in the domains of relationships (e. g. communication, investigator engagement, role clarification) and administrative process (e. g. budgeting and recruiting positions at different institutions, partner agreements). Analysis of the challenges identified: 1) that most of the challenges could have been prevented during grant preparation, 2) the importance of relationships and collaborative leadership, and 3) the need for a sufficiently experienced, skilled and resourced coordinator to manage the added complexity of a MICRE relative to a research centre based in a single institution. Relevance to policy, research and/or practice needs: The results from this study provide information to assist 1) researchers in preparing their grant application to establish a MICRE; 2) MICRE coordinators in the management of their MICRE; and 3) MICRE funding bodies in the development of requirements and <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>applicants...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aims and rationale: The Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute funded nine multi-institution centres of {{research}} excellence (MICRE) to address knowledge gaps in primary health care. Anecdotal evidence suggested that these MICREs were experiencing common {{problems in their}} establishment and operation. The study aimed to document the challenges and lessons from the nine MICREs to inform future planning of MICREs. Methods: Qualitative interviews with the directors and managers of the nine MICRES and other key informants. Findings: Challenges were experienced in the domains of administrative processes (e. g. budgeting, recruitment, partner agreements) and relationships (e. g. communication, investigator engagement, role clarification). Two main issues were identified. 1) That {{most of the problems}} could have been prevented during grant preparation; and 2) That the research administration manager at each collaborating institution in the MICRE during grant preparation, and the appointment of a sufficiently experienced, skilled and resourced MICRE manager are critical to ensure efficient administrative processes during the life of the MICRE. The lessons learned from this study have been incorporated into a ‘tips’ document which will be made available to assist researchers, research administration managers, and MICRE managers from inception to completion. This document also provides ‘tips’ to MICRE funding bodies for developing <b>Information</b> <b>for</b> <b>Applicants</b> documents. Conclusion: MICREs are more complicated and vulnerable to establishment and management problems than single-institution research centres. The contributions of the research administration manager (or equivalent at each collaborating institution), and the MICRE manager can facilitate the achievement of an efficient and effective research partnership...|$|E

RESULTS [...] Only eight advertisements included all the recommended information. Amount of information given was related to grade, specialty, or employer in only one respect: advertisements for basic trainees were more likely than those for higher specialist trainees to include information on pay and hours of work (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Starting {{and current}} {{salaries}} of 3, 564 men and 1, 053 women hired between 1976 and 1986 by a large, private firm were examined. Using a comprehensive model including year of hire, potential experience, education degree, college major, firm tenure, performance, and job title, men {{were found to}} have 5. 8 % higher current salaries. Among college graduates, men ~alized a 2. 9 % current salary advantage. Further analyses suggested that the bulk of the current salary disadvantage of women could be attributed to a one-time salary shortfall incurred at the time of hire. Although among college graduates, for example, differences in college major explained much of the starting salary advantage for men, an unexplained 4. 8 % advantage in starting salaries remained. Although women were more likely to leave the firm, correction for this potential source of sample selection bias did not change the pattern of results. Finally, we suggest that the fact that women experience a greater salary disadvantage at entry may stem from the smaller amount of job-relevant <b>information</b> available <b>for</b> <b>applicants</b> relative to current employees. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the modern}} {{technological}} age, social media {{allows us to}} communicate vast amounts of personal information to countless people instantaneously. This information is valuable to more than just our “friends” and “followers,” however. Prospective employers can use this personal data to inform hiring decisions, thereby maximizing fit and minimizing potential liability. The question then arises, how best to acquire this <b>information?</b> <b>For</b> job <b>applicants,</b> the counter-question is how best to protect {{the privacy of their}} social media accounts. As these two competing desires begin to clash, it is important to find a method to mediate the conflict. Existing privacy law, whether rooted in constitutional, statutory, or common law, is insufficient to cope with the practice, and pending legislation also fails to adequately account for the legitimate interests of both parties. This Note advocates a novel solution: a modified information escrow that would provide employers with the relevant information they seek while keeping private the substantive content of applicants’ social media accounts...|$|R
