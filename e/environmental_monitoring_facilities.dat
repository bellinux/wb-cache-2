40|$|International audienceWithin the INSPIRE framework, data {{pertaining}} to observations or measurements of environmental phenomena, often collected through sensors, {{are to be}} provided in addition to spatial features; these are usually consolidated in monitoring networks specifically designed to address various environmental issues and related policies. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Facilities</b> (EF) data model describes <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>facilities</b> as spatial objects {{in the context of}} INSPIRE, it includes observations and measurements (O&M) linked to the <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>facilities,</b> together with relevant metadata on the measurement methodology and process. The OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) has been identified as well suited for the provision of O&M encoded data; last December the technical guidance document for the implementation of SOS as an INSPIRE download service were finalized. In addition, the guidelines for the usage of O&M within INSPIRE have been updated to version 3. Both of these documents will be presented, including necessary extensions to the OGC service specifications. Almost one year has passed since the adoption of the technical guidance for SOS and O&M in INSPIRE. Thus, it is time to investigate a broad spectrum of interdependent topics, including (i) feedback from implementers, (ii) challenges related to the currently existing technical guidance documents and the maturity of available technology, and (iii) an outlook for the future of observation data in INSPIRE considering the rapidly changing technological scenery. Within this context, the main focus of this workshop will be on the integration of SOS services with established INSPIRE download services such as WFS; the utilization of Web Processing Services (WPS) or interactive environments (e. g. Virtual Research Environments - VRE, interactive computational environments, etc.) for enrichment of O&M data shall also be taken into account. O&M based data architectures and information flows will be discussed, as well as referencing between service types, illustrating how INSPIRE data stemming from SOS and WFS services can be integrated to complex applications {{for a wide range of}} environmental domains. Server and client implementations from various environmental domains will be presented and discussed, including a perspective towards open science solutions. Based on feedback gained during the workshop we will also work on prioritizing next steps on various pending issues, ranging from (i) known deficits within the underlying OGC standards, (ii) development and uptake of new standards such as JSON encoding, and (iii) the new OGC SensorThings API standard. The primary learning objectives of the workshop are:•understanding how O&M data models and SOS standards fit into the wider INSPIRE architecture;•envisioning the types of applications that can be created utilizing O&M and SOS;•learning and discussing about examples and concrete issues on the implementation of INSPIRE based <b>Environmental</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Facilities</b> data services...|$|E

40|$|Developments in micro electro {{mechanical}} systems and wireless communications {{have led to}} the development of low power, low cost, multi functional, wireless sensing devices. Distributed communication network formed with the help of these sensing devices is called Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). WSN forms the fundamental infrastructure for future unique network for variety of potential and powerful applications such as defense, <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring,</b> <b>facilities</b> management, manufacturing and agriculture. Many fundamental operations of WSN such as Time Synchronization among nodes and sink, routing of data, clustering of nodes, localization schemes, data aggregation and dissemination consume excess part of the energy utilized. To optimize energy consumption, this paper focuses on the time synchronization between nodes and the cluster head within the cluster, to reduce the relative drift of clocks between two different nodes at two different times thus reducing the synchronization error. We prove the minimization of the relative drift of clocks through a mathematical model with few assumptions on applications. The output of the mathematical model, based on the assumptions, clearly prove that the relative drift of clocks between two different nodes drops to an infinitesimally small value, which is better than many of the existing time synchronization schemes for WSNs...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{technique}} that overcomes the obstacles of the existing methods for monitoring near-surface water vapor, by estimating humidity from data collected through existing wireless communication networks. Weather conditions and atmospheric phenomena affect the electromagnetic channel, causing attenuations to the radio signals. Thus, wireless communication networks are in effect built-in <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>facilities.</b> The wireless microwave links, used in these networks, are widely deployed by cellular providers for backhaul communication between base stations, a few tens of meters above ground level. As a result, the proposed method can provide moisture observations at high temporal and spatial resolution. Further, the implementation cost is minimal, since the data used are already collected and saved by the cellular operators. In addition &ndash; many of these links are installed in areas where access is difficult such as orographic terrain and complex topography. As such, our method enables measurements in places that {{have been hard to}} measure in the past, or have never been measured before. We present results from real-data measurements taken from two microwave links used in a backhaul cellular network that show excellent correlation to surface station humidity measurements. The measurements were taken daily in two sites, one in northern Israel (28 measurements), the other in central Israel (29 measurements). The correlation of the microwave link measurements to those of the humidity gauges were 0. 9 and 0. 82 for the north and central sites, respectively. The RMSE were 20. 8 % and 33. 1 % for the northern and central site measurements, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In Europe a major recent {{development}} has been the entering in force of the INSPIRE Directive in May 2007, establishing an {{infrastructure for spatial information}} in Europe to support Community environmental policies, and policies or activities which may {{have an impact on the}} environment. INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the 27 Member States of the European Union. The Directive addresses 34 spatial data themes needed for environmental applications, with key components specified through technical implementing rules. This makes INSPIRE a unique example of a legislative ¿regional¿ approach. One of the requirements of the INSPIRE Directive is to make existing spatial data sets with relevance for one of the spatial data themes available in an interoperable way, i. e. where the spatial data from different sources in Europe can be combined to a coherent result. Since INSPIRE covers a wide range of spatial data themes, the first step has been the development of a modelling framework that provides a common foundation for all themes. This framework is largely based on the ISO 19100 series of standards. The use of common generic spatial modelling concepts across all themes is an important enabler for interoperability. As a second step, data specifications for the first set of themes has been developed based on the modelling framework. The themes include addresses, transport networks, protected sites, hydrography, administrative areas and others. The data specifications were developed by selected experts nominated by stakeholders from all over Europe. For each theme a working group was established in early 2008 working on their specific theme and collaborating with the other working groups on cross-theme issues. After a public review of the draft specifications starting in December 2008, an open testing process and thorough comment resolution process, the draft technical implementing rules for these themes have been approved by the INSPIRE Committee. After they enter into force they become part of the legal framework and European Member States have to implement these rules. The next step is the development of the remaining 25 spatial data themes, which include many themes of interest for the Earth Sciences including geology, meteorological and oceanographic geographic features, atmospheric conditions, habitats and biotopes, species distribution, <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>facilities,</b> and land cover to name a few. The process will follow in general the same steps as for the first themes and the working groups are expected to start their work in March/April 2010. The first draft specifications for public comment are expected at the end of 2010 and the work is scheduled to be completed in 2012. JRC. DDG. H. 6 -Spatial data infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are an {{emerging}} technology with {{applications in the}} elds of <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring,</b> <b>facility</b> management, and high-precision data gathering in general. They are deployed {{in the form of}} a large set of inexpensive sensing units that communicate over an ad-hoc wireless network. Developing applications for WSNs is challenging due to very limited resources available on each sensor node and the distributed nature of the algorithms used. In order to ease the development e ort, we propose the FACTS middleware architecture for wireless sensor networks. Built around a rule-based programming paradigm, FACTS supports event-driven and data-centric applications to be written in the ruleset de nition language. Components of the middleware are implemented in rulesets, compiled into bytecode and interpreted on the sensor nodes. We illustrate the capabilities of the FACTS middleware architecture by simulating it using the ns- 2 network simulator and the ScatterWeb WSN platform.

40|$|Advances in {{wireless}} {{multimedia communication}} technologies enable {{new types of}} pervasive and ubiquitous applications such as mobile health care, <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring,</b> <b>facility</b> <b>monitoring</b> and traffic surveillance. Among different factors concerned, energy efficiency {{is one of the}} most challenging issues in multimedia communication due to the resource constraints, and the requirements for high bandwidth and low transmission delay. In this survey, we provide a broad picture of the state of- the-art energy efficient techniques that have been proposed in wireless multimedia communication for resource-constrained systems such as wireless sensor networks and mobile devices. Following the essential stages required for multimedia communication, we categorize these techniques into two groups: multimedia compression techniques and multimedia transmission techniques. In the first group, we introduce the state-of-the-art compression algorithms and perform analyses and evaluations on energy efficiency in applying these compression algorithms to resource-constrained multimedia transmission systems. In the second group, we will further categorize the energy efficient transmission techniques into two sub-categories according to their different communication architectures. We review both cross-layer communication, including Unequal Error Protection (UEP), and independent-layer communication, focusing on Routing, MAC, and Physical layer protocols. We present the basic problem statement and objectives of these techniques, and survey multiple potential approaches that have been reported in the literature. Our focus in this survey is to provide insight into different research directions to improve energy efficiency in wireless multimedia communication protocols for future developments...|$|R
40|$|Data {{integration}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important issue with the increased sharing of information {{as a result of}} linked data and Spatial Data Infrastructures. To investigate the potential issues a case study for the Water Quality Register (WQR) of the Informatiehuis Water is used. In this case study the data residing in three separate data sources (Water Framework Directive (WFD) Database, Bulkdatabase and Limnodata) is to be integrated into a single register (the WQR). A full integration requires harmonisation steps at the data model level (schema mapping and transformation) and at the instance level (instance matching). Schema mapping involves the definition of correspondences between equivalent elements in two or more data models (schemas) defined in for example the Unified Modelling Language (UML) using class diagrams or the XML Schema Definition language (XSD). Correspondences need to be created between a source and a target schema. During this research the schemas of the data sources are documented using reverse engineering techniques as existing documentation is lacking. During the documentation it was found that none of the sources adhered (fully) to a known standard. Also referential integrity and the quality of data contents are lacking. Because none of the existing schemas is suitable for data integration, a target model for the WQR is developed based on INSPIRE (themes Hydrography, <b>Environmental</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Facilities</b> and Area Regulation, Restriction zones and Reporting Units), ISO 19156 (“Observations and Measurements”), the WISE reporting sheets and Aquo. The conceptual target schema in UML is converted to an application schema in XSD. To document the correspondences a number of schema mapping languages exist. Only a few of these languages have practical tooling available however. As part of the research three options were further described and their applicability to the case study examined: Rule Interchange Format (RIF), Ontology Mapping Language (OML) and XSLT. For the case study XSLT (and XQuery) were chosen in combination with Altova MapForce as most suitable option for implementation. The second part of a full {{integration is}} instance matching. The key spatial object in the case study is the monitoring location. During instance matching inconsistencies from double entries in the data source (conflation) and overlap between data sources (equivalence) are detected and resolved. This is done by matching the locations against each other using the geometry, geographical name and identifier. The resulting matches are used to create a single reference set with (unique) monitoring locations. Both the INSPIRE Geographical Names and Gazetteer schema are investigated for suitability as schema for the reference set. Preference is given to the Geographical Names schema because it allows for more semantic detail. Adaptations to the Geographical Names schema are suggested to make it more suitable as a reference schema. Based on the user requirements from the case study, a hybrid approach is tested for data integration. This hybrid approach combines the use of a harmonised database (Water Database) for storing data collected after the formation of the Water Database, {{with the use of a}} mediated schema approach for queries involving data existing in the original data sources prior to the formation of the Water Database (historic data). The Water Database is built using the WQR target schema and filled through an Extract, Load and Transform process with relevant data (surface water bodies and monitoring programs) from the WFD Database and the monitoring locations from the reference set. The integration solution, the WQR mediated schema, uses the Water Database as a new source together with the existing Bulkdatabase and Limnodata data sources. The WQR mediated schema solution retrieves information from these data sources using XSLT and XQuery in a proof of concept. The mediated schema uses the INSPIRE Geographical Names monitoring locations reference set as a central reference for the geographic queries. The proof of concept is functional but is not practical due to long response times. This is a result from the use of file based XML data sources. Suggestions to improve performance are given but not tested. GIMAGIS technologyOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|E

40|$|As recent {{world events}} show, {{criminal}} and terrorist access to nuclear materials {{is a growing}} national concern. The national laboratories have developed quantitative models to simulate the response of detection equipment when looking for lost or stolen nuclear material. SYNTH, a code written to synthesize typical gamma-ray spectroscopy experiments, and QUEST, a model to Quantify Uncertain Emergency Search Techniques, calculate the response functions of gamma-ray detectors for arbitrary source types and shielding configurations. In addition, QUEST provides an interactive, three-dimensional user interface supporting the virtual quest for nuclear materials, making possible quantitative comparisons of various sensor technologies and inspection methodologies. The probability of detecting a radioactive source during an inspection {{is a function of}} many different variables, including source type, structure geometry (including shielding), inspection dynamics (path and speed), detector (type, size, and resolution), and analysis algorithms. The authors present the results of their study comparing the synthetic Sodium Iodide (NaI) and Germanium (Ge) detector responses generated by both SYNTH and QUEST with those generated by real detectors deployed in the field.

Used in combination with various ionization techniques and sample introduction systems, miniaturized instrumentation offers advanced solutions to chemical measurement problems {{in the areas of}} interest. ^ The analytical capabilities of both home-built and commercially available miniature ion trap mass spectrometers equipped with electron ionization as well as several types of sample introduction systems were investigated. With the appropriate sampling method, the instrument was used to rapidly detect, identify, and quantitate a wide range of compounds including toxic industrial compounds and chemical warfare agent simulants, with high accuracy, chemical selectivity, sensitivity to trace amounts of analytes, and low false positive rates. The miniature mass spectrometers discussed have mass ranges up to about m/z 500, unit resolution, tandem mass spectrometry capabilities, and limits of detection in the low to sub-parts per billion range. In-trap ion/molecule reaction experiments were needed to analyze the low mass compound ammonia by reacting it with an analyte of higher mass to create a product ion that was above the low-mass cutoff of the miniature mass spectrometer (∼ m/z 40). Source parameters of the ambient ionization method of desorption electrospray ionization – a method which allows for rapid, direct analysis of chemical analytes from untreated surfaces – were also investigated using a bench-top, commercially available, mass spectrometer. ^ In summary, it is shown that an automated, fieldable, miniature mass spectrometer can be used for <b>facility</b> air <b>monitoring.</b> Compounds that fall below the instrument’s lowmass cutoff can be detected using ion/molecule reactions.
