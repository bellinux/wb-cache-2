50|$|In 1846 the London & Birmingham {{became part}} of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR); Bury {{resigned}} in 1847 and was succeeded by James E. McConnell as Locomotive Superintendent of the LNWR Southern Division. An innovative engineer who during his tenure experimented with <b>hollow</b> axles, <b>rubber</b> <b>springs,</b> brakes working on the rails, and elaborate boilers and fireboxes, but perhaps his greatest claim to fame is the 2-2-2 Bloomer type of 1851, which was closely based on a Bury design. A total of seventy-four were built in three classes between 1851 and 1862, similar in design and layout but different in dimensions. In 1861 the cost-conscious Richard Moon was appointed Chairman of the LNWR, and became very critical of McConnell; after the Board passed a motion of censure on him, McConnell was obliged to resign in March 1862.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{break through}} the {{drawbacks}} of the one- mass vibrating screen like plugging screen, high noise and etc., a new vibration screen with two-mass and high energy which could generate transient high vibration intensity was analyzed. To {{meet the requirements of}} energy-saving and system stability, a spring with nonlinear and hard features was used in the main vibration system. In this case, the spring’s stiffness could change along with the vibration intensity. The stiffness of the vibration isolation spring could be determined by analyzing the vibration isolation coefficient, and then the <b>hollow</b> cylindrical <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> with internal damping was adopted in the vibration isolation system. On the one hand, this vibration isolation spring could effectively absorb transient high vibration intensity which passed from main vibrating spring to the lower mass. On the other hand, it could achieve good effect of vibration isolation between the lower mass and the foundation. Base on field testing, the vibration intensity was increased by 28 %, meanwhile, the noise was reduced by 4 % and the impact vibration to foundation was reduced by 24 %, which successfully solved the plugging screen problem and also verified the validity of the vibration isolation system...|$|R

It is, therefore, necessary to establish a suitable criterion for the replacement period of chevron <b>rubber</b> <b>spring.</b> In this study, we performed characteristic analysis and useful lifetime prediction of chevron <b>rubber</b> <b>spring.</b> <b>Rubber</b> material coefficient was obtained by curve fittings of uniaxial tension equibiaxial tension and pure shear test. Computer simulation was executed to predict and evaluate the load capacity and stiffness for chevron <b>rubber</b> <b>spring.</b> In order to useful lifetime prediction of rubber material, we carried out the compression set with heat aging test in an oven at the temperature ranging from 50 °C to 100 °C during a period 180 days. By using the Arrhenius plot, several useful lifetime prediction equations for rubber material was proposed.

40|$|Dampening {{systems are}} {{important}} in heavy vehicles utilized in rough terrains, with purpose to reduce shocks and vibrations with negative influences on the vehicle and, more importantly, on the operator of the vehicle. During the years the heavy vehicles require sturdier construction parts, due to demands on higher load capacity, where the easy solution to scale up the construction parts is not always applicable for dampening systems with nonlinear behavior. Hence, the sturdiness {{in the design of}} these dampening systems requires improvement. In this thesis the design of the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> used as <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> in Volvo’s articulated hauler A 40 G is treated. The aim of this thesis is to find alternative design solutions on the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring,</b> improving its lifetime. The usual failure of these <b>rubber</b> <b>springs</b> is crack propagation in the rubber body. In the method of this thesis, alternative design solution are generated in concepts though brain storming, which are adjusted to achieve the desired behavior of the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> through calculations and tested in performance through simulations in Abaqus. From analyzing the generated data, it is concluded that among the tested design solutions, a combination of fewer plates and shaping the plates as thin bowls, results in highest potential increase in lifetime...|$|R

40|$|Element Analysis(동적유한요소해석), Rubber(고무), Nonlinear(비선형), Viscoelastic(점탄성) Recently, the {{vibration}} and structure-borne noise induced by passing trains are of great con-cerns, and the floating slab track is highlighted {{as one of}} most efficient alternatives to reduce the railway vibration. However, due to the non-linearity and viscosity of <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> used in the floating slab track, its dynamic behavior is very complex. In this study, therefore, to simulate the dynamic behavior of floating slab track with a better accuracy, a nonlinear viscoelastic <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> model that can be incorporated in commercial finite element analysis codes has been proposed. This model is composed {{of a combination of}} elastic spring element, friction element and viscous element, and termed the “generalized friction viscoelastic model(GFVM) ”.
