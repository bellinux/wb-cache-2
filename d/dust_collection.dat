40|$|A {{computer}} simulation of the atmospheric entry deceleration and heating for micrometeorites into a planetary atmosphere was developed. The {{results of this}} model were compared to an earlier model. The major difference between the extent of heating experienced in the two models results from an underestimation of the atmospheric density at altitudes above 130 km in the earlier model. Thus the earlier model systematically overestimates the peak temperature reached on atmospheric entry. The discrepancies are small for near vertical entry and/or high density particles, where little deceleration is experienced at high altitudes. For particles entering at grazing incidence and/or of low density the discrepancies are more pronounced. Gravitational enhancement, which {{is a function of}} geocentric velocity at the collection opportunity, was found to bias near Earth cosmic <b>dust</b> <b>collections</b> in favor of low velocity particles. The effect is to increase the proportion of low velocity dust, predominately from asteroids, in the stratospheric cosmic <b>dust</b> <b>collections</b> and on Earth orbiting spacecraft impact surfaces over its proportion in the interplanetary dust cloud...|$|R

25|$|Hybrid {{table saws}} are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor table saws. They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve <b>dust</b> <b>collection.</b> The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted trunnions and some have table-mounted trunnions. In general, cabinet-mounted trunnions are easier to adjust than table-mounted trunnions. Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the Bjurbole fusion crust using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive analysis (EDS) shows that filamentary crystals and ablation spheres may form on the meteoroid surface. Filamentary crystals, hollow spheres, and porous regions of the surface point to a period of intense vapor phase activity during atmospheric passage. Filamentary crystals {{can be divided into}} three categories on the basis of bulk composition and morphology. Two types of filamentary crystals are vapor phase condensation products formed during atmospheric entry of the meteoroid. The other type forms by the interaction of seawater with the fusion surface. The density and composition of ablation spheres varies with the flight orientation of the meteorite. The size range and composition of iron-nickel spheres on the surface of Bjurbole are similar to spheres collected in the stratosphere.

2500|$|Cabinet {{table saws}} are heavy (using {{large amounts of}} cast iron and steel) to {{minimize}} vibration and increase accuracy. A cabinet saw is characterized by having an enclosed base (cabinet). Cabinet saws usually have induction motors in the 3 to 5 hp (2 to 4kW) range, single-phase, but motors in the 5 to 7 HP (4 to 6kW) range, three-phase, are common in commercial/industrial sites. For home use, this type of motor typically requires that a heavy-duty circuit be installed (in the US, this requires a 240 volt receptacle, or [...] "hard" [...] wiring and a dedicated branch circuit). The motor is enclosed within the cabinet and drives the blade with two to four parallel V-belts, often [...] "A" [...] belts as [...] "A" [...] belts may be ganged without having to be specially selected (otherwise, specially selected sets of light-duty [...] "4L" [...] belts are used). Cabinet saws are heavier and offer the following advantages over contractor saws: heavier construction for lower vibration and increased durability; a cabinet-mounted trunnion (the mechanism that incorporates the saw blade mount and allows for height and tilt adjustment); improved <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> due to the totally enclosed cabinet and common incorporation of a <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> port. Cabinet saws are designed for, and are capable of very high duty-cycles, such as are encountered in commercial/industrial applications.

This is the type often used by hobbyists and homeowners because standard electrical circuits provide adequate power to run it, and due to its low cost. Because the motor sometimes hangs off the rear of the saw on a pivot, <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> can be problematic in comparison with a cabinet saw.|$|E

40|$|Since in situ {{studies and}} interplanetary <b>dust</b> <b>collections</b> only provide a {{spatially}} {{limited amount of}} information about the interplanetary dust properties, it is of major importance to complete these studies with properties inferred from remote observations of light scattered and emitted, with interpretation through simulations. Physical properties of the interplanetary dust in the near-ecliptic symmetry surface, such as the local polarization, temperature and composition, together with their heliocentric variations, may be derived from scattered and emitted light observations, giving clues to the respective contribution of the particles sources. A model of light scattering by a cloud of solid particles constituted by spheroidal grains and aggregates thereof is used to interpret the local light scattering data. Equilibrium temperature of the same particles allows us to interpret the temperature heliocentric variations.

We present here preliminary results from SEM, EDS and, where appropriate, XRD analysis of all of the particles from a collection surface which sampled the stratosphere between 18 and 20 km in altitude.

40|$|Comet 26 P/Grigg-Skjellerup was {{identified}} as a source of an Earth-crossing dust stream with low Earth-encounter velocities, with peak anticipated fluxes during April in 2003 and 2004 [1]. In response to this prediction, NASA performed dedicated stratospheric <b>dust</b> <b>collections</b> using high altitude aircraft to target potential interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) from this comet stream in April 2003.

High abundances of large D enrichments [3] and presolar grains [4] in IDPs from this collection are also consistent with an origin from the comet Grigg-Skjellerup. Here we report a new mineral from one of the cluster IDPs of the "Grigg-Skjellerup" collection, L 2055.

40|$|Collections {{of solid}} {{particles}} from the Earths' stratosphere {{have been a}} significant part of atmospheric research programs since 1965 [1], but it has only been in the past decade that space-related disciplines have provided the impetus for a continued interest in these collections. Early research on specific particle types collected from the stratosphere established that interplanetary dust particles (IDP's) can be collected efficiently and in reasonable abundance using flat-plate collectors [2 - 4]. The tenacity of Brownlee and co-workers in this subfield of cosmochemistry has led to the establishment of a successful IDP collection and analysis program (using flat-plate collectors on high-flying aircraft) based on samples available for distribution from Johnson Space Center [5]. Other stratospheric collections are made, but the program at JSC offers a unique opportunity to study well-documented, individual particles (or groups of particles) {{from a wide variety of}} sources [6]. The nature of the collection and curation process, as well as the timeliness of some sampling periods [7], ensures that all data obtained from stratospheric particles is a valuable resource for scientists from a wide range of disciplines.

40|$|Three {{chemical}} {{groups of}} primary "silicate" spheres < 30 micron in diameter of cometary origin {{were collected in}} the lower stratosphere between 1981 May and 1994 July. The "silicate" sphere abundances represent an annual background from contributions by sporadic meteor and weak annual meteor shower activities. During two collection periods, from 06 / 22 until 08 / 18, 1983 (U 2015), and from 09 / 15 - 12 / 15, 1981 (W 7027 / 7029), a higher number of spheres was collected compared to other periods of the year represented by the other collectors studied here. This study links two different data sets, viz. the NASA/JSC Cosmic Dust Catalogs and peak activities of annual meteor showers, and identified high-velocity cometary sources for collected stratospheric "silicate" spheres. The majority of spheres on flag U 2015 may originate from comet P/Swift-Tuttle (Perseids), {{while the majority of}} spheres on flags W 7027 / 7029 could be from comet P/Halley (Orionids) or comet P/Tempel-Tuttle (Leonids). Variations in relative proportions of the Mg,Si,Ca +/- Al, Mg,Si +/- Fe and Al,Si,Ca spheres may offer a hint of chemical differences among high-velocity comets.

The idea of such an experiment was to install collectors inside hermetic boxes, to have these boxes mounted outside a space station, orbiting the Earth and to have the capability of chosing the date and duration of the collection. In February 94, it has been proposed to fly an improved version of this instrument, as part of the payload of the EUROMIR 95 mission. Renamed as the European Space Exposure Facility (ESEF), it carries experiments from several principal investigators (PIs). These experiments have been designed to analyse in real time some parameters of the encountered particles and to collect material, both of terrestrial and extraterrestrial origin, to be brought back to the Earth {{at the end of the}} mission. Three types of collecting material are used: high purity metals, foams and silica aerogels. All grains down to submicron sizes can be possibly identified by such a variety of collectors; the presence of very low density collectors, like the foams and silica aerogels, should permit the collection of grains least modified, one of the primary goals of this investigation.
