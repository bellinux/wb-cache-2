5|$|Another method {{adopted in}} the past to tackle the phumdis was by way of {{diverting}} them towards the Khordak River. However, as this approach had not been very successful, the State Government planned to construct a canal at Tera Khunou Khong Ahanbi to divert the phumdis to Manipur River. Other methods adopted by the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) to control phumdis and water <b>hyacinth</b> include introducing weevils for the biological control of water <b>hyacinth,</b> which was carried out in collaboration with the Horticulture Institute of Bangalore. Reports have shown this to be an effective method in controlling water <b>hyacinth.</b>|$|E

5|$|The broad-billed parrot's {{head was}} large in {{proportion}} to its body, {{and there was a}} distinct crest of feathers {{on the front of the}} head. The bird had a very large beak, comparable in size to that of the <b>hyacinth</b> macaw, which would have enabled it to crack hard seeds. Subfossil bones indicate that the species exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in overall size and head size than any living parrot. The exact colouration is unknown, but a contemporary description indicates that it had multiple colours, including a blue head, and perhaps a red body and beak. It is believed to have been a weak flier, but not flightless.|$|E

5|$|The zirconium-containing mineral zircon {{and related}} {{minerals}} (jargoon, <b>hyacinth,</b> jacinth, ligure) were mentioned in biblical writings. The mineral {{was not known}} to contain a new element until 1789, when Klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He named the new element Zirkonerde (zirconia). Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed. Zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the <b>hyacinth,</b> also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.|$|E

5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the <b>hyacinth</b> macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are {{habitual}} ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water <b>hyacinth,</b> has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} is whether the name should be Leopoldia. In 1819 Herbert had {{proposed}} Leopoldia as a nomen provisorium (provisional name) for the same taxon as he called Hippeastrum in 1821. Although Leopoldia was subsequently validated (i.e. became the correct name), this was overlooked, and Hippeastrum rather than Leopoldia {{was used for the}} genus of New World amaryllids. Following Filippo Parlatore in 1845, the name Leopoldia was used for a genus of grape <b>hyacinth</b> species, allied to Muscari. In order to preserve the widespread usage of both Hippeastrum and Leopoldia, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed in 1970 that Herbert's Hippeastrum and Parlatore's Leopoldia should be conserved and Herbert's Leopoldia rejected. This was accepted and Hippeastrum Herb. is now a nomen conservandum (conserved name), i.e. the correct name regardless {{of the fact that it}} does not have priority over Leopoldia.|$|E
