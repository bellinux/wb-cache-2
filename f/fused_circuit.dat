50|$|Metal oxide varistors {{typically}} have lower resistance as they heat up; if connected directly across a power bus, for protection against electrical transients, a varistor with a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway {{and sometimes a}} small explosion or fire. To prevent this, the fault current is typically limited by a thermal <b>fuse,</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker, or other current limiting device.|$|R
50|$|In an {{electric}} power system, overcurrent or excess current {{is a situation}} where a larger than intended electric current exists through a conductor, leading to excessive generation of heat, and the risk of fire or damage to equipment. Possible causes for overcurrent include short circuits, excessive load, incorrect design, or a ground fault. <b>Fuses,</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, temperature sensors and current limiters are commonly used protection mechanisms to control the risks of overcurrent.|$|R
5000|$|Metal oxide varistors {{typically}} develop lower resistance as they heat up. If connected {{directly across}} an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against electrical transients), a MOV which {{has developed a}} lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire.

5000|$|The IET {{defines a}} Consumer Unit, {{also known as}} a {{consumer}} control unit or electricity control unit, as [...] "a particular type of distribution board comprising a type-tested co-ordinated assembly for the control and distribution of electrical energy, principally in domestic premises, incorporating manual means of double-pole isolation on the incoming circuit(s) and an assembly of one or more <b>fuses,</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, residual current operated devices or signalling and other devices proven during the type-test of the assembly as suitable for use." ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{electronic}} components develop lower resistances or lower triggering voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power dissipation may raise the temperature further by Joule heating. A vicious circle or positive feedback effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as thermal <b>fuses,</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, or PTC current limiters.|$|R
40|$|The Power Flow is {{the most}} {{important}} issue to ensure an efficient yet affordable system. To maintain a low failure electrical breakdown or blackout analysis of faults leads to appropriate protection settings which can be computed in order to select suitable <b>fuse,</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker size and type of relay.

50|$|Switchgear is a {{combination}} of electrical disconnect switches, <b>fuses</b> or <b>circuit</b> breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switches are safe to open under normal load current, while protective devices are safe to open under fault current.|$|R
50|$|A {{short circuit}} fault current can, within milliseconds, be {{thousands}} of {{times larger than the}} normal operating current of the system. Damage from short circuits can be reduced or prevented by employing <b>fuses,</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, or other overload protection, which disconnect the power in reaction to excessive current. Overload protection must be chosen according to the current rating of the circuit. Circuits for large home appliances require protective devices set or rated for higher currents than lighting circuits. Wire gauges specified in building and electrical codes are chosen to ensure safe operation in conjunction with the overload protection. An overcurrent protection device must be rated to safely interrupt the maximum prospective short circuit current.|$|R

40|$|A {{kinetic model}} is {{developed}} of Teflon ablation {{caused by a}} plasma. The model {{takes into account the}} returned atom flux that forms in the non-equilibrium layer during the ablation.

The problem of the ablation controlled discharge has a common general interest in a number of applications such as electric <b>fuses,</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, soft x-ray, pulsed plasma thrusters and extreme ultraviolet sources [1 â€“ 5]. In these devices, the discharge energy is principally dissipated by ablation of wall material, which then forms the main component of the discharge plasma.

40|$|A {{grid-connected}} PhotoVoltaic {{plant is}} a system formed by the PV modules (connected in arrays), the inverter(s) and the protection systems (<b>fuses,</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, etc.). Also energy meters are important for the economic valorization of the energy produced, self-consumed and sold to the grid. Depending on the resort where PV plant is located, different photovoltaic module technologies and inclinations and different inverter types may have quite a few impacts on the energy efficiency and production. The paper reports on a model describing the energetic and economic aspects of different PV technologies (m-Si, p-Si, a-Si and CIS) coupled to different inverter types in various Italian climates. The analysis reveals that the main parameter affecting the sizing is the inverter efficiency curve. The other parameters (PV module technology and inclination) seem to have less importance, but their influence is investigated {{in relation to the}} inverter size compared to the PV peak power...|$|R
50|$|Breaking {{capacity}} or {{interrupting rating}} {{is the current}} that a <b>fuse,</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker, or other electrical apparatus is able to interrupt without being destroyed or causing an electric arc with unacceptable duration. The prospective short circuit current which can occur under short circuit conditions should not exceed the rated breaking capacity of the apparatus. Otherwise breaking of the current cannot be guaranteed. Breaking capacity current corresponds to a voltage, so an electrical apparatus may {{have more than one}} breaking capacity current, according to the voltage. Breaking current may be stated in terms of the total current or just in terms of the alternating-current (symmetrical) component. Since the time of opening of a fuse or switch is not coordinated with the reversal of the alternating current, in some circuits the total current may be offset and can be larger than the alternating-current component by itself.|$|R
30|$|At present, {{the commercially}} {{available}} protection devices for DC microgrids are <b>fuses</b> and <b>circuit</b> breakers [11]. Interruption {{of the current}} leads {{to the creation of}} an arc that cannot be easily extinguished in a DC system without the current crossing through zero. Thatâ€™s still a challenge for applying the DC power system technologies. Fortunately, those difficulties have to be gradually overcome.|$|R
50|$|Most light sets {{come with}} built in fuses {{to help protect}} against {{overheating}} and to prevent household <b>fuses</b> or <b>circuit</b> breakers from being tripped. If a fuse blows, the strand must be unplugged {{and the number of}} strands must be reduced. If the strand has nothing attached, or has blown repeatedly, it may contain a short circuit and should be repaired or discarded.|$|R

Additional standard ampere ratings for fuses are 1, 3, 6, 10, and 601.|$|R
50|$|A {{distribution}} board (also known as panelboard, breaker panel, or electric panel) is {{a component of}} an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits, while providing a protective <b>fuse</b> or <b>circuit</b> breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure. Normally, a main switch, and in recent boards, one or more residual-current devices (RCD) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection (RCBO), are also incorporated.|$|R
50|$|Protective {{devices such}} as <b>circuit</b> {{breakers}} and <b>fuses</b> must be selected with an interrupting rating that exceeds the prospective short circuit current, {{if they are to}} safely protect the circuit from a fault. When a large electric current is interrupted an arc forms, and if the breaking capacity of a <b>fuse</b> or <b>circuit</b> breaker is exceeded, it will not extinguish the arc. Current will continue, resulting in damage to equipment, fire or explosion.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the other}} {{recommendations}} in the report was {{the introduction of the}} ring circuit system (often informally called a [...] "ring main"). [...] In this arrangement a cable connected to a <b>fuse,</b> or <b>circuit</b> breaker, in the distribution board was wired in sequence to a number of sockets before being terminated back at the distribution board, thus forming a ring final circuit. In the ring circuit, each socket-outlet was supplied with current by conductors {{on both sides of the}} 'loop.' This contrasts with the radial system (which is also used in the UK, often in the same installation) wherein a single cable runs out radially, like a spoke, from the distribution board to serve a number of sockets. [...] Since the <b>fuse</b> or <b>circuit</b> breaker for a ring circuit has to be rated for the maximum current the ring could carry (30A or 32A for a breaker), additional protection is required at each socket-plug connection. [...] Theoretically, such protection could have been designated either within the socket or within the plug. [...] However, to ensure that this protection has a rating matched to the appliance flexible cord fitted to the plug, a fuse rated between 1A and 13A is incorporated into each plug. Wired connections may also be connected to the ring, and these are also required to include a suitably rated <b>fuse.</b> The ring <b>circuit</b> in the UK requires the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets, but the BS1363 system is not limited to use with ring circuits.|$|R
50|$|Analysis of the {{prospective}} short-circuit current {{is required for}} selection of protective devices such as <b>fuses</b> and <b>circuit</b> breakers. If a circuit is to be properly protected, the fault current must be high enough to operate the protective device within as short a time as possible; also the protective device {{must be able to}} withstand the fault current and extinguish any resulting arcs without itself being destroyed or sustaining the arc for any significant length of time.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{electrical}} <b>fuses</b> or <b>circuit</b> breakers, thermal <b>fuses</b> only {{react to}} excessive temperature {{and not to}} excessive current (unless the excessive current is sufficient to cause the thermal fuse itself to heat up to the trigger temperature). For example, in a surge protector thermal fuses may be wired in series with the varistors; when the varistors conduct, the fuse heats up and disconnects the power, which eliminates the risk of fire which can occur when the varistors are overloaded.|$|R
30|$|In an {{electric}} power system, over current or excess current {{is a situation}} where the value larger than intended electric current exists through a conductor, leading to excessive generation of heat which leads to the risk of fire or damage to equipment [5 â€“ 7]. Possible causes for over current include short circuit, excessive load, incorrect design, or a ground fault. <b>Fuses,</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, temperature sensors and current limiters are commonly used protection mechanisms to control the risks of over current. Over current protection also includes the protection against over loads and this is most widely used protection. Over loading of a machine (or equipment) means the machine is taking more current than its rated current. Hence, with overloading there is an associated temperature rise. The permissible temperature rise has a limit based on insulation class and material. Over current protection against overload is generally provided by thermal relays. Over current protection also includes protection against short-circuit. Short circuits may leads to phase faults, earth faults or winding faults. Short circuit currents are generally several times more than full load current. Hence fast fault clearance is always desirable at the time of short-circuits.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation.
