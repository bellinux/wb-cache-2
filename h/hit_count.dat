5000|$|Points are earned through hits, sinks, and knockovers. There are {{two primary}} {{variations}} for counting scoring and declaring {{the winner of}} a game. In the five-point game, <b>hits</b> <b>count</b> for one point, sinks count for two points, and knockovers count for five points. In the five-point game, whenever a team earns points, both players of that team are expected to drink one fifth of the total volume of their cup for each point. In the four-point variation of the game, <b>hits</b> <b>count</b> for one point, sinks count {{for up to two}} points, and knockovers count for up to two points. If a cup is half-full and gets sunk or knocked-over, that counts as only one point. Players in a four-point game are expected to drink half of a single cup for each point. A team cannot lose on a serve. If a team has only one point left, they cannot have the last point scored through their own ineptitude. However, if both teams have only a single point left, a team may [...] "serve out" [...] if others are waiting to play a subsequent game. In a five-point game, the first team to earn five points loses. In a four-point game, the first team to earn four points loses.|$|R

The robustness together with the low overhead makes the proposed code hit counter suitable for (on-line) ADC self-testing and self-calibration applications. I...|$|R
50|$|Normal combos can {{be edited}} by {{inserting}} extra commands. These commands appear {{after the first}} normal attack. Normal combos branch off into three types: Rush, Heavy Hits, and Break. Rush attacks usually involve high <b>hit</b> <b>counts.</b> Heavy <b>Hits</b> usually deplete enemy HP faster. Break attacks usually deplete enemy GP faster. By executing certain commands in specific patterns and consuming a set amount of AP, a combo finisher called an EX Finish is performed. The type of EX Finish is usually related to the command used to execute it.|$|R
