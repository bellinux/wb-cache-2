5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such {{in the paper that}} described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1626 the {{southern}} {{threat to the}} Commonwealth was overshadowed by a northern one, as an incursion by Swedish forces reignited the Polish–Swedish War. In June, Gustavus Adolphus, with a fleet of 125 ships and an army of over 14,000 men, approached the Polish coast and began collecting tariffs on trade passing through Gdańsk (Danzig). Having taken Piława and Braniewo, Swedish forces spread through Pomerania, taking Frombork, Tolkmicko, Elbląg, Malbork, Gniew, Tczew and Starograd, while other Swedish forces landed near Puck—the main port of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth fleet—and captured it. The major city of Gdańsk, however, refused to surrender <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> lightning Swedish advances. In a battle that took place between 22 and 30 September 1626 {{near the village of}} Gniew, Gustavus defeated a Polish army led by King Sigismund, who retreated and called for reinforcements {{from other parts of the}} country. In response, Koniecpolski was tasked with defending Royal Prussia against the Swedish incursion. He was delayed by the unstable situation in the south, though, and it was not until 1 October that he finally departed for Prussia.|$|E
5|$|Once Chrono Trigger was completed, {{the team}} resumed discussions for Final Fantasy VII in 1995. The team {{reviewed}} {{the option of}} continuing the 2D strategy, {{which would have been}} the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift toward the future of 3D gaming, and the radical new development models that these 3D consoles would require. The team decided to take the riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware, but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered Sega's new Saturn console and the Microsoft Windows personal computer (PC). Their decision was influenced by two things: a tech demo based on Final Fantasy VI created using the new Softimage 3D software that impressed both staff and external developers, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square's audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version of the game, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster put too much of a strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It was later estimated that it would have required thirty 64DD discs to run Final Fantasy VII properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and favorably impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of Final Fantasy VII in addition to all other planned game projects, onto Sony's PlayStation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{algorithm}} that implements a totally ordered multicast primitive for a Totally Ordered Group Communication Service (TO-GCS).

Our algorithm is adaptive, i. e., {{it is able to}} dynamically alter the message delivery order in response to changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transmission rates of the participating processes. This compensates for differences among participant transmission rates and therefore minimizes fluctuations in message delivery latency. Our algorithm is thus useful for soft real-time environmentswhere sharp fluctuations in message delivery latency are not acceptable. Our solution provides well-defined message ordering semantics.

40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{character of}} face space is investigated, and is analyzed {{within the framework}} of eigenface decompositions. To deal with the sparse data problem, which occurs when not enough data is present to fill the space, we construct and test a range of probabilistic models. A key tool in this investigation is the decomposition of the eigenfaces representation of face space into odd and <b>even</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> midline) components. As has been pointed out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature, lighting artifacts may account for most of <b>the</b> variance encountered <b>in</b> analyzing face space data. It is here demonstrated that most of the odd eigenfaces, and a very small set of even eigenfaces, are associated with the lighting artifact. On filtering out this set of eigenfaces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analysis, we achieve near perfect recognition rates, even for faces exhibiting extreme lighting artifacts. It is also shown here that a multidimensional Gaussian model of face images is a moderately successful approximation in describing symmetrized face subspace. Random sampling of the Gaussian model for this subspace provides visually realistic synthetic faces, which respect gender.

40|$|International {{volunteer}} service (IVS) {{plays an}} integral role in international development by supplying non-profit, nongovernmental and charitable organizations with manpower to serve marginalized populations across the globe. Despite the critical importance of international volunteers, the overall efficacy of IVS {{is open to}} discussion. Due {{to the nature of}} international volunteerism, volunteers often feel as if their service is ineffective, {{while at the same time}} host organizations often feel that volunteers do not adequately suit their primary needs. Through fifteen interviews with Peruvian and Ecuadorian host organizations and fourteen interviews with international volunteers, this qualitative study seeks to assess the challenges of IVS and to identify methods of best practice for this field. This study found cultural obstacles, namely language barriers and difficulties associated with acclimating to foreign environments, to be contributing factors that hinder the efficacy of IVS. Other factors include the duration and personal motivations of a volunteer?s service. Additionally, this study also identified a mismatch of supply and demand between international volunteers and host organization needs as a major deterrent of IVS effectiveness. This mismatch is predicated on the discrepancy between the qualifications and expectations of international volunteers and the needs and expectations of host iii organizations. <b>The</b> interviews conducted <b>in</b> this study identified specific methods of best practices that enhance international volunteerism and contribute to mutual benefit and fulfillment for volunteers and the organizations to which they render their service. These practices range from volunteer management strategies to characteristics of successful volunteer behavior.

40|$|The Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT) is a C++ library {{designed}} to analyze data {{through the application}} of Bayes' theorem. For parameter inference, it is necessary to draw samples from the posterior distribution within the given statistical model. At its core, BAT uses an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. As an example of a challenging task, we consider the analysis of rare B-decays in a global fit involving about 20 observables measured at the B-factories and by the CDF and LHCb collaborations. A single evaluation of the likelihood requires approximately 1 s. <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> 3 [...] 12 parameters of interest, there are on the order of 25 nuisance parameters describing uncertainties from standard model parameters as well as from unknown higher order theory corrections and non-perturbative QCD effects. The resulting posterior distribution is multi-modal and shows significant correlation between parameters as well as pronounced degeneracies, hence the standard MCMC methods fail to produce accurate results. Parallelization is the only solution to obtain a sufficient number of samples in reasonable time. We present an enhancement of existing MCMC algorithms, including the ability for massive parallelization on a computing cluster and, more importantly, a general scheme to induce rapid convergence <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> complicated posterior distributions...|$|R
