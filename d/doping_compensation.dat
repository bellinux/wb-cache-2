With an N-dopant, {{the effects of}} N on the ZnO surface demonstrate a relatively shallow acceptor level in the band gap. As the dimension of the ZnO materials decreases, the quantum confinement effects will increase and render the charge transfer on surface to influence the shifting of Fermi level, by evidence of transition level changes of the N-dopant. We report that this can overwhelm the intrinsic p-type conductivity and transport of the ZnO bulk system.

We find that the B-N edge codop-ing is energetically a very favorable process and furthermore can achieve novel doping effects that are absent for the single B or N <b>doping.</b> The <b>compensation</b> effect between B and N is predicted to generally recover the excellent electronic transport properties of pristine GNRs. For the zigzag GNRs, however, the spatially localized B-N defect states selectively destroy the doped-side spin-polarized GNR edge currents at the valence and conduction band edges. We show that the energetically and spatially spin-polarized currents survive even in the fully ferromagnetic metallic state and heterojunction configurations. This suggests a simple yet ef-ficient scheme to achieve effectively smooth GNR edges and graphene-based spintronic de-vices. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Admittance spectroscopy revealed shallow traps at 0. 055 eV which were attributed to AsTe; its compensation by Cdi is discussed. Formation of the alloy CdSxTe 1 −x is linked to deep levels at EV+∼ 0. 55 eV and EV+∼ 0. 65 eV. Limits to the diffusion of photo-generated carriers were considered to be important in determining photovoltaic performance rather than carrier lifetime.

The superconductor-insulator transition accompanies the crossover from the host band to the impurity band. We point out an enhancement of the critical temperature Tc around the crossover. Further localization of electron wave functions leads to the localization of Cooper pairs and induces the pseudogap.

40|$|The {{concentration}} p and {{the mobility}} mu of holes in metal-organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD) GaN:Mg layers were studied by room temperature Hall-effect measurements {{as a function of}} the Mg concentration N(A) in the range 3 x 10 (exp 18) cm(exp- 3) <= N(A) <= 1 x 10 (exp 20) cm(exp - 3). The hole density first increases with increasing N(A), reaches a maximum value p(max) ~ 6 * 10 (exp 17) cm(exp - 3) at N(A) ~ 2 * 10 (exp 19) cm(exp - 3), decreases for larger N(A) values, and drops to very small values at N(A) 1 x 10 (exp 20) cm(exp - 3). The hole mobility decreases monotonically with increasing N(A). The p(N(A)) data provide strong evidence for self-compensation, i. e., for a <b>doping</b> driven <b>compensation</b> of the Mg acceptor by intrinsic donor defects. This effect becomes significant when N(A) exceeds a value of 2 x 10 (exp 19) cm(exp - 3). A semiquantitative self-compensation model involving nitrogen vacancies is developed.

40|$|We argue, {{based on}} band {{structure}} calculations and Eliashberg theory, that the observed decrease of T_c of Al and C doped MgB_ 2 samples {{can be understood}} mainly {{in terms of a}} band filling effect due to the electron doping by Al and C. A simple scaling of the electron-phonon coupling constant λ by the variation of the density of states as function of electron doping is sufficient to capture the experimentally observed behavior. Further, we also explain the long standing open question of the experimental observation of a nearly constant π gap as function of <b>doping</b> by a <b>compensation</b> of the effect of band filling and interband scattering. Both effects together generate a nearly constant π gap and shift the merging point of both gaps to higher doping concentrations, resolving the discrepancy between experiment and theoretical predictions based on interband scattering only.

40|$|A {{series of}} low {{temperature}} processes {{incorporated in the}} silicon on insulator (SOI) formation using Si molecular beam epitaxial growth on porous silicon dramatically reduces the impurity ramp-up from the porous silicon substrate and lowers the doping level in the epitaxial Si layer. A double-layer porous silicon system with a spongy microstructure layer {{on top of a}} dendritic microstructure layer was fabricated on a moderately doped p-type Si wafer using a two-step anodization process, and was used as the substrate for Si epitaxy. An extended low temperature annealing in high vacu-um was found to be helpful in stabilizing the porous silicon and making it less susceptible to microstructure change dur-ing the subsequent heat-treatment. Prior to epitaxy, a Ge-beam treatment was used to lower the temperature necessary for the Si surface cleaning. A low temperature preoxidation process stabilized the porous silicon during the subsequent high temperature oxidation.

40|$|Deep-level <b>doping</b> <b>compensation</b> process using {{elemental}} gold is used {{to create}} high resistivity silicon substrate for microwave application. Gold atoms are introduced into low resistivity Czochralski silicon substrates through an ion-implantation process and activated via high-temperature annealings. The highest substrate resistivity recorded for optimised substrates is 60 k-cm. A constant attenuation value of 0. 19 dB/mm is measured at 20 GHz for a bias voltage range of - 6 V to + 6 V, for coplanar waveguides fabricated on this type of substrate, indicating full suppression of parasitic surface conduction effect at microwave frequencies. The attenuation results are supported by the capacitance-voltage characteristics, where the substrate is seen to be insensitive towards bias voltage. Based on a finite element analysis, this effect {{is caused by the}} reduced number of free carriers in the substrate and the increased interface trap densities at the oxide-silicon interface. Optimisation of substrate-processing stages are presented in this work. It is shown that the combination of slow-cooling and quenching for activation annealing provide a higher resistivity enhancement and a lower attenuation compared to single annealing. The removal of the near surface gold to increase substrate's resistivity is found to be unnecessary as it does not provide reduced attenuation. It can therefore be avoided to reduce process complexity. The influence of oxide type is studied, and thermal oxidation is seen to be unsuitable for oxide passivation. Bias-dependent attenuation characteristics suggest gold out-diffusion during the high-temperature treatment. Reactively sputtered oxides do, however, give excellent performance. In addition to coplanar waveguides attenuation responses, quality factor performance of meander inductors fabricated on gold-compensated high resistivity silicon substrate is evaluated. A higher quality factor is recorded for all inductance values for Au-compensated high resistivity silicon compared to Float-zone silicon.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a summary}} of the research effort for the theoretical study, modeling, design, and optimization of solid state photovoltaic devices. The effect of grating structures on the back reflector is studied using electromagnetic modeling and an optimized structure is proposed to enhance the optical absorbance of these devices. Solar cells with optimized arbitrarily shaped gratings exhibit a 29 % improvement over planar cells and 9. 0 % improvement over the optimal cell with periodic gratings. A new model incorporating carrier transport and recombination is proposed and simulation result shows the significance of this model in the modeling of intermediate band solar cell. The material ZnTeO is used as a numerical example for the intermediate band solar cell model. The optimal impurity concentration is determined to be 1018 cm- 3 for an optical absorption cross section of 10 - 14 cm 2. The conversion efficiency of a ZnTe solar cell with a total recombination lifetime of 10 ns is calculated to increase from 14. 39 % to 26. 87 % with the incorporation of oxygen. Fully coupled solution to partial differential equations provides insight into the operation of intermediate band solar cell. A <b>doping</b> <b>compensation</b> scheme is proposed to mitigate the space charge effects, and the device achieves conversion efficiencies of approximately 40 %, similar to the maximum expected values from prior 0 -D models. A spectrally decoupled scheme for subbandgap photovolatics is proposed in which, device structures with non-uniform occupation of intermediate electronic states are employed to reduce the dependence of conversion efficiency on spectral overlap. Solar cell conversion efficiencies are calculated for structures where absorption bands are spatially decoupled due to defined occupation of intermediate states. The spectrally-decoupled device provides a means to achieve high theoretical efficiency independent of spectral overlap that approaches the detailed balance efficiency limit of 63. 2 % for intermediate state devices without spectral overlap.

The k. p approximation was applied successfully to the alloy systems and employed throughout the study in the interpretation of the spectroscopic results, thus providing an important test of the bandstructure theory. The predicted compositional dependence of the electron gyromagnetic ratio was satisfactory, enabling discrimination between different sets of bandstructure parameters published in the literature. However, as with other semiconductors the hole dependence proved more problematic. Magneto-optical measurements revealed evidence of excitons weakly localised by potential fluctuations. Modelling these results with a suitable Hamiltonian enabled the electron-hole exchange interaction to be determined. Significantly, analogous results were obtained in both ZnMgSSe and AlGaInP quaternary alloy systems, inferring that the behaviour is a general feature of disordered alloys. Further, in MBE-grown AlGaInP the exchange splitting was found to be linearly dependent on the degree of localisation, implying the existence of an excitonic mobility edge. A simple model accounting for this linear dependence required a two-dimensional confining potential; this may therefore be related to excitonic localisation at disc-like antiphase boundaries previously reported for AlGaInP, although further work is required to investigate this possibility.

40|$|Due to the {{increase}} in the demand for more efficient and reliable power switches, gallium nitride based devices have been long foreseen as eventual replacement for silicon technology. Due to their superior material properties, GaN-based devices are able to deliver much higher output power and handle higher driving voltages than their silicon counterparts for the same die area. GaN-based devices still face significant hurdles towards an industrial integration in the current power electronics, as these devices still fall short from their actual potential with record devices still significantly distant from the theoretical material limits. GaN on silicon (or GaN-on-Si) represents a viable solution for a wider adoption of GaN devices. On one hand, GaN-on-Si technology will benefit from the well-established Si foundries for device processing. On the other hand, the availability of large-diameter silicon wafers will bring down manufacturing costs. Growing GaN on a foreign substrate such as silicon will add, nonetheless, epitaxial complexity higher dislocation densities which can jeopardize the device performance. During the course of this work, DC and dynamic properties of power transistors fabricated on GaN-on-Si wafers are intensively investigated. The analysis is focused on the voltage-blocking capabilities and the losses in conduction during dynamic operation of these transistors. These two parameters were chosen as they represent the most straightforward criteria in choosing an efficient and reliable transistor for a power switch. The voltage-blocking capabilities of the devices are limited by the leakage current flowing through the device in the off-state. The source of this leakage current is due to carrier injection from the grounded silicon substrate and the background doping of the GaN buffer. To tackle the first problem, the source of the injected carriers was suppressed via altering the initial growth conditions of the GaN-on-Si epitaxial stack. To address the second challenge, <b>compensation</b> <b>doping</b> of the GaN buffer using carbon was adopted. Losses in electrical conduction during dynamic operation in GaN devices stems from incomplete recovery of trapped charge carriers. This phenomenon takes place either on the device surface or in the GaN buffer due to surface traps or bulk traps, respectively. Proper surface passivation with PECVD SiNX proves to be the most effective in suppressing surface trapping. This leaves buffer trapping — for example due to carbon <b>compensation</b> <b>doping</b> — as the main contributor to conduction losses during dynamic operation. Specially devised back-gated techniques are used to characterize buffer trapping mechanisms. These techniques were adopted to investigate the effects of various growth parameters and carbon incorporation techniques on the dynamic properties of the GaN buffers. The analysis pointed to the intricate role of charge transport and charge injection in trapping/de-trapping of charge carriers in the GaN buffer...|$|R
