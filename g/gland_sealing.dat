40|$|<b>Gland</b> <b>sealing</b> {{has been}} {{researched}} since the 1950 ’s by the British Hydraulic Research Association and others to improve seal performance. The literature review showed the focus had been on uniform packing compression to more closely match the packing pressure distribution to the fluid pressure {{with the objective of}} reducing leakage over time. There was limited work on the tribology of <b>gland</b> <b>sealing</b> and the patents were dominated by seal designs in a liquor environment. The review identified the particle properties of hardness, shape, fracture toughness and size as relevant to the wear and useful life of a gland seal in a slurry environment. This research presents the design, development and testing of a novel laboratory test rig which deliberately injects slurry particles into a typical standard slurry pump gland seal to cause wear of the sacrificial shaft sleeve. Mineral processing relies on slurry pumping to transfer slurry between plant operations and to improve life cycle costs and reliability in the long term a tribology approach was employed for the research. A range of mineral and synthetic particles were selected over the widest possible hardness range, tested and correlated with the output variable (specific wear rate) of the shaft sleeve. The wear of the shaft sleeve was normalised by travel distance and gland follower load. The data was combined by a novel empirical regression wear model which unified the controlling variables of load, travel distance, particle size, hardness, fracture toughness and size. Recent published values of hardness and fracture toughness were included in the analysis. A linear regression model with interactive terms between the fracture toughness, particle size and hardness, including a log term for the size, provided a good fit with statistical significance to the experimental data. Some dependency was demonstrated between the controlling variables of fracture toughness and particle size. Particle shape was found not to be relevant to the model for particle sizes less than 500 microns. A novel particle shape descriptor weighted dihedral angle which described the average dihedral angle of particle vertices, was proposed and this did not provide any more accuracy than existing descriptors such as SPQ. It was discovered during the experiments that slurry particles may form quasi particles in the seal gap depending on the geometric parameters, gap dimension and material parameters of the opposing (packing) surface, in a semi continuous process. A new tribology qualitative model for the wear of the shaft sleeve and motion of the particles in the gap is described. The relevant particle properties have also been combined into a novel dimensionless number (PDN) which was found to provide a significant correlation with the shaft sleeve SWR, and therefore has the potential to {{serve as the basis for}} future research investigation in three body wear.

40|$|Pressure-energized {{seal rings}} {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized seal rings have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to seal rings used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized seal ring generally has a U-shaped cross section {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the high-pressure side that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} seal ring tighter against the gland and body sealing surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the seal ring is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the U-shaped cross section and ejects or deforms the seal ring so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative seal rings according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the U-shaped cross section from that of the corresponding conventional seal ring to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the seal ring directly against the both gland and body sealing surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the seal ring against a <b>gland</b> <b>sealing</b> surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the seal ring into a smaller volume bounded by the gland and body sealing surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the seal ring more tightly against the body sealing surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the seal ring, the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the body sealing surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the seal gland. These extensions would help to restrain the seal ring against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the sealing ring in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the seal ring when the pressure on the high-pressure side was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal seal rings may be preferred. The bottom part of Figure 2 shows one example of an alternative gland configuration with an all-metal seal ring...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation of the}} aerodynamic forces generated by a single <b>gland</b> labyrinth <b>seal</b> executing a simultaneous spinning/whirling motion has been conducted. A lumped parameter model for a single <b>gland</b> <b>seal</b> with coupling to an upstream cavity with leakage is developed along with an appropriate solution technique. From this theory, it is shown {{that the presence of}} the upstream cavity can, in some cases, augment the cross-stiffness and direct damping by a factor of four. The parameters that govern the coupling are presented along with predictions on their influence. A simple uncoupled model is used to identify the mechanisms responsible for cross force generation. This reduced system is nondimensionalized and the physical significance of the reduced parameters is discussed. Closed form algebraic formulas are given for some simple limiting cases. It is also shown that the total cross-force predicted by the uncoupled model can be represented as the sum of an ideal component due to an inviscid flow with entry swirl and a viscous part due to the change in swirl created by friction inside the gland. The frequency dependent ideal part is solely responsible for the rotordynamic direct damping. The facility designed and built to measure these frequency dependent forces is described. Experimental data confirm the validity and usefulness of this ideal/viscous decomposition. A method for calculating the damping coefficients based on the force decomposition using only the static measurements is presented.

50|$|By 1925 the {{vertical}} {{arrangement of the}} engine had been taken advantage of to improve steam porting and access for maintenance. The Super-Sentinel engine used two camshafts: inlet and exhaust, placed near the crankshaft in the crankcase and operating the poppet valves through long pushrods. In the original waggon engine, all four valves were mounted {{at the far end of}} the cylinder from the crankshaft, requiring long narrow ports to the other end of the cylinder. With the locomotives the easily accessed vertical engine allowed a pair of these valves to be moved to the lower end of the cylinder, allowing for a short, efficient port with less 'dead space'. The crankcase of the engine, together with the crosshead trunk guide, was enclosed and provided with oil splash lubrication. A small plenum was left exposed between the cylinder's piston rod stuffing box and another <b>gland</b> <b>seal</b> into the crankcase.

40|$|Extracellular matrix (ECM) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the maintenance of mammary epithelial differentiation in culture. We asked whether changes in mouse mammary specific function in vivo correlate with changes in the ECM. We showed, using expression of beta-casein as a marker, that the temporal expression of ECM-degrading proteinases and their inhibitors during lactation and involution are inversely related to functional differentiation. After a lactation period of 9 d, mammary epithelial cells maintained beta-casein expression up to 5 d of involution. Two metalloproteinases, 72 -kD gelatinase (and its 62 -kD active form), and stromelysin, and a serine proteinase tissue plasminogen activator were detected by day four of involution, and maintained expression until at least day 10. The expression of their inhibitors, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, preceded the onset of ECM-degrading proteinase expression and was detected by day two of involution, and showed a sharp peak of expression centered on days 4 - 6 of involution. When involution was accelerated by decreasing lactation to 2 d, there was an accelerated loss of beta-casein expression evident by day four and a shift in expression of ECM-remodeling proteinases and inhibitors to a focus at 2 - 4 d of involution. To further extend the correlation between mammary-specific function and ECM remodeling we initiated involution by <b>sealing</b> just one <b>gland</b> in an otherwise hormonally sufficient lactating animal. Alveoli in the <b>sealed</b> <b>gland</b> contained casein for at least 7 d after sealing, and closely resembled those in a lactating gland. The relative expression of TIMP in the <b>sealed</b> <b>gland</b> increased, whereas the expression of stromelysin was much lower than that of a hormone-depleted involuting gland, indicating that the higher the ratio of TIMP to ECM-degrading proteinases the slower the process of involution. To test directly the functional role of ECM-degrading proteinases in the loss of tissue-specific function we artificially perturbed the ECM-degrading proteinase-inhibitor ratio in a normally involuting gland by maintaining high concentrations of TIMP protein with the use of surgically implanted slow-release pellets. In a concentration-dependent fashion, involuting mammary glands that received TIMP implants maintained high levels of casein and delayed alveolar regression. These data suggest that the balance of ECM- degrading proteinases and their inhibitors regulates the organization of the basement membrane and the tissue-specific function of the mammary gland.

40|$|Abstract]: The {{need for}} this {{research}} project has arisen principally due to the economic cost incurred from poor reliability of a pump group within the Rio Tinto Alcan Gove Alumina refinery. This poor reliability issue concerns the glands on a pump group whose reliable operation {{is critical to the}} success of the business. This research project has identified the root cause of the problem and in turn provided a solution. The Alumina industry relies heavily on slurry pumps to transport liquids and solids throughout the refining process. The failure of these pumps can significantly impact on a refineries ability to produce and consequently the reliability of the equipment is a major focus. Slurry pumps often utilise tradition stuffing box style <b>glands</b> to <b>seal</b> the wet end of the pump from the atmospheric and are usually the first part of a pump to fail. At the Rio Tinto Alcan Gove alumina refinery the mill injection pump group have been experiencing repetitive gland failures which have been costing the operation approx 12, 000 per day. It is these pumps that the project has concentrated on. The critical objectives of this research project include • Identification of the reliability project • Identification of the root cause • Proposal of a solution to mitigate the effect of the root cause. • Implementation of the solution. To achieve these objectives several methodologies have been employed. • Comprehensive review of production and maintenance cost associated with these pumps. • Literary review to examine past works involving pump gland on site and globally. • Detailed failure investigation. • Conducting of an Apollo root cause analysis to identify the root cause and provide the best solution to mitigate it. • Implementation and validation of the solution. With all objectives achieved the completed project has obtained it desired results.

D. Bowen Abstract: We studied milk composition {{over the course of}} lactation in 21 harbour seal (Phoca vitulina L., 1758) females on Sable Island, Nova Scotia. Milk fat content increased significantly from 40. 8 % ± 1. 01 % at parturition to 50. 2 % ± 1. 39 % at day 7 and then remained relatively constant throughout the remainder of lactation. Changes in dry matter mirrored changes in fat content. Protein content averaged about 9 % over mid to late lactation. There was con-siderable between-individual {{variation in}} the composition of milk and how it changed over lactation, particularly in milk fat content (CV 9. 1 %– 11. 4 %). In three females that were separated from their pups for 4 – 6 days, milk fat content declined by 20 %– 23 % and milk protein content increased by 6 %– 11 %.

Newer piping plans however offer options to increase leakage detectability and containment in single seals without sacrificing the simplicity of the seal design. A Plan 65 piping plan was introduced in API 682 Third Edition and ISO 21049. This captured leakage detection practices which were currently in use in the pipeline industry. The upcoming Fourth Edition of API 682 changes the designation of this plan to Plan 65 A and adds an alternative version designated as Plan 65 B. In addition, the Fourth Edition of API 682 will introduce Plan 66 A and 66 B which provide additional alternatives for monitoring and containing seal leakage in the <b>seal</b> <b>gland.</b> The selection of piping plans in any seal application depends not only on the application conditions but also on the expectations of the end user. This includes the design of the pump and also the infrastructure to monitor equipment performance and handle process leakage. With these new options for piping plans, end users can add additional capabilities to their existing Arrangement 1 seal installations and consider single seals for future applications...|$|R
5000|$|The {{change of}} air cooling to liquid cooling {{occurred}} {{at the start of}} World War II when the US military needed reliable vehicles. The subject of boiling engines was addressed, researched, and a solution found. Previous radiators and engine blocks were properly designed and survived durability tests, but used water pumps with a leaky graphite-lubricated [...] "rope" [...] <b>seal</b> (<b>gland)</b> on the pump shaft. The seal was inherited from steam engines, where water loss is accepted, since steam engines already expend large volumes of water. Because the pump seal leaked mainly when the pump was running and the engine was hot, the water loss evaporated inconspicuously, leaving at best a small rusty trace when the engine stopped and cooled, thereby not revealing significant water loss. Automobile radiators (or heat exchangers) have an outlet that feeds cooled water to the engine and the engine has an outlet that feeds heated water {{to the top of the}} radiator. Water circulation is aided by a rotary pump that has only a slight effect, having to work over such a wide range of speeds that its impeller has only a minimal effect as a pump. While running, the leaking pump seal drained cooling water to a level where the pump could no longer return water to the top of the radiator, so water circulation ceased and water in the engine boiled. However, since water loss led to overheat and further water loss from boil-over, the original water loss was hidden.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews ceramic {{substrates}} and {{thick-film metallization}} based packaging technologies in development for 500 C silicon carbide (SiC) electronics and sensors. Prototype high temperature ceramic chip-level packages and {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs) based on ceramic substrates of aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) and aluminum nitride (AlN) have been designed and fabricated. These ceramic substrate-based chip-level packages with gold (Au) thick-film metallization have been electrically characterized at temperatures up to 550 C. A 96 % alumina based edge connector for a PCB level subsystem interconnection has also been demonstrated recently. The 96 % alumina packaging system composed of chip-level packages and PCBs has been tested with high temperature SiC devices at 500 C for over 10, 000 hours. In addition to tests in a laboratory environment, a SiC JFET with a packaging system composed of a 96 % alumina chip-level package and an alumina printed circuit board mounted on a data acquisition circuit board was launched {{as a part of}} the MISSE- 7 suite to the International Space Station via a Shuttle mission. This packaged SiC transistor was successfully tested in orbit for eighteen months. A spark-plug type sensor package designed for high temperature SiC capacitive pressure sensors was developed. This sensor package combines the high temperature interconnection system with a commercial high temperature high pressure stainless steel <b>seal</b> <b>gland</b> (electrical feed-through). Test results of a packaged high temperature capacitive pressure sensor at 500 C are also discussed. In addition to the pressure sensor package, efforts for packaging high temperature SiC diode-based gas chemical sensors are in process...|$|R
40|$|The basoapical {{organization}} of monolayered epithelia {{is defined by}} the presence of hemidesmosomes at the basal cellular pole, where the cell makes contacts with the basement membrane, and tight junctions at the opposite apical pole. In the mammary <b>gland,</b> tight junctions <b>seal</b> cell–cell contacts against the lumen and separate the apical and basolateral cell membranes. This separation is critical to organize intracellular signaling pathways and the cytoskeleton. The study {{of the impact of the}} highly organized apical pole, and notably apical polarity regulators (Crb complex, Par complex, and Scrib, Dlg, Lgl proteins) and tight junction proteins on cell phenotype and gene expression has revealed an intricate relationship between apical polarity and the cell nucleus. The goal of this review is to highlight the role of the apical pole of the tissue polarity axis in the epigenetic control of tissue phenotype. The {{organization of}} the apical pole and its importance in mammary homeostasis and tumorigenesis will be emphasized before presenting how apical polarity proteins impact gene expression indirectly, by influencing signal transduction and the location of transcription regulators, and directly, by participating in chromatin-associated complexes. The relationship between apical polarity and cell nucleus organizations might explain how apical polarity proteins could switch from nuclear repressors to nuclear promoters of cancerous behavior following alterations in the apical pole. The impact of apical polarity proteins on epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression will be discussed in light of increased evidence supporting a role for apical polarity in the fate of breast neoplasms...|$|R
