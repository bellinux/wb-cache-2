The endogenous circadian pacemaker generates the 24-hour circadian rhythm that regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as core body temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. Misalignment of the circadian rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health <b>decrements.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractIncrement and <b>decrement</b> probe {{thresholds}} {{were measured}} during {{the presentation of}} two types of temporal masking stimuli. In Experiment 1, we measured thresholds for increment or <b>decrement</b> rectangular probes presented during the presentation of an increment or <b>decrement</b> Gaussian masking stimulus. We find that thresholds are higher when the probe and the Gaussian mask are of the same sign (e. g. both increments). However, both types of Gaussian mask raised increment and <b>decrement</b> probe thresholds above steady state conditions. In Experiment 2, we presented increment or <b>decrement</b> probes at one of eight possible phases of a 1 Hz luminance-modulated sine wave. For both increment and <b>decrement</b> probes, threshold variation with phase is non-sinusoidal in shape, but increment and <b>decrement</b> probe thresholds vary {{as a function of}} the sinusoid phase. These experiments show that increment and <b>decrement</b> thresholds vary {{as a function of the}} adaptation state of the visual system, and as a function of the direction of change in the adaptation state.

40|$|A <b>decrement</b> in the {{probability}} of eliciting a response is observed {{during the course of}} repetitive stimulation in many response systems of both metazoa and protozoa. Those forms of metazoan response <b>decrement</b> called habituation have recently been characterized behaviorally. In the studies reported here, the response <b>decrement</b> of the contractile protozoan, Stentor coeruleus, to repeated mechanical stimulation was systemically characterized to provide a comparison with metazoan habituation. This change in response probability was closely approximated by a negative exponential function after the first few stimuli. Animals responded to parametric variations of stimulus amplitude, interstimulus interval and retention period in a manner paralleling that observed in metazoa. However, neither interpolated large amplitude mechanical stimuli nor suprathreshold electrical stimuli produced dishabituation in Stentor though these stimuli are among the most effective dishabituating stimuli for metazoan tactile response systems. Behavioral analysis of the response <b>decrement</b> proceeded on the assumption that Stentor contains receptor and effector mechanisms only. Since the response <b>decrement</b> was not correlated with a change in responsiveness to electrical stimuli, the ability of the animal to contract appears to be unaltered by the process producing the response <b>decrement.</b> On the other hand, weak mechanical prestimuli were found to increase the rate of the response <b>decrement</b> which suggests that a process of receptor adaption is operative...|$|R

2500|$|CCS (count, compare, and skip): A complex {{conditional}} branch instruction. The A register {{was loaded with}} data retrieved from the address specified by the instruction. (Because the AGC uses ones' complement notation, there are two representations of zero. When all bits are set to zero, this is called plus zero. If all bits are set to one, this is called minus zero.) The diminished absolute value (DABS) of the data was then computed and stored in the A register. If the number was greater than zero, the DABS <b>decrements</b> the value by 1; if the number was negative, it is complemented before the decrement is applied—this is the absolute value. Diminished means [...] "decremented but not below zero". Therefore, when the AGC performs the DABS function, positive numbers will head toward plus zero, and so will negative numbers but first revealing their negativity via the four-way skip below. The final step in CCS is a four-way skip, depending upon the data in register A before the DABS. If register A was greater than 0, CCS skips to the first instruction immediately after CCS. If register A contained plus zero, CCS skips to the second instruction after CCS. Less than zero causes a skip to the third instruction after CCS, and minus zero skips to the fourth instruction after CCS. The {{primary purpose of the}} count was to allow an ordinary loop, controlled by a positive counter, to end in a CCS and a TC {{to the beginning of the}} loop, equivalent to an IBM 360's BCT. The absolute value function was deemed important enough to be built into this instruction; when used for only this purpose, the sequence after the CCS was TC *+2, TC *+2, AD ONE. A curious side effect was the creation and use of CCS-holes when the value being tested was known to be never positive, which occurred more often than one might suppose. That left two whole words unoccupied, and a special committee was responsible for assigning data constants to these holes.|$|E
2500|$|The fall of Rangoon cut off {{the routine}} import of Burmese rice into India and Ceylon. [...] In India, {{according}} to the Famine Commission's, Final Report, [...] "the areas most affected were parts of the provinces of Bombay and Madras and the States of Cochin and Travancore." [...] The imports from Burma normally met India's supply deficit in rice, which totaled 1,750,000 tons. In Bengal, the net import for which actual receipts and despatch documents existed, was on average 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937, [...] and 159,000 tons annually for 1938–42, the highest levels being recorded for the years 1934 and 1939 at 364,000 tons and 382,000 tons respectively. [...] But, according to the Final Report, there was also unrecorded import into Bengal [...] "by country boat from Assam and from Arakan in Burma" [...] the extent of which was not known accurately. [...] The Commission proposed that this import was {{of the order of}} 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937 and 100,000 tons annually for 1938–1942. [...] Aggregate consumption was also computed, not by a direct approach using census-based population statistics whose margin of error was too high, but by indirect estimation from a combination of the available values of annual supply, net import, carry-over stock at the year's beginning, and the same at the year's end. [...] However, as carry-over stock in any individual year could not be accurately estimated, averages were computed for a longer periods under the expectation that the carry-over stock at {{the beginning and the end}} of the periods were negligible compared to the total consumption during the periods. [...] The commission also made adjustments in annual supply, which had errors stemming from the assessment of cultivated acreage under the permanent settlement in Bengal. In this way, average consumption for the 15-year period 1928 to 1942 was computed to be 8.14 million tons annually for unadjusted acreage, and 9.18 million tons for the adjusted. Annual consumption was then estimated by assuming that it veered off the unadjusted average by increments, or <b>decrements,</b> of 0.10 million tons every year, and off the adjusted average by those of 0.12 million tons. [...] Using these data in the Famine Inquiry Commission report, the percentage of net imports—either recorded only, or both recorded and unrecorded, computed relative to a 15-year- or 5-year time period, and to consumption- or supply averages, which were either unadjusted or adjusted—were found by scholars to be 1.1% and 1.4% in one instance, and [...] "less than 4%" [...] in another. Using different data, P. C. Mahalanobis estimated the net imports to be on average 1% of aggregate supply for the period 1934–39, estimating their highest value for a single year at 5% for 1934, and noting that [...] "the physical quantities of net imports was never large." [...] While acknowledging that the influx of Burma rice was a factor in stabilizing prices, as it prevented hoarding or cornering the market, he concluded that there was [...] "chronic but a growing shortage of rice in Bengal," [...] which had not affected prices or imports because a large number of people, lacking the money to buy enough food, often made do with less than what was enough.|$|E
