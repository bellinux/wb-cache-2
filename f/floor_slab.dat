5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the <b>floor</b> <b>slab).</b> At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of building structures made of reinforced concrete is their considerable weight. One of the trends {{to decrease the}} weight of concrete structures, including <b>floor</b> <b>slabs,</b> is the arrangement of voids in the cross-sectional building structures.

40|$|Two 2 / 3 -scale {{reinforced}} concrete eccentric beam-column-slab subassemblies (edge connections with flush exterior edge-beam and column faces) were tested under large lateral displacement reversals. The main {{objective of the}} study was to investigate the effect of <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> on the seismic performance of eccentric beam column connections. The specimens (with different eccentricities and edge-beam widths) exhibited similar behavior before they started to break down, and they also reached similar joint shear strengths. Based on these results, it was concluded that the <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> diminished differences between seismic performance of the specimens and increased joint shear strengths of the specimens when compared with other eccentric connections without <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> Finally, ACI code design procedures for estimating nominal joint shear strength were quite conservative for the case of eccentric beam-column connections with <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> open 121...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two types}} of loads that {{structure}} engineering must encounter in the design. First type of load is called Dead loads that consist of the weights of the various structural members and the weights of any objects that are permanently attached to the structure. For example, columns, beams, girders, the <b>floor</b> <b>slab,</b> roofing, walls, windows, plumbing, electrical fixtures, and other miscellaneous attachments. Second type of load is Live Loads which vary in their magnitude and location. There are many different types of live loads like building loads, highway bridge Loads, railroad bridge Loads, impact loads, wind loads, snow loads, earthquake loads, and other natural loads.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Earthquake {{is one of}} {{the major}} threats towards {{building}} and non-building structure and various seismic isolation technologies have gained a good development all-round the world. Based on such a condition, a new form of seismic isolation technology is raised, which combine rolling bases and dampers to isolate <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> from quake wave. Analysis towards scaled model dynamic test shows that this seismic isolation technology for <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> can effectively reduce response acceleration of <b>floor</b> <b>slabs,</b> especially when frequency of input acceleration is high. While frequency of input acceleration is low, it has to be assured that when slab hits damper, the hitting should be soft so that the response acceleration can be controlled at a low level...|$|R
40|$|Several {{factors can}} affect the {{behaviour}} of the hollowcore <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> in fire. This paper analytically investigates {{the relationship between the}} fire resistance of the overall floor system and the floor length to width ratio as well as the type of side supports. The study uses beam grillage and shell elements to model the hollowcore slabs and the topping concrete under the platform of the non-linear finite element program, SAFIR. Different methods to model precast, prestressed concrete hollowcore <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> subjected to fire are also investigated. The results show that side supports can enhance the fire performance of hollowcore <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> provided that the spacing of the side supports does not greatly exceed the span length...|$|R

The {{inscription}} on it is that composed by Johnson for an earlier stone which he ordered a few days before he died That original stone was removed when the church was repaved in the late 1790s. Richard Greene, a relation of Dr Johnson’s and senior bailiff in Lichfield, did a lot to contribute to the city’s history. At Dr Johnson’s request he supervised the erection of the monument to Johnson’s parents and brother.|$|E

25|$|From {{the ground}} level {{entrance}} {{door on the}} western side of the tower, a spiral concrete staircase with steel tubular handrail winds around a central service duct before arriving in the near-centre of the observation room. Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet. Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of suspended ceiling panels conceals the underside of the concrete roof slab. A recent sink and cupboard sits up against the southern wall of the toilet. All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a single door in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate screen door. The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> and are fixed on the underside.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there were}} created many {{tests of the}} {{composite}} <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> with fibre concrete at ambient and at elevated temperature in real scales. Rectangular <b>floor</b> concrete <b>slabs</b> reinforced only by steel fibres and supported by steel beams were tested. One of the main purposes of those experiments was to create and evaluate new analytical model, which precisely predict fire resistance of the composite slabs. For this analytical model, there were introduced basic boundary conditions, which defined field of the utilization. At the elevated temperature, slabs were only partially protected. Only edge beams were protected by the <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> Intermediate beams and fibre concrete slab were without protection. Suitable properties of the fibre concrete in fire were clearly demonstrated during the tests. There {{is important for the}} fire resistance of the <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> that material has a necessary tensile strength and ductility. The same mixture of the concrete, but with different kinds of fibres was used {{in the course of the}} tests. The fibres had different length, strength and amount. The material properties of the fibre concrete allow creating a different load bearing mechanism, which increase fire resistance of the <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> Thanks to this mechanism, the fire resistance of the slab can reach 60 min and more. Experiments of determination of material properties were made. These tests were carried out at ambient and at elevated temperature...|$|R
