Obviously, Shonda Rhimes didn’t reinvent the wheel with the series, but there’s no denying its popularity." [...] adding, [...] "I {{understand}} its significance in the pop culture sphere." [...] He also stated that the show could go higher in the ranks with the upcoming season stating, [...] "Apparently, Grey’s Anatomy fans are passionate about their show, although it seems like they’ve been closeted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> I’d love to move Grey’s Anatomy even higher on the ranking, but I’ll have wait until the 11th season comes to Netflix." ...|$|E

500|$|At Joshua's apartment, they {{discover}} {{he has a}} twin brother Matthew and equipment used for a negative matter ring. Their investigation is cut short as {{they are forced to}} evacuate from a rigged bomb which destroys the apartment as they flee. Lee and Francis were unable to hear the bomb, but Olivia could, possibly indicating that she retains the enhanced hearing demonstrated in [...] "Night of Desirable Objects." [...] They travel to Matthew's home in the suburbs, meeting the brother, his wife, and their children. Matthew professes to no knowledge of the location of his brother. Olivia is suspicious of Matthew's behavior but does not explore further. Olivia's suspicion is shown to be correct as Matthew is revealed to have been the one trapped in the amber, having tried to come warn his brother about the quarantine. Joshua, having posed as Matthew <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> was the one that freed him and spoke to Fringe.

500|$|The {{songs on}} the album began as [...] "very loose, general ideas" [...] {{according}} to Rubalcaba, who also said [...] "Violence of the Red Sea" [...] was the most organized, structured song on the album (although he later said the same of the title track). Eginton wrote the bass lines for [...] "Violence of the Red Sea", inspired by funk and [...] "prog-psych" [...] bands from the UK and Europe. The song, which had {{been included in the}} band's concert setlist <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> prior to recording, was named after the combination of riffs and tempos which [...] "collid together like an angry sea". The song's finale was present in the band's repertoire for almost a decade and was used to close the song for the tension it created, whereas the opening of the song was considered more of a [...] "laid back groove". After Rubalcaba and Eginton had outlined the song's bass guitar and drum parts in Mitchell's absence (due to now living elsewhere), Mitchell was allowed to improvise lead guitar over them when he was able to play with the duo.|$|E
500|$|Pope {{suggests}} that Pullin's writing gave the debate [...] "a renewed vigour and sharp focus once again." [...] Although Pullin toned down his comments {{by the time}} the articles were published in book form, his attacks on Yorkshire County Cricket Club and general cricket administration aroused public support and led to action. Thewlis, for example, was given work as a groundsman and provided with a pension. [...] In Pullin's entry into the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Lincoln Allison notes that the book reflected Pullin's close and sympathetic relationship with the players. Allison describes it as a pioneering work: the unhappy experiences of cricketers after retirement was a phenomenon not widely known at the time. E.W. Swanton, a press box colleague <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of Pullin's career, writes: [...] "It was his revelations about the straits of poverty to which some of these heroes of the past were reduced that first roused the conscience of the public and the county committees, Yorkshire's not least." [...] Derek Hodgson, in the official history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, writes that Pullin [...] "produced one of the most valuable source books on Victorian cricket".|$|E
