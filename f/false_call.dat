The configurations were modified by the vendors to improve their performance. The modifications to Peek VD configuration effectively reduced dropped calls at the stop bar zones; however, {{that was at the}} expense of increasing <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> during daytime and missed and <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> during night time.

In the advance zones, the Autoscope changes significantly reduced missed calls in both day and night, reduced <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> in daytime, but increased in <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> during nighttime.

We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling.

Two Damage Indices (DI's) correlated with the total energy received by a given sensor are used to detect fatigue cracks and monitor their growth. The indices proposed carries marginal signal information content in order to decrease their sensitivity with respect to other undesired non-controllable factors which may distort the received signal. The {{reason for that is}} to limit the false calls ratio which besides the damage detection capability of a system, plays a crucial role in applications.

40|$|The {{work of this}} Engineering Doctorate {{addresses}} {{the research and development}} of efficient Finite Element (FE) modelling techniques for calculating the ultrasonic response from rough defects for Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) applications specific to the nuclear power generation industry. The project has been carried out in collaboration with Imperial College London and Rolls-Royce allowing for the transfer of novel academic research into an applied industrial context. Within the UK nuclear power generation industry, one of the fundamental principles of regulation and operation is a robust safety culture where the highest levels of quality assurance are applied to safety critical components. This principle places a requirement on NDE to deploy reliable and accurate inspections to ensure the structural integrity of the plant and its components. To achieve this goal, modelling techniques can be used to aid in the design and justification of ultrasonic NDE inspections. For smooth, relatively large defects, analytical methods can provide an accurate scattering solution; however, for more realistic rough defects, the limitations of these methods are only applicable for specialised cases of roughness. Defects which possess rough surfaces greatly affect ultrasonic wave scattering behaviour. Ultrasonic NDE inspections of safety-critical components rely upon this response for detecting and sizing flaws. Reliable characterisation is crucial, so it is essential to find an accurate means to predict any reductions in signal amplitude. An extension of Kirchhoff theory has formed the basis for many practical applications; however, it is widely recognised that these predictions are pessimistic owing to analytical approximations. As a result, NDE inspections can be overly sensitive, meaning that small and insignificant indications are incorrectly classed as being potentially hazardous defects. This increases the likelihood of making false-calls and incurring unnecessary expenditure to the programme. A numerical full field modelling approach does not fall victim to such limitations, and therefore, FE modelling techniques have been developed to deliver a non-conservative methodology for the prediction of expected back-scattering from rough defects. This has been achieved in two parts: improved performance of absorbing boundary methods for use with commercial FE codes, and application of domain linking algorithms to NDE inspection problems. This thesis presents the development of these methods and their application to industrial NDE inspections. Ultimately, the findings of this work will aid in establishing more reliable, less conservative, reporting thresholds for the inspection of power plant components, reducing <b>false</b> <b>call</b> rates and therefore any unnecessary expenditure.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{non-destructive}} testing is a renowned method for the inspection of girth welds. However, defect sizing and characterization remains challenging {{with the current}} inspection philosophy. In addition, data display and interpretation is not straightforward and requires skill and experience from the inspector. A better and more reliable inspection result would contribute to safer pipeline construction and economic benefits (like low <b>false</b> <b>call</b> rates and the possibility to use smaller wall thickness). In seismic exploration, images of the subsurface have been obtained using acoustic data, for many years. The main objective of this thesis is to apply the imaging concepts developed in seismic exploration to the application field of ultrasonic NDI in 2 D and to give a proof of concept in 3 D. The 2 D inverse wave field extrapolation (IWEX) imaging approach is presented, {{which is based on}} the Rayleigh II integral for back propagation. A 3 D imaging approach is presented called 'two pass imaging'. This approach consist of two 2 D imaging steps performed in two orthogonal directions. For homogeneous media, this two-pass process is known to be exact. With a linear array, a surface is scanned. In the direction parallel to linear array (the in-line direction) full offset imaging can be performed. In the direction perpendicular to the linear array (the cross-line direction) zero-offset imaging can be performed. The current traditional inspection philosophy is based on zonal discrimination. This philosophy is well regulated in codes and standards. From these codes and standards, a rough requirement was derived for the resolution of the IWEX imaging approach. The resolution that can be obtained with IWEX imaging is investigated on the basis of point spread functions. Aperture limitations and directivity effects of the ultrasonic elements are taken into account. Result of 2 D images from different insonification and scatter paths are presented. The data was obtained from measurements on various test blocks with machined reflections using a linear array. The test blocks also contain reflectors that are representative for actual weld defects. To demonstrate the proof of principle of 3 D IWEX imaging, test blocks were manufactured with suitable reflectors to study the characteristics of 3 D imaging. Also, a final experiment was performed on a test block with an intentional defect in a real weld. The results are presented and discussed. The IWEX imaging approach basically removes propagation effects from source to scatterer and from scatterer to receiver. In ultrasonic data from carbon steel, two wave modes exist with different sound velocities (longitudinal and transversal). To construct an image, one of these modes must be chosen for the back propagation. As a consequence, the energy in the data from the other mode is not treated correctly and will produce leakage artifacts in the image. Artifacts in L-T images caused by L-L arrivals are discussed and illustrated with an analytical example. In addition, a procedure is presented and demonstrated to suppress these artifacts. It is concluded that the IWEX imaging approach is suitable to detect, size and characterize defects that are common in girth welds. The L-L image (direct longitudinal insonification path and direct longitudinal scatter path) will usually contain the most information. However, for the area just below the surface, the LL-LL image (insonification and scatter paths via the back wall) must be used. To confirm the L-L and the LL-LL images, the L-T image (direct longitudinal insonificaton path and direct transversal scatter path) can be used, after the artifacts are suppressed with the proposed procedure. It is also concluded that 3 D IWEX imaging is feasible and that it contributes to an improved resolution in the lateral direction. Finally, recommendations are given for further research. Although ultrasonic imaging based on inverse wave field extrapolations offers a huge potential for ultrasonic NDI, still work must be done to apply IWEX in practice. Evaluation programs are necessary for the acceptance of the imaging technique. In addition, new codes and standards must be written for industrial use. Applied Science...|$|E

Four types of detection errors (false, missed, stuck-on, and dropped calls) were quantified at stop bar and advance detection zones, and all errors were visually verified using video images from the intersection. Results indicate that VDS performance was not greatly impacted under daytime light fog or rain conditions without wind, but significant changes were observed under dense fog and snow in daytime, and snow and rain in nighttime. During dense fog conditions Iteris and Autoscope changed their operating mode and placed constant calls due to image contrast loss, with potential for significant effects on traffic operation, while Peek significantly increased its missed calls.

In this paper, the normal and tangential components of the stress induced SMLF on the surface of specimens made from L 80 steel, which is commonly used for pipes in the petrochemical industry, were measured by two permanently installed magnetic sensor arrays under the earth’s magnetic field. The results show that the SMLF changes are very small (about 10 ~ 30 A/m) in all cases for the material tested and occur mainly in first elastic load cycle. A Finite Element (FE) model has been used to predict the spatial distribution of the magnetic field due to localized MMM. The FE studies show that the defect size and the applied background magnetic field will influence the SMLF signal; however, the signal due to MMM could be swamped by any ferromagnetic material near to the magnetic sensors. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the high probability of <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> with the MMM technique even if there were a significant MMM effect in the material used...|$|R
