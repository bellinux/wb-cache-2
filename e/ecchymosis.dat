5|$|Symptoms {{commonly}} include <b>ecchymosis</b> and swelling. The pain {{is generally}} {{more severe than}} bites from the copperhead, but less so than those from rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.). The formation of vesicles and bullae is less common than with rattlesnake bites, although necrosis can occur. Myokymia is sometimes reported. However, the venom has strong proteolytic activity {{that can lead to}} severe tissue destruction.|$|E
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as <b>ecchymosis,</b> bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
25|$|Bite {{symptoms}} include massive tissue swelling, pain, <b>ecchymosis,</b> hemorrhagic blebs, and necrosis. Systemic symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, coagulopathy, clinical bleeding and hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|Some (<10%) are {{diagnosed}} during the accelerated stage which most often presents bleeding, petechiae and <b>ecchymosis.</b> In these patients fevers are most commonly {{the result of}} opportunistic infections.|$|E
25|$|Intramuscular {{progesterone}} irritates {{tissues and}} {{is associated with}} injection site reactions such as changes in skin color, pain, redness, transient s (due to inflammation), <b>ecchymosis</b> (bruising/discoloration), and others.|$|E
25|$|A contusion, {{commonly}} known as a bruise, {{is a type of}} hematoma of tissue in which capillaries and sometimes venules are damaged by trauma, allowing blood to seep, hemorrhage, or extravasate into the surrounding interstitial tissues. Bruises, which do not blanch under pressure, can involve capillaries at the level of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone. Bruises are {{not to be confused with}} other similar-looking lesions primarily distinguished by their diameter or causation. These lesions include petechia (< 3nbsp&mm result from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet disorders and diseases such as cytomegalovirus), purpura (3nbsp&mm to 1nbsp&cm, classified as palpable purpura or non-palpable purpura and indicates various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia), and <b>ecchymosis</b> (>1nbsp&cm caused by blood dissecting through tissue planes and settled in an area remote from the site of trauma or pathology such as periorbital <b>ecchymosis,</b> e.g.,"raccoon eyes", arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma).|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} of bothropic envenomation include immediate burning pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, massive {{swelling of the}} bitten extremity, hemorrhagic blebs, local necrosis, bleeding from the nose and gums, <b>ecchymosis,</b> erythemia, hypotension, tachycardia, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, melena, epistaxis, hematuria, intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure secondary to hypotension and bilateral cortical necrosis. There is usually some discoloration around the bite site, and rashes may develop on the torso or the extremities.|$|E
25|$|Other meta-analyses include homeopathic {{treatments}} to reduce cancer therapy side-effects following radiotherapy and chemotherapy, allergic rhinitis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and childhood diarrhoea, adenoid vegetation, asthma, {{upper respiratory tract}} infection in children, insomnia, fibromyalgia, psychiatric conditions and Cochrane Library reviews of homeopathic treatments for asthma, dementia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, induction of labour, and irritable bowel syndrome. Other reviews covered osteoarthritis, migraines, postoperative <b>ecchymosis</b> and edema, delayed-onset muscle soreness, or eczema and other dermatological conditions.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of Bennett {{fracture}} are {{instability of}} the CMC joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and {{weakness of the}} pinch grasp. Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and <b>ecchymosis</b> {{around the base of}} the thumb and thenar eminence, and especially over the CMC joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC joint of the thumb. The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper. Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object, such as when reaching into a pants pocket.|$|E
25|$|Practical {{surgical}} procedures used for treating synkinesis are neurolysis and selective myectomy. Neurolysis {{has been shown}} to be effective in relieving synkinesis but only temporarily and unfortunately symptoms return much worse than originally. Selective myectomy, in which a synkinetic muscle is selectively resected, is a much more effective technique that can provide permanent relief and results in a low recurrence rate; unfortunately, it also has many post-operative complications that can accompany including edema, hematoma, and <b>ecchymosis.</b> Therefore, {{surgical procedures}} are very minimally used by doctors and are used only as last-resort options for patients who do not respond well to non-invasive treatments.|$|E
25|$|Bruise shapes may {{correspond}} {{directly to}} the instrument of injury or be modified by additional factors. Bruises often become more prominent as time lapses, resulting in additional size and swelling, and may grow to a large size {{over the course of}} the hours after the injury that caused the bruise was inflicted. As stated above, bruising present in a different location than the site of impact is called <b>ecchymosis</b> and generally occurs when the tissue at the site of injury is loose, allowing blood to travel under the skin to another location due to gravity or other forces, such as in a black eye.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of TTP is variable. The initial symptoms, which force {{the patient to}} medical care, are often the consequence of lower platelet counts like purpura (present in 90% of patients), <b>ecchymosis</b> and hematoma. Patients may also report signs and symptoms {{as a result of}} (microangiopathic) hemolytic anemia, such as (dark) beer-brown urine, (mild) jaundice, fatigue and pallor. Cerebral symptoms of various degree are present in many patients, including headache, paresis, speech disorder, visual problems, seizures and disturbance of consciousness up to coma. The symptoms can fluctuate so that they may only be temporarily present but may reappear again later in the TTP episode. Other unspecific symptoms are general malaise, abdominal, joint and muscle pain. Severe manifestations of heart or lung involvements are rare, although affections are not seldom measurable (such as ECG-changes).|$|E
25|$|Although {{technically}} the antivenin CroFab {{could be}} used to treat an envenomation, it is usually not administered for copperheads, as the risk of complications of an allergic reaction to the treatment are greater than the risk from the snakebite itself in most cases. The antivenin can cause an immune reaction called serum sickness. Pain management, antibiotics, and medical supervision in the case of complications is usually the course of action. In 2002, an Illinois poison control center report on the availability of antivenin stated it used 1 Acp to 5 Acp depending on the symptoms and circumstances. The symptoms of a mild envenomation include swelling of the hand, mild cellulitis, and respiratory distress. The symptoms of a moderate envenomation would include swelling of the hand, vomiting, mild bleeding, <b>ecchymosis,</b> diaphoresis, sinus tachycardia, and hypotension.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, <b>ecchymosis,</b> scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E

2500|$|Bites {{can cause}} pain, {{swelling}}, hemorrhagic bleb formation, and <b>ecchymosis.</b> Any swelling {{is usually not}} particularly severe, but it can involve all of the affected limb, {{as well as the}} trunk. Systemic symptoms can include nausea, dizziness, chills, coagulopathy, and shock. Klauber (1997) includes an account {{of a man who had}} been bitten on the first joint of the index finger of the right hand, with only a single fang penetrating. Although the bite was described as no more painful than a pin prick, a doctor was seen within about 25 minutes, and 10 cc of antivenin were administered.
