60|$|But I think I {{have said}} enough to express and perhaps convey my {{conviction}} that our present Labour troubles are unprecedented, {{and that they}} {{mean the end of}} an epoch. The supply of good-tempered, cheap labour--upon which the fabric of our contemporary ease and comfort is erected--is giving out. The spread of information and the means of presentation in every class and the increase of luxury and self-indulgence in the prosperous classes are the chief cause of that. In the place of that old convenient labour comes a new sort of labour, reluctant, resentful, critical, and suspicious. The replacement has already gone so far that I am certain that attempts to baffle and coerce the workers back to their old conditions must inevitably lead to a series of increasingly destructive outbreaks, to stresses and disorder culminating in revolution. It is useless to dream of going on now for much longer upon the old lines; our civilisation, if it is not to enter upon a phase of conflict and decay, must begin to adapt itself to the new conditions of which the first and foremost is that the wages-earning labouring class as a distinctive class, consenting to a distinctive treatment and accepting life at a disadvantage is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappear.</b> Whether we do it soon as the result of our reflections upon the present situation, or whether we do it presently through the impoverishment that must necessarily result from a lengthening period of industrial unrest, {{there can be little doubt}} that we are going to curtail very considerably the current extravagance of the spending and directing classes upon food, clothing, display, and all the luxuries of life. The phase of affluence is over. And unless we are to be the mere passive spectators of an unprecedented reduction of our lives, all of us who have leisure and opportunity have to set ourselves very strenuously to the problem not of reconciling ourselves to the wage-earners, for that possibility is over, but of establishing a new method of co-operation with those who seem to be definitely decided not to remain wage-earners for very much longer. We have, as sensible people, to realise that the old arrangement which has given us of the fortunate minority so much leisure, luxury, and abundance, advantages we have as a class put to so vulgar and unprofitable a use, is breaking down, and that we have to discover a new, more equable way of getting the world's work done.|$|E

Vernacular architecture is a manifestation, a physical representation of the culture of a people. Malatya-Battalgazi which is the oldest habitation area in Anatolia is among the downtowns that losing its cultural identity. The civil architecture in the town has suffered but the religious architecture is nearly conserved related with the beliefs. The history of Battalgazi, which is called as Old Malatya till to 1988, goes to ancient times. The first habitation of Malatya is the artificial hill called Aslantepe in the boundary of village Bah 7 eba. Strabon, the ancient times geographer, called Malatya as Melitene.
