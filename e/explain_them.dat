In February 1960 he returned to Switzerland, and upon its arrival back in Brussels he began renting an apartment in Uccle, away from Germaine.

5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to <b>explain</b> <b>them.</b> Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
5|$|The quatrains, {{published}} in a book titled Les Propheties (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published. Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, {{while many of the}} elite evidently thought otherwise. Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II of France, was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to <b>explain</b> <b>them</b> and to draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded, but by {{the time of his death}} in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King Charles IX of France.|$|E

25|$|While parapsychologists {{look for}} {{quantitative}} {{evidence of the}} paranormal in laboratories, {{a great number of}} people immerse themselves in qualitative research through participant-observer approaches to the paranormal.

25|$|From 1965 to 1970, Hersey was {{master of}} Pierson College, one of twelve {{residential}} colleges at Yale University, where his outspoken activism and early {{opposition to the}} Vietnam War made him controversial with alumni, but admired by many students.

25|$|Layered deposits, called {{interior}} layered deposits (ILDs), {{in various}} parts of Valles Marineris, especially Candor Chasma and Juventae Chasma, have led many researchers to believe that they were formed when the whole area was a giant lake. However, many other ideas have been advanced to <b>explain</b> <b>them.</b> High-resolution structural and geologic mapping in west Candor Chasma, presented in March 2015, showed that the deposits {{on the floor of the}} Candor chasma are basin-filling sediments that were deposited in a wet playa-like setting; hence water was involved in their formation.|$|E
25|$|Layers in peat {{were first}} noticed by Heinrich Dau in 1829. A prize was {{offered by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to anyone who could <b>explain</b> <b>them.</b> Blytt {{hypothesized}} that the darker layers were deposited in drier times; the lighter, in moister times, applying his terms Atlantic (warm, moist) and Boreal (cool, dry). In 1926 C.A. Weber noticed the sharp boundary horizons, or Grenzhorizonte, in German peat, which matched Blytt’s classification. Sernander defined subboreal and subatlantic periods, {{as well as the}} late glacial periods. Other scientists have since added other information.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{agree that}} {{the teachings of the}} Buddha were passed down in an oral tradition for approximately a few hundred years after the passing of the Buddha; the first written recordings of these teachings were made hundreds of years after the Buddha's passing. According to academic scholars, inconsistencies in the oldest texts may reveal developments in the oldest teachings. While the Theravada-tradition holds that {{it is likely that the}} sutras date back to the Buddha himself, in an unbroken chain of oral transmission, academic scholars have identified many of such inconsistencies, and tried to <b>explain</b> <b>them.</b> Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the Four Noble Truths, which are an important topic in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research.|$|E
25|$|Plotting to {{kill his}} brothers-in-law, Atli dispatches {{messengers}} to Gunnarr and Högni, the sons of Gjúki, with an invitation to his hall. Guðrún, daughter of Gjúki and Atli's wife, learns about the plot and sends a runic message to her brothers but the runes are corrupted {{by one of the}} messengers, Vingi. Nevertheless, Kostbera, Högni's wife, discerns from the runes that something is wrong and warns Högni. Högni dismisses her fears but she persists and describes dreadful dreams she has had, interpreting them as warnings. Högni remains unmoved and explains the dreams away. Glaumvör, Gunnarr's wife, has also had bad dreams which she describes to her husband, who also attempts to <b>explain</b> <b>them</b> away. Eventually Gunnarr admits that their lives may be short but tells Glaumvör that he cannot evade his doom. The brothers set out to Atli with only three companions. The women follow the brothers to a fjord where their ways must part. Glaumvör reminds Vingi of the sanctity due to a guest and he swears that there is no deception.

Pittsburgh played an undefeated full season despite the war, {{although it was}} not awarded the national championship. Although the team lacked the previous year's punch, it dominated the opposition. A key aspect of its success was the opposing coaches' inability to address Warner's evolving strategies; according to Powers, [...] "His reverse plays were a mystery, although Pop always was willing to <b>explain</b> <b>them</b> in detail to any other coach".|$|E

500|$|Having {{devised a}} means of {{measuring}} gamma radiation, Chadwick proceeded to measure the absorption of gamma rays by various gases and liquids. This time the resulting paper was published under his name alone. He was awarded his Master of Science (MSc) degree in 1912, and was appointed a Beyer Fellow. The following year he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship, which allowed him to study and research at a university in continental Europe. He elected {{to go to the}} Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin in 1913, to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, which provided more accuracy than the earlier photographic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation did not produce discrete lines, as has been previously thought, but rather a continuous spectrum with peaks in certain regions. On a visit to Geiger's laboratory, Albert Einstein told Chadwick that: [...] "I can explain either of these things, but I can't <b>explain</b> <b>them</b> both at the same time." [...] The continuous spectrum would remain an unexplained phenomenon for many years.|$|E

500|$|The novel, {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Döblin as a novel in [...] "Kino-Stil" [...] ("cinematic style"), {{is characterized by}} rapid shifts of perspective and the increasingly sophisticated use of montage. Döblin, having emphatically rejected the psychological novel in his 1913 essay [...] "To novel writers and their critics," [...] presents the reader of Wadzek with a depiction of characters from a perspective that, rather than offering psychological motivations for their actions, opts for a [...] "psychiatric method" [...] that records events and processes without commenting on them or attempting to <b>explain</b> <b>them.</b> Condemned by contemporary critics for its overly-detailed and grotesque descriptive language, the novel's style has since received acknowledgment for its [...] "radical naturalism". Describing the narrative technique used in Wadzek, the critic Judith Ryan has written, [...] Döblin's refusal to make Wadzek a tragic figure, {{as well as the}} novel's thematization and satire of tragedy, earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht, who declared, [...] "Ich liebe das Buch." [...] Other themes of the novel include monopoly capitalism, modern technology, the bourgeois family, and the modern metropolis. Certain aspects of the plot, such as Schneemann's dislike of Stettin (Szczecin) and Wadzek's elopement for America, recapitulate elements of Döblin's own biography.|$|E

He was intrigued by paradoxes, and with the related concepts of uncertainty, undecidability/unprovability, and incompleteness; he sought models of cognition that could embrace these elements, rather than simply <b>explain</b> <b>them</b> away.|$|E
