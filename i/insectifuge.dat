40|$|Drimys brasiliensis Miers is {{a native}} plant species to the Atlantic Forest, {{commonly}} known as cataia, and used as a stimulant, anti-diahrreal, antipyretic, among other properties. Dried and fresh leaves of cataia were collected in autumn/ 2012, submitted to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger graduated apparatus {{over a period of}} 4 hours after reaching the boiling point, then essential oil was collected. In oil from green leaves, 49 compounds were identified, being 65. 0 % sesquiterpenes, 12. 0 % monoterpenes and 23. 0 % other substances. In oil from dry leaves, 40 compounds were identified, being 76. 1 % sesquiterpenes, 2. 0 % monoterpenes and 21. 9 % other compounds. The main constituents in green leaves were germacrene D (8. 9 %), bicyclegermacrene (5. 3 %), epi-alpha-cadinol (5. 1 %), alpha-cadinol (6. 0 %), and drimenol (9. 3 %). In dry leaves the main constituents were germacrene D (6. 3 %), (E) -nerodidol (5. 4 %), spathulenol (9. 5 %), epi-alpha-cadinol (5. 5 %), alpha-cadinol (6. 7 %), and drimenol (11. 6 %) Due to its composition, antibacterial, antimycotic, <b>insectifuge</b> and molluscicide activities are proven, together with the pharmacological properties that this species may present. ...|$|E

Sw.) i dvije adventivne vrste (Datura inoxia Miller i Sisyrinchium angusti/olium Miller). In {{this paper}} new localities for and {{distribution}} maps (Fig. 1 - 5) of three autochthonous and two adventious plant {{species that are}} interesting but not very underspread in Croatia are given. Taxa found in new localities are: Autochthonous plant species Artemisia annua L. (Asteraceae) is a medicinally valuable plant and also an <b>insectifuge.</b> It is native from Japan to the Balkan Peninsule and was introduced into Central Europe. According to available literature data, some localities of Artemisia annua in Croatia were noted (Schlosser et Vukotinović 1869, Marković 1975, 1978, 1980), In July 1994 A. annua wras noted on the embankment of the Drava river at Donji Miholjac (Slavonija) on an area of 30 m 2 in the Lolio-Plantaginetum majoris Beger 30 association. Astragalus cicer L. (Fabaceae) occurs in scattered localities from Siberia to Western Europe. In {{the last few years}} (since 1989) A. cicer has been found in the arable area from Trnovcica to Granesina (the eastern part of Zagreb). It grows on the margins of paths, verges, Stubblefields, fallows and as a weed in clover fields. Umodorum abortivum (L.) Sw. (Orchidaceae) has been cited for some localities in Croatia (Schlosser e t Vukotinović 1869, Ilijanić 1977, Trinajstić 1985, Hećimovic M. et S. Hecimović 1987, 1989). In May 1995 the occurrence of L. abortivum was observed on neglected grassland in Vugrovec Gornji (the eastern part of Medvednica mountain). The distribution of L. abortivum in Croatia is displayed on map 3. Adventious plant species Datura inoxia Miller (Solanaceae) is originally from America. It is introduced and cultivated world - wide as an ornamental plant. Up to now this species has been known in Dalmatia (Pavletic Zi. et Trinajstic 1990) and Slavonia (Franjić 1993). The species D. inoxia has been found recently (1995) in Granesina and Cugovec where it was introduced from Dalmatia. Sisyrinchium angustifolium Miller (Iridaceae). This anthropochorous species was discovered in Croatia near Zagreb by Pevalek (1915). Later it was found in some other localities (Pavletić Zi. et al. 1980). A new locality for S. angustifolium is Kraljev vrh which is situated in the northwestern foothills of Medvednica mountain, At this location, S. angustifolium was discovered in May 1989, growing in a microdepresion in the Bromo-Cynosuretum cristati H-ić 1930 association...|$|E
