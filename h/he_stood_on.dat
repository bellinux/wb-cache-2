5|$|The {{front cover}} design, a {{photograph}} of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve.|$|E
5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

25|$|The pirates' {{plan was}} to sail past the Swallow, which meant exposing {{themselves}} to one broadside. Once past, {{they would have a}} good chance of escaping. However, the helmsman failed to keep the Royal Fortune on the right course, and the Swallow was able to approach to deliver a second broadside. Captain Roberts was killed by grapeshot, which struck him in the throat while <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the deck. Before his body could be captured by Ogle, Roberts's wish to be buried at sea was fulfilled by his crew, who weighed his body down and threw it overboard after wrapping it in his ship's sail.

Paterson, now with a rifle, ran back outside and onto Champ Street. He decided he could not get a clear shot, so <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> a low wall in the prison's front garden.

25|$|Months after Sun Rui won {{his first}} {{national}} dance award, a tragedy struck him. In Feb 2001, a car accident happened to him and some other junior dancers {{when he was on}} a tour with the Secondary School of Beijing Dance Academy in the United States. Although he survived the tragic accident, his pelvis was fractured. As this part of bone is critical to a dancer, his dancing career seemed to be doomed. However, Sun Rui did not give up. After painful rehabilitation and even harder training, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the stage again.

On the election for the President of the Senate of the Philippines in April 1963, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the podium for more than 18 hours to wait for party-mate Alejandro Almendras who was to arrive from the United States. The Nacionalistas, who comprised exactly half of the Senate, wanted to prevent the election of Ferdinand Marcos to the Senate Presidency. Prohibited from even going to the comfort room, he had to relieve in his pants until Almendras' arrival. He voted for party-mate Eulogio Rodriguez just as Almendras arrived, {{and had to be}} carried off via stretcher out of the session hall due to exhaustion.
