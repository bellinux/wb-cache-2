25|$|The 2009 to 2010 {{model year}} Toyota Matrix (and its Pontiac Vibe relative) {{are subject to}} the 2009–2011 Toyota vehicle recalls {{regarding}} <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> and accelerator pedal replacement.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{recalled}} {{and replaced}} 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Toyota Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing {{the risk of}} unsecured mats jamming the accelerator pedal. In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine shutoff. On 29 November, the 2007–2010 MY <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a brake override feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 September 2007, Toyota {{recalled}} the optional [...] "all-weather" [...] heavy-duty rubber floor mats from 2007 and 2008 model year Toyota Camry XV40s sold in North America. Toyota issued a second recall on 2 November 2009 asking owners {{to remove the}} driver <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> and not replace it with {{any other type of}} mat. Toyota extended its <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> recall on 25 November to reconfigure the accelerator pedal, replace the all-weather floor mats, and install a brake override system to prevent sudden unintended acceleration. Toyota issued a fourth unwanted acceleration-related recall for the Camry on 21 January 2010, this time in response to reports of accelerator pedals sticking in models without floor mats. Evaluations by Car and Driver and Edmunds found that the Camry's brakes were powerful enough to overcome the accelerator in all tests, bringing the car safely to a stop.|$|E

2500|$|In the Lake Patzcuaro and Lake Cuitzeo areas, reeds and bulrushes {{have been}} used to make a variety of products.

In Ichupio, Puácuaro and San Jerónimo they make also baskets, purses, tablecloths, tortilla baskets, floor coverings and a variety of decorative figures, especially birds and those representing daily life in the area. [...] The raw material is generally collected from the lakeshore and woven in family workshops. In San Lucas Pío, reeds are used to make hampers and baskets.

Hodgins regularly refers to himself as the lab's [...] "bug and slime guy". During an investigation, he primarily deals with particulates and trace evidence and, at the crime scene, will provide Booth with approximate time of death. He is best friends with former co-worker Zack Addy and often tries to [...] "educate" [...] him on social norms. They often compete {{for the title of}} [...] "King of the Lab", referring to whoever has more useful information in the investigations. His family is extremely wealthy and is major sponsor of the Jeffersonian, however, Hodgins wishes for this status to remain concealed from his colleagues. It eventually comes out during an investigation, but nobody allowed it to significantly impact their relationship with him. He later loses all his wealth due to the scheming of serial killer Christopher Pelant, but he manages to regain a considerable portion of it eventually. Initially through the sale of a hot sauce he creates in collaboration with intern Finn Abernathy, later through a still more successful creation: the non-breakable beaker, but invented a polymer <b>floor</b> <b>mat.</b> He marries Angela Montenegro in season five, following an on-again-off-again romance since the second season. She gives birth to their son, Michael Vincent, in season six. In season 11, Hodgins is left paralyzed from the waist down due to a bomb attack. At the conclusion of the series, Hodgins is promoted to temporary head of the Jeffersonian while Cam and Arastoo are on leave after their wedding.|$|E

He could smell a crocodile farther off and more differentiatingly than could any man, than could even a salt-water black or a bushman smell one.

5000|$|On May 28, 2010, the NHTSA {{issued a}} {{statement}} that the stacking of all-weather floor mats from any manufacturer {{on top of the}} factory <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> could cause accelerator entrapment. In their press release they stated the following: [...] "NHTSA is urging drivers of 2010 Fusions {{to make sure they do}} not stack the rubber “All Weather” <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> on top of the secured carpeted <b>floor</b> <b>mat.</b> Further, drivers are reminded to ensure that any driver-side floor mats (whether they are the carpeted <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> or all weather <b>floor</b> <b>mat)</b> are properly installed and restrained by the retention hooks on the floorboard. Depending on vehicle and <b>floor</b> <b>mat</b> design, it is possible for unsecured floor mats to interfere with accelerator or brake pedals in a wide range of vehicles. Therefore, NHTSA reminds all drivers of all makes and models to check the driver-side floor mats for secure installation and to follow all manufacturer instructions for installing the mats." ...|$|E

50|$|Quality <b>floor</b> <b>mats</b> improve {{indoor air}} quality (IAQ) and safety in {{commercial}} and residential applications.
