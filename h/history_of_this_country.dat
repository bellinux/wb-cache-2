5|$|No one {{familiar}} with the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember {{that we are not}} descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

This university is an arts and culture based university which draws from the rich history of the monuments. It was created to preserve the rich <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> which was facing a dark future due to globalisation. The university main site is near the monuments with other campuses in the City centre and Mashava. the campuses include Herbet Chitepo law school, Robert Mugabe, school of Education, Gary Magadzire School of Agriculture and Natural Science, Simon Muzenda School of Arts and Munhumutapa school of Commerce.|$|E

This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.|$|E

By the way, scat is {{something}} {{that a lot of}} people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.|$|E
25|$|In the {{old days}} I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark {{him as a man}} of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country...</b> The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E

I do not object to the {{principle}} of graduated taxation: for the just principle of ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income.... But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have received, I find it too violent. It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender.... I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of property should be more heavily burdened than others, unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty that that which is ranked as personal...the aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots of my being).... For the sudden introduction of such change there is I think no precedent in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> And the severity of the blow is greatly aggravated in moral effect {{by the fact that it}} is dealt only to a handful of individuals.|$|E
40|$|Proposed {{solutions}} to the problems <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> health care sys-tem range along a spectrum from central planning to free market. Central planners and free market advocates provide various ethical justifi cations for the policies they propose. The crucial fl aw in the philosophical rationale of central planning is failure to distinguish between normative and metanormative principles, which leads to mistaken {{understanding of the nature of}} rights. Natural rights, based on the principle of noninterference, provide the link between individual morality and social order. Free markets, the practical expression of natural rights, are uniquely capable of achieving the goals that central planners seek but fi nd beyond their grasp. The <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> health care system and the experiences of other nations provide evidence of the superiority of free markets in reaching for the goals of universal access, control of costs, and sustaining the quality of health care...|$|R
40|$|American Indian Tribes in the United States have {{a unique}} legal and {{political}} status shaped by fluctuating federal policies and the over-arching <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> brand <b>of</b> settler-colonialism. One of the several legacies <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>history</b> is that federally recognized tribes have membership rules that diverge significantly from typical state or national citizenship criteria. These rules and their history are poorly understood by judges {{and members of the}} public, leading to misunderstandings about the “racial” status of tribes and Indian people, and on occasion to incoherent and damaging decisions on a range of Indian law issues. This article, which {{is part of a larger}} project on tribes, sovereignty, and race, will discuss the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Florida’s tribes, their road from pre-contact independent peoples to federally recognized tribes, and their contemporary membership criteria in order to shed light on the inextricably political nature of race, membership and sovereignty in the American Indian context...|$|R

40|$|The book {{is built}} around the themes of savagery within the justice system; the entrenchment {{of the rule of}} law and the {{development}} of legal principle; and the discretionary application of clemency within the criminal law. Early on in the piece, Wood warns the reader that he will focus on the law relating to murder, rape, assault and theft, and essential doctrines and procedures relating to criminal trials. Dry as the prospect of reading a further 400 pages appears to be at that point, it is a misleading impression. Wood brings this apparently dense and unpromising topic to life by employing a series of vignettes, anecdotes and case studies that reveal the peculiarities, not only of the law itself, but of colonial judges, lawyers, politicians, administrators and criminals in all their hideousness and glory; and he does so with both gravitas and humour. Woods’s pioneering work (as far as I can ascertain, the first comprehensive <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> criminal law in the colonial period) is not only an impressive piece of scholarship and a fascinating expedition into our past, but a service in placing our current controversies in their historical contexts...|$|R

6000|$|I {{hold that}} the {{proposition}} that slavery cannot enter a new country without police regulations is historically false. It is not true at all. I hold that the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> shows that the institution of slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these [...] "police regulations" [...] which the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual establishment of it. Not only so, but is there not another fact,--how came this Dred Scott decision to be made? It was made upon {{the case of a}} negro being taken and actually held in slavery in Minnesota Territory, claiming his freedom because the act of Congress prohibited his being so held there. Will the Judge pretend that Dred Scott was not held there without police regulations? There is at least one matter of record as to his having been held in slavery in the Territory, not only without police regulations, but in the teeth of congressional legislation supposed to be valid at the time. This shows that there is vigour enough in slavery to plant itself in a new country, even against unfriendly legislation. It takes not only law, but the enforcement of law to keep it out. That is the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> upon the subject.|$|E
