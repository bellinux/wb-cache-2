5|$|Marilyn Waring {{described}} how {{the exclusion of}} non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and {{the design of the}} <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities. In some countries, such as Norway, which had included unpaid household work in the GDP {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, it was left out in 1950 for reasons of compatibility with the new <b>international</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E

5|$|A URN is a URI that {{identifies}} a resource by {{name in a}} particular namespace. A URN {{may be used to}} talk about a resource without implying its location or how to access it. For example, in the <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> Book Number (ISBN) system, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 identifies a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. To gain access to the book, its location is needed, for which a URL would have to be specified.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% iridium {{was used}} in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. The meter bar was replaced as {{the definition of the}} fundamental unit of length in 1960 by a line in the atomic spectrum of krypton, but the kilogram prototype is still the <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> of mass.|$|E

5|$|As {{a widely}} used <b>international</b> <b>standard,</b> ISO 3166-1 is {{implemented}} in other standards {{and used by}} international organizations to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information.

Other country codes used by many international organizations are partly or totally incompatible with ISO 3166-1, although some of them closely correspond to ISO 3166-1 codes.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Curie {{succeeded in}} {{isolating}} radium; she also defined an <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> for radioactive emissions that was eventually named {{for her and}} Pierre: the curie.

5|$|Standard {{diagnostic}} criteria require impairment in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development. Unlike the <b>international</b> <b>standard,</b> the DSM-IV-TR criteria also required significant impairment in day-to-day functioning; DSM-5 eliminated AS {{as a separate}} diagnosis in 2013, and folded it into the umbrella of autism spectrum disorders. Other sets of {{diagnostic criteria}} have been proposed by Szatmari et al. and by Gillberg and Gillberg.|$|E

5|$|The International System of Quantities (ISQ) is {{a system}} based on seven base quantities: length, mass, time, {{electric}} current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. Other quantities such as area, pressure, and electrical resistance are derived from these base quantities by clear non-contradictory equations. The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units. The ISQ is defined in the <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> ISO/IEC 80000, and was finalised in 2009 {{with the publication of}} ISO 80000-1.|$|E
5|$|Damai, one of Sarawak's main beach resort area, {{is located}} on the Santubong Peninsula, about 35 minutes drive from Kuching. The area has sandy beaches at the foot of an {{imposing}} jungle-covered mountain. Damai features three world-class resort hotels such as the Damai Beach Resort, Damai Puri Resort and Spa and One Hotel Santubong. Each resort has their own private beach, swimming pool and offers jet-skiing, waterskiing, windsurfing, mountain biking, tennis, squash and fitness centres. There is also an <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> 18-hole golf course designed by the legendary Arnold Palmer located nearby. Other attractions include the Damai Central, Permai Rainforest Resort, Sarawak Cultural Village and the sleepy fishing villages of Santubong and Buntal with their excellent seafood restaurants. While for visitors who like adventurous activities, there is a trekking activity on Mount Santubong.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard characters, six characters taken from the Grantha script, which {{was used in the}} Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied. ISO 15919 is an <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> for the transliteration of Tamil and other Indic scripts into Latin characters. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script. Tamil can be transliterated into English by using ISO 15919, since English language uses the Latin script for writing.|$|E

Such measures involve concepts to enhance the legitimacy of <b>international</b> <b>standards,</b> precise designation of the relevant international stan- dards in national legal enactments, creation of a FINMA regulatory board and extension of judicial protection in financial market law. ...|$|R

5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E

5|$|When the French Government first {{investigated}} {{the idea of}} overhauling their system of measurement, the concept of universality was put into practice in 1789: Maurice de Talleyrand, acting on Condorcet's advice, invited John Riggs Miller, a British parliamentarian and Thomas Jefferson, the American Secretary of State to George Washington, {{to work with the}} French in producing an <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> by promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies. However, these early overtures failed and the custody of the metric system remained {{in the hands of the}} French government until 1875.|$|E

5|$|Opened in 1884, Anfield was {{originally}} owned by John Orrell, a minor land owner {{who was a}} friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Everton, who previously played at Priory Road, were in need of a new venue owing to the noise produced by the crowd on match days. Orrell lent the pitch to the club in exchange for a small rent. The first match at the ground was between Everton and Earlestown on 28 September 1884, which Everton won 5–0. During Everton's tenure at the stadium, stands were erected for some of the 8,000-plus spectators regularly attending matches, although the ground was capable of holding around 20,000 spectators and occasionally did. The ground was considered of <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> at the time, playing host to the British Home Championship match between England and Ireland in 1889. Anfield's first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and Accrington F.C. Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield's first league champions in the 1890–91 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} an <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> for {{chemistry}} was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz. This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds. The ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting, {{making it one of}} the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies. Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature. IUPAC as such was established in 1919. One notable country excluded from this early IUPAC is Germany. Germany's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards Germans by the Allied powers after World War I. Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC during 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II.|$|E
