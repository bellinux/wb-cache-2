5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience of <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E

All of the children represented their high school for sport—Don and Ian in athletics, swimming, football and cricket; and Margaret in softball.

5|$|Though the Mellotron was not {{extensively}} {{used in the}} 1980s, {{a number}} of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album Architecture & Morality. Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into limitations of the cheap monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. He bought a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC's Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, and {{thought it would be}} an interesting addition to the group's sound. He bought a second-hand model in 1982 for £165, and first used it on the album Mummer (1983). IQ's Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical quality or convenience.|$|E

5|$|His father {{emigrated to}} New York in 1905. The {{rest of the}} family {{followed}} in 1912, except for 17-year old Lazarus who remained in London. From then on, he lived with the family of Joseph Posener at 292 Commercial Road in the East End of London. At the time, the area was a hub of the Jewish diaspora and {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, a quarter of its population were Jews from Central and Eastern Europe. <b>Growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East End, Aaronson was part of a group of friends who are today referred to as the Whitechapel Boys, all of whom were children of Jewish immigrants and shared literary and artistic ambitions. Others in the group who, like Aaronson, later achieved distinction included John Rodker, Isaac Rosenberg, Joseph Leftwich, Samuel Winsten, Clara Birnberg, David Bomberg, and the brothers Abraham and Joseph Fineberg. Aaronson was also involved in the Young Socialist League, where he and other Whitechapel Boys helped organise educational meetings on modern art and radical politics.
