40|$|Materials are {{utilized}} in <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> such as nuclear reactors, autoclaves, engines, steam generators, down wells, refineries, etc. Understanding how these materials behave in these <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> is paramount for designing robust systems. Traditionally, the material behavior {{is determined by}} placing the material in the form needed for a material parameter measurement (i. e. corrosion growth coupon, creep specimen, compact-tension (CT) specimen, etc.) into its operating environment for a time, removing it, and then measuring the material parameter in a laboratory environment (the so called cook then look method) and then repeating this process. Although this method gives excellent results, it is time consuming and costly. By designing material parameter measurement systems that can operate in the <b>harsh</b> <b>environment,</b> the material parameters can be measured while in the <b>harsh</b> <b>environment,</b> saving the time necessary to remove, measure, and place back into the system the material being tested. The different material measurements of interest and systems capable of making these measurements in the <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAim Certain {{species have}} few living relatives, i. e., occupy low clade ranks. Hence, they possess high {{conservation}} value and scientific interest as unique representatives of ancient lineages. However, {{we do not}} know whether particular environments favour the maintenance of low clade ranks or whether the distribution of environments across the globe affects the global distribution of clade ranks and, hence evolutionary uniqueness. In this study, we tested whether and how <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> decrease the clade ranks of the species that inhabit them. Location Global Methods We described the phylogeny of the collembolan genus Willemia by a parsimonious method based on 52 morphological characters and estimated the species' use of <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> (polar, high-mountain, desert, polluted, waterlogged, saline, and acidic) from 248 publications. Results We found that the use of different types of <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> is maintained among close relatives and has similar phylogenetic signals (except for the use of salinity). The use of <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> might therefore affect the diversification of lineages. Correcting for the phylogenetic non-independence of species, we found that species using <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> have comparatively low clade ranks. We also found that species using <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> occur almost exclusively on former Laurasian continents and that as a statistical consequence, Laurasian species tend to have lower clade ranks. Main Conclusions We suggest that <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> maintain low-clade-rank species by decreasing, simultaneoulsy or successively, extinction and speciation, which may eventually explain the major variation in clade rank across the globe...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} such as automotive, health and energy require micro-sensors and actuators that can survive <b>harsh</b> <b>environments,</b> such as high temperatures, pressures and relative humidity. However, the materials properties of silicon impose limitations on its use in <b>harsh</b> <b>environment</b> and demanding applications. Silicon carbide (SiC) is an alternative semiconducting material that enables such applications because of its wider bandgap and higher melting/sublimation temperature, elastic modulus, fracture toughness, hardness, chemical inertness, and thermal conductivity.

40|$|Microsystems are {{increasingly}} being applied in <b>harsh</b> and/or inaccessible <b>environments,</b> but many markets expect {{the same level of}} functionality for long periods of time. <b>Harsh</b> <b>environments</b> cover areas that can be subjected to high temperature, (bio) -chemical and mechanical disturbances, electromagnetic noise, radiation, or high vacuum. In the field of actuators, the devices must maintain stringent accuracy specifications for displacement, force, and response times, among others. These new requirements present additional challenges in the compensation for or elimination of cross-sensitivities. Many state-of-the-art precision devices lose their precision and reliability when exposed to <b>harsh</b> <b>environments.</b> It is also important that advanced sensor and actuator systems maintain maximum autonomy such that the devices can operate independently with low maintenance. The next-generation microsystems will be deployed in remote and/or inaccessible and <b>harsh</b> <b>environments</b> that present many challenges to sensor design, materials, device functionality, and packaging. All of these aspects of integrated sensors and actuator microsystems require a multidisciplinary approach to overcome these challenges. The main areas of importance are in the fields of materials science, micro/nano-fabrication technology, device design, circuitry and systems, (first-level) packaging, and measurement strategy.
