The paddle shifters have two distinct advantages: the driver can safely keep {{both hands on the}} steering wheel when using the Manual/tiptronic mode; and the driver can temporarily manually override either of the automatic programmes (D or S), and gain instant manual control of the DSG transmission (within the above described constraints).|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} generation, the {{interior}} was not as customizable in the second generation, and many options that were previously available were cut for 1992. The second generation now used only a single seat design shared with all models (the first generation LX got its own unique seat design), and was only available in two configurations; with a front bench seat and a column mounted shifter, or with front bucket seats and a center console with a <b>floor</b> <b>mounted</b> shifter. The console was a carryover from the first generation, although it was redesigned for 1993.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{fractures}} like pelvis fractures, calcaneus or tibia head fractures, etc. need {{an exact}} placement of screws and other surgical implants to allow quickest possible {{treatment of the}} patients. Minimally invasive surgical approaches result in less trauma for the patient and quicker recovery. However, the risk of malpositionins, revisions and nerval damage cannot be underestimated (Malposition and revision rates of different imaging modalities for percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation following pelvic fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis). The possibility {{of the use of}} an angio system with a spatial resolution of 0.1mm, the large field of view to image the entire pelvis in one image and the high kW rate allows the surgeon high precision images while not impairing hygiene (<b>floor</b> <b>mounted</b> systems) or access to the patient (CT). Degenerative spine surgery, traumatic spinal fractures, oncologic fractures or scoliosis surgery are other types of surgery that can be optimized in a hybrid OR. The large field of view and the high kW rate allow to optimally image even obese patients. Navigations systems or the use of integrated laser guidance can support and improve the workflow.|$|E

500|$|Leicester Square is {{the centre}} of London's cinema land, {{and one of the}} signs marking the Square bears the legend [...] "Theatreland". It {{contains}} the cinema with the largest screen and another with the most seats (over 1,600). The square is the prime location in London for film premieres and co-hosts the London Film Festival each year. Similar to Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, the square was surrounded by <b>floor</b> <b>mounted</b> plaques with film stars' names and cast handprints. During the 2010–2012 refurbishment, many of the plaques were removed, confusing tourists who still expected to find them there.|$|E

[...] The sedans could seat a maximum of 6 people with the flip fold console, and 5 people with a regular console.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1996 model year, GM {{renamed the}} model from [...] "Eighty Eight Royale" [...] to three models – Eighty Eight, Eighty Eight LS and LSS (A [...] "Luxury Sports Sedan" [...] {{targeted}} to male European car buyers, available with a supercharged V6 and a <b>floor</b> <b>mounted</b> gear shifter). [...] It {{is important to}} note, however, early LSS models (1995) were rarely equipped with the 3800 Supercharged engine. [...] The LSS was an originally a trim level package on the 88 starting in 1992. In 1996 the LSS received Aurora-inspired seats. 1996 was the final year that the original-style rocket (in black and silver) appeared on a hood emblem. 1997 would welcome the new Oldsmobile logo on all Eighty-Eight trims except the Regency.|$|E

The gear box was controlled with a column-mounted lever in the lower-priced models, but <b>floor</b> <b>mounting</b> of gear levers was by now {{seen as a}} preferred location, and the more expensive models provided this. The automatic gear box, where specified, was also controlled using a floor-mounted level positioned between the two separate front seats.|$|R

2500|$|This Taurus' {{interior}} {{was available in}} two configurations; a front bench seat with a column mounted shifter and the Flip-Fold center console, or bucket seats with a traditional console and a <b>floor</b> <b>mounted</b> shifter. The configuration for a steering column mounted shifter and a center console, which made a brief return for 1999, had been dropped. The interior also contained many new safety features; side airbags, tether straps, and a glow in the dark trunk release mounted inside of the trunk. This interior also contained a new system which Ford called the [...] " [...] Advanced Personal Safety System". This system, {{at the time of}} a collision, would detect the driver and passenger's positions as well as seatbelt usage, and would inflate the airbags to match, possibly preventing airbag-related injuries. For 2004, the interior got a minor revision. This included a new steering wheel with a center airbag pad that was shaped like an upside-down taco and new gauges with a [...] diagnostic center that would tell if there were any problems with the car, as well as average fuel economy. It also was able to perform a [...] "system check" [...] at the driver's request {{to make sure that the}} engine was functioning properly.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "PCC" [...] in this car's {{name comes}} from {{the name of a}} design {{committee}} formed in 1929 as the [...] "Presidents' Conference Committee" [...] and renamed the [...] "Electric Railway Presidents' Conference Committee" [...] (ERPCC) in 1931. [...] This group's membership consisted mostly of representatives of some of the larger operators of urban electric street railways in the United States plus potential manufacturers. [...] Three interurban lines and at least one [...] "heavy rail," [...] or rapid transit, operator - the Chicago Rapid Transit Company - were represented as well. [...] Also included on the membership roll were manufacturers of surface cars (streetcars) and interested component suppliers. The ERPCC goal was to design a streamlined, comfortable, quiet, and fast accelerating and braking streetcar that would be operated by a seated operator utilizing <b>floor</b> <b>mounted</b> pedal controls to better {{meet the needs of the}} street railways and to better appeal to riders. [...] The committee prepared a detailed research plan, conducted extensive research on streetcar design, built and tested components, made necessary modifications and revisions based upon the findings, and, in the end, produced a set of specifications for a standardized and fixed design (albeit one with a modest list of available options with some room for customer customization) to be built with standard parts as opposed to a custom designed carbody with any variety of different parts added depending on the whims and requirements of the individual customer. An excellent product emerged, the PCC car, as was proved in later years by numerous national and international users.|$|E

25|$|In the hangline approach, wood items being {{finished}} are hung by carriers or hangers {{that are}} attached to a conveyor system that moves the items overhead or above the floor space. The conveyor itself can be ceiling mounted, wall mounted or supported by <b>floor</b> <b>mounts.</b> A simple overhead conveyor system can be designed to move wood products through several wood finishing processes in a continuous loop. The hangline approach to automated wood finishing also allows the option of moving items up to warmer air at the ceiling level to speed up drying process.|$|R

After the first race {{of the season in}} Australia, the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car's undertray to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed. Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight line speed. Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 car would not be compromised in any way by the required modifications.|$|R

Other observing instruments on lower floors of the tower were usually lined up directly beneath the eighth <b>floor</b> <b>mounting</b> pad and the rooftop marker, so they shared the same latitude and longitude. The pipe stands shown on floors six and seven of the Nahant Site 131-1A tower probably held azimuth scopes, which were less complex telescopes that determined bearings to a target but not its range from the tower.|$|R
