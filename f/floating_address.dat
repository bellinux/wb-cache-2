40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{structural}} optimization of a <b>floating</b> breakwater is <b>addressed</b> {{through several}} methods concerning its topology and shape, which constitutes a new application. Three methods {{are introduced to}} handle the optimization problem. The first one discusses the shape optimization of a simple predefined geometrical form. The second, studies the topological optimization based on bit array representation of a triangular mesh using genetic algorithms. An attempt to overcome the limitations of bit-array was developed through several steps (new partition element, mesh distinguishing between the representation type and finite element analysis, varying finite element problem size, creating a density vector to control {{the presence or absence}} of the boundaries, generating initial population representing void domains instead of void elements). The third method concerns shape optimization, based on a variable number of points creating a structural domain. In contrary to traditional methods where the variable points are indicated by the user, it searches for the optimum number of points to create the optimum shape. Finally, a comparison between these methods for the case of the floating breakwater is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{modeling}} of tethering elements of seabed anchored <b>floating</b> structures is <b>addressed,</b> with particular {{reference to the}} so-called Archimedes Bridge (submerged floating tunnel, SFT) solution for deep water crossing; attention {{is devoted to the}} design solution encompassing slender bars as anchor elements. Two numerical tools are proposed: firstly, a geometrically nonlinear finite element (NWB model), developed in previous work, has been refined in order to capture the effect of higher flexural modes of anchor bars. Secondly, a 3 D beam element, based on the classical corotational formulation (CR model), has been developed and coded. Both elements are implemented in a numerical procedure for the dynamic time domain step-by-step analysis of nonlinear discretized systems; seismic loading is introduced by generating artificial time histories of spatially variable seismic motion. An example of application of the NWB element is shown regarding the behavior of the dynamic model of a complete SFT. The model was subjected to extreme multiple-support seismic loading. The seismic behavior is here illustrated and commented, {{especially in light of the}} effect of higher local vibration modes of the anchor bars. Finally, a comparison between the performances of the two modeling approaches is presented. Both harmonic and seismic excitations are considered in the test; the results justify the use of the simpler NWB approach, especially in the SFT design phase...|$|R
40|$|Floating {{offshore}} wind turbines {{are taking on}} more and more prominence, as the industry moves towards larger turbines, farther offshore, in deeper water. The increase in turbine size can reduce the costs of {{offshore wind}} energy, but requires larger support structures. Rather than redesigning the structure completely, a rational methodology for upscaling an existing floating substructure can improve {{the efficiency of the}} design process. This work presents a guideline for the optimization and upscaling of a semi-submersible <b>floating</b> platform, <b>addressing</b> also special challenges related to changes in turbine technology, as well as design criteria for floating platforms. The OC 4 semi-submersible platform is used as starting point of this study. Based on analysis results of an initial elementary upscaling procedure, the main criteria, when dealing with a semi-submersible floating platform, are specified. Optimization is then carried out, focusing on stability and eigenfrequencies. Reducing the upper column diameter and changing the ballast position within the columns, yields longer natural periods in heave and pitch, a lighter and cheaper platform, and a less over-conservative, but still stable and safe system. Based on this optimized design, a guideline for an upscaling procedure for any other turbine is given. The main scaling factor is determined from the mass ratio of the top structures, rather than the turbine rating. The main column is scaled, so that it fits the new tower base diameter. The scaling factor for the upper columns is computed, based on the ratio of the overturning moments, and considers the contribution of the different columns to the stiffness component in pitch. The mooring line length is scaled, such that it can yield a predefined stiffness. Finally, the controller gains are recalculated, based on the expected natural frequency in pitch. The optimization and upscaling process is carried out for Fraunhofer's offshore wind turbine IWT- 7. 5 - 164 and the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine. The floating wind turbines are analyzed, modelled and simulated by means of simplified spreadsheet methods, linear frequency-domain calculations (in DNV's software HydroD), and detailed equation-based models (in Fraunhofer's software Modelica). The systems are evaluated regarding their eigenfrequencies, nominal pitch, stability and global performance in selected sea states, taking variable buoyancy and center of buoyancy into account, and adjusting the blade-pitch controller gains. The results, obtained from both computer programs and the initial hand calculations, are comparable and satisfying. The structural integrity is proved by a simplified approach, using tank pressure and sea pressure for computing the equivalent stress. More detailed strength checks for fatigue and ultimate limit states, as well as optimization of the mooring system, are left for future work...|$|R
40|$|The project {{addresses}} for {{the first}} time the development of large size NAND Flash memories based on the charge trapping mechanism, instead of the conventional floating gate concept, for technology generations in the range of 36 - 28 nm. The project was started in 2008 with the target to develop a NAND Flash memory technology for mass storage based on the charge trapping mechanism, instead of the conventional <b>floating</b> gate concept, <b>addressing</b> technology generations in the range of 36 - 28 nm. The final objective of the project was to demonstrate the potential of the concept on demonstrator, realized by the industrial partners, with a target size close to the foreseen upper limit of the technology, in the order of the Gigabyte (= 8 Gigabit). The motivation of the project was coming from the increasing demand for compact memory storage from a variety of ICT applications, mainly in the field of portable devices. One of the success factors of the solid-state Flash memories was not only their small cell size, but also their strong scalability that had enabled the continuous decrease of the cost per bit (Moore’s law), so that larger and larger memories have become affordable at very reasonable costs. Beside the economical importance of the market, which has been growing at a rate of more than 30 % per year, the development of low cost solid-state mass-storage memories was seen as a critical enabling factor for other ICT segments, like:Smart PhonesDigital Consumer ElectronicsPortable computersPortable information storageNavigation SystemsFull medical records on one cardData base for image recognition and biometric systemsDuring the first year of the project it appeared evident that the evolution of the standard floating gate NAND technology was going to be faster than expected, with devices in the 30 - 35 nm generation being announced by several companies. It was therefore decided to change the overall targets of the project, putting the final objective in the 22 - 25 nm range (comparable with the expected state-of-the-art in 2011) and anticipating a first full size demonstrator of the technology in the available 45 nm generation...|$|R
40|$|Obvious {{examples}} include inequities in our {{criminal justice system}} and in school funding. Much has been written on those and other topics. This article focuses on another example, specifically on how a sweeping change to an obscure banking rule regulating the check collection process has negatively affected consumers in general, and minority groups in particular. U. S. check collections require a complex system comprised of a variety of institutions including commercial banks, savings and loans, savings banks, and credit unions, as well as the customers who rely upon them to collect payments from far and near. Traditionally, the check collection process, including the timing rules under U. C. C. Article Four, was inherently cumbersome and slow to honor the payee’s right to receive immediate payment of funds from the paying bank. Frustration among payees, which grew due to not having their funds available fast enough because of delays that were inherent within the system, led lawmakers and others to reform the check collection timing rules [...] It has now been more than twenty years since Congress passed the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA), which empowered the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to regulate the speed with which commercial banks are required to make funds available to depositors after their checks were deposited for collection. There is evidence, however, that these reforms have had an negative impact on checking account customers as a whole, but in particular, a disproportionate impact on minority communities. Specifically, by reducing the maximum amount of waiting time between the date of deposit and the date when funds are available to deposit customers, the reforms also reduced the time that the funds were available to the check-issuing consumer. Thus, in every checking transaction, checking account customers lost the benefit of the float that was built into every transaction under the traditional U. C. C. rules. It is my thesis, therefore, that recent reforms in the timing rules that regulate the speed of the check collection process have indeed reduced the wait time for funds to be available, but have also resulted in increases in the appetite for various risky cash management alternatives by consumers to obtain the money that under old timing rules would stay in their deposit accounts for a longer period. Put another way, consumers who issued checks liked <b>float,</b> too! To <b>address</b> this problem, I will propose two recommendations that can provide a remedy for consumers, at their option. First, that the definition of “check” should be changed under both state and federal commercial law to remove the limitation that all checks are due on demand. Second, I propose that the federal check collection timing rules should be amended to require banks to honor checks that are payable on a definite due date just as they honor those that are payable on demand...|$|R
40|$|As {{human beings}} are {{becoming}} more and more aware of importance of the environment, resorts to clean energy have provoked great interest for the past decades. As a sort of clean power, wind has been widely considered as an ideal energy source to generate electricity. That is why the offshore wind farm plans have been drawn up, specifically in North Sea in Europe. Besides, in order to comply with marine spatial planning which aims to make use of marine resources sustainably, seaweed aquaculture will also be operated among wind farm zone under wind turbines, which provides the food necessity for mankind. The introduction of seaweed aquaculture may have influences on local hydrodynamics as seaweed attenuates waves, which may further affect the environment. This effect has not been understood. Therefore this study is conducted to investigate the impact of seaweed aquaculture on wind waves. As a relatively young sector, few studies have been found on the effect of floating vegetation on waves. Since there is no ready-to-use hydrodynamic model which can deal with floating seaweed, it is required to set up a numerical model and calibrate this model with experimental data. In this research the wave modelling program SWAN is used owing to the fact that there exists a vegetation model in SWAN. In this model the vegetation is schematised as stiff cylinders mounted at the bottom. The energy dissipation by vegetation is calculated as work carried out by the drag force induced by cylinders. However, the function of this vegetation model in SWAN is somewhat different from what is required for this study. 9 ̆ 5 Firstly, the SWAN deals with bottom-mounted vegetation while in this research <b>floating</b> vegetation is <b>addressed.</b> 9 ̆ 5 Secondly, in SWAN model stiff objects are considered while in current research the vegetation possesses flexibility. With flexibility the drag force will become smaller as the relative velocity between water particle and vegetation gets smaller. On the other hand, the inertial force may have an impact on the wave energy dissipation. Considering these two differences, corresponding measures need to be taken to meet the requirement of this study. To model the floating vegetation, the original vegetation model has been modified. In the beginning, the floating vegetation model is achieved by dividing the vegetation into two vertical layers and making the lower layer virtual. There is drawback in this model: only flatbed can be applied. For sensitivity analysis and calibration this model works well, but it is not applicable in the case study as non-flat seabed is implemented in the model setup. It leads to a second modification in the SWAN model. The method is to alter the interval of integration of dissipation term by vegetation, which results in further change in the source code. To account for the flexibility, the bulk drag coefficient is adjusted. This parameter accommodates the influence of flexibility of vegetation and uncertainty of other parameters related to the model. To test this floating vegetation model a sensitivity analysis is performed. Relevant parameters in this model are varied to see its individual influence on the wave dissipation. It has been observed that a larger wave height results in a higher dissipation rate. The opposite has been seen for wave period. Wave with a larger peak period gives a smaller wave height behind the vegetation field. It has been also demonstrated that larger vegetation length, larger vegetation diameter and larger vegetation density give rise to greater dissipation rates. In addition, spectrum analysis shows that the energy dissipation rate varies along the frequency domain with the greatest magnitude of energy dissipation observed at around the peak frequency. To calibrate this model the experimental data is used, obtained from flume test in Technology University of Braunschweig. The calibration is conducted by adjusting the bulk drag coefficient until that the floating vegetation model describes the experiment data. By this method a fitted drag coefficient is obtained for each wave condition. It has been verified that drag coefficient depends on both the wave condition and vegetation parameters. The relation between wave condition and vegetation characteristic is indicated by KC-number or Reynolds number. Through this calibration a relation between drag coefficient and Reynolds number or KC-number is obtained. With the calibrated model, a case study is conducted in the North Sea. The dominant wave data for the period 1991 - 2010 is used, as well as corresponding wind information. The vegetation parameters (vegetation density, vegetation width and vegetation length) are set according to local cultivation. With this information and the drag coefficient function obtained from the calibration stage, the drag coefficient for the field condition is obtained. Implementing all relevant input parameters in the model, the result shows that the dissipation is species specific. Also from the results it is shown that wave attenuation occurs mainly in the local scale. Behind the vegetation field waves develop due to the directional spreading. At the South boundary 85...|$|R
