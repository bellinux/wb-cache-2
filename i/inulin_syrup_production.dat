Carbohydrate composition of HFIS with different degrees of polymerization was studied; fructose, sucrose, dianhydrides of fructose (DFAs), inulobiose, kestoses and inulotriose were detected in all the samples. Honey adulterations with 5 %, 10 % and 20 % of HFIS were performed. Inulotriose proved to be the best marker of honey adulteration with these syrups since it was not detected in any of the honey samples analyzed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fertilizer}} was examined on 15 sugar maple stands in eastern Ontario managed for <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> that sustained 7 % to 72 % ice-induced crown damage. Stands {{were divided into}} 4 plots that received the following fertilizer treatments: dolomitic lime – calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K), and lime plus P+K treatments and no fertilizer in June 1999. The effects of crown damage level and fertilization on root starch, sap volume, sap sugar content, <b>syrup</b> <b>production,</b> and tap hole closure rate were examined during Phase I of this study, which ran from 1998 to 2001. During Phase II fall root starch content and stem diameter growth (fall of 2003), sap volume and sugar content, hourly block temperatures measured during the sap run (spring of 2004), and tap hole closure (fall of 2004) were examined and effects on <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> calculated. Fall root starch content, sap volume, and tap hole closure rate were not affected by crown damage level. Sugar content of sap was reduced in trees with moderate (26 - 50 %) and severe (> 50 %) damage. Moderate damage also lowered <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> per tap. Daily air temperature amplitudes were about 1 oC greater in moderately and severely damaged stands compared to lightly (0 - 25 %) damaged stands. Moderately and severely damaged trees also had less stem diameter growth in 1999, 2000, and 2001, but not in 2002 and 2003. The fertilizer and lime treatments had no significant effects.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a pilot project {{exploring}} the impacts of climate change on maple <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> in understudied near north, Ontario spaces. Maple syrup is produced by settler, Métis and First Nations communities for commercial distribution {{and as part of}} a mixed subsistence economy. The focus on maple syrup is opportune, since <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> and sugar maple trees (Acer saccharum) are extremely susceptible to climate change and the biophysical and social impacts of climate change on maple <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> in the near north of Ontario have yet to be understood. Given that the process of developing research is under-reported and that this project has had the opportunity to undertake a funded development process, this paper describes and assesses our process of ‘coming to know’, which has been guided by the following objectives: 1) to undertake an exploratory investigation of the nature of available data about long-term <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> and climate change in both settler and Indigenous communities, 2) to include and valorize marginalized Indigenous voices and ecologies, 3) to focus on collecting climate change data from understudied near north spaces, 4) to assess the availability and quality of ecological and quantitative data in order to enhance locally-relevant understandings of climate change, and 5) to work towards the development of a cross-cultural and transdisciplinary methodological framework within which to accomplish the first four objectives. We approach these objectives across disciplinary boundaries and cultural perspectives, and with growing relationships with community partners. We describe the rich sources of information found through the pilot study and discuss highlights of our on-going process of developing our research project...|$|R

5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and maple sugar.

Other stories credit the development of maple <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance.

40|$|Sugar maple <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> is an {{important}} economic activity for eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. Since annual variations in syrup yield have been related to climate, there are concerns about the impacts of climatic change on the industry in the upcoming decades. Although the temporal variability of syrup yield has been studied for specific sites on different time scales or for large regions, a model capable of accounting for both temporal and regional differences in yield is still lacking. In the present study, we studied the factors responsible for interregional and interannual variability in maple syrup yield over the 2001 – 2012 period, by combining the data from 8 Quebec regions (Canada) and 10 U. S. states. The resulting model explained 44. 5 % of the variability in yield. It includes the effect of climatic conditions that precede the sapflow season (variables from the previous growing season and winter), the effect of climatic conditions during the current sapflow season, and terms accounting for intercountry and temporal variability. Optimal conditions for maple <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> appear to be spatially restricted by less favourable climate conditions occurring {{during the growing season}} in the north, and in the south, by the warmer winter and earlier spring conditions. This suggests that climate change may favor maple <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> northwards, while southern regions {{are more likely to be}} negatively affected by adverse spring conditions...|$|R

40|$|Maple <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> {{has become}} {{not only a}} popular hobby but also a small {{business}} venture for many home producers throughout the world. Maple <b>syrup</b> <b>production</b> involves the collection of sap from maple trees, followed by a relatively simple processing operation to increase the sugar concentration of the substance. Costs for home producers are relatively high due to high capital and energy costs. In {{an effort to reduce}} these costs, reverse osmosis systems have been incorporated to concentrate the sap before boiling. This process reduces the necessary boiling time, thereby reducing labor and energy costs. However, these reverse osmosis systems are typically too expensive for home producers to afford.
