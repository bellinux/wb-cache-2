5|$|The {{concert was}} {{initially}} {{scheduled for a}} single performance, but after selling out within twelve hours a second concert was added prior in the same day in Cologne. This too sold out, {{resulting in a total}} attendance of over 4000. A third performance was held almost six years later on June 18, 2017 in Paris, and a fourth just after on June 20, 2017 in London. A recording of the concert was published as a two-disc album on December 28, 2011 by Dog Ear Records, Uematsu's own record label. The albums, along with the concerts themselves, received varied reviews, with some critics giving enthusiastic praise, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> <b>to</b> the quality of the performance, the choice of source material, {{and the quality of the}} arrangements, while other critics greatly disliked several of the arrangements.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> <b>to</b> the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Athens, the Athenian {{democracy}} was restored on three separate occasions following the initial {{conquest of the}} city by Antipater in 322 BC. However, when it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state, their membership determined by {{the value of their}} property. Yet other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy. After Philip II conquered Amphipolis in 357 BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (boule), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs. However, Philippi, the city founded by Philip II, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (ecclesia) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues, although evidence is lacking as to whether this was derived from local taxation or grants from the royal court. The Macedonian king and central government otherwise sustained strict control over the finances administered by other cities, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> <b>to</b> the revenues generated by temples and cultic priesthoods.|$|E
5|$|Upon formation, the AIF {{consisted}} {{of only one}} infantry division, the 1st Division, and the 1st Light Horse Brigade. The 1st Division {{was made up of}} the 1st Infantry Brigade under Colonel Henry MacLaurin, an Australian-born officer with previous part-time military service; the 2nd, under Colonel James Whiteside McCay, an Irish-born Australian politician and former Minister for Defence; and the 3rd, under Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan, a British regular officer seconded to the Australian Army before the war. The 1st Light Horse Brigade was commanded by Colonel Harry Chauvel, an Australian regular, while the divisional artillery was commanded by Colonel Talbot Hobbs. The initial response for recruits was so good that in September 1914 {{the decision was made to}} raise the 4th Infantry Brigade and 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades. The 4th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Colonel John Monash, a prominent Melbourne civil engineer and businessman. The AIF continued to grow through the war, eventually numbering five infantry divisions, two mounted divisions and a mixture of other units. As the AIF operated within the British war effort, its units were generally organised along the same lines as comparable British Army formations. However, there were often small differences between the structures of British and Australian units, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> <b>to</b> the AIF infantry divisions' support units.|$|E

25|$|Fielding {{hoped to}} remove any moral {{ambiguity}} found within The Beggar's Opera. Unlike The Welsh Opera, the rewrite deals with morality at the very beginning. Similarly, the play focuses on problems within the literary community; the title links the play with the Grub Street Journal, a periodical that satirised inept writers that frequent Grub Street. It also links the play with Fielding's previous attacks on the London theatre and inept writers. In particular, Fielding satirises bad imitations of Gay's The Beggar's Opera {{and those who do}} not understand what Gay's play was originally about <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> <b>to</b> its mockery of the Italian opera tradition.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties. The genetic basis of response to herbivory is being explored in tall fescue, where it appears the production of jasmonic acid {{may play a role in}} downregulation of the host plant’s chemical defense pathways when a fungal endophyte is present. In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for secondary metabolite production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants. This represents an important line of inquiry to pursue, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> <b>to</b> understanding the chemical pathways that can be utilized in biotechnological applications.|$|E
25|$|The disease triangle, {{consisting}} of host, environment, and pathogen, {{is an important}} concept, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> <b>to</b> plant pathology. In this case, the pathogen is Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Agrobacteria have the widest host range of any plant pathogen, so the main factor {{to take into consideration}} in the case of crown gall is environment. There are various conditions and factors that make for a conducive environment for A. tumefaciens when infecting its various hosts. For example, the bacterium requires the host plant to be wounded, as this is where the invasion occurs. Factors leading to wounds in plants include cultural practices, grafting, freezing injury, growth cracks, soil insects, and other animals in the environment causing damage to the plant. Thus, in exceptionally harsh winters, it's common to have an increased incidence of crown gall due to the weather-related damage. Along with this, there are methods of mediating infection of the host plant. For example, nematodes can act as a vector to introduce Agrobacterium into plant roots.|$|E
25|$|In his old age Yan {{also found}} {{time to work on}} a {{dictionary}} and related literary projects. In his 26 chapter book Yanshi jiaxun 顏氏家訓 ("The Family Instructions of Master Yan") Yan Zhitui left an entire written compendium of his own philosophy and life-advice to his sons, advising them on which paths to take and which paths to avoid in order to gain success in life. In addition, he also made observations about the differences between Northern and Southern China of his time, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>regards</b> <b>to</b> language, customs, and culture. He wrote that he formed many bad habits in life that took years to overcome because his elder brother had not been strict enough with him in the absence of their father. He stressed the need to acquire a good education, since well-educated ministers were chosen for posts, while others who had prestigious family lines for centuries wound up working on farms or tending to horses in the stable if they were not properly educated. Although he stressed the need for mastering calligraphy, painting, and playing the musical instrument of the lute (guqin), he warned against them from practicing too much and gaining too much skill. This was because those of higher rank, in a degrading and humiliating fashion, could easily call upon them to constantly entertain and produce fanciful calligraphy, poetry, or a musical song on the spot. Yan Zhitui was an antiquarian {{when it came to the}} prized calligraphy in his family's collection, with written pieces in his possession that were originally penned by the masters of early calligraphy, Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi.|$|E
