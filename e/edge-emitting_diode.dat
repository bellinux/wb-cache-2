40|$|After the {{invention}} of lasers, in the past 50 years progress made in laser-based display technology has been very promising, with commercial products awaiting release to the mass market. Compact laser sys-tems, such as <b>edge-emitting</b> <b>diodes,</b> vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, and optically pumped semi-conductor lasers, are suitable candidates for laser-based displays. Laser speckle is an important concern, as it degrades image quality. Typically, one or multiple speckle reduction techniques are employed in laser displays to reduce speckle contrast. Likewise, laser safety issues need to be carefully evaluated in designing laser displays under different usage scenarios. Laser beam shaping using refractive and diffractive components {{is an integral part}} of laser displays, and the requirements depend on the source specifications, modulation technique, and the scanning method being employed in the display.

While in the first approach, based on the scalar wave simplification, optical fields within laser resonators are found to be composed of the TE modes, an alternative, more precise vectorial approach leads to the hybrid modes: EH and HE. Advantages and disadvantages of both methods are discussed and their validity limits in determination of mode intensities are compared.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the square-wave (SW) self-modulation output of an <b>edge-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> laser subject to polarization rotated optical feedback in detail, both experimentally and theoretically. Our experimental {{results show that}} the 2 τ-periodic SW, where τ is the delay of the feedback, coexists with other SW oscillations of shorter periods. We have found that these new SWs are specific harmonics of the fundamental one and their periods are P(n) ≃ 2 τ/(1 + 2 n), where n is an integer. Numerical simulations and analytical studies of laser rate equations confirm the multistability of SW solutions. By adding a weak conventional optical feedback, we show that the switching between the different periodic SWs can be easily controlled. The delay of this feedback control is the key parameter determining the harmonic that is stabilized. Numerical simulations corroborate the effectiveness of our experimental control scheme.

40|$|Solid-state lasers {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} as attractive drivers for inertial confinement fusion on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and at the Omega Facility at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) in Rochester, NY. For power plant applications, these lasers must be pumped by semiconductor diode lasers to achieve the required laser system efficiency, repetition rate, and lifetime. Inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plants will require approximately 40 -to- 80 GW of peak pump power, and must operate efficiently and with high system availability for decades. These considerations lead to requirements on the efficiency, price, and production capacity of the semiconductor pump sources. This document provides a brief summary of these requirements, {{and how they can}} be met by a natural evolution of the current semiconductor laser industry. The detailed technical requirements described in this document flow down from a laser ampl 9 ifier design described elsewhere. In brief, laser amplifiers comprising multiple Nd:glass gain slabs are face-pumped by two planar diode arrays, each delivering 30 to 40 MW of peak power at 872 nm during a {approx} 200 {micro}s quasi-CW (QCW) pulse with a repetition rate in the range of 10 to 20 Hz. The baseline design of the diode array employs a 2 D mosaic of submodules to facilitate manufacturing. As a baseline, they envision that each submodule is an array of vertically stacked, 1 cm wide, <b>edge-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> bars, an industry standard form factor. These stacks are mounted on a common backplane providing cooling and current drive. Stacks are conductively cooled to the backplane, to minimize both diode package cost and the number of fluid interconnects for improved reliability. While the baseline assessment in this document is based on edge-emitting devices, the amplifier design does not preclude future use of surface emitting diodes, which may offer appreciable future cost reductions and increased reliability. The high-level requirements on the semiconductor lasers involve reliability, price points on a price-per-Watt basis, and a set of technical requirements. The technical requirements for the amplifier design in reference 1 are discussed in detail and are summarized in Table 1. These values are still subject to changes as the overall laser system continues to be optimized. Since pump costs can be a significant fraction of the overall laser system cost, it is important to achieve sufficiently low price points for these components. At this time, the price target for tenth-of-akind IFE plant is $ 0. 007 /Watt for packaged devices. At this target level, the pumps account for approximately one third of the laser cost. The pump lasers should last {{for the life of the}} power plant, leading to a target component lifetime requirement of roughly 14 Ghosts, corresponding to a 30 year plant life and 15 Hz repetition rate. An attractive path forward involes pump operation at high output power levels, on a Watts-per-bar (Watts/chip) basis. This reduces the cost of pump power (price-per-Watt), since to first order the unit price does not increase with power/bar. The industry has seen a continual improvement in power output, with current 1 cm-wide bars emitting up to 500 W QCW (quasi-continuous wave). Increased power/bar also facilitates achieving high irradiance in the array plane. On the other hand, increased power implies greater heat loads and (possibly) higher current drive, which will require increased attention to thermal management and parasitic series resistance. Diode chips containing multiple p-n junctions and quantum wells (also called nanostack structures) may provide an additional approach to reduce the peak current...|$|E

In the area of bulk crystal growth, high-quality 3 -inch ZnO wafers grown by the hydrothermal method have become available, and Bridgman growth has also been developed. In the thin-film area, excellent ZnO layers have been grown by liquid-phase epitaxy. Other types of epitaxial material have also shown improvements, and the quantum Hall effect has now been observed, along with photoluminescence (PL) linewidths as low as 110 μeV. In the area of impurity characterization, radioactive-tracer methods have been used to make positive identifications of the PL donor-bound exciton lines I 8 and I 9, as due to Ga and In, respectively. Our understanding of the common impurity H has also advanced, because it is now known from both theory and experiment that interstitial H is not stable at room temperature. The same is true of the native interstitials, ZnI and OI. New results suggest that the common H-related shallow donor is probably multibonded H substitutional on an O site, and the ZnI-related shallow donor is probably a complex, such as ZnI-NO.

40|$|An {{electrically}} pumped {{gallium nitride}} vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser exhibits promising performance at a wavelength of 462 nm, achieved with excellent electrical properties. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) contain two high-reflectivity distributed-Bragg reflectors (DBRs) {{as well as}} a short cavity characterized by a small optical-mode volume. They emit a single longitudinal mode in a circularly symmetric beam with little beam divergence. Both characteristics are superior to those achieved with edge-emitting lasers and desirable for many practical applications in, for example, high-density optical stor-age and laser printing. In addition, the strong field in the micro-cavity facilitates exploration of cavity quantum-electrodynamics effects, such as single-photon and polariton emission, controlled spontaneous emission, and low threshold (or thresholdless) lasing. Over the past decade, two developments have affected the realization of electrically pumped gallium nitride (GaN) -based VCSELs. First, high-reflectivity, high-quality DBRs composed of AlxGa 1 −xN and GaN exhibit a large lattice mismatch that forms cracks in the epitaxially grown DBR structure. These cracks could result in a reduction in optical reflectivity and become a leakage-current path. The second is the fabrication of novel, high-transparency, high-conductivity contacts for current injec-tion, which was triggered by the difficulties encountered in constructing low-resistance p-type GaN layers. In 1996, GaN-based <b>edge-emitting</b> laser <b>diodes</b> were first real-ized at room temperature by Nakamura’s team. 1 Arakawa and co-workers subsequently fabricated an In 0. 1 Ga 0. 9 N VCSEL and observed lasing at 77 K {{for the first time in}} 1998. 2 We recently fabricated a crack-free high-reflectivity DBR by incorporating AlN/GaN superlattice layers between the DBR structures to reduce V-shaped defects and act as strain buffers. 3 Figure 1 shows the device structure employing hybrid mir-rors.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} one of {{the last}} hurdles to optoelectronic integration on silicon, namely the incorporation of room-temperature, electrically-pumped <b>edge-emitting</b> laser <b>diodes.</b> To this end, thin (- 6 pm) InP-based multiple quantum well (MQW) ridge laser platelets emitting at a wavelength of 1550 nm have been manufactured and integrated by metal-to-metal bonding onto silicon substrates. These laser platelets {{can be thought of as}} freestanding optoelectronic building blocks that can be integrated as desired on diverse substrates. These blocks are fully processed lasers, with both top side and bottom side electrical contacts. The thinness of these optoelectronic building blocks and the precision with which their dimensions are defined are conducive to assembling them in dielectric recesses on a substrate, such as silicon, as part of an end-fire coupled, coaxial alignment optoelectronic integration strategy. They are assembled by a micro-scale pick and place technique that allows the blocks to be picked up individually and placed as desired on any substrate. Integration is accomplished by metal-to-metal solder bonding. To enable the manufacture of these laser blocks, a novel micro-cleaving process technology has been developed. This novel micro-cleaving process is used to simultaneously obtain both smooth end laser facets and precisely defined laser cavity lengths. As a proof of concept, this process has been shown to achieve nominal cavity lengths of 300 pm +/- 1. 25 pm. It is believed that this micro-cleaving process could be used in the future to make thin platelet lasers having much shorter cavity lengths and with better than 1. 25 pm length precision. For the 300 pm long, 6,am thin, micro-cleaved ridge platelet lasers integrated onto silicon substrates, continuous-wave lasing at temperatures as high as 55 "C and pulsed lasing at temperatures to at least 80 "C have been achieved. (cont.) These lasers have output powers as high as 26. 8 mW (at T = 10. 3 oC), differential efficiencies as high as 81 % (at T = 10. 3 oC), and threshold currents as low as 18 mA (at T = 10. 3 oC). The characteristic temperatures, To and T 1, of the lasers on silicon were measured to be 43 K and 85 K, respectively. To put the performance of these integrated micro-cleaved ridge lasers on silicon in perspective, conventionally cleaved multiple quantum well (MQW) ridge lasers on their native InP substrate were also fabricated and tested. The thin micro-cleaved ridge platelet lasers integrated onto silicon outperformed the conventional lasers on InP in terms of thermal characteristics (maximum operating temperature, To, and T 1), output power, and differential efficiency. The structure of this thesis is as follows. First, the motivation for this work and the historical evolution of the optoelectronics field are briefly described. Next, the various optoelectronic integration techniques that have been pursued over the years and their limits are presented. The novel fabrication processes developed to manufacture these platelet lasers is then described in detail. Specifics on the characterization methods and measurement results of both the micro-cleaved ridge lasers on silicon and the conventionally cleaved ridge lasers on native InP substrates are presented. A technique, Magnetically Assisted Statistical Assembly, that could be potentially used to scale the integration technology to ultra-high densities of optoelectronic components is then theoretically described. Finally, the thesis concludes with a comparison with other state of the art results in the literature and proposes further directions for this research effort. by Joseph J. Rumpler, II. Thesis (Ph.
