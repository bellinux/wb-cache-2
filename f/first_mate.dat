40|$|The {{effect of}} {{age at the}} <b>first</b> <b>mating</b> and herd size were {{evaluated}} in the reference Spanish Databank (BDporc) of 37 698 sows born between 1991 and 1995 and with individual lifetime records. The data included dates of births at entrance and culling, <b>first</b> <b>mating,</b> repetitive <b>mating</b> and conception, <b>first</b> farrowing and weaning records. Individual records were validated before the analysis by screening them through a tolerance “filter” in order to eliminate the extreme values from the analysis. The total database of the sows was classified in 7 classes according to age at the <b>first</b> <b>mating</b> (270 days) and in 6 classes of herd size (800 sows). The total number of litters and number of weaned piglets obtained from each sow during the lifetime production were significantly (P 800 sow-herds. Furthermore, a significant (P < 0. 001) interaction between age at the <b>first</b> <b>mating</b> and herd size was detected and {{can be associated with}} a particular pattern for the herd size class 401 – 600 sows with the best performances obtained for the sows <b>first</b> <b>mated</b> at less than 200 days. For the other herd sizes, the results indicated that sows <b>mated</b> for the <b>first</b> time at the right age, 221 – 240 days, are more productive, both in the number and size of the parities throughout lifetime production...|$|R

5|$|On September 30, gales {{from the}} former {{hurricane}} swept across the Great Lakes. Hundreds of spectators lined the shores of Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, to watch the enormous waves.

The schooner Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while the barge Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, <b>first</b> <b>mate,</b> and cook were safely rescued.

Eleven {{years after his}} film debut, Day-Lewis had a small part in the film Gandhi (1982) as Colin, a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character. In late 1982 he had his big theatre break {{when he took over}} the lead in Another Country. The following year, he had a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal <b>first</b> <b>mate</b> in The Bounty, after which he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, <b>first</b> <b>mate</b> James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E
40|$|Although {{only the}} <b>first</b> <b>mating</b> is {{effective}} for females in Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae), {{it remains unclear}} whether this is also true for closely related species, such as T. kanzawai. To address this question, I analyzed paternity in the progeny of T. kanzawai females that had been observed to copulate with two males by using a microsatellite DNA marker. In this study, mating was allowed to take place without experimental interruption. The results show that progenies were sired by both males in only 1 of 14 families, whereas progeny were sired only by the first males in the other families. This result suggests that only the <b>first</b> <b>mating</b> would be, by and large, effective in T. kanzawai...|$|R
40|$|Female remating {{with more}} than one male leads to {{coexistence}} of sperm from different males in the same female, thus creating a selection pressure on sperm. To understand the extent of divergence in the reproductive behaviour among closely related species, in the present study, the influence of <b>first</b> <b>mating</b> histories like mating latency, duration of copulation and age of flies have been analysed on female remating behaviour in closely related Drosophila nasuta subgroup species with varying levels of reproductive isolation. The time taken for the once mated females to remate varied from 7 days in D. s. sulfurigaster to 19 days in D. s. neonasuta after <b>first</b> <b>mating.</b> The female remating frequency varied from a minimum of 29 % in D. s. neonasuta to a maximum of 95 % in D. s. sulfurigaster. The younger flies, which had remating latency of three times less than aged flies, show 100 % remating frequency. In addition, it was observed that the duration of copulation in the <b>first</b> <b>mating</b> influences the remating behaviour among the nasuta subgroup members. The results revealed that D. nasuta subgroup members despite being closely related differ in their reproductive behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the calving to first service interval and several measures of reproductive performance were examined in 1738 lactation records from cows in 32 southern Ontario Holstein herds. Lactation records were divided into three separate health categories based on postpartal disease histories. Relationships between the calving to first service interval and the first service conception rate, number of services per conception and open interval were similar for all three categories. The first service conception rate was lower and {{the average number of}} services per conception higher in cows <b>first</b> <b>mated</b> before 60 days when compared to cows <b>first</b> <b>mated</b> after 60 days. The relationship between the calving to first service interval and the open interval indicated that for each day that mating was delayed the open interval was extended by 0. 86 days. Overall conception rates may be lower for cows <b>first</b> <b>mated</b> very early or very late, but differences in the overall conception rate were only significant for cows with a reproductive tract infection. Unless very expensive semen is being used, it is suggested that disease free cows be <b>mated</b> at the <b>first</b> heat occurring after 40 days postpartum, and that cows with postpartal disease be <b>mated</b> at the <b>first</b> heat occurring after 60 days postpartum. ...|$|R
