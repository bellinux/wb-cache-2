500|$|Black's {{voice has}} been {{described}} as raspy, death growls often appearing in her music. In an interview with The Advocate, Black revealed that she has always had this talent and that it is something she has never practiced. RedOne, the producer who signed her to his label, says that Black's voice and attitude reminded him of Joan Jett. He concluded that [...] "he can scream and <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>with</b> her voice that nobody can do. She is uncompromising in pursuing her own creative vision. She's taking everything that's old and making it futuristic and bringing rock and roll back in her own way." [...] Black styled her musical genre [...] "horror-pop". It {{has been described}} as the love child between Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears, a fusion of dance-pop and darker industrial themes. Black cites that Spears inspires her deep love for choreography, while Manson inspires the sound and attitude of her lyrics and performance style.|$|E
500|$|Byrom is a midfielder, {{and is more}} {{comfortable}} in the centre of midfield. He is left-footed, although the left side is not his natural position, and he is rarely deployed as a winger. In 2007, Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said that Byrom has [...] "tremendous skill and potential", adding [...] "Joel is a quality player. He can <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>with</b> the ball that players on the television can't. In May 2009, Stevenage manager Graham Westley believed that the acquisition of Byrom would [...] "give the squad more balance", and has also described him as having a [...] "cultured left-foot" [...] that enables him to open up opposition defences. On securing the signature of Byrom, Westley said, [...] "Joel is very creative going forward {{and is going to}} be one hell of a player. I was delighted to secure his signature as he is a real talent". Dino Maamria has called Byrom a [...] "creative midfielder", as well as being able to unlock defences. Byrom has called himself [...] "a good passer of the ball", as well as being able to [...] "chip in with a few goals and generally get the team ticking over". In March 2010, following Stevenage's 3–0 win against Crawley Town, a game in which Byrom scored a goal from just inside Crawley's half, Westley said that Byrom has the [...] "ability to score spectacular goals".|$|E
500|$|Kurt sets up Burt with Finn's widowed mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) in {{the episode}} [...] "Home", hoping {{it will help}} him become closer to Finn, who he has a crush on. The {{relationship}} has become serious before Finn finds out about it, and he is initially hostile to it, but begins to bond with Burt over sports when the two families go out to dinner. It is implied that Burt's motivation to build a connection with Finn is more out of his knowledge that Finn never had a father to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>with,</b> and not favoritism over his own son. However, Kurt feels left out, and later asks Finn to help him break up their parents. Finn initially agrees, but changes his mind after Burt tells him that he loves Carole and would never hurt her. In [...] "Laryngitis", Kurt feels increasingly jealous of how much time Burt is spending with Finn, so he attempts to emulate Burt's personality to regain Burt's attention. When Burt takes Finn to yet another event without including Kurt, a hurt and angry Kurt drops his emulation {{of his father and}} sings [...] "". Burt overhears his performance, praises Kurt's singing and apologizes for not spending enough time with him. He assures Kurt that he still loves him and always will, no matter what his son chooses to be.|$|E

500|$|... "Business School" [...] was {{the second}} Office episode written by Brent Forrester. [...] Forrester had {{previously}} written [...] "The Merger". [...] The episode {{was the first to}} be directed by Joss Whedon. [...] Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode [...] "because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show." [...] When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke, stating [...] "Didn't I just leave this party?" [...] in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny. Especially when people died. And {{a lot of people do}} die in [...]" [...] But upon completing the episode, Whedon stated [...] "That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun." [...] Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. [...] "I wouldn't say freedom to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>with</b> it...But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated." [...] At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn't suit Whedon. [...] "I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.'" [...] Whedon said that he held up filming for over an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.|$|E

She argues that [...] "aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film".

2500|$|Flowers {{were the}} subject of many of Van Gogh's {{paintings}} in Paris, due in great part to his regard for flowers. As said to his brother, [...] "You will see that by making a habit of looking at Japanese pictures you will come to love to make up bouquets and <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>with</b> flowers all the more." [...] To his sister, Wil, Van Gogh advised her to cultivate her own garden, like Voltaire's Candide, to find joy and meaning in life. After he left Paris and settled in Arles Van Gogh painted his second group of Sunflowers in 1888 and 1889. His paintings of sunflowers in vases are among his most well known paintings.|$|E
2500|$|Attributed to P. F. Strawson is the performative {{theory of}} truth {{which holds that}} to say [...] "'Snow is white' is true" [...] is to perform the speech act of {{signaling}} one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the bride says [...] "I do" [...] {{at the appropriate time}} in a wedding, she is performing the act of taking this man to be her lawful wedded husband. She is not describing herself as taking this man, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such [...] "illocutionary acts" [...] is J. L. Austin, [...] "How to <b>Do</b> <b>Things</b> <b>With</b> Words").|$|E

In addition to decrying [...] "radical feminism", Burke criticizes the recent practice of allowing girls to serve as acolytes at Mass and other church ceremonies. [...] "The introduction of girl servers also led many boys to abandon altar service", Burke said. [...] "Young boys don't want to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>with</b> girls. It’s just natural.

2500|$|Searle's early work, {{which did}} {{a great deal to}} {{establish}} his reputation, was on speech acts. He attempted to synthesize ideas from many colleaguesincluding J. L.

He also drew on the work of Paul Grice (the analysis of meaning as an attempt at being understood), Hare and Stenius (the distinction, concerning meaning, between illocutionary force and propositional content), P. F. Strawson, John Rawls and William Alston, who maintained that sentence meaning consists in sets of regulative rules requiring the speaker to perform the illocutionary act indicated by the sentence and that such acts involve the utterance of a sentence which (a) indicates that one performs the act; (b) means what one says; and (c) addresses an audience in the vicinity.|$|E
