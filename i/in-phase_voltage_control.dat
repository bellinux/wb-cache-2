Consequently, three control methods, namely, voltage control through shunt compensation, real power flow control through quadrature voltage injection and reactive power flow control through in-phase voltage injection for the UPFC were examined {{in order to improve}} the transient stability of the power system. The quadrature voltage control was found to be effective in reducing the transient swings whereas <b>in-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> was effective in improving the transient stability margin.

This paper describes three different dynamic <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> options during unbalanced grid faults: 1) the positive sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> with only a positive sequence reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; 2) the positive sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> with limitation of the positive sequence reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; and 3) {{the positive and negative}} sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> with both a positive and a negative sequence reactive current injection. These different control options are compared in simulations of a wind power plant connected to a meshed power system, including synchronous generators.

40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{by means}} of coordinated <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> {{is one of the}} challenging aspects of distribution system operation. Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> mode, in distribution systems may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts and long term oscillations. The seamless operation of distribution systems embedded with DG for effective <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> is one of the challenging tasks, mainly because (a) DG may interact with the conventional <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices and (b) prioritised operation of different <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices depends on the network topology and real-time characteristics of the system. Coordinated operation involving multiple <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices (i. e., on-load tap changers and voltage regulators in addition to local capacitor banks) and DG units is one of the feasible technical solutions at medium voltage distribution system level. In most of the methods proposed in the literature, the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices and DG units are tuned and coordinated online using Volt/VAR optimization strategies in accordance with the time-graded operation. However, there is no mechanism to operationally minimize the interactions between DG units and the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices in real-time between any two consecutive control states. In such case, more generic approach needs to be developed for examining interactions between the DG units and the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices.

40|$|Evaluation of <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> {{methods for}} maximizing end-of-grid wind farm {{capacity}} uses the Kalbarri Wind Farm {{as a base}} study case. The weakness of end-of-grid feeders {{is that they have}} relatively high resistance and reactance, which lead to high real and reactive power losses and low power transfer capability. This thesis report provides summaries of the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithms from the simplest to the most complex algorithm. The parameters of the Kalbarri Wind Farm elements are based on the documents provided by Verve Energy. This thesis investigates the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm including the use of a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) with the wind farm in order to stabilise the grid <b>voltage.</b> The <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm study cases are based on the Kalbarri Network Model, and its system simulations are carried out by using DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. The first <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is a wind turbine with fixed power factor which is the simplest <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm. The second <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is the wind turbine with fixed power factor combined with a STATCOM, with the STATCOM using the isochronous <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> method. The STATCOM size required for this <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is so large that it makes the system uneconomic. In order to improve it, the third <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm uses a ± 1 MVAr STATCOM. At the same time, an upstream <b>voltage</b> regulator <b>controls</b> the STATCOM within a ± 0. 8 MVAr range. The upstream voltage regulator does the remote control, since there is communications between the upstream regulator and the STATCOM. The fourth <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is built on the third algorithm with the STATCOM using the droop <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> method. The upstream regulator indirectly controls the Point of Connection (PoC) voltage by using the Line Drop Compensation (LDC) to keep STATCOM within a ± 0. 8 MVAr Range. In the fourth <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm, the LDC is used {{to take the place of}} the communications in the third algorithm. The ‘WindFREE’ wind turbine option is also considered in this thesis report, which means the wind turbine is equipped with the feature of providing reactive power under the ‘no wind’ conditions. The dynamic <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm with the STATCOM using a variable voltage setpoint, as used in Kalbarri is evaluated.

The Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) have the responsibility to maintain the voltage supplied to consumers within statutory limits. On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) transformer equipped with Automatic <b>Voltage</b> <b>Control</b> (AVC) relay is the most widely used and effective <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> device. Due to a variety of advantages of adding Distributed Generation (DG), more and more distributed resources are connected to local distribution networks to solve constraints of networks, reduce the losses from power supply station to consumers. When DG is connected, the direction of power flow can be reversed when the DG output power exceeds the local load. This means that the bidirectional power flow can either be from power grid towards loads, or vice versa. The connection point of DG may suffer overvoltage when the DG is producing a large amount of apparent power. The intermittent nature of renewable energy resources which are most frequently used in DG technology results in uncertainty of distribution network operation. Overall, conventional OLTC <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> methods need to be changed when DG is connected to distribution networks.

40|$|Nowadays, {{more and}} more {{distributed}} generations (DGs) are being connected to local distribution networks due to the variety of advantages they offer. Without any DG, the direction of power flow is always from the power grid towards the loads. Therefore, the voltages decrease along the feeder and the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> has {{to compensate for the}} resultant voltage drops. When DG is connected to the network, the direction of power flow can be reversed whenever the DG output power exceeds the local load. This bi-directional power flow complicates the voltage profile along the feeder and simple compensation is no longer effective. Furthermore, the voltage profile resulting from the power in-feed from the DG may be exceed the statutory limits.
