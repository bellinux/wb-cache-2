25|$|Historical romance (also {{historical}} novel) {{is a broad}} {{category of}} fiction which the plot {{takes place in a}} setting located in the past, which Walter Scott helped popularize in the early 19th-century, with works such as Rob Roy and Ivanhoe. Literary fiction historical romances continue to be published, and a notable recent example is Wolf Hall (2009), a multi-award winning novel by English historical novelist Hilary Mantel. However, the <b>focus</b> <b>here</b> is on the mass-market genre.|$|E
25|$|Theology of Pope Francis is an {{analysis}} of his personal understanding of Christian beliefs and practices. The <b>focus</b> <b>here</b> is on salient features, what he emphasized during his papacy, what characterized his pontificate. This is usually seen from his manner of expressing himself, often distinguishing his own views from previous practices. Also, {{the focus is on}} his papacy, as distinct from his time as Jesuit provincial or as archbishop in a very special Latin American context. He is the first member of the Society of Jesus to be appointed Pope of the Catholic Church, elected on 13March 2013.|$|E

If it's necessary, we will, and I'm sure we would be agreeable, but the <b>focus</b> <b>here</b> is more on training the Afghan National Army and the police, as opposed to the increased U.S. troop presence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Investment {{analysis}} (or capital budgeting) {{is concerned}} with the setting of criteria about which value-adding projects should receive investment funding, and whether to finance that investment with equity or debt capital. [...] Working capital management is the management of the company's monetary funds that deal with the short-term operating balance of current assets and current liabilities; the <b>focus</b> <b>here</b> is on managing cash, inventories, and short-term borrowing and lending (such as the terms on credit extended to customers).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the light}} of their near-simultaneous {{emergence}} into the literary spotlight, Hazlitt presents the two as a contrasted pair. While Irving created a considerable stir when he burst on the English scene, and {{was at that time}} the more popular of the two, to Hazlitt that phenomenon was a consequence of the current rage for novelty. Irving's writings made for pleasant reading, Hazlitt allowed, yet he believed that Lamb, whose writing under the pen name of [...] "Elia" [...] is Hazlitt's chief <b>focus</b> <b>here,</b> was more original and deserved greater attention.|$|E
5000|$|The author sees Russia as an 'heir' to the {{fundamental}} Christ-Antichrist conflict and <b>focuses</b> <b>here</b> on Peter the Great as the [...] "embodiment of Antichrist" [...] (an idea he shared with Russian Old Believers) {{as opposed to the}} 'purely Christian' figure of Tsarevich Alexei.|$|R

2500|$|Peirce {{held that}} logic is formal semiotic, the formal study of {{signs in the}} {{broadest}} sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. He held that [...] "all this universe is perfused with signs, {{if it is not}} composed exclusively of signs", along with their representational and inferential relations, interpretable by mind or quasi-mind (whatever works like a mind despite perhaps not actually being one); the <b>focus</b> <b>here</b> is on sign action in general, not psychology, linguistics, or social studies).|$|E
2500|$|Task {{partitioning}} {{refers to}} the division of one task into sequential actions done {{by more than one}} individual. The <b>focus</b> <b>here</b> is on the task, and its division, rather than on the individuals performing it. [...] For example, [...] "hygienic behavior" [...] is a task in which worker bees uncap and remove diseased brood cells that may be affected by American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae) or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. [...] In this case, individual bees often focus on either uncapping or removing diseased brood. [...] Therefore, the task is partitioned, and performed by multiple individuals.|$|E

Men came forward to feel the creatures and look into their mouths, and one brute, unshaven and with filthy linen, snatched a child from its mother's lap Stephen shuddered with the sharpest pain he had ever known. An ocean-wide tempest arose in his breast, Samson's strength to break the pillars of the temple to slay these men with his bare hands. Seven generations of stern life and thought had their <b>focus</b> <b>here</b> in him,--from Oliver Cromwell to John Brown.|$|E
