5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Felling {{consisted}} of little more than the large Brandling <b>estate</b> and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling <b>estate</b> at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his <b>estate</b> and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his <b>estate</b> difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his <b>estate</b> and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his <b>estate,</b> began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.|$|E

5|$|During William John's absence the <b>estate</b> was {{managed by}} his brother, Canon George Bankes, who {{inherited}} {{it on his}} brother's death just a year before his own in 1857. His youngest grandson Walter Ralph inherited the <b>estate</b> in 1869, and later in life married Henrietta, and had a son Henry John Ralph Bankes. After Walter's death in 1902, his widow undertook the last major developments to the <b>estate,</b> including construction of the church (1907), new entrance lodges (1912–13) and numerous <b>estate</b> cottages. In 1923 control passed to Ralph Bankes, the seven times great-grandson of the original creator. During the Second World War an extensive military encampment {{was established in the}} south-east quarter of the park, which was only restored after the National Trust took ownership. Ralph Bankes died in 1981 and the Kingston Lacy <b>estate,</b> including 12 working farms, and Corfe Castle were bequeathed to the National Trust.
