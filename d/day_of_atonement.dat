5|$|On September 24, 1928, the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement,</b> British police {{resorted to}} {{removing}} by force a screen used to separate {{men and women}} at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs. Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, the Chief Rabbi of the ultraorthodox Jews in Jerusalem, issued a protest letter {{on behalf of his}} community, the Edah HaChareidis, and Agudas Yisroel strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site. Various communal leaders called for a general strike. A large rally was held in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed Douglas Valder Duff, the British officer involved, was sheltering.|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement.</b> This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E

50|$|Several of Williams' novels have a {{distinct}} cyberpunk feel to them, notably Hardwired (also {{an homage to}} Roger Zelazny's novel Damnation Alley), Voice of the Whirlwind and Angel Station. However, he has explored {{a number of different}} styles and genres, including farce (e.g., the Majistral series), postcyberpunk space opera (Aristoi), military science fiction (Dread Empire's Fall series), alternative history (Wall, Stone, Craft), science fantasy/arcanepunk (Metropolitan and City on Fire), disaster thriller (The Rift), a Star Wars novel (The New Jedi Order: Destiny's Way) and historical adventure (Privateers and Gentlemen series), and police procedural (<b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement),</b> usually in a science fiction context. He has also contributed to some of the Wild Cards cooperative novels.|$|R
25|$|A {{discussion}} of symbolism inherent in Rosh Hashanah (The New Year) and Yom Kippur (the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement)</b> {{is found in}} the entries on those subjects. The <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement</b> was considered the most holy day of the entire year, and was regarded as the symbol of the complete atonement of the people and of their absolution from their sins committed against God.|$|E
25|$|Different {{view of the}} Atonement—Protestant Christianity has {{traditionally}} taught that Jesus Christ performed his work of atonement on the Cross, and that his sacrificial death brought to fulfillment the entire Old Testament sacrificial system, including the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement.</b> The idea that the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement</b> does not meet its antitype until 18 centuries after Jesus' crucifixion is a deviation from historic Christian theology.|$|E
25|$|So, from a {{time before}} the {{composition}} of Kol Nidrei there was a corresponding ritual intended for Rosh Hashana. It is believed that Kol Nidrei {{was added to the}} liturgy of Yom Kippur, ten days after Rosh Hashana, because that service is much more solemn, because the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>atonement</b> is entirely attuned to the theme of repentance and remorse, and because (despite the great importance of Rosh Hashana) Yom Kippur services are better attended, and perhaps because Yom Kippur itself is once referred to as Rosh Hashana in Scripture (Ezekiel 40:1). Such reasons were enumerated by, among others, Asher ben Jehiel (early 14th century). There may be an additional reason — perhaps the annulment of vows was moved to, or repeated at, the commencement of the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement</b> in order to minimize the risk that new vows would be made in the ten-day interval between the repudiation of vows in Rosh Hashana and the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement,</b> and, more than the rather dry legalistic Rosh Hashana declaration, Kol Nidre includes an emotional expression of penitence which sets the theme for the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement.</b>|$|E
50|$|Yom Kippur is the Jewish holiday of repentance {{and is a}} {{time for}} the Jewish people to pray and repent for their sins. As Soussloff writes in Jewish Identity in Modern Art History, “Yom Kippur is also the {{occasion}} in the Jewish year when the dead are solemnly commemorated (in the service called Yizkor), and Gottlieb has injected into this picture several prominent self-memorials.” This piece shows the rabbi grasping the holy Torah (which contains the Old Testament); his expression is very somber and serious in keeping with the theme of the holiday they are observing. The location (a synagogue) is apropos considering the figures are observing the holiday of Yom Kippur. Gottlieb was a man who was proud of his Jewish heritage and wanted to show the world the religion and culture of Eastern European Jews. This painting was created on the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>atonement</b> (preceding the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> Yom Kippur) but the setting of the piece is on the actual <b>day</b> <b>of</b> Yom Kippur. In his book Painting a People, Ezra Mendelsohn confirms that Gottlieb’s subject in this painting is the <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Atonement: “Nathan Samuely, who discussed the work with Gottlieb in 1878, does specifically connect it, in his German essay on the artist published in 1885, with Yom Kippur, and informs us that the artist himself had the idea of painting it during the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> repentance preceding this holiday.” Not only does this piece show the observance of the specific holiday of Yom Kippur, but it also highlights the many differences of how Jewish people observe general holidays and how they dress in a unique fashion as opposed to gentiles.|$|R
40|$|The {{first volume}} of the two-volume book {{publication}} entitled "Multiculturalism, Conflict and Belonging", which stems out of the four-day international conference under the same title organized by Interdisciplinary. Net at Mansfield College, Oxford University, in September 2012, aims not only at exploring the concepts of "identity", "difference" and "belonging" from a theoretical perspective, but more importantly at relating them empirically to multicultural contexts that shed a better light on the concepts in question. Both volumes are composed of chapters under various themes that provide an analytical analysis on how individuals choose and shift from one identity to the other {{as well as how}} they voluntarily and involuntarily belong to one or the other group thus shaping the very fabrics of a multicultural environment. This first volume entitled "Identity, Difference and Belonging" is composed of nine chapters that are divided under two main themes, namely: (1) Making and Negotiating Identities: Education, Religion and Culture; and (2) Making Identities: Cultural Representations. [...] Introduction: Identity, Difference and Belonging / Dina Mansour, Andrew Milne and Sebastian Ille [...] Part I Making and Negotiating Identities : Education, Religion and Culture [...] Clash of Identities: Understanding Social Conflict in Post-Arab Spring Egypt / Dina Mansour, Sebastian Ille and Mervat Madkour [...] Religious Education, Knowledge and Power: Religion as Discursive Construction in New Zealand Primary Schools / Helen Bradstock [...] Nation and Violence: A Path through Identity / Nicole Tressoldi [...] Between Coexistence and Dissolution: The Case of Bosnia and Herzegovina Aleksandar Savanovia and Aleksandar Vranjes [...] Part II Making Identities : Cultural Representations [...] Transgressing Boundaries: Nigerian Hip Hop and the Signifying Other / Yomi Olusegun-Joseph [...] The Cleft Identity of Jayanta Mahapatra at the End of Words / Sreekanth Kopuri [...] Resisting, Enduring and Embracing Multiculturalism in Michael Gregorio's <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement</b> / Roxanne Barbara Doerr [...] A Convergence of Cultures: Mariano Fortuny and His Clothing Designs / Wendy Ligon Smith [...] Chinese Producers, Indian Directors and Malay Actors: Role and Contribution of Cultural Conflict in Malay Films of the Golden Age / Ramachandran Ponna...|$|R

25|$|Fasting, {{which plays}} so {{essential}} {{a part in}} the practices of ascetics, classically found official recognition only {{in the development of the}} <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement.</b> The Prophets, again, had little patience with fasting. There are some obscure allusions to fast days of popular observance, but the Prophets of exilic and postexilic days insist on the futility of this custom. Isaiah (lviii.), while appealing for a broader charity and deeper sense of justice, maintains that these, and not fasting, are the expression of a will sanctified unto God. It is characteristic of the attitude of later Judaism that this very chapter has been assigned for the Hafṭarah for the <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Atonement,</b> the one penitential fast-day of the synagogue.|$|E
