50|$|Virgin queens {{are most}} {{attractive}} to workers. Males {{are attracted to}} the queens via olfactory signals composed of <b>hexyl</b> <b>hexanoate.</b> These scents indicate the queen's reproductive status. S. postica males respond to the pheromones of virgin queens and congregate in groups of variable size {{at the entrance of}} the nest. These groups can be from just a few individuals up to thousands of S. postica males. The individuals of the group become a compact swarm as some drones sit on the backs of others. While the drones compete to mate with the virgin queen, they do not act aggressively towards each other. These individuals will quickly disperse upon any intrusion, extra commotion, or disturbance due to an alarm pheromone that spread from individual to individual. Queens make one mating flight. The males lose their genitalia during mating, only inseminating one female. Flights generally occur during the afternoon, with low flight activity in the morning hours. When mating with the queen, the S. postica drones assume an upright posture, antennae stretched as far and outward as possible. The queen will store the spermatozoa, returning to the nest to lay her eggs which she fertilizes in the laying process with remarkably few sperm per egg.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{biochemical}} metabolism of aroma volatiles derived from fatty acids, pear fruits were incubated in vitro with metabolic precursors of these compounds. Aroma volatiles, especially esters, were significantly increased, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in pear fruits fed on fatty acid metabolic precursors. Cultivars having different flavor characteristics had distinctly different aroma volatile metabolisms. More esters were formed in fruity-flavored “Nanguoli” fruits than in green-flavored “Dangshansuli” fruits fed {{on the same}} quantities of linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Hexanal and hexanol were more efficient metabolic intermediates for volatile synthesis than linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Hexyl esters were the predominant esters produced by pear fruits fed on hexanol, and their contents in “Dangshansuli” fruits were higher than in “Nanguoli” fruits. <b>Hexyl</b> esters and <b>hexanoate</b> esters were the primary esters produced in pear fruits fed on hexanal, however the content of hexyl ester in “Dangshansuli” was approximately three times that in “Nanguoli”.

The dominant types of these volatiles {{can be divided}} into three categories: carbohydrate-derived compounds, fatty acid derived compounds and amino acid derivatives. In this research, the volatile organic compounds were investigated in three different parts of the New Zealand native plant – Kohia (P. tetrandra), which is also known as New Zealand passion fruit. The parts included leaves, flowers and fruit. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) was chosen as the analytical method. The identification of volatiles was by gas chromatography – mass spectrometry. It was found that the compositions of different parts of Kohia were distinctly different. The volatiles in the leaves were mostly alcohols and carbonyl compounds, whereas the major components in flowers were terpenes, and esters were the principal components of the fruit. In addition, the volatiles in female and male of Kohia leaves were also different. The main components in female leaves were cyclopentenone (31. 49 %), cyclopentanone (13. 10 %) and 2 -hexenol (8. 38 %), while the predominant compounds in male leaves were cyclopentanone (17. 97 %), cis-hexenyl acetate (14. 06 %) and 2 -hexenol (14. 02 %). Attached (still on the plant) and excised (cut off) flowers of female Kohia were mainly contained (Z) -ocimene and α-farnesene.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{purposeful}} induction of malolactic fermentation (MLF) in wines such as Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is {{an established}} commercial wine making practice in Oregon. This induction {{is not always}} successful, especially with white wines, such as Chardonnay. A study was initiated to examine the compatibility of yeasts commonly used in Oregon winemaking with various strains of malolactic bacteria. In preliminary and pilot plant scale experiments, the yeast strain found to be most conducive to malolactic fermentation by lactic acid bacteria was Montrachet (Red Star). The malolactic bacterial strains that were best able to complete malolactic fermentation in various wines, fermented by different yeast strains, were the two Oregon commercial strains, ER 1 A and Ey 2 d, and the Pinot Noir juice isolate, DAPN 85 A. Sensory analysis of aroma by difference from control test was done on Chardonnay wine fermented by 4 different yeast strains and 3 different malolactic bacterial strains. In all cases, there was an overall significant difference in malolactic fermented wine aroma when compared to control wines. Organic acid analyses by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and analyses of volatile compounds by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were done on selected Chardonnay wines. Propionic acid was found to diminish in malolactic fermented wines while acetic acid content increased. Isobutanol and isobutyraldehyde increased significantly in MLF wines, compared to the controls. Chemical analyses of MLF and control wines suggested two possible chemical reactions resulting from the MLF. The first was the reduction of isobutyraldehyde to isobutanol, and the second was the hydrolysis of isobutyl acetate to isobutyraldehyde and acetate. On all GC chromatograms of wines, where MLF had occurred, there was an unidentified peak close to the retention time of isoamyl acetate. This peak was not evident in wines where MLF had not occurred.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to 1) qualitatively and quantitatively measure the odor-active compounds in ‘Marion’ blackberry; 2) compare the aroma profiles of advanced selections and new cultivars of thornless blackberry cultivars with ‘Marion’; 3) study the development of furaneol in ‘Marion’ during ripening and; 4) investigate the distribution of odor-active compounds and their precursors in the selections that contributed to ‘Marion’s pedigree. Aroma of ‘Marion’ blackberry was analyzed with LiChrolut-EN solid-phase extraction (SPE) and microvial insert thermal desorption GC-MS-olfactometry. The results showed that LiChrolut-EN had limited absorption of sugars, pigments, and other non-volatile compounds, while extracting a vast majority of polar and non-polar aroma compounds. The potential odorants identified in ‘Marion’ included furaneol, linalool, β-ionone, hexanal, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> <b>hexyl</b> acetate, 2 -heptanol, cis- 3 -hexenol, and trans- 2 -hexenol. Furaneol was considered the impact characteristic aroma compound in ‘Marion’. A method used for the determination of furaneol was further developed using SPE-GC-MS operated in the selected ion mode. Furaneol could be effectively isolated by LiChrolut-EN cartridge and completely eluted out with 1 mL of methanol, which could be directly analyzed on GC-MS using an automated microvial insert thermal desorption technique without further purification and concentration. The method proved sensitive with good recovery and reproducibility. A modified method using SPE-GC-MS with poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone) to remove pigments in the berry samples was further developed to quantify other odor-active compounds. The method was reproducible, had satisfactory recoveries for over 50 selected compounds, and had minimum decomposition of glycosides and pigments. The aroma constituents of ‘Black Diamond’ blackberry were identified and the predominant odor-active compounds in ‘Black Diamond’ were ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 1 -octen- 3 -one, 2 -heptanol, cis- 3 -hexenol, nonanal, trans- 2 -hexenol, methional, linalool, ethyl 3 -hydroxyhexanoate, α-ionone, β-ionone, and furaneol. A comparison of volatiles in ‘Black Diamond’ and ‘Marion’ was conducted using SPE-GC-MS and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) -GC-MS over two growing seasons. Although seasonal variations were present, the overall volatile profile in ‘Black Diamond’ and ‘Marion’ were very similar, but the concentrations of some aroma compounds varied greatly. Odor activity values (OAVs) indicated that furaneol, linalool, β-ionone, and hexanal were the most important odor-active compounds in ‘Marion’, while in ‘Black Diamond’, the most important compounds were linalool, β-ionone, furaneol, and 2 -heptanol. The major difference between two cultivars was that ‘Marion’ had a five times higher OAV of furaneol than ‘Black Diamond’, while ‘Black Diamond’ had a three times higher OAV of linalool than ‘Marion’. A flavor comparison of other thornless blackberry cultivars including ‘Thornless Evergreen’, ‘Black Pearl’, ‘Nightfall’, ORUS 1843 - 3, ‘Waldo’, NZ 9351 - 4, and ‘Chester Thornless’ with ‘Marion’ was further conducted. The results indicated that the blackberries had very diverse flavor profiles. Furaneol, linalool, β-ionone, 2 -heptanol, and carvone were the major aroma compounds in blackberries. High OAVs of furaneol, linalool, and β-ionone in ‘Marion’, ‘Black Diamond’, ‘Black Pearl’, ORUS 1843 - 3, and NZ 9351 - 4 accounted for their similar fresh fruity, strawberry and raspberry aroma, while high OAVs of 1 -octen- 3 -ol, myrtenol, eugenol, and α-terpineol in ‘Waldo’, ‘Nightfall’, ‘Chester Thornless’, and ‘Thornless Evergreen’ accounted for their vegetal, woody, and moldy aroma. Instrumental analysis matched with descriptive sensory analysis. Free furaneol and furaneol glycoside were further studied in ‘Marion’ during ripening. Free furaneol was analyzed by SPE-GC-MS with PVPP decoloration of juice. Furaneol glucosides were isolated with XAD- 2 sorbent, hydrolyzed with β- glucosidase, and the released aglycone was analyzed using SPE-GC-MS. Seasonal variation was observed; however, the tendency of the change in each year’s berry flavor profile was similar. Dramatic chemical composition changes occurred after the mottled stage. Only trace levels of free furaneol and furaneol glycoside were detected before the mottled stage. Between the mottled and shiny-black stages, free furaneol dramatically increased from 1. 4 mg/kg to 9. 0 mg/kg, and continuously increased into the overripe stage to 22 mg/kg; while furaneol glucoside increased from 0. 8 mg/kg to 4. 0 mg/kg, and dramatically increased into the overripe stage to 34 mg/kg – a much higher concentration than the free furaneol at the same stage. The distribution of volatile constituents and volatile precursors in the genotypes that are in ‘Marion’s pedigree was investigated. Volatiles were analyzed using SBSE-GC-MS and SPE-GC-MS. Volatile precursors were isolated with C 18 cartridge, enzymatically hydrolyzed, and released aglycons were analyzed using GC-MS. The results indicated each cultivar in the ‘Marion’ pedigree had a specific volatile and volatile precursor pattern. Wild ‘Himalaya’ had predominant volatiles of terpenes and furanones. ‘Santiam’ also had dominant volatile of terpenes. Their progeny, ‘Chehalem’, had a combination of these characteristics. ‘Meeker’ raspberry was dominated by norisoprenoids, lactones, and acids. Its progenies, ‘Logan’ and ‘Olallie’, were similar in norisoprenoid dominance. ‘Marion’, from the cross of ‘Chehalem’ and ‘Olallie’, contained almost all the volatile compounds, but the concentrations of most compounds were more evenly distributed than other cultivars. Some key compounds such as linalool, β-ionone, and furaneol had a unique distribution. ‘Marion’ had a moderate level of linalool. ‘Olallie’ and ‘Logan’ had a significantly high linalool level, while the other stream had much lower linalool content. The concentrations of β-ionone in ‘Marion’, ‘Chehalem’, ‘Santiam’, and ‘Himalaya’ were low, while the cultivars in the other stream had higher β-ionone levels. The β-ionone content in ‘Meeker’ was over 40 times the amount in other cultivars. The concentration of furaneol in ‘Marion’ was higher than in its parents, ‘Chehalem’ and ‘Olallie’. The distribution of volatile precursor pattern in the ‘Marion’ pedigree was similar to the free form. The chiral isomeric ratios of 13 pairs of compounds were studied using a Cyclosil B column. Strong chiral isomeric preference was observed for the most of compounds, and each cultivar had its unique chiral isomeric ratio distribution...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Key {{research}} {{areas in}} modern enology {{are related to}} the production of wine of consistent quality, {{as well as to the}} improvement of existing wine quality through the enhancement of the sensory properties of wine. The formation of glycerol during alcoholic fermentation is highly relevant to both these issues. Since the early years of the zo" century, glycerol has been positively associated with the quality of wine and it is thought to impart important mouth-feel sensations such as "viscosity", "smoothness" and "body". In general, it is considered that glycerol concentrations higher than those normally found in wine, can contribute towards the improvement of wine quality. It has also been suggested that increased concentrations of glycerol can enhance the aroma of wine. On the basis of these perceptions, several strategies have been developed to favour the production of glycerol during the fermentation process and over a period of years, a large volume of data has been collected that relates to various aspects regarding glycerol production during alcoholic fermentation. To date, however, several aspects regarding the relationship between glycerol and wine quality remain unclear. The reasons for this situation can mainly be ascribed to the lack of reliable analytical data to serve as a basis for investigating the relationship between glycerol and wine quality, as well as the preponderance of empirical and anecdotal evidence. Despite numerous opinions regarding optimal glycerol concentrations in wine, glycerol is indeed seldom assayed on a routine basis and targets with respect to specific wine grape cultivars and glycerol concentrations have largely remained unspecified. To date, very little information regarding glycerol concentrations in South African wines has been published. The analytical techniques that are most frequently used for the quantification of glycerol in grape juice, fermenting must and wine are not easily automated and this aspect placed severe limitations on the generation of large volumes of analytical data on glycerol concentrations in these matrices. This project was undertaken with the aim to holistically address some of the unresolved issues relating to the relationship between glycerol and wine quality. This also implied the development and optimisation of analytical techniques suitable for the rapid and accurate determination of glycerol in fermentation media, as well as in finished wine. In the first stage of this project a quantitative database was established that contained the analytical data on the glycerol concentrations of a statistically significant number of wines of adjudged quality, as well as additional information for each wine regarding the geographic origin, vintage, routine chemical analyses and the yeast strain(s) used for the production of the wine. The relevance of glycerol in wine for the modern South African winemaker was evaluated through the establishment of a quantitative database that contained the opinions of an expert panel of 15 South African winemakers, enologists and wine chemists on topics relating to glycerol in wine. In the second stage of the project the data captured in the databases were used to investigate aspects regarding the relationship between glycerol and wine quality. From the data captured in the qualitative database, it was clear that the topic regarding glycerol in wine was important to the South African winemakers and it was also evident that there was a need for the development and optimisation of methods suitable for the routine analysis of the glycerol concentrations in grape juice, fermenting must and wine. The opinions of the panel members also highlighted the issue that the mouth-feel property of wine was considered to be an area where the quality of some wines could be further improved. The quantitative database contained the information on the glycerol concentrations of 450 commercial South African table wines of adjudged quality. The premium cultivars Chardonnay, Chenin blanc, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz and Pinotage were used for the purpose of investigating the relationship between glycerol concentration and wine quality. The wines represented a wide variety of wine styles, including dry white, off-dry white, dry red and late harvest wines. The average glycerol concentration was significantly associated with the wine style. In white wines the average glycerol concentration was much lower than in the red wines (6. 82 gIL versus 10. 49 gIL, respectively). No significant relationship between the final glycerol concentration and the geographic origin, vintage and the yeast strain used for the fermentation was found. Wine quality could not be significantly associated with glycerol concentration in the red wines. In the white wines, the relationship between glycerol concentration and wine quality was significant, but due to the very small differences in the average glycerol concentrations of the wines of different quality ratings, the statistical significance is probably of little practical value. The effect of glycerol on the volatility of a selection of esters and higher alcohols was also investigated. Solid-phase microextraction, followed by gas chromatography, was used to analyse the composition of the headspace at equilibrium between the liquid phase and the gas phase of a model wine, and a dry white wine that contained a basal concentration of 5. 4 gIL glycerol. Results showed that incremental increases in the glycerol concentrations over a range of 1 - 10 gIL in the model wine and in a Chenin blanc wine, were not accompanied by a proportional increase or decrease in the abundance of the aroma components in the headspace. The volatile components tested were isoamyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl valerate, ethyl lactate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> <b>hexyl</b> acetate, isoamyl alcohol and isobutanol. For all the volatile components tested, the difference between the headspace composition of samples containing the lowest glycerol concentration, and those containing the highest glycerol concentration, was not significant. However, sufficient experimental evidence was obtained to indicate that increasing glycerol concentrations had an effect on the volatility of aroma components, and that the effect is of a complex and non-linear nature. In the third phase of the work Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to establish and optimise methods for the accurate and rapid quantification of glycerol in wine. For this purpose calibrations were developed for the quantification of glycerol in dry wine and late harvest wines. The accuracy of prediction was evaluated by means of the standard error of prediction that was 0. 38 gIL for the dry wines and 0. 65 gIL for the sweet wines. Large variations are introduced in the FT-IR spectra of wine by factors such as process technology, cultivar and geographic origin, and this variation can have an effect on the accuracy of the analytical data generated when employing FT-IR spectroscopy. Using glycerol prediction in wine as a model system, principal component analysis of the FT-IR spectra was done in order to establish quality control measures for the detection of poorly predicted, or outlier samples. A classification model, based on principal component analysis, was established that enabled the interpretation and classification of the outlier samples in the data set in 100 % of the cases tested. This work forms the basis for expanding the quality control measures for the detection of wines of which the FT-IR spectra are highly unnatural, as well as for establishing quality control measures to ensure that accurate analytical data are generated when FT-IR is used. FT-IR spectroscopy was also used to develop a rapid screen for the evaluation of the fermentation profiles of wine yeasts. For this purpose, a selection of wine yeasts, which included commercial wine yeasts frequently used in winemaking in South Africa, as well as a selection of hybrid Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts, that were obtained through a selective breeding strategy aimed at increasing glycerol concentrations were used. Calibrations necessary for the accurate quantification of glycerol, volatile acidity, ethanol, reducing sugar and glucose, in Chenin blanc must and a synthetic must were developed and optimised. This work forms the basis upon which the scope of the analysis, both in terms of the number of components that can be measured, as well as the medium in which the yeasts are being evaluated, can be enlarged. This would be valuable for future applications in both the research as well as the industrial environment. The method that was developed serves to illustrate how this application can play a supportive role in yeast development programmes, through the speeding up of the initial stages of yeast strain evaluation.

Die vorming van gliserol tydens alkoholiese fermentasie het betrekking op beide hierdie aspekte. In Opvatting wat wyd gehuldig word en wat reeds sedert die vroeë jare van die 20 e eeu geld, impliseer dat gliserol In positiewe bydrae lewer tot wynkwaliteit. Oor die algemeen word dit beskou dat gliserolvlakke hoër as wat normaalweg in wyn aangetref word, kan bydra om die kwaliteit van die wyn nog verder te vehoog. Daar is ook spekulasie dat verhoogde gliserolvlakke in wyn die intensiteit van die aroma van wyn kan verhoog. Hierdie opvattings het tot gevolg gehad dat veskeie strategieë ontwikkel is om die gliserol vlakke wat tydens die fermentasieproses gevorm word, te verhoog.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of volatiles by 'Golden Delicious' apple fruits {{are highly}} diminshed {{after a long}} term controlled atmosphere (CA) or ultra low oxygen (ULO) storage. To study the mechanisms of volatile production at both harvest time and after long term storage and to explain {{the reasons for the}} inability of fruits to produce adequate amounts of volatiles, aroma precursors were supplied to the fruits at different times during storage. Fruits were supplied with the following aroma precursors: Alcohols (ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, isobutanol and isopentanol), acids (acetic-, propionic-, butyric-, pentanoic- and hexanoic acid) and esters (methyl heptanoate and methyl linolenate). Each aroma precursor was applied separately both at harvest time (October) and in March, after the apples were stored in ultra low oxygen conditions (1 % O 2 : 3 % CO 2) for 5 months. Alcohols, except ethanol, induced in both application times a strong increase in the biosynthesis of its volatiles. Butanol enhanced the production of butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, butanol and pentyl butyrate. Hexanol enhanced the synthesis of butyl butyrate, hexyl acetate, hexyl propionate, hexanol and <b>hexyl</b> <b>hexanoate.</b> The biosynthesis of butyl butirate or propyl acetate by fruits stored for 5 months in ULO-storage after the treatments with hexanol or pentanol is evidence for an active beta-oxiodation process. The influence of acids was negligible at harvest time but they, except acetic and hexanioc acids, induced at the second date the biosynthesis of their esters. It is proposed that the long chain unsaturated fatty acids (linol- and linolenic acids) are the ultimate precursors for aroma (Bartley et al., 1985). The content of both fatty acids were found to be highly and positively correlated with volatile production. They decreased strongly after 6 months in ULO-storage in about the same manner as aroma production...|$|E
