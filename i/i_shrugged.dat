I have to admit <b>I</b> <b>shrug</b> to see something like the French Academy, assembled in full.

A halfling {{in the middle}} of the Oasis of Marr, he is busy honing his druidic skills by hunting down a group of orcs that have been terrorizing {{traveling}} merchants and gypsies in the area. Spotting an orc priest, he casts a spell that commands local flora to ensnare the surprised orc. After Wolfwalker proceeds to pummel it with fire spells, the orc falls dead. He rifles through its pack and finds five silver coins, the spoils of combat.
