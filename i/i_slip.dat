6000|$|Carol smiled {{upon them}} ingratiatingly. [...] "Do you dears mind if <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> up to bed? I'm rather tired--cleaned the upstairs today." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I awake, {{and find}} that I really am hungry, and {{remember}} that in consequence of a headache I did not eat any dinner. So <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> on a few clothes, and {{go down to the}} kitchen on a foraging expedition.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{go through}} the village, and Mary King will be looking out; so I shall wear my best hat. Mamma won't see me, if <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> down the back way; and I do so want Mary to know that my hat is prettier than hers," [...] said Polly, up in her little room.|$|E
60|$|At half-past seven next morning, <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> {{quietly into}} Boots's pantry.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} he had the {{handcuffs}} loose, and <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> them off.|$|R
60|$|BLOOM: (Weakly) They {{challenged}} me to a sprint. It was muddy. <b>I</b> <b>slipped.</b>|$|R
60|$|BRODIE. It is in vain. I cannot leave till I have said. There is a man; I must obey him. If <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> my chain till he {{has done}} with me, the hue and cry will blaze about the country; every outport will be shut; I shall return to the gallows. He is a man that will stick at nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{when this}} honey-pot {{is full of}} honey, I shall get another, {{and put on the}} top of it, bottom upwards. Then the bees will work up into that, and come out at the upper hole. When they get fairly at work in the upper hive, then I shall get Henry to hold it, while <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> the lower one out, and put the upper one down in its place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{this going}} {{to be the end of}} me?" [...] asked Ormond languidly, and the old man, turning his head, glanced toward me in warning as he answered: [...] "That's as the Lord wills. Yere friends will need to be careful. The leg's no set that ill, but I'm suspecting trouble inside o' ye. With good {{guidance}} ye should get over it. Lay him gently yonder while <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> on a better lashing." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. Suddenly my eyes lighted on them. At once <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> to the ground.|$|R
60|$|Seeing that Panda dozed, <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> behind Saduko {{and gripped}} {{him by the}} arm.|$|R
60|$|The Pharaoh {{heard and}} glanced first {{at his son}} and then at me, doubtfully, whereon, covered with confusion, <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let them throw another rope," [...] the {{smuggler}} said, [...] "and you can haul him on board too. It won't make much matter whether <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> the noose round his body or his neck. The last {{will be the}} easiest plan perhaps, for then, if he happens not to be alive when you pull him out, {{it would be an}} accident; and even if anyone chooses to peach, they can't swear that it was purposely done." ...|$|E
60|$|I had not {{notified}} to Mrs. Fairfax {{the exact}} {{day of my}} return; for I did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my box in the ostler's care, did <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> away from the George Inn, about six o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.|$|E
6000|$|Leaving the river, {{they began}} to ascend a steep chalky lane, which had been wet all the winter, and was now full of rough {{hardened}} wheel-ruts and holes made by slipping horses. Elizabeth thought that Robert Bruce's calthorps could hardly have made the ground more uneven, {{and she was just}} going to say so, when Helen groaned out, 'What a horrid place! <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> and bruise my ancle every minute.' Upon which she immediately took the other side of the question, and answered, 'It is not nearly so bad as the long lane on the down, and you never complain of that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks to you, Francisco, that I am {{not lying}} there beside them," [...] the {{merchant}} said. [...] "I {{did not know}} that you were so close at hand, and as <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>I</b> felt that my end had come." ...|$|R
60|$|Here, as it happened, <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> off {{the stone}} on which I was {{standing}} and nearly {{went down with}} the stream myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just said}} that <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> on the marshes. One doesn't talk of such little adventures as you and I {{experienced}} last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think,' he says, 'I'll go {{and walk}} up and down outside, and have a look at them as they're getting out of the cab. My plan, you see, is first to kiss mother. Then I've made up four things to say to father, and it's after I've said them that the awkward time will come. So then I say, [...] "I wonder what is in the evening papers"; and out <b>I</b> <b>slip,</b> and when I come back you will all have settled down to {{ordinary}} life, same as other people. That's my plan.' He goes off, not without hope, and Ginevra shrugs her shoulders forgivingly.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the train}} slows {{down for a}} stop, half a dozen {{platforms}} from where I had decked her I come down. No one is on the platform. When the train comes to a standstill, <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> off to the ground. Ahead, and {{between me and the}} engine, are two moving lanterns. The shacks are looking for me on the roofs of the cars. I note that the car beside which I am standing is a [...] "four-wheeler"--by which is meant that it has only four wheels to each truck. (When you go underneath on the rods, be sure to avoid the [...] "six-wheelers,"--they lead to disasters.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{have got}} a bottle of caustic {{from one of the}} surgeons. He put me up to it. He says if I see that I am suspected, if <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> aside and rub one of these little sticks of caustic over my tongue it will make such a sight of it that I have only to open my mouth and let them look at it, and they will believe readily enough that I have got some frightful disease in my tongue and cannot use it. In case of {{necessity}} I can mumble out a few words, and the state of my mouth will quite account for any difficulty they may have in understanding me." ...|$|E
60|$|I put up {{the note}} in my pocket-book. <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> the five-franc pieces into my purse--then I took a turn through my narrow chamber.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wid that <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> my arm {{round her}} waist, for, begad, I fancied she had surrindered at discretion, an' the honours av war were mine.|$|R
60|$|So I held on till all {{the late}} sounds had quit {{and the early}} ones hadn't begun yet; and then <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> down the ladder.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} awkward, Mr. Cyril, for neither you nor I could be away at supper-time without {{questions}} being asked. It {{seems to me}} that I had better take Matthew into the secret. As he don't live in the house he could very well watch wherever she is, till <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> round after supper to relieve him, and he could watch outside here in the evening till either you or I could steal downstairs and take his place. You can count on him keeping his mouth shut just as you can on me. The only thing is, how is he to stop her if he finds her coming out from a neighbour's before the Captain has come for her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Very dark {{under the}} great carob tree {{as we go}} down the steps. Dark still the garden. Scent of mimosa, and then of jasmine. The lovely mimosa tree invisible. Dark the stony path. The goat whinnies out of her shed. The broken Roman tomb which lolls right over the garden track does not fall on me as <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> under its massive tilt. Ah, dark garden, dark garden, with your olives and your wine, your medlars and {{mulberries}} and many almond trees, your steep terraces ledged high up above the sea, I am leaving you, slinking out. Out between the rosemary hedges, out of the tall gate, on to the cruel steep stony road. So under the dark, big eucalyptus trees, over the stream, and up towards the village. There, I have got so far.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's queer," [...] Mr. Waddington murmured. [...] "Do you know," [...] he continued, {{dropping}} {{his voice and}} looking around him anxiously, [...] "that I've taken to reading Ruskin? I've got a copy of 'The Seven Lamps' at the office, and I can't keep away from it. <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> it into my drawer if any one comes in, like an office boy reading the Police Gazette. All the time I am in the streets I am looking at the buildings, and, Burton, this is the extraordinary part of it, I know no more about architecture than a babe unborn, and yet I can tell you where they're wrong, every one of them. There are some streets I can't pass through, and I close my eyes whenever I get near Buckingham Palace. On the other hand, I walked a mile the other day to see a perfect arch down in South Kensington, {{and there are some}} new maisonettes in Queen Anne Street without a single erring line." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> {{back into}} my sleeping-bag, with a keen {{consciousness}} of its nature, and carefully pulled the flap in place, which almost hermetically sealed me up.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's good; I'll soon be all right. <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> when we {{were coming}} down the crag and pitched {{over the edge of}} the steep bottom part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> and sank," [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "I {{pulled down}} that lever, and I opened the water-gate and let out the lake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no," [...] he said, [...] "no, I can't {{say that}} I am always cheerful, but--well, {{you know that}} kind of a night that comes: say--you wake up 'way in the night and the whole world is sunk in gloom and there are storms and {{earthquakes}} and all sorts of disasters in the air threatening, and you get cold and clammy; and when that happens to me I recognize how sinful I am and it all goes clear to my heart and wrings it and I have such terrors and terrors!--oh, they are indescribable, those terrors that assail me, and <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> out of bed and get on my knees and pray and pray and promise that I will be good, if I can only have another chance. And then, you know, in the morning the sun shines out so lovely, and the birds sing and the whole world is so beautiful, and--b' God, I rally!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, to cut {{the tale}} short, we never left there till plumb noon; and long before that I was hid in this stateroom; for before breakfast I see a man coming, away off, that had a gait like Hal Clayton's, {{and it made me}} just sick. I says to myself, if he finds out I'm aboard this boat, he's got me like a rat in a trap. All he's got to do is to have me watched, and wait--wait till <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> ashore, {{thinking}} he is a thousand miles away, then slip after me and dog me to a good place and make me give up the di'monds, and then he'll--oh, I know what he'll do! Ain't it awful--awful! And now to think the OTHER one's aboard, too! Oh, ain't it hard luck, boys--ain't it hard! But you'll help save me, WON'T you?--oh, boys, be good to a poor devil that's being hunted to death, and save me--I'll worship the very ground you walk on!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, but I can," [...] said Little John, [...] "and that I {{will show}} you presently. I thank the good Saint Wilfred that he hath given me a pretty wit. Look ye, now. Here I take this great basket, so; here I tie my rosary around the handle, thus; and here <b>I</b> <b>slip</b> the rosary {{over my head and}} sling the basket upon my back, in this wise." [...] And Little John did {{according}} to his words, the basket hanging down behind him like a peddler's pack; then, giving his staff to one of the maids, and taking a basket upon either arm, he turned his face toward Tuxford Town and stepped forth merrily, a laughing maid on either side, and one walking ahead, carrying the staff. In this wise they journeyed along, and everyone they met stopped and looked after them, laughing, for never had anybody seen such a merry sight as this tall, strapping Gray Friar, with robes all too short for him, laden with eggs, and tramping the road with three pretty lasses. For this Little John cared not a whit, but when such folks gave jesting words to him he answered back as merrily, speech for speech.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> aside, so {{that none}} {{knew that it}} was I who had spoken, but the cry was caught up and echoed far and wide.|$|R
6000|$|The moment I got {{a chance}} <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> aside privately and touched an ancient common looking man on the {{shoulder}} and said, in an insinuating, confidential way: ...|$|R
60|$|Seeing that I was {{not being}} noticed, <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> from the {{forecastle}} to the companionway. In a moment I was {{down the steps and}} in the cabin.|$|R
