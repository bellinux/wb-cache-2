40|$|The {{resistance}} spot weldability characteristics of three commercially available electrode compositions, Cu/Cr, Cu/Cr/Zr, and Cu/Zr {{have been investigated}} when welding three metallic coated sheet steels: aluminium 45 % zinc, galvanised and <b>galvanneal</b> <b>steels.</b> Electrodes were evaluated using weldability lobes and electrode life tests. The aggressive nature of the erosion process encountered for Al- 45 %Zn and galvanised steels masks the influence of small additions of alloying elements such as Zr on electrode life. However, for <b>galvanneal</b> <b>steel</b> where the erosion process is more gradual, the Cu/Cr/Zr electrode {{proved to be the}} most effective in obtaining maximum life. The development and composition of alloy layers which form on the tips of each electrode used to weld <b>galvanneal</b> <b>steel</b> have been identified from the outside as: a surface oxide sublayer (ZnO), a porous Fe-Zn sublayer (F phase: FesZnio), a hard and brittle gamma (y) brass (CusZng) sublayer, and a ductile beta (p) brass (CuZn) sublayer, and then the Cu/Cr substrate. The feasibility of depositing a surface coating onto Cu/Cr electrodes to mitigate the formation of alloy layers and thus extend electrode life was also investigated. Physical vapour deposition of Cr using unbalanced magnetron sputtering and filtered arc evaporation extended the life of Cu/Cr electrodes by 100 % from approximately 420 to 840 welds when welding Al- 45 %Zn sheet steel. Although extension of electrode tip life was achieved it has been established that the life determining failure mechanism of coated electrodes is by gross plastic deformation of the electrode tip due to the extreme temperatures and repeated compressive forces generated during the welding operation. It is therefore proposed that future work should aim to improve the mechanical properties of the electrode material in order to provide a strong base capable of supporting a thin liquid metal resistant coating.

In recent years, application of <b>galvannealed</b> <b>steel</b> has increased due to its excellent corrosion resistance, good weldability and paintability. Galvannealed production requires strict control of processing conditions to obtain an optimal alloying degree in the coatings.

40|$|<b>Galvanneal</b> <b>steel</b> is {{considered}} to be better for automotive applications than its counterpart, galvanized steel, mainly because of its superior coating and surface properties. <b>Galvanneal</b> <b>steel</b> is produced by hot dipping sheet steel in a bath of molten zinc with small, controlled, levels of aluminium, followed by annealing which creates a Fe-Zn intermetallic layer. This intermetallic layer of the coating improves spot weldability and improves subsequent paint appearance.

Our research revealed that the amount of austenite formed during intercritical annealing can be strongly influenced by the annealing temperature and the pre-annealing conditions of the hot band (coiling temperature) and cold band (% cold reduction). In the late part of this thesis, the base composition was a low carbon steel which would exhibit good spot weldability. To this steel were added two levels of Cr and Mo for strengthening the ferrite and increasing the hardenability of intercritically formed austenite. Also, these steels were produced with and without the addition of vanadium in an effort to further increase the strength. Since earlier studies revealed a relationship between the nature of the starting cold rolled microstructure and the response to CGL processing, the variables of hot band coiling temperature and level of cold reduction prior to annealing were also studied. Finally, in an effort to increase strength and ductility of both the final sheet (general formability) and the sheared edges of cold punched holes (local formability), a new thermal path was developed that replaced the conventional GI ferrite-martensite microstructure with a new ferrite-martensite-tempered martensite and retained austenite microstructure. The new microstructure exhibited a somewhat lower strength but much high general and local formabilities. In this thesis, both the physical and mechanical metallurgy of these steels and processes will be discussed. This research has shown that simple compositions and processes can result in DP steels with so-called Generation III properties...|$|R
40|$|Zinc {{coated steel}} is an {{attractive}} material for the manufacture of automotive body panels due to its excellent corrosion resistance and good weldability. It does however pose problems during sheet metal forming operations due to zinc pick-up on the die surfaces which changes the original forming characteristics of the part and increases maintenance of the die. The hypothesis presented {{here is that the}} severity of the problem may be reduced through surface engineering of the critical areas of the die so as to modify the frictional and chemical properties of the die surface. The critical area of the die to be investigated is the drawbead region. Drawbeads are added to deep drawing sheet metal forming dies to control the flow of metal into the die to eliminate wrinkling. The surface engineering involved coating experimental drawbeads with thin, hard coatings of TiN, TiCN and TiC using filtered arc physical vapour deposition. Uncoated Steel drawbeads of varying hardness were also investigated. Frictional forces of the drawbeads were determined using a Drawbead Simulation Test. Zinc pick-up on the drawbeads was assessed through ICP analysis. All results were correlated with hardness, roughness and chemistry of the drawbead surface. Hardening and polishing the surface of the uncoated steel drawbead reduces the average coefficient of friction between the sheet and the bead. Over time however as more sheets are drawn, a steady increase in friction coefficient occurs. Changing the surface chemistry of the drawbead by coating not only reduces the average coefficient of friction but also acts to reduce friction as more sheets are drawn. Thus, the minimisation of zinc pick-up when using <b>galvanneal</b> <b>steel</b> depends on a complex interaction between increasing die surface hardness, decreasing die surface roughness and changing die surface chemistry in the regions of high forming forces (i. e. the drawbead). Thin, hard, smooth ceramic-like coatings of alloy carbides (in particular) and alloy nitrides deposited onto the drawbead section of sheet metal forming dies effectively reduced the coefficient of friction between the die and galvanneal sheet. The reduction in the friction contribution of the forming forces in the drawbead region assists in maintaining forming characteristics of the die and may also assist in reducing the powder/flaking of the zinc-alloy coated sheet. The hardness of the coated drawbead together with the reduced affinity between the carbides and nitrides in the drawbead coating and the Fe in the zinc-alloy coating also reduced the amount of zinc-alloy pick-up...|$|R
