5|$|Colleagues have testified that, {{far from}} feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra, as Green {{and others have}} suggested, Bix often <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of exhilaration. It was like {{attending}} a music school, learning and broadening: formal music, especially the synthesis of the American vernacular idiom with a more classical orientation, so much sought-after in the 1920s, were calling out to him.|$|E
5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were {{a source of}} inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{intersection}} of Highway 33 and Prince Edward County Road 1 (Scoharie Road) near Picton saw {{the introduction of}} a traffic roundabout, the first ever constructed on a provincial highway in the province, to replace the at-grade intersection. The MTO felt that the area had reached its operational threshold due to high tourist and recreational activity, particularly during the busy summer months, and so <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> traffic roundabout was needed.|$|E

5|$|In their 2004 {{study of}} lynching, Peter Ehrenhaus and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice, arguing Waco {{residents}} <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of collective righteousness after Washington's death, {{as they saw}} him {{as the presence of}} evil in the community. Bernstein compares the public brutality of the lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging, drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason.|$|E
5|$|The pilots <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> jolt, and the {{autopilot}} disengaged. As Records {{took hold of}} his control column, Haynes focused on the tail engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak's suggestion, a valve cutting fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E

5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of the novel, Gatiss <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story than he did when adapting the lesser-known stories. The script was intended to follow elements of the horror genre and make the episode scary. As opposed to traditional ghost stories, Gatiss's plot focused on more contemporary horrors, conspiracy theories and genetic modification. Filming was done throughout May 2011, with additional shots taking place as late as August. Location shooting took place mostly across South Wales, though parts were shot in Dartmoor. The hound was created using visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E

5|$|Garga Samhita (a work on {{the life}} of Krishna) and Brahma Vaivarta Purana further tell of the {{previous}} birth of Putana as Ratnamala, the daughter of demon king Bali. When she saw Vamana, the previous incarnation of Krishna as a dwarf, she <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> desire to have him as her son and suckle him. She soon changed her mind and decided to kill Vamana, after he acquired all possessions of Bali. Krishna knew her desires and allowed her to fulfil both of them - to suckle him and to attempt to take his life.|$|E
5|$|Göring spent The Hardest Day at Karinhall {{with two}} of his top fighter pilots, Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland. He was decorating them with the Combined Pilots-Observation Badge in Gold with Diamonds after they had {{achieved}} much success in recent weeks. However, Göring took the opportunity to berate them over bomber losses and in particular, what he saw, as a lack of aggression in the Jagdwaffe. This criticism was not received well by the two men. Göring moved to quickly reconcile with them by ordering their promotion to Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) in command of their respective Geschwader (Wings). Göring <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> younger generation of combat leaders would help motivate the force. They were dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E

5|$|In another storyline {{her sister}} Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) reveals {{she is in}} fact her mother. The reveal episode {{centered}} around Ruby interrogating Charlie about the identity of her secret child, with Charlie breaking down whilst she admits the truth. Whilst filming the episodic block, both Breeds and Anderson found the storyline challenging; furthermore they <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> responsibility to get the narrative flow and emotions perfect. Breeds {{said she had to}} let it affect her own emotions in order to affect the viewing public. Although she was nervous, Breeds was pleased with the end result.|$|E
5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
5|$|Kirk takes {{command of}} the ship citing his experience, angering Captain Willard Decker, who had been {{overseeing}} the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprises new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan Enterprise science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud.|$|E
