60|$|Mark her unwearied watchfulness, as {{the night}} passes away. At last, brutalized by the accursed thing, he {{staggers}} along with rage, and, shivering with cold, he makes his appearance. Not a murmur is heard from her lips. On the contrary, she meets him with a smile--she caresses him with tender arms, with all the gentleness and softness of her sex. Here, then, is seen her disposition, beautifully arrayed. Woman, thou art more to be admired than the spicy gales of Arabia, and more sought for than the gold of Golconda. We believe that Woman should associate freely with man, {{and we believe that}} it is for the preservation of her rights. She should become acquainted with the metaphysical designs of those who condescended to sing the siren song of flattery. This, we think, should be according to the unwritten law of decorum, which is stamped upon every innocent heart. The precepts of prudery are often steeped in the guilt of contamination, which blasts the expectations of better moments. Truth, and beautiful dreams--loveliness, and delicacy of character, with cherished affections of the ideal woman--gentle hopes and aspirations, are enough to uphold her in the storms of darkness, without the transferred colorings of a stained sufferer. How often have we seen it in our public prints, that woman occupies a <b>false</b> <b>station</b> in the world! and some have {{gone so far as to}} say it was an unnatural one. So long has she been regarded a weak creature, by the rabble and illiterate--they have looked upon her as an insufficient actress on the great stage of human life--a mere puppet, to fill up the drama of human existence--a thoughtless, inactive being--that she has too often come to the same conclusion herself, and has sometimes forgotten her high destination, in the meridian of her glory. We have but little sympathy or patience for those who treat her as a mere Rosy Melindi--who are always fishing for pretty complements--who are satisfied by the gossamer of Romance, and who can be allured by the verbosity of high-flown words, rich in language, but poor and barren in sentiment. Beset, as she has been, by the intellectual vulgar, the selfish, the designing, the cunning, the hidden, and the artful--no wonder she has sometimes folded her wings in despair, and forgotten her HEAVENLY mission in the delirium of imagination; no wonder she searches out some wild desert, to find a peaceful home. But this cannot always continue. A new era is moving gently onward, old things are rapidly passing away; old superstitions, old prejudices, and old notions are now bidding farewell to their old associates and companions, and giving way to one whose wings are plumed with the light of heaven and tinged by the dews of the morning. There is a remnant of blessedness that clings to her in spite of all evil influence, there is enough of the Divine Master left to accomplish the noblest work ever achieved under the canopy of the vaulted skies; and that time is fast approaching, when the picture of the true woman will shine from its frame of glory, to captivate, to win back, to restore, and to call into being once more, THE OBJECT OF HER MISSION.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, an {{efficient}} authentication scheme is proposed which {{is suitable for}} low-power mobile devices. It uses an elliptic-curve-cryptosystem based trust delegation mechanism to generate a delegation passcode for mobile station authentication, and it can effectively defend all known attacks to mobile networks including the denial-of-service attack. Moreover, the mobile station only needs to receive one message and send one message to authenticate itself to a visitor’s location register, and the scheme only requires a single elliptic-curve scalar point multiplication on a mobile device. Therefore, this scheme enjoys both computation efficiency and communication efficiency as compared to known mobile authentication schemes.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{analyzes}} the authentication and key agreement protocol adopted by Universal Mobile Telecommunica-tion System (UMTS), an emerging standard for third-generation (3 G) wireless communications. The protocol, known as 3 GPP AKA, {{is based on}} the security framework in GSM and provides significant enhancement to address and correct real and perceived weaknesses in GSM and other wireless communication systems. In this paper, we first show that the 3 GPP AKA protocol is vul-nerable to a variant of the so-called <b>false</b> base <b>station</b> attack. The vulnerability allows an adversary to redirect user traffic from one network to another. It also allows an adversary to use au-thentication vectors corrupted from one network to impersonate all other networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of synchronization between a mobile station and its home network incurs considerable difficulty for the normal operation of 3 GPP AKA. To address such security problems in the current 3 GPP AKA, we then present a new authentication and key agreement protocol which defeats redirection attack and drastically lowers the impact of network corruption. The protocol, called AP-AKA, also eliminates the need of synchronization between a mobile station and its home network. AP-AKA specifies a sequence of six flows. Dependent on the execution environment, entities in the protocol have the flexibility of adaptively selecting flows for execution, which helps to optimize the efficiency of AP-AKA both in the home network and in foreign networks.

40|$|Several {{quality control}} (QC) {{procedures}} {{are available to}} detect errors in ground records of solar radiation, mainly range tests, model comparison and graphical analysis, {{but most of them}} are ineffective in detecting common problems that generate errors within the physical and statistical acceptance ranges. Herein, we present a novel QC method to detect small deviations from the real irradiance profile. The proposed method compares ground records with estimates from three independent radiation products, mainly satellite-based datasets, and flags periods of consecutive days where the daily deviation of the three products differs from the historical values for that time of the year and region. The confidence intervals of historical values are obtained using robust statistics and errors are subsequently detected with a window function that goes along the whole time series. The method is supplemented with a graphical analysis tool to ease the detection of false alarms. The proposed QC was validated in a dataset of 313 ground stations. Faulty records were detected in 31 stations, even though the dataset had passed the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) range tests. The graphical analysis tool facilitated the identification of the most likely causes of these errors, which were classified into operational errors (snow over the sensor, soiling, shading, time shifts, large errors) and equipment errors (miscalibration and sensor replacements), and it also eased the detection of <b>false</b> alarms (16 <b>stations).</b> These results prove that our QC method can overcome the limitations of existing QC tests by detecting common errors that create small deviations in the records and by providing a graphical analysis tool that facilitates and accelerates the inspection of flagged values.
