The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean."

Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E

[...] But it all does have a tie together, so it all kind of makes sense. [...] You really just got to come see the show, all right. It's so much fun to put on and we have a blast with it".|$|E
