40|$|Exact <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> towed {{distance}} with proper ground gear contact {{is an essential}} parameter in bottom trawl swept area estimates of fish abundance. Errors in this key parameter {{may lead to a}} first order bias in abundance estimates of demersal fish. The paper describes the results obtained with a new sensor for measuring the exact timing of trawl ground gear bottom contact and departure, as well as monitoring of the ground gear contact during the haul. Measured towed duration with the new system is compared with the traditional survey measures of this parameter on a number <b>of</b> <b>hauls,</b> and the results are discussed with respect to survey bias...|$|R

40|$|The 2000 s were {{dominated}} by rising fuel prices and economic recession. Both {{had an impact on}} the structure of the trucking industry and how freight was moved. This paper examines how fuel prices shaped trucking industryâ€™s network characteristics such as the average length <b>of</b> <b>haul,</b> average load, and capacity utilization. In particular, we show the effect of fuel price on average length <b>of</b> <b>haul</b> using 29 quarterly independent surveys from the Danish heavy goods vehicle (HGV) trip diary from 2004 to 2011. The results show that the average length <b>of</b> <b>haul</b> is sensitive to changes in fuel price: a DKK 1 (0. 18 $) increase in diesel price/liter leads to a 4 percent decrease in the average length <b>of</b> <b>haul</b> in the 2004 - 2007 period. This implies that firms improve transport efficiency by reducing the number of kilometers needed to transport a tonne of cargo as a short run response to fuel price increases. This result, however, is not confirmed for the years following the 2008 financial crisis. It also depends on where in the distribution of the average length <b>of</b> <b>haul</b> one looks...|$|R

40|$|Current {{management}} techniques for the aintenance <b>of</b> mine <b>haul</b> roads, such as ad hoc blading, scheduled blading and even maintenance management systems, have shortcomings in complex mining environments. This paper investigates {{the possibility of}} using the response <b>of</b> <b>haul</b> trucks to aid the management <b>of</b> <b>haul</b> road maintenance. The question arises as to whether truck response data can be used to recognize road defects at specific locations, in terms of type and size. This is important since different defect types require different road maintenance strategies.

40|$|Spanish {{demersal}} trawlers which {{operate in}} the Grand Sole and Porcupine Areas usually make between 50 and 80 hauls in each fishing trip, lasting around 15 days where fishing is almost continuous. Since the observer {{is not able to}} sample every haul, it is crucial to define a robust number <b>of</b> <b>hauls</b> to be sampled by the observer. A bootstrap analysis was carried out to determine the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>hauls</b> to be sampled to reduce significantly intra-variance within a fishing trip. Additionally, number of vessels and trips per vessel to be sampled was also analysed. Taking account the multistage sampling design and partitioning the over-all variability over the various stages, optimum sample sizes was estimated. On the other hand, fishermen may vary its retained catch and discard patterns whilst fishing trip occurs. Particular targets, discarded fish length or proportion of discarded/retained may change according to weather, occasional presence/absence of main target, storage space, quota exceeded, etc [...] . To look into these plausible differences, every fishing trip was divided in three periods, beginning of the trip, half period and ending period, containing each one the same number <b>of</b> <b>hauls.</b> Several statistical tests were applied to these three periods to look for differences as well as to fit a consistent division <b>of</b> <b>hauls</b> to every period. Finally, an optimal allocation sampling scheme is suggested, both in terms of minimum number <b>of</b> <b>hauls</b> to be sampled and temporal division <b>of</b> those <b>hauls</b> along the fishing trip...|$|R
