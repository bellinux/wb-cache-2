It asked questions such as [...] "what is devata (god)?", [...] "are rituals dedicated to devatas efficacious?", [...] "what makes anything efficacious?", and [...] "can it be proved that the Vedas, or any canonical text in any system of thought, fallible or infallible (svatah pramanya, intrinsically valid)?, if so, how?"

Reduced glomerular filtration and increased aldosterone secretion are often noted in subjects with edema. However, these factors, separately or in combination, do not adequately account for renal sodium retention in all clinical and experimental types of edema formation. The dog with constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava (TVC dog) has been a useful model for {{the investigation of the}} pathophysiology of edema, es-pecially in the studies of Davis and associates (1 - 7). Such dogs exhibit striking renal sodium retention and rapid collection of ascites. The in-creased aldosterone secretion that occurs in these dogs is not required for sodium retention, since ascites continues to form in adrenalectomized dogs maintained on a minimal amount of a mineralo-corticoid hormone (2) or on a high salt intake without hormone replacement (3). The observa-tion that sodium retention continues after trans-plantation of the kidney to the neck indicates that renal nerves and elevated renal venous pressure are not necessary for sodium retention (5). Al-though it has proven difficult to <b>demonstrate</b> with <b>certainty</b> that small decreases in glomerular filtra-tion are not involved, suggestive data have been obtained (1, 7, 8).

40|$|Oxidative stress {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{to play an}} important role in the pathogenesis of asthma; although a defect in antioxidant responses has been speculated to exacerbate asthma severity, this has been difficult to <b>demonstrate</b> with <b>certainty.</b> Nuclear erythroid 2 p 45 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is a redox-sensitive basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many antioxidant genes. We show that disruption of the Nrf 2 gene leads to severe allergen-driven airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in mice. Enhanced asthmatic response as a result of ovalbumin sensitization and challenge in Nrf 2 -disrupted mice was associated with more pronounced mucus cell hyperplasia and infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs than seen in wild-type littermates. Nrf 2 disruption resulted in an increased expression of the T helper type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in splenocytes after allergen challenge. The enhanced severity of the asthmatic response from disruption of the Nrf 2 pathway was a result of a lowered antioxidant status of the lungs caused by lower basal expression, as well as marked attenuation, of the transcriptional induction of multiple antioxidant genes. Our studies suggest that the responsiveness of Nrf 2 -directed antioxidant pathways may act as a major determinant of susceptibility to allergen-mediated asthma...|$|R

Damages for injury is one of the fastest developing areas of medical law. The legislation of liability for damage to health is contained primarily in the civil code and in some other statutes, of which the most important is the statute on health care of the people. The essential preconditions for the emergence of the liability for damage to health, {{as well as in the}} case of other responsibility for the damage, is; the violation of legal obligation, fault, damage and causation between the breach and damage. Each components its specificities. Most of the issues concern causation. Causation can be difficult to <b>demonstrate</b> with <b>certainty</b> due to the unpredictability of biological processes in the body. Courts usually require a 100 % proof of it. In cases of liability for damage to health caused by the applied instrument or operational activities is not necessary to prove the fault or breach of legal obligation, which facilitates the position of claimants who seek damages. The basic legal obligation of the provider of health services is to follow the lege artis principle. This concept requires that the procedure be [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse {{radiological}} findings in patients surgically treated for adjustable silicone gastric banding (ASGB) for morbid obesity complicated by band penetration into the gastric lumen. We reviewed the records of four patients with surgically confirmed penetration of gastric band into the gastric lumen; three had preoperative opaque meal, one only a plain abdominal film. Vomiting was the presenting symptom in two cases, whereas others had new weight gain and loss of early satiety. Two patients had normally closed bands: radiography showed that their position had changed from previous controls and the barium meal had passed out of their lumen. Two patients had an open band. One patient had the band at the duodeno-jejunal junction, and the tube connecting the band to the subcutaneous port presented a winding course suggesting the duodenum. In the other case, both plain film and barium studies failed to <b>demonstrate</b> with <b>certainty</b> the intragastric position of the band. As ASGB is becoming widely used, radiologists need to be familiar with its appearances and its complications. Band penetration into the stomach is a serious complication which needs band removal.

40|$|Utility {{functions}} {{are an important}} component of normative decision analysis, in that they characterize the nature of people's risk-taking attitudes. In this paper we examine various factors that make it difficult to speak of the utility function for a given person. Similarly we show that it is questionable to pool risk-propensity data across studies (for descriptive purposes) that differ in the elicitation methods employed. The following five sources of bias or indeterminacy are hypothesized and <b>demonstrated.</b> First, <b>certainty</b> equivalence methods generally yield greater risk-seeking than probability equivalence methods. Second, the probability and outcome levels used in reference lotteries induce systematic bias. Third, combining gain and loss domains yields different utility measures than separate examinations of the two domains. Fourth, whether a risk is assumed or transferred away exerts a significant influence on people's preferences in ways counter to expected utility theory. Finally, context or framing differences strongly affect choice in a nonnormative manner. The above five factors are first discussed as essential choices to be made by the decision scientist in constructing Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. Next, each is examined separately in view of existing literature, and demonstrated via experiments. The emerging picture is that basic preferences under uncertainty exhibit serious incompatibilities with traditional expected utility theory. An important implication {{of this paper is to}} commence development of a systematic theory of utility encoding which incorporates the many information processing effects that influence people's expressed risk preferences. utility/preference: theory, estimation, information processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented here was to screen genes involved in appetite regulation, {{with a focus on}} orexigenic signalling. The following genes were screened: the serotonin receptor 5 HT 2 c, the melanin-concentrating hormone receptors types 1 and 2 (MCHR 1 and MCHR 2) and the gene for the orexigenic ligand agouti-related peptide (AGRP). Several previously-unknown DNA variants were detected. Of greatest interest were mutations that changed coding amino acids. A Thr 419 Ala variant in 5 HT 2 c cosegregated with obesity over two generations in a British Caucasian family, and was not detected among 192 controls. Nonconservative variants found in MCHR 1 were Tyr 181 His and Arg 248 Gln. The latter cosegregated with obesity in the proband’s nuclear family, and neither MCHR 1 coding variant was detected in 262 controls. Functional testing of the mutant receptors was done in collaboration with other investigators. No differnces between the signalling properties of the wild type and mutant 5 HT 2 c proteins were found. Constitutive activity of the MCHR 1 variant proteins could not be <b>demonstrated</b> with <b>certainty.</b> Population studies among British Caucasians found no association between common MCHR 1 variants and obesity phenotypes.

We sequenced 1013 MRSA submitted to the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy by 46 laboratories between 2001 and 2010. Each isolate was assigned to a regional healthcare referral network in England and was otherwise grouped based on country of origin. Phylogenetic reconstructions were used to contextualize MRSA outbreak investigations and to detect the spread of resistance. The majority of isolates (n = 783, 77 %) belonged to CC 22, which contains the dominant United Kingdom epidemic clone (EMRSA- 15).

Rat livers, perfused for 5 h with a recycling fluid consisting of a perfluorochemical emulsion (Fluosol 43), were used to demonstrate a cumulative increase of HF in the perfusate as measured by a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay. The rate of increase in the perfusate pool of HF during the final 4 h of perfusion yielded a mean synthetic rate of 3. 5 micrograms/h per 100 g body wt, which was approximately 0. 2 % of the synthetic rate of albumin in the same system. The cumulative appearance of albumin and transferrin was linear after 1 h and calculated rates of synthesis were 2, 012 micrograms/h per 100 g and 263 micrograms/h per 100 g body wt, respectively.

This study investigated the potential for online scenarios to support the development of clinical decision making, through the provision of a “safe ” learning environment allowing the students to have flexible, repeated access to learning materials. Critical care scenarios were developed and placed on a web server, taking advantage of multimedia to add an element of realism. Participants were given the option of working alone (at a time of their choice) or in groups. The online scenarios included a mixture of peer and self assessment (including self-confidence ratings), and incorporated an element of expert feedback into the design. Pre and post test measures were used to establish whether the approach had supported the development of decision making expertise. Although computer based learning is relatively little used in nurse education, the online scenarios were well received by the participants, who reported that they had found it flexible to their needs, and the demands of clinical practice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was difficult to <b>demonstrate</b> with <b>certainty</b> that clinical decision making had improved.

Instead, a large segment of the high-tech pageantry seen on television and now expected and employed in court would fail to clear even the lowest hurdles of stringent scientific inquiry. Nonetheless, forensic evidence is often used to <b>demonstrate</b> the <b>certainty</b> of a person’s guilt by authoritatively “matching” evidence from the crime scene or victim to the suspect. The Report sounded the alarm as to the needs of the forensic science community, raised critical concerns, and even suggested a remedy by calling for the creation of an independent agency to regulate the field of forensic science.

This implies that postgraduate assessment should include knowledge testing. Longitudinal assessment, like progress testing, seems a promising approach for postgraduate progress knowledge assessment. AIMS: To evaluate the validity and reliability of a national progress test in postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynaecology training. METHODS: Data of 10 years of postgraduate progress testing were analyzed on reliability with Cronbach's alpha and on construct validity using one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Scheffe test. RESULTS: Average reliability with true-false questions was 0. 50, which is moderate at best. After the introduction of multiple-choice questions average reliability improved to 0. 65. Construct validity or discriminative power could only be <b>demonstrated</b> with some <b>certainty</b> between training year 1 and training year 2 and higher training years. CONCLUSION: Validity and reliability of the current progress test in postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynaecology training is unsatisfactory. Suggestions for improvement of both test construct and test content are provided...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A) [...] Humboldt State University, English: Literature, 2013 Iris Murdoch???s {{philosophy}} {{departs from}} the norm in analytic philosophy. Rather than set out to <b>demonstrate</b> the deductive <b>certainty</b> of her views, Murdoch takes it as self-evident that the human consciousness is inherently value-laden, but clouded by self-consoling fantasies. Her antidote is art. By viewing good art, in any medium, the individual becomes aware of a reality outside of oneself, and thereby expands the capacity for empathy. My project looks at the relationship between Murdoch???s philosophy and her fiction, arguing that the two are mutually supportive. I advance this claim by showing how Murdoch???s ethics are most clearly seen in her novels for reasons surrounding their form. With this in mind, I examine The Bell and The Black Prince. I also look at contemporary scholarship which challenges various interpretations of Murdoch???s views. My own criticism is primarily concerned {{with the work of}} David Robjant, who argues against theological interpretations of Murdoch???s work which view her moral exemplar as a Buddhist Christian. With that in mind, my argument shows the relevance of Maria Antonaccio???s interpretation of Murdoch???s work {{and the extent to which}} it can withstand Robjant???s critique...|$|R
5000|$|A {{first version}} of the work was written by March 1953, {{but it was only}} after his friend Karlheinz Stockhausen had {{finished}} his Studie I in November that Goeyvaerts was able to come to Cologne to realise his work. In the meantime, Goeyvaerts made a revised version of his score, probably in the Autumn, with a much more complex web of proportions over the entire composition that appears to have been influenced by Stockhausen's Studie ( [...] ; [...] ). Goeyvaerts was given technical assistance by Stockhausen in realising his work [...] The premiere of Goeyvarts's composition was given on 19 October 1954 on the inaugural concert of works produced in the WDR studio, together with the first performances of six other pieces: Stockhausen's Studie I and Studie II, Herbert Eimert's Glockenspiel and Etüde über Tongemische, 's Formanten I/II, and Henri Pousseur's Seismogramme. Eimert emphatically titled these pieces [...] "Die sieben Stücke" [...] (The Seven Pieces), and long maintained that this was the first concert of electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). In retrospect, Goeyvaerts was unhappy with Nummer 5 as a finished product, because it <b>demonstrated</b> that absolute <b>certainty</b> lay outside his grasp [...]|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the relationship between the doctrine of God and the doctrines pertaining to salvation in the theology of Isaac Dorner (1808 - 1884) with particular reference to his System ojChristian Faith. The thesis seeks to depict the way in which Dorner both exposits and uses his doctrine of God to serve the purposes of <b>demonstrating</b> the <b>certainty</b> of the Christian faith, the necessity of the incarnation of Jesus Christ, and the coherence of the doctrine of substitutionary atonement. We argue that his acco/Illt of God is marked by a consistent, though not unproblematic, interest in demonstrating the certitude of the Christian idea of God as the objective content of basic Christian faith. His account of the economic relation between God and world is analysed in terms of its capacity to depict the possibility of divine immanence within the world without detriment to the world's distinction or prejudicing God's Self-sufficiency. We argue that the world's freedom, though not absolute,. is nevertheless authentic and preserved by its dependent state. In this arrangement we see Dorner's account of God's aseity as decisive. We trace the progress of his theological account from its foundational propositions concerning the objective content of the Christian belief in the Holy Trinity, considered both in its immanent and economic forms. This leads to an analysis of his doctrines of the human creature and its teleological relation to the idea of the necessary God-man. The second part of the thesis includes analyses of those doctrines which pertain to the salvific significance of the realised Godman, Jesus Christ. We investigate Dorner's treatments of the doctrines of Sin, Christology, and Atonement. Keywords Isaac A.
