5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and <b>ductility.</b> Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its <b>ductility,</b> tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E
5|$|Copper, silver, {{and gold}} are in group 11 of the {{periodic}} table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron {{on top of}} a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high <b>ductility,</b> and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high <b>ductility</b> of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.|$|E

The {{conventional}} {{materials used}} in superplastic forming operations generally have grain sizes of ~ 2 µm or larger and they exhibit superplasticity at relatively low strain rates. Processing by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) produces materials having ultrafine-grain sizes, usually in the submicrometer range. If these ultrafine grains show reasonable stability at elevated temperatures, the alloys may exhibit a capability for achieving superplastic elongations at high strain rates.
