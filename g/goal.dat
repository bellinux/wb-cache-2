5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of {{creating}} a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of rule changes on game-related statistics in men’s water polo matches. A total of 856 men’s matches played in all Olympic Games and World Championship since 1936 was analysed.

Differences between rule changes were determined using a one-way ANOVA. In general, the changes in water polo rules were shown to have an effect on the final result of the matches. There were differences in each rule change of duration (increased total <b>goals</b> and winners’ <b>goals),</b> period (increased total <b>goals</b> and winners’ <b>goals),</b> possession time (increased losers’ <b>goals),</b> timing (increased total, winners’, losers’, and decreased % <b>goals</b> and total <b>goals)</b> and fouls (increased total <b>goals</b> and losers’ <b>goals).</b> The analysis in game-related statistics through the rule changes could be used to evaluate their effects and/or justify future modifications...|$|R
