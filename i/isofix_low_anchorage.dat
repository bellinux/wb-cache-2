40|$|AbstractThe bolting {{is easy to}} go out {{of force}} in soft coal roadway. Based on the field {{measured}} data, the reason of bolt pre-stressed hysteresis descending in soft coal roadway was analyzed in detail by theoretical analysis and field measurement. Closely encircling the changing law of anchorage force during the bolt bearing course, the reason of the <b>low</b> initial <b>anchorage</b> force in soft coal roadway, the effect of surrounding rock deformation on bolt anchorage force and the circulating hysteresis descending of anchorage force as well as the impact of the structure stability on bearing structure of the bolt-mesh support were analyzed. The analyzed results show there exists a great amount of bolt pre-stress hysteresis descending in soft coal roadway because of remarkable difference between bolt and soft coal deformable capability. Thus, many comprehensive measures should be taken to effectively control the initial loose deformation of non-anchorage rocks between two bolts, to achieve higher initial anchorage force and to prevent anchorage force losing during bolt bearing course. At the same time along with increasing the bolting strength, the structure compensating measures should be taken to ensure the structure stability of the bolt-mesh support and to realize the high-strength stable bolting...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate sewage inputs at popular anchorages in Moreton Bay, a sub-tropical, semi-enclosed embayment system in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Sterol biomarkers were quantified in sediments revealing low levels over a spatial and temporal scale consistent with a shallow, oligotrophic, highly dynamic, sand dominated system. Despite low concentrations (ng/g) and high variability, relevant sterol/stanol pairs remained well-correlated and were successful in identifying an unexpected once-off pollution event from a point source at Moreton Bay Island. During this incident, the main human sewage biomarker, coprostanol, was found at a concentration of 1. 4 姯g, with a coprostanol/ 5 a-cholestanol ratio of 3. 2. Other than this one incident, sterol levels were consistently <b>low</b> even when <b>anchorages</b> were at full capacity. Thus, sewage from recreational vessels was found to have very little effect on sediment quality at anchorages in Moreton Bay and Gold Coast Broadwater.

40|$|Aims: This study {{investigates the}} risk of small for gestational age (SGA) in {{relation}} to country of origin of the mother. The role of psychosocial resources, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors was examined in different causal models. Methods: Among all pregnant nulliparous women {{in the city of}} Malmö, Sweden, who gave birth in 1991 – 92, 872 (87. 7 %) women completed a questionnaire during their first antenatal visit. The study was carried out among women whose pregnancies resulted in a singleton live birth (n~ 826); 22 % (n~ 182) of these women were foreign-born. Results: Fifty-five (6. 7 %) of the infants were classified as SGA, 37 (5. 7 %) of mothers of Swedish origin and 18 (9. 7 %) of foreign origin. SGA deliveries were much more prevalent among Middle East- and North Africa-born women (22 %) and sub-Saharan-born women (15 %). In all, women of foreign origin had increased odds for delivering SGA babies (OR~ 1. 8, 95 % CI~ 1. 0, 3. 2). In a multivariate analysis psychosocial and socioeconomic factors explained 30 % and 40 %, respectively, of the increased SGA risk. Psychosocial factors seemed to be more prominent risk factors for SGA among mothers of foreign origin. A possible synergistic relation was demonstrated between foreign origin of the mother and <b>low</b> social <b>anchorage.</b> Conclusions: This study showed that psychosocial factors, most probably linked to a disadvantaged social situation, could be the theoretically most important focus for preventing SGA in immigrant women. This could also further support a hypothesis of a link between psychosocial stress and SGA in general. However, this should not exclude the need for intervention in the antenatal care system in terms of specially tailored support and education.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore how {{socioeconomic}} and psychosocial life experiences in childhood and at adult age influence the level of sense of coherence (SOC) in women. The idea was to seek empirical support for establishing whether SOC is an individual construct being developed in early life and basically resistant toward adverse environmental factors or rather an entity influenced by adult psychosocial factors and as such, sensitive to health promotion activities; that is, if evidence could be found for a causal direction from classic factors involved in health promotion, such as social network and support, to SOC. A questionnaire (Krantz & Ostergren, 1999) was mailed to a random sample of 486 women, equivalent to 50 % of the women between the ages of 40 and 50 in a medium-sized municipality (population 13, 200) in Sweden. The response rate was 81. 7 % (397 women). Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate bivariate associations between socioeconomic and psychosocial variables and low SOC Logistic regression analysis was used to test for confounding and as a method of analyzing the structure of tentative causal chains. It was found that adult factors such as job strain (OR = 3. 42, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 11 - 5. 54), low social support (OR = 4. 00, CI = 2. 48 - 6. 46), and <b>low</b> social <b>anchorage</b> (OR = 4. 14, CI = 2. 57 - 6. 67) were independent predictors for low SOC in adult women. Childhood conditions such as family disruption and child abuse proved not to influence SOC to a statistically significant degree. Our study suggests that SOC is an entity partly associated with an individual's position in the social structure and partly by work conditions and social network and support rather than by childhood conditions. We could not claim this study to be a critical test of Antonovsky's (1979) theories in. the full refutationistic sense. To approach this goal, it would take a carefully designed prospective study assessing the effect of different factors on SOC in a true life course perspective...|$|R

The H- 2 Dd antigen was for the most part conserved. The reduced expression of H- 2 Kd antigen was com-pletely restored by IFN treatment, whereas that of H- 2 Ld antigen was only par-tially restored. Meanwhile, MuLV and MMTV antigens were expressed on parental BALB 3 T 3. These antigens was down-modulated in all of the EJ-ras and in one of the v-src-transfected clones. However, all the PyMT-transfected clones expressed the antigens as much as parental BALB 3 T 3 even in the clones with high anchorage independent growth potential.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—Over {{the past}} few decades there has been a growing {{interest}} among researchers, in women's overall life circumstances and their relation to women's health status. For example, paid employment has been considered an important part of women's living conditions in Western societies as the number of women entering the labour market has grown constantly over the past decades. When comparing men's and women's health, one of the most consistent findings is a higher rate of symptoms among women. The most commonly reported symptoms in women are depressive symptoms, symptoms of bodily tension and chronic pain from muscles and joints. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether socioeconomic factors, employment status, psychosocial work conditions and social network/support are associated with middle aged women's health status in terms of common symptoms.  DESIGN—A mailed questionnaire was used in a cross sectional design assessing socioeconomic factors, employment status, psychosocial work conditions according to the demand/control model, social network/support and an index based on the 15  most frequent symptoms presented by middle aged women when seeking health care.  SETTING—A rural community with 13   200 inhabitants in the western part of Sweden.  PARTICIPANTS—Women were randomly selected from the general population in the study area, 40  to 50  years of age. The response rate was 81. 7  per cent.  MAIN RESULTS—Women who were non-employed had a significantly increased odds of a high level of common symptoms (OR= 2. 82; 95 % confidence intervals 1. 69,  4. 70), as well as women exposed to job strain (OR= 3. 27; 1. 92,  5. 57), independently of the level of social network/support. Furthermore, exposure to low social support, <b>low</b> social <b>anchorage</b> or <b>low</b> social participation independently showed significantly increased odds of a high level of common symptoms (OR= 2. 75; 1. 71,  4. 42; OR= 2. 91; 1. 81,  4. 69  and OR= 1. 69; 1. 10,  2. 61, respectively).  CONCLUSIONS—Work related factors, such as non-employment and job strain, and circumstances within the private sphere, such as social network/support, seem equally important for middle aged women's health status. These findings ought to have important policy implications and also to be of major importance in a primary health care setting when meeting women who seek health care because of common symptoms.    Keywords: women's health; common symptoms; job strain; non-employment; social suppor...|$|R
40|$|We have {{established}} 3 cell lines ORL- 48, - 115 and - 136 from surgically resected specimens obtained from untreated primary human oral squamous cell carcinomas {{of the oral}} cavity. The in vitro growth characteristics, epithelial origin, in vitro anchorage independency, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, microsatellite instability status, karyotype {{and the status of}} various cell cycle regulators and gatekeepers of these cell lines were investigated. All 3 cell lines grew as monolayers with doubling times ranging between 26. 4 and 40. 8 h and were immortal. Karyotyping confirmed that these cell lines were of human origin with multiple random losses and gains of entire chromosomes and regions of chromosomes. Immunohistochemistry staining of cytokeratins confirmed the epithelial origin of these cell lines, and the <b>low</b> degree of <b>anchorage</b> independency expressed by these cell lines suggests non-transformed phenotypes. Genetic analysis identified mutations in the p 53 gene in all cell lines and hypermethylation of p 16 INK 4 a in ORL- 48 and - 136. Analysis of MDM 2 and EGFR expression indicated MDM 2 overexpression in ORL- 48 and EGFR overexpression in ORL- 136 in comparison to the protein levels in normal oral keratinocytes. Analysis of the BAT- 26 polyadenine repeat sequence and MLH- 1 and MSH- 2 repair enzymes demonstrated that all 3 cell lines were microsatellite stable. The role of HPV in driving carcinogenesis in these tumours was negated by the absence of HPV. Finally, analysis of the tissues from which these cell lines were derived indicated that the cell lines were genetically representative of the tumours, and, therefore, are useful tools in the understanding of the molecular changes associated with oral cancers. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: We have {{established}} a cell line ORL- 48 (T) from a surgically resected specimen of an untreated primary human oral squamous cell carcinoma of the mandible. This patient {{did not appear to}} have any oral habits which have been reported to be associated with oral cancer Materials and Method: The in vitro growth characteristics, epithelial origin, in vitro anchorage independency, HPV infection, microsatellite instability status, karyotype and the status of various cell cycle regulators and gatekeepers of the ORL- 48 (T) cell line were investigated. Results: The ORL- 48 (T) cell line is immortal, 3 T 3 - independent and grew as a monolayer with the doubling time of 48 h. Immunohistochemistry staining of cytokeratins confirmed the cell line is of epithelial origin. Soft agar assays demonstrated that ORL- 48 (T) expressed a <b>low</b> degree of <b>anchorage</b> independency (CFE< 6). Karyotyping analysis revealed that ORL- 48 (T) is aneuploidy in which the number of chromosomes varied between 67 and 73. There is consistent trisomies of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16 and 18 and homogenously staining region on 4 q suggesting gene amplification in this region. Sequencing of exons 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of p 53 revealed a mutation resulting in a stop codon. Molecular analysis of p 14 INK 4 a indicates hypermethylation of the p 14 INK 4 a promoter. In contrast to normal human keratinocytes, MDM 2 is overpressed in ORL- 48 (T). Microsatellite analysis of BAT 26 indicated that ORL- 48 (T) is microsatellite stable and this was confirmed by western blots demonstrating the expression of both hMSH 2 and hMLH 1 mismatch repair proteins. Polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that ORL- 48 (T) was not infected with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conclusion: This well characterized cell line will be useful tool in the understanding of the molecular changes associated with oral cancer particularly in cases where no clear aetiological factors are present.

40|$|Cochrane Oral Health Groups Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, Embase, key {{international}} orthodontic {{and dental}} journals and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Randomised controlled trials comparing surgical anchorage with conventional anchorage in orthodontic patients. Trials comparing {{two types of}} surgical anchorage were also included. Data extraction was performed independently and in duplicate by three review authors and the Cochrane risk of bias tool {{was used to assess}} bias. Random-effects meta-analysis was used for more than three studies when pooling of the data was clinically and statistically appropriate. Fixed-effect analysis was undertaken with two or three studies. Fifteen studies, involving 543 analysed participants, were included. Five ongoing studies were identified. Eight studies were assessed to be at high overall risk of bias, six at unclear risk and one study at low risk of bias. Ten studies (407 randomised and 390 analysed patients) compared surgical anchorage with conventional anchorage for the primary outcome. A random-effects meta-analysis of seven studies for the primary outcome found strong evidence of an effect of surgical anchorage. Compared with conventional anchorage, surgical anchorage was more effective in the reinforcement of anchorage by 1. 68 mm (95 % CI - 2. 27 mm to - 1. 09 mm) (moderate quality evidence). This result should be interpreted with some caution, however, as there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity for this comparison. There was no evidence of a difference in overall duration of treatment between surgical and conventional <b>anchorage</b> (<b>low</b> quality of evidence). Information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and acceptability was limited and inconclusive. When direct comparisons were made between two types of surgical anchorage, {{there was a lack of}} evidence to suggest that any one technique was better than another. There is moderate quality evidence that reinforcement of anchorage is more effective with surgical anchorage than conventional anchorage, and that results from mini-screw implants are particularly promising.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the conservation of early reinforced concrete structures from the last third of the 19 th century up to 1914, this research deals with superstructures (excluding foundations, roads, pipes, etc.) in reinforced concrete (in the modern sense of the term – i. e. concrete made with artificial cement and rebars supplying tensile strength; thus, the combination of a metal profile embedded in concrete is excluded). The development of reinforced concrete as a building material started around 1880 and became widespread {{around the time of the}} First World War. Some of the structures concerned are listed as heritage properties today. Therefore they deserve specific and careful study to ensure long-term preservation of their historic, architectural, technical and socio-economic value. They bear witness to a period in construction history when reinforced concrete was a new material. The outbreak of the First World War marked the end of the initial period of innovation, exploration and experimentation. By then, reinforced concrete had become widely accepted and adopted as a suitable and effective building material. However, present-day attempts at restoration often prove inadequate, due to incomplete understanding of this period of construction and the characteristics of the first generation of reinforced concrete. If the causes of degradation are incorrectly diagnosed, the repairs are likely to be inappropriate. Moreover, the number of reinforced concrete structures requiring repair work is currently increasing with the natural ageing of the material. This phenomenon will continue to grow in the coming years. With this in mind, the present research aims at identifying the specific structural characteristics of reinforced concrete structures erected before the First World War. Several axes of investigation were pursued in this PhD research and have resulted in the main observations detailed below. - Based on a case study of the region of Brussels (Belgium), a database of structures built in reinforced concrete prior to 1914 was drawn up in order to place the material in its historical and geographical context. The inventory currently contains 507 examples and provides a panorama of the uses of reinforced concrete, ranging from numerous foundations and slabs to a complete structure from the end of the 1890 s. This list is supplemented by a survey of a total of 605 patents filed for reinforced concrete in Belgium before the First World War. The early development of reinforced concrete was strongly related to national patenting, with a considerable number of systems being patented by private inventors for commercial purposes. Reinforced concrete profoundly transformed the building industry. All the professions working with the composite material had to change their approach, from the planning stage through to execution on the site. From the viewpoint of construction history, all these modifications make the time of the advent of reinforced concrete a particularly fruitful period to study. - From the survey of early reinforced concrete structures in Brussels and the database of Belgian patents, the supremacy of the Frenchman François Hennebique and his system on the Brussels market for reinforced concrete (and, by extension, on the Belgian market) before 1914 is incontestable. This commercial achievement resulted from a combination of factors: an efficient structural system, meticulous attention to the quality of on-site reinforced concrete execution, and the commercial acumen to develop the business through advertising and other media. The well-known Hennebique system represents a monolithic structure including slabs, beams and columns. In fact, this system changed over the decades of operation of Hennebique’s company, not so much in relation to the design methods (his original semi-empirical method continued to be used) but particularly in practical terms (the type and location of the rebars among others). The evolution of the system is analysed by means of technical drawings from about 30 Belgian projects designed by Hennebique between 1900 and 1930. - After the building contractors, who had been the first to believe in the structural and economic potential of reinforced concrete, engineers invented the calculation models and architects started developing new shapes. The Belgian engineer Paul Christophe was among the first theorists of reinforced concrete. The publication of his book Le béton armé et ses applications in 1899 is internationally recognised as a milestone in the rational modelling of structural reinforced concrete elements. Prior to the present study, details of his life and work remained largely uninvestigated, but the discovery of large parts of his personal archives has allowed clarification of his role in the popularisation of reinforced concrete, especially at the theoretical level. - Reinforced concrete structures around the beginning of the 20 th century were initially governed by empirical models of calculation (and execution) developed by the individual constructors. Gradually, reinforced concrete standards, published between 1904 and 1923 and based on working stress analysis and elastic modular ratio theory, replaced the utility of the patented systems. The different theoretical approaches are briefly described in this research. Mastering the theoretical assumptions and calculation methods used at the time represents the first step towards an appreciation of the structural behaviour and the possible weaknesses that can be expected. - A review, based on literature published at that time, of the properties of the components of reinforced concrete allows identification of the characteristic materials used in the concrete matrix and the metal reinforcements. The execution process and the available technological tools for erecting a reinforced concrete structure are also addressed, as these would have had a direct influence on the quality of construction. Non-destructive and destructive experimental laboratory tests were performed on original samples, mainly removed from the Colo-Hugues viaduct (1904, Braine-l’Alleud, Hennebique system) in order to assess the mechanical properties, chemical features and durability issues for concrete and ferrous reinforcements. Comparing the results obtained using different techniques also makes it possible to determine the extent to which these techniques are reliable for the appraisal of early reinforced concrete structures. - The structural efficiency of the Hennebique system is assessed based on an understanding of the principles of Hennebique’s semi-empirical method of calculation, but also – and primarily – by means of observations from experimental tests carried out on full-sized beams removed from the Colo-Hugues viaduct. Analysing and understanding the behaviour of the new composite material was a critical issue for promoting the use of reinforced concrete at the beginning of the 20 th century. Today, what is required is a re-assessment of its structural behaviour. Three bending tests up to failure in simply supported conditions were performed at the BATir Department of the Université libre de Bruxelles on T-beams from the Colo-Hugues viaduct. This case study is representative of the majority of Hennebique structures, because the typical continuous straight T-beam is the main structural element of any Hennebique structure (bridge, building, etc.). The first test is a four-point bending test on a complete span (6 m) of the viaduct to obtain the response of the central part under positive bending moment. The flexural failure was ductile and occurred through yielding of the reinforcements followed by crushing of the concrete at mid-span. The second and third tests are three-point bending tests on 4 m long specimens centred on the column, representing the behaviour of the beam around the supports. These showed a sudden slipping failure due to loss of the adhesive bond between rebars. The results of these three experiments combined reproduce the actual behaviour of the viaduct in service. The bearing capacity of the Hennebique system in service and at ultimate has been demonstrated, at least for one loading case. These experimental tests provide essential data for a better understanding of the mechanisms of failure and reveal the main weaknesses of the Hennebique T-beam. Two strengthening solutions are suggested as supplementary information. - The pathologies observed in early reinforced concrete structures (honeycombs, corrosion of the rebars, and so on) are mainly attributable to the tools and techniques that the builders had at their disposal (handmade compaction, high water-to-cement ratio, etc.) and by the limited contemporary knowledge of the physical and chemical phenomena, especially with regard to long-term effects. In fact, the concrete quality of the viaduct is surprisingly satisfactory despite its great age, due to the fact that the whole structure was covered with plaster, like the majority of reinforced concrete structures designed at that time. This research establishes that reinforced concrete structures from 1880 to 1914 differ from later reinforced concrete structures. Taking into consideration the features of early reinforced concrete structures will contribute to ensuring sustainable conservation with limited intervention, thus preserving as much as possible of the original structure when restoration work is undertaken. Working on existing buildings often requires a multidisciplinary and holistic approach. The present study could thus be extended in various areas. For example, other structural aspects could be studied more in depth, such as demonstration of the shear strength of the Hennebique system or detailed consideration of the reinforcements (<b>low</b> adherence, particular <b>anchorage</b> devices, etc.) / C'est dans le cadre de la conservation, au sens large du terme, que s'inscrit cette recherche sur les constructions en béton armé|$|R
