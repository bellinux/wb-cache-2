5000|$|Labour Cost: During {{installation}} MI cable {{must not}} be bent repeatedly as this will cause work hardening and cracks in the cladding and cores. A minimum bend radius must be observed and the cable must be supported at regular intervals. The magnesium oxide insulation is hygroscopic so MICC cable must be protected from moisture until it has been terminated. Termination requires stripping back the copper cladding and attaching a compression gland fitting. Individual conductors are insulated with plastic sleeves. A sealing tape, insulating putty or an epoxy resin is then poured into the compression gland fitting to provide a watertight seal. If a termination is <b>faulty</b> due to <b>workmanship</b> or damage then the magnesium oxide will absorb moisture and lose its insulating properties. Depending on the size and number of conductors, a single termination can take between 1 and 2 hours of labour (an electrician {{should be able to}} make a termination in 10 to 15 minutes on up to 4 core smaller sizes). Installation of a three-conductor MI cable (size No. 10 AWG — about 5 square mm) takes about 65% more time than installation of a PVC-sheathed armoured cable of the same conductor size. Installation of MICC is therefore a costly task. Certain PTFE, silicone or other polymer-insulated cables have been substituted in applications which require similar properties in terms of flame spread, which use less labour to terminate. MICC is still used in applications which are particularly suited to its combination of properties.|$|R
40|$|Some {{stakeholders}} {{continue to}} voice {{concerns about the}} performance of customer-sited photovoltaic (PV) systems, particularly because these systems typically receive financial support through ratepayer- or publicly-funded programs. Although {{much remains to be}} understood about the extent and specific causes of poor PV system performance, several studies of the larger programs and markets have shed some light on the issue. An evaluation of the California Energy Commission (CEC) 's Emerging Renewables Program, for example, found that 7 % of systems, in a sample of 95, had lower-than-expected power output due to shading or soiling (KEMA 2005). About 3 % of a larger sample of 140 systems were not operating at all or were operating well below expected output, due to failed equipment, <b>faulty</b> installation <b>workmanship,</b> and/or a lack of basic maintenance. In a recent evaluation of the other statewide PV incentive program in California, the Self-Generation Incentive Program, 9 of 52 projects sampled were found to have annual capacity factors less than 14. 5 %, although reasons for these low capacity factors generally were not identified (Itron 2005). Studies of PV systems in Germany and Japan, the two largest PV markets worldwide, have also revealed some performance problems associated with issues such as shading, equipment and installation defects, inverter failure, and deviations from module manufacturers' specifications (Otani et al. 2004, Jahn & Nasse 2004). Although owners of PV systems have an inherent incentive to ensure that their systems perform well, many homeowners and building operators may lack the necessary information and expertise to carry out this task effectively. Given this barrier, and the responsibility of PV incentive programs to ensure that public funds are prudently spent, these programs should (and often do) {{play a critical role in}} promoting PV system performance. Performance-based incentives (PBIs), which are based on actual energy production rather than the rated capacity of the modules or system, are often suggested as one possible strategy. Somewhat less recognized are the many other program design options also available, each with its particular advantages and disadvantages. To provide a point of reference for assessing the current state of the art, and to inform program design efforts going forward, we examine the approaches to encouraging PV system performance - including, but not limited to, PBIs - used by 32 prominent PV incentive programs in the U. S. (see Table 1). 1 We focus specifically on programs that offer an explicit subsidy payment for customer-sited PV installations. PV support programs that offer other forms of financial support or that function primarily as a mechanism for purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs) through energy production-based payments are outside the scope of our review. 2 The information presented herein is derived primarily from publicly available sources, including program websites and guidebooks, programs evaluations, and conference papers, as well as from a limited number of personal communications with program staff. The remainder of this report is organized as follows. The next section presents a simple conceptual framework for understanding the issues that affect PV system performance and provides an overview of the eight general strategies to encourage performance used among the programs reviewed in this report. The subsequent eight sections discuss in greater detail each of these program design strategies and describe how they have been implemented among the programs surveyed. Based on this review, we then offer a series of recommendations for how PV incentive programs can effectively promote PV system performance...|$|R
50|$|A {{contract}} for 1,000 aircraft was placed initially with the Fisher Body Corporation, {{but this was}} subsequently cancelled and reallocated to the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company instead. On 7 December 1917, the order was doubled to 2,000 aircraft. On 25 January 1918, the first aircraft, which was given the designation U.S.A 0-1, was completed, despite the warnings and misgivings of Barnwell, who was not satisfied {{by some of the}} modifications made, particularly {{in the use of the}} Liberty L-12 engine. According to Bruce, misdirections attributed to Major E.J. Hall of the U.S. Signals Corps had led to roughly 1,400 production drawings produced by Curtiss being rendered obsolete. The reputation of the type was also tarnished by three early crashes, although one had been attributed to pilot error, and the other two to <b>faulty</b> <b>workmanship.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Van Halen {{requested}} in {{the technical}} rider that a bowl of M&M's be provided in their dressing room with the brown ones removed. Failure {{to do so would}} not only mean that the band would not perform, but the venue would still have to pay the full fee. [...] The objective of this was not due to any excesses {{on the part of the}} band, but was a method to determine how much attention to detail the crew at a local venue paid to the requests specified in the rider. Should the bowl be absent, or if brown M&M's were present, it would give band members reason to suspect other, legitimate, technical and safety issues were also being performed poorly or were outright overlooked. David Lee Roth stated in his autobiography that this request was made as a result of <b>faulty</b> <b>workmanship</b> at a venue on an earlier tour which nearly cost the life of a member of Van Halen's road crew. He added that at one venue where he found brown M&M's, the management's failure to read weight requirements in the rider resulted in the band's equipment sinking through the floor and causing over $80,000 of damage.|$|E
5000|$|Yosemite Sam {{was one of}} {{the classic}} Looney Tunes {{characters}} who appeared as faculty members of Acme Looniversity in the 1990s animated series Tiny Toon Adventures. Sam was shown teaching classes in Firearms and Anvilology (the study of falling anvils, a staple joke in the Looney Tunes genre), and was sometimes portrayed as the school principal (though at least one episode identified Bugs Bunny as the principal, and Wile E. Coyote was Dean of Acme Loo). As with all the main Looney Tunes characters, Sam had a student counterpart at Acme Loo in Montana Max. In [...] "K-Acme TV," [...] Yosemite Sam was seen as the judge of [...] "Toon Court" [...] (a parody of The People's Court) where he proceeded over a trial where Calamity Coyote issues a complaint against the ACME Corporation for negligence and <b>faulty</b> <b>workmanship.</b> The ACME Corporation's representative Bobbo ACME claims that the devices made by the ACME Corporation work if they are used right as he demonstrates the catapult on Calamity Coyote.

5000|$|The {{first of}} the [...] "flying" [...] IAe 33 prototypes, (No. 02) built in 1950, {{completed}} its maiden flight on 27 June of that year, with Captain Edmundo Weiss at the controls. On the second flight, ex-Focke-Wulf test pilot Otto Behrens encountered severe lateral stability problems at speeds over 700 km/h {{and returned to the}} airfield as a precaution. Landing at very high speed, the aircraft bounced with sufficient force to cause the right main undercarriage strut to fail. During repairs to the aircraft, in order to rectify the [...] "tricky" [...] landing characteristics, the front undercarriage strut was increased in length, which served to alter the angle of incidence of the aircraft, while the shock absorbers were adjusted to have a greater [...] "throw". Although never considered docile, the modifications improved the takeoff, landing and low-speed characteristics of the IAe 33. More serious aerodynamic problems persisted, stemming from tip stall— in which the wingtip stalled before the wingroot resulting in an unpredictable [...] "rolling moment"— leading to a change in the wing leading edge near the wingroot, while the rudder was modified in an attempt to resolve the interminable lateral instability issues. In addition, the canopy was reinforced with two external frames and a small fairing was installed above the engine exhaust.Tank, himself a capable development test pilot, took over the test program to investigate the aircraft's stalling characteristics, although the requisite airframe changes took several months to complete, with the Pulqui II N. 02(m) so modified not able to undertake its third proving flight until 23 October. During the ensuing high-altitude test, on two successive occasions, the IAe 33 stalled inadvertently, although Tank had sufficient height at 9,000 m for recovery. Adding ballast to the nose of the aircraft cured the problem. On 8 February 1951, Tank publicly demonstrated the IAe 33 before Perón at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The audience also included government officials, legislators and the foreign diplomatic corps in the military attaches of the embassies, along with a large crowd of spectators. Both the IAe 27 Pulqui I and IAe 33 Pulqui II flew during the demonstration.With the successful completion of the proving test flights, the Argentine Air Force requested a pre-production order of 12 IAe 33 aircraft. In 1951, the air force established a team of service pilots to test fly the new aircraft in a series of acceptance flights.

40|$|An {{issue in}} the area of {{insurance}} law that has been litigated frequently in recent years is whether construction defects are “occurrences” under Commercial General Liability (“CGL”) insurance policies. The courts have been divided in deciding the issue and in their approaches to analyzing the issue. This article addresses how the issue should be analyzed and concludes that construction defects are “occurrences”. The relevant rules of insurance policy interpretation dictate that construction defects are “occurrences”. Policy language should be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the policyholder when the policy is construed as a whole with all ambiguities in the policy to be construed in favor of coverage. “Occurrence” is defined in CGL policies as an “accident,” including continuous or repeated exposure to harmful conditions, but the term “accident” itself is undefined. The common law provides that an “accident” is an event or happening that unexpectedly and unintentionally results in property damage. Thus, in determining whether construction defects are “occurrences”, the analysis should focus upon whether the <b>faulty</b> <b>workmanship</b> and resulting damage was expected or intended by the contractor/policyholder. If the <b>faulty</b> <b>workmanship</b> and resulting damage was unexpected and unintended by the contractor, which typically is the case, then the resulting construction defects, and any related property damage, were caused by an “occurrence”. Such a result is consistent with contractors’ reasonable expectations regarding the coverage they think they are purchasing under CGL policies. Contractors reasonably expect that when they purchase CGL insurance to cover their business liabilities that they will receive coverage for liability claims relating to property damage arising out of their business activities, which often include claims for alleged construction defects. Thus, if construction defects were not “occurrences” under CGL policies, then CGL policies unfairly and impermissibly would provide illusory coverage to contractors. Finally, if construction defects were not “occurrences” in the first instance, then the “business risk” exclusions found in CGL policies, which purport to exclude coverage for certain risks inherent in doing business, would be superfluous. Thus, construing CGL policies as a whole also leads to the conclusion that construction defects are “occurrences”...|$|E

40|$|The general {{construction}} process {{today is not}} designed to handle the entire process as a whole system, which means that changes are needed in both process and the management of it. Productivity within housing is lower than in the manufacturing industries {{due to a lack}} of cooperation between actors, weak commitment, a disruptive {{construction process}} and lack of holistic approach. Creating maximum value for the customer and minimize waste of resources is fundamental to lean production and the Toyota Production System, TPS, two of the most successful manufacturing process philosophies. To achieve an effective and functioning concept within industrial housing, it should be based on long-term relationships and continuous processes with a focus on the customers. Structured processes and practices, standardized technology and knowledge back into the processes is the key. MFB, Masonite Flexible Building System, is a building system for industrial construction with a high degree of prefabrication which minimize and facilitates the assembly work on the construction site. MIKS, MFB Industrial Constructive Interaction, is a form of cooperation between actors in industrial wood construction with the MFB-system. The MIKS model has been developed during a development project, with two construction projects made with MFB system and the MIKS model. One of these, Kv. Kullen in Nordmaling (Sweden), has been studied to analyze how methods for experience feedback within the manufacturing industry can be used to increase the experience feedback for the joint action group so as to gain power in competing with larger companies. On site documentation, along with the contractor's statement of costs, showed which procedures that were most time and resource consuming. Participants were interviewed with techniques from the manufacturing business and the interviews were analyzed to find the root cause of the additional costs of the project. The analysis shows that the greatest waste is unnecessary or <b>faulty</b> <b>workmanship,</b> and the waste that it created in turn. To form a competitive joint action group requires: - Control of the process- Designate the process owner- Common goals for each new construction project: - Short-term goals - what the specific project to achieve - Long-term goals - evaluate and revise- Determine the common platform for the process- The contractor appoints and train or hire a process manager- Every actor or team for each stage designates a process observer who uses “five whys”, continuous follow-up meetings and simple documentation and reports to the process manager- Perform continuous and time-limited measurement and control- Return the experience to the common process platform of joint action group and distribute the informationValiderat; 20120226 (anonymous...|$|E
