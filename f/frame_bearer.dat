Separation of building (dilatation) is planned to transform {{an irregular}} building becomes a regular building. By {{construction of the}} regular building, it is expected the stiffnes and mass distribution tens to be coincide in position or at least be closer. In the condition, when the building shaking because of earthquake, it will cause a small torsion. Structure design of GET 2 ̆ 7 S Hotel Semarang in this final project is designed by Special Moment <b>Frame</b> <b>Bearer</b> System (SRPMK) in Semarang 2 ̆ 7 s seismic zone. By chosing Special Moment <b>Frame</b> <b>Bearer</b> System (SRPMK), it is expected the structure has a high ductility. Ductile structure {{is a kind of}} structure types which is able to has a large post elastic deviation repeatedly and frequently because of earthquake that caused the first yield and it is able to maintain the strength of the structure so that the structure remains standing in spite of the edge of collapse. This structure is designed by using a capacity design of Strong Column Weak Beam. In this condition, the column structure is made stronger than beam structure, so that the part of the beam becomes the first plastic joints. The building will not be collapse totally when the strong earthquake occurs. The joints of the beam-column are designed to prevent the first collapse. The structure analysis of this building is based on SNI 03 - 1726 - 2012 and supported by SAP 2000 v 12 software which the results of the analysis are used to determine the fundamental period of the structure and the forces on the structure. Structural fundamental period on SRPMK has to be limited so that the structure is not very flexible...|$|E

The frame of the building is quite unique, so the author is interested in reviewing of the structure. In this study is limited on reviewing the structures of the frame and {{the aims of the}} study: (1) Expenses of gravity and seismic loads, (2) Analyzing the strength and ductility of columns, and (3) Comparison the use of reinforced concrete columns and steel columns. The design of the frame was using the 3 D and analysis assuming the dimensions of each frame in according to the real building ground. The author used Etabs version 7. 10 for earthquake load analysis based on SNI 03 - 1726 - 2002 the code of earthquake resistant building standards of assigning, analysis of concrete structures based on SNI 03 - 2847 - 2002 about regulation procedures for reinforced concrete structures, and SNI 03 - 1729 - 2002 about steel structure design procedures for structural design of steel columns.
