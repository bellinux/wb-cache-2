40|$|INTRODUCTION HIV-infected {{patients}} require antiretroviral {{treatment for}} life. To improve access to care, CD 4 enumeration and viral load tests have been redesigned {{to be used}} as point-of-care techniques using finger-stick blood. Accurate CD 4 counting in capillary blood requires a free flowing blood drop that is achieved by blade incision. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the attitude of the patients toward blade-based finger-stick blood donation. METHODS Four hundred and ninety-nine patients were included (299 patients from South Africa and 200 from Belgium). They completed a questionnaire to express their preference for finger stick or venipuncture, after undergoing both. The South African patient cohort was divided in two groups, receiving either single or multiple finger stick for CD 4 and other HIV-related tests. The Belgian patients received a single finger stick for CD 4 testing, and were asked to respond directly and again after two days. RESULTS The majority of the patients preferred the finger stick to the venipuncture. The perceived pain using the blade was superior to a small needle, but similar to a large needle. They preferred up to three finger sticks over one venipuncture. Up to 30 % of the patients changed their mind over two days. The main reason for choosing a finger stick was continued bleeding after venipuncture. The most cited objection to finger stick was pain/soreness. CONCLUSION Patient perceptions support the implementation of donating capillary blood with bladebased finger stick during CD 4 point-of-care testing. S 1 File.

AIM: To investigate the in-vitro efficacy of a novel, alcohol-release doorplate to reduce surface contamination during hand contact. METHODS: Prototype, horizontally-held, Surfaceskins, alcohol gel-impregnated and control (aluminium) doorplates were challenged (n= 72 per microorganism) with Staphylococcus aureus, Eschericia coli, Enterococcus faecalis or Clostridium difficile contaminated <b>fingers.</b> <b>S.</b> aureus and E. faecalis {{were used for}} challenges (90 per microorganism) of vertical (modified design) doorplates, on days 0, 3, 4, 6 and 7. Surface contamination was measured pre- and immediately post-challenges using agar contact plates. FINDINGS: Horizontal test, but not control, doorplates demonstrated bacterial killing of S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli, but not C. difficile; hence, only testing of S. aureus and E. faecalis was continued. Vertical Surfaceskins, but not control, doorplates demonstrated rapid killing of S. aureus over 7 days. There were significant reductions (> 90 % up to day 6; P< 0. 01) of surface bacterial colony counts compared with controls immediately post-challenge. There were also significant reductions in Surfaceskins doorplate enterococcal colony counts compared with controls on every day of testing (p< 0. 004). There {{was no evidence that}} bacterial recovery was greater from the tops of Surfaceskins doorplates (i. e. due to pooling of contents). CONCLUSION: Surfaceskins doorplates were efficient at reducing surface contamination by S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli.

The hybrid protein was unfolded, as judged by CD and NMR criteria. To reveal the role of each of the five amino acids, which form the N-capping motif of the α-helix, we analyzed conformational and stability properties of eight FSD- 1 mutants. We used a shielded methyl group of Leu 18 and a CD signal at 215 nm as a convenient measure of the folded state. Glu 17 →His substitution at the N 3 in S 13 NEKE 17 variant decreased the folded structure content from 90 % to 25 % (equivalent to 1. 8 kcal • mole− 1 destabilization) by disruption of N-capping interactions, and had the most significant effect among single mutants studied here. The Ncap Asn 14 substitution with Arg considerably decreased stability, reducing structure content from 90 % to 40 % (1. 4 kcal • mole− 1 destabilization) by disruption of a helix-capping hydrogen bond and destabilization of a helix macrodipole.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{guidelines}} {{recommend the}} use of capillary refill time (CRT) {{as part of the}} routine assessment of unwell children, but there is little consensus on the optimum method of measurement and cut-off time. METHODS: We searched Medline (from 1948), Embase (from 1980) and CINAHL (from 1991) to June 2014 to identify studies with information on the normal range of CRT in healthy children, the validity of CRT compared with reference standard measures of haemodynamic status, reliability and factors influencing measurement of CRT, such as body site, pressing time and temperature. FINDINGS: We included 21 studies on 1915 children. Four studies provided information on the relationship between CRT and measures of cardiovascular status, 13 provided data on the normal range of CRT, 7 provided data on reliability and 10 assessed the effect of various confounding factors. In children over 7  days of age, the upper limit of normal CRT is approximately 2  s when measured on a <b>finger,</b> and 4  <b>s</b> when measured on the chest or foot, irrespective of whether the child is feverish or not. Longer pressing times and ambient temperature outside 20 °C- 25 °C are associated with longer CRT. Evidence suggests that {{the use of}} stopwatches reduces variability between observers. INTERPRETATION: We recommend use of the following standardised CRT method of measurement: press on the <b>finger</b> for 5  <b>s</b> using moderate pressure at an ambient temperature of 20 °C- 25 °C. A capillary refill time of 3 s or more should be considered abnormal...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} phase field model of {{infiltration}} {{that explains the}} formation of gravity fingers during water infiltration in soil. The model {{is an extension of}} the traditional Richards equation, and it introduces a new term, a fourth-order derivative in space, but not a new parameter. We propose a scaling that links the magnitude of the new term to the relative strength of gravity-to-capillary forces already present in Richards' equation. We exploit the thermodynamic framework to design a flow potential that constrains the water saturation to be between 0 and 1, its physically admissible values. The model predicts a saturation overshoot at the wetting front, which is in good agreement with experimental measurements. Two-dimensional numerical simulations predict gravity fingers with the appearance and characteristics observed in visual laboratory experiments. A linear stability analysis of the model shows that there is a direct relation between saturation overshoot and the strength of the front instability. Therefore our theory supports the conjecture that saturation overshoot, a pileup of water at the wetting front, is a prerequisite for gravity <b>fingering.</b> Eni <b>S.</b> p. A.
