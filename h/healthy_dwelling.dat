50|$|Between 1925 and 1930 Germany was {{the site}} of {{innovative}} and extensive municipal public housing projects, mostly in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne and Frankfurt am Main. These Siedlungen (settlements), were made necessary by the dreadful living conditions of pre-war urban tenements. The right to a <b>healthy</b> <b>dwelling</b> was written into the 1919 Weimar Constitution, but few dwellings were built until economic stability in 1925.|$|E
40|$|The {{planning}} {{intention of}} many post-war urban areas {{was to create}} quiet and harmonious, <b>healthy</b> <b>dwelling</b> areas for mostly working class families. However, unpredicted effects such as safety issues (crime and feeling of being unsafe in public spaces) started {{to take place in}} many of these areas just a few years after realization (Van Wegen and van der Voort, 1991, p. 172 - 173). The urban design of the Dutch post-war areas, like too wide streets, a lot of space between the buildings, windows and doors do not face the streets and blind facades of the backsides of the shops have a negative influence on safety in public spaces (Rueb & van Nes, 2009). Thus, the main research question of this master thesis is: “Which urban design interventions can improve the public space in Osdorp-Oost, in order to increase the safety for the inhabitants”. First, the features of public space in urban environment that contribute to safety are reviewed with the help of literature research. In this report, two approaches about safe urban design are compared. The first one is called Social Safe Design made by van den Voordt & van Wegen. This approach could be described by three factors: visibility, accessibility and attraction. The second approach was made by van Nes et al. It is actually an improvement of the first theory and could be described with the next keywords: accessibility, connectedness, vitality, identity and visibility. It was made with the help of space syntax analysis, which provides a strong scientific base for this approach. The literature review concludes that the second approach is more extended than the first one and will form a good starting point for the design of the graduation project. Next, {{in order to understand the}} main design concepts of the chosen location, in relation to safety, the social and special structure of Western Garden Cities (Osdorp-Oost) was described. Also the data research about the age groups, nationalities, incomes, housing prices and subjective and objective safety were review about the strategies that took place in order to improve the post-war neighborhoods was reviewed. Then in order to understand how the space is currently used in Osdorp-Oost and to link the location with the theory, different fieldwork analyses was performed. Safety related factors that were defined earlier in the theoretical framework such as: infrastructure, functions, the use of the ground floor, buildings heights, location of the entrances and green facilities were mapped and analyzed. In addition, in order to define safe and unsafe places in more detail in Osdorp-Oost, the inhabitant were interviewed about their perception of safe and unsafe places in the neighborhood. Four reference cases were analyzed as well: Wisgerebbuurt, Overtomse Veld, P. C. Hooftstraat and Ertskade in Amsterdam. The results of the performed analyses were implemented in several solutions for Osdorp-Oost in order to increase subjective and objective safety in Osdorp-Oost. The solutions were tested with space syntax analysis and the most suitable one was elaborated in to final design for Osdorp-Oost. The structure of the thesis is as followed. Chapter 1 forms an introduction of the project and describes motivation, problem field and problem statement. Chapter 2 describes the research approach, research questions and methodology. It also provides theoretical framework and location analysis. Chapter 3 describes the fieldwork. In the last chapter 4 the concepts and final design interventions for Osdorp-Oost are described. The chapter will finish with the final critical evaluation of the methods and design. MSc 3, 4 Urban RegenerationUrbanismArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|E

Their report states that " 9, 760 houses were occupied as dwellings let in tenements," and that of these 2, 300, occupied by about 30, 000 persons, were in a condition unfit for habitation. The report recommends the gradual closing of the ruinous houses, and the supervision and daily regulation of the others, and it also says that by the provision of improved sanitary accommodation, and the strict enforcement of {{the provisions of the}} Public Health Act against overcrowding, a considerable proportion of the tenement houses can be converted into <b>healthy</b> <b>dwellings.</b> The report pointed out that it is the duty of the Corporation to determine how many persons are to be allowed to occupy each room, and to ascertain, by frequent inspection, that the number fixed upon be not exceeded. The Commissioners affirmed "that the tenement houses of Dublin appear to be the prime source and cause of the excessively high death rate; that they are not properly classified, registered, and regulated; that they are dilapidated, dirty, ill-ventilated, much overcrowded, and that disease, a craving for stimulants and its consequences?drunkenness and extreme poverty, are thereby fostered, and that until the {{condition of}} these houses shall have been improved the general health of the city will continue to be injuriously affected. ...|$|R

40|$|Apathy is characterised {{by a lack}} of {{motivation}} towards goal directed behaviour and is a symptom of various neurodegenerative diseases. There are various tools {{that can be used to}} assess apathy but a caveat of these is that they usually assess it as a unidimensional concept. Apathy has been recognised to have a multidimensional substructure. The Dimensional Apathy Scale is the only comprehensive measure designed to quantify neurobiologically-based subtypes, called Executive, Emotional and Initiation apathy. The first aim of this study was to explore multidimensional apathy, and its associations with demographic variables, in <b>healthy,</b> community <b>dwelling</b> adults. Secondly, multidimensional apathy was explored in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For each disease group, the validity and reliability of both the self rated and carer rated DAS were also determined. Finally, the association between specific apathy subtype impairments and executive dysfunction was explored in ALS patients. Four hundred <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> adults, eighty-three ALS patients (seventy-five carers), thirty-four PD patients (thirty carers) and forty-nine AD patients (eighty-nine carers) were recruited for the questionnaire study. In the <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> adults, Executive apathy decreased with age, whereas Emotional increased with age. Gender differences were also shown with higher apathy in males on Emotional apathy. There were also employment differences, in that Executive apathy was higher in unemployed individuals compared to those who were employed. Emotional apathy showed difference in type of employment, where full time employed individuals were significantly more apathetic than those employed part time. These findings were taken into account in selecting the appropriate control samples to match our patient groups. In the patient groups, ALS patients were found to be significantly more impaired on the Initiation subscale when compared to controls. Furthermore, Initiation apathy was found to be the most frequent impairment above abnormality cut-off on the carer rated DAS. PD patients were significantly more impaired on Executive and Initiation apathy when compared to controls. These two subscales were most frequently above abnormality cut-off in the carer rated DAS. Finally, AD patients were significantly more impaired on all subscales when compared to controls and, on the carer rated DAS, global impairment over all subscales was most often reported as above abnormality cut-off. Additionally in AD, there was a significant disparity between carer and patient ratings on Executive and Initiation apathy, indicating patients’ impaired awareness. When comparing patient groups, there was a significant difference between carer rated apathy subtype impairments for each patient group. Validity and reliability of the DAS was found to be robust when compared to standard measures of apathy and depression. In the experimental study, a sample of ALS patients (and their carers) and healthy controls (and their informants) were recruited to complete a battery of neuropsychological tests, the DAS, other apathy and depression measures. ALS patients were impaired on tasks of executive functioning when compared to controls. Furthermore, apathy subtype deficits were associated with executive dysfunction in ALS. In conclusion, apathy is a multidimensional concept that manifests in different subtype profiles dependent on neurodegenerative disease. This has further implications for understanding and assessment of cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy, in ALS and other neurodegenerative disease patient groups...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Increasing {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} diseases associated with ageing, as {{the mean age of the}} population in developed countries increases. Vitamin D and parathyroid hormone play key roles in calcium homeostasis, which is integral to skeletal health. AIMS: To assess the vitamin D status of <b>healthy,</b> community <b>dwelling,</b> middle-aged and older females. METHODS: General biochemistry and bone profiles, including ALP, PTH and 25 (OH) D, were determined. RESULTS: Of 143 healthy white women receiving no supplementation or bone modifying treatments, 47 % were vitamin D insufficient (< 50 nmol/L) and only 4 % were sufficient for the time of year. There was no statically significant correlation between age and 25 (OH) D concentrations; neither was there a statistically significant seasonal variation in 25 (OH) D levels noted. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D status should be assessed more often in middle-aged and older females. Expected age-related and seasonal variations in 25 (OH) D levels were not confirmed in this study...|$|R

40|$|Many {{older adults}} {{residing}} {{in long term}} care (LTC) homes have underlying health conditions and limited functionality. The objective {{of this research was}} to address the issues which might affect the health status and functionality of older adults (age ≥ 60 y) living in LTC homes. To achieve this objective, the research was carried out as four studies. In the first study, supplement and medication use was examined, specifically exploring the impact of dementia, and to assess pill burden in older adults residing in LTC home. In the second study, menu served in this LTC was assessed for recommendations of Canada’s Food Guide servings, macro, micro nutrients, and diet quality score. This menu analysis was compared to a similar analysis conducted a decade ago to find out what changes had occurred over time. In the third study, LTC residents were assessed for blood inflammatory markers, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), metabolic syndrome, physical functioning, cognition, pain, and associations between inflammation and markers of functionality. Similar analyses on <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> older and younger adults was conducted to draw differences amongst all three groups, i. e., older frail (LTC residents), older healthy, and younger <b>healthy</b> (community <b>dwelling).</b> In the fourth study the option of adding an anti-inflammatory diet was explored to address the issues of inflammation and compromised menus in LTC. Major findings suggested that there was inappropriate overuse of supplements, yet vitamin D supplements were consumed by only one-third residents of the LTC home. The LTC menu did not meet the recommendations for Canada’s Food Guide servings except for Fruits & Vegetables. Diet quality of the LTC menu was low and indicated the need of improvement, however, the comparison of current menu to a decade old menu showed some improvements. Inflammatory markers in LTC older adults were high, and the majority of subjects had insufficient 25 (OH) D. Metabolic syndrome was seen in about more than one-third of subjects. Significant correlations between C-reactive protein, cognition and activities of daily living were detected. The anti-inflammatory diet was validated from research, and strategies of incorporating it into the diets of LTC residents were addressed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several cross-sectional, case-control and {{prospective}} studies revealed a relation between homocysteine and cognitive function or dementia. These studies included either patient populations or <b>healthy,</b> community- <b>dwelling</b> elderly people. AIM OF THE STUDY: In {{this study we}} tested the hypothesis that homocysteine was inversely associated with cognitive function in a population of institutionalised elderly (aged >/= 60 y; n = 157). METHODS: For testing this hypothesis baseline data of a recently conducted intervention study in institutionalised elderly (median age 83 years) were used. Cognitive function was evaluated by the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). The association between fasting plasma homocysteine level and cognitive function was investigated by multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: In the crude model homocysteine concentration was not significantly related to ADAS-cog score (beta = 0. 061; p = 0. 45). Age {{was found to be}} related to ADAS-cog score (beta = 0. 161; p < 0. 05). Adjusting for age did however not result in a relation between homocysteine and cognitive function.

40|$|Background: Loss {{of muscle}} mass and {{strength}} {{is a significant}} comorbidity in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) that limits their quality of life and has prognostic implications but does not affect everyone equally. To identify mechanisms that may contribute to the susceptibility to a low muscle mass, we investigated microRNA (miRNA) expression, methylation status, and regeneration in quadriceps muscle from COPD patients and the effect of miRNAs on myoblast proliferation in vitro. The relationships of miRNA expression with muscle mass and strength was also determined in a group of healthy older men. Methods: We identified miRNAs associated with a low fat-free mass (FFM) phenotype in a small group of patients with COPD using a PCR screen of 750 miRNAs. The expression of two differentially expressed miRNAs (miR- 675 and miR- 519 a) was determined in an expanded group of COPD patients and their associations with FFM and strength identified. The association of these miRNAs with FFM and strength was also explored in a group of healthy community-dwelling older men. As the expression of the miRNAs associated with FFM could be regulated by methylation, the relative methylation of the H 19 ICR was determined. Furthermore, the proportion of myofibres with centralized nuclei, as a marker of muscle regeneration, in the muscle of COPD patients was identified by immunofluorescence. Results: Imprinted miRNAs (miR- 675 and from a cluster, C 19 MC which includes miR- 519 a) were differentially expressed in the quadriceps of patients with a low fat-free mass index (FFMI) compared to those with a normal FFMI. In larger cohorts, miR- 675 and its host gene (H 19) were higher in patients with a low FFMI and strength. The association of miR- 519 a expression with FFMI was present in male patients with severe COPD. Similar associations of miR expression with lean mass and strength were not observed in <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> older men participating in the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study. Relative methylation of the H 19 ICR was reduced in COPD patients with muscle weakness but was not associated with FFM. In vitro, miR- 675 inhibited myoblast proliferation and patients with a low FFMI had fewer centralized nuclei suggesting miR- 675 represses regeneration. Conclusions: The data suggest that increased expression of miR- 675 /H 19 and altered methylation of the H 19 imprinting control region are associated with a low FFMI in patients with COPD but not in <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> older men suggesting that epigenetic control of this loci may contribute to a susceptibility to a low FFMI...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{census data}} {{has found that}} roughly 40 % of adults 65 years and older not only consume alcohol but also drink more of it than {{previous}} generations. Older drinkers are more vulnerable than younger counterparts to the psychoactive effects of alcohol due to natural biological changes that occur with aging. This study was specifically designed to measure the effect of long-term moderate alcohol consumption on cognitive health in older adult drinkers. An extensive battery of validated tests commonly used in aging and substance use literature {{was used to measure}} performance in specific cognitive domains, including working memory and attention. An age (young, old) * alcohol consumption (light, moderate) factorial study design was used to evaluate the main effects of age and alcohol consumption on cognitive performance. The focus of the study was then limited to light and moderate older drinkers, and whether or not long–term moderate alcohol consumption exacerbated age-related cognitive decline. No evidence was found to support the idea that long-term moderate alcohol consumption in older adults exacerbates age-related cognitive decline.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Our {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} reported that testosterone (T) administration to older men significantly improves cognitive function. This study examined potential changes in insulin-like growth factor (IGF) IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-related binding proteins {{in response to}} T administration in older men {{and their relationship to}} cognitive functioning. METHODS: Twenty-five <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> volunteers, ranging in age from 50 - 80 years were randomized to receive weekly intra-muscular (i. m.) injections of either 100 mg T enanthate or placebo (saline) for 6 weeks. Serum hormone levels and cognitive functioning was assessed at baseline and twice during treatment. RESULTS: Significant positive associations between IGF-I and IGF-II and spatial memory, spatial reasoning, and verbal fluency were observed after 6 weeks of T administration. Increased serum T levels from treatment were positively associated with improvement in spatial reasoning performance, whereas estradiol was associated with a decline in divided attention performance. Serum IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBPs did not change in response to T treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that T, estradiol and IGF-I may have independent and selective effects on cognitive functioning. Positive associations between T levels and cognition are consistent with an effect of androgen treatment, whereas positive associations between IGF-I levels and cognition are reflective of a relationship between endogenous IGF-I levels and cognition. ...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} the stability of the conceptualisation of QoL in the face of normative developmental processes against which to compare changes in response to non-normative events, such as chronic illness. The present study examined the stability of the QoL construct over one year in a cohort of <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> adolescents through applying the response shift (RS) model. Method: A cohort of 356 adolescents (M age = 14. 05) completed the Kidscreen QoL measure on two occasions, one year apart. Both research-design and statistical techniques were employed to assess three types of RS; recalibration, reprioritisation and reconceptualisation. Results: A significant recalibration of small effect size was found for three QoL domains using a then-test, which was confirmed in the domain of autonomy through statistical modelling. No evidence was found for reprioritisation or reconceptualisation RS using either analytical approach. Conclusion: The findings support the assumption that the conceptualisation of QoL is stable during adolescence in the absence of significant health threats. However, researchers and clinicians should be aware of potential recalibration effects of some life domains...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from both}} human and animal studies {{suggests}} that gonadal steroids, such as testosterone, exert activational effects on adult spatial behavior. Endogenous testosterone levels decline gradually but variably as men age; {{it remains to be}} shown whether these decreases are associated with age-related declines in visuo-spatial performance or constituent abilities indicative of generalized age-related cognitive decline. Ninety-six <b>healthy,</b> community <b>dwelling</b> men aged between 38 and 69 years completed the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Test (MRT) together with a battery of tests including processing speed, executive function, perceptual discrimination, working memory, and reaction time measures. Significant main effects of tertiles of calculated free testosterone levels (cEFT) were found on composite measures of processing speed, executive function, and perceptual discrimination ability in a subset of men aged over 50 years in age and crystallized intelligence controlled analyses; higher cEFT levels were associated with poorer performance. Hierarchical multiple regression and path analyses on the whole data set showed that cEFT levels negatively moderated processing speed performance, which in turn predicted both working memory and MRT performance with aging. Together these data suggest that age-related declines in endogenous testosterone levels in healthy middle-to-older aged men are not associated with generalized age-related cognitive decline. Donel M.

40|$|The {{following}} is a normative study in the limits of postural stability demonstrated by fifty-eight <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> individuals aged 18 - 84 years. A decline in the limits of stability perceived by the individual may indicate {{a decline in the}} ability to adapt to changes in the environment. An investigation into measuring such limits across the age continuum is warranted since loss of balance and falls are an increasing problem among the aged. The limits of postural stability were therefore measured using a computerized standing forceplate and a reaching measurement apparatus. As hypothesized, the results indicated that cone-shaped limits of stability and ability to allow a moving target with weight shifting significantly declined with age using an one-way ANOVA (p=. 0001 2 ̆ 6 p=. 0002 respectively). There appeared to be a more rapid decline in these abilities after age 40 years as revealed by an one-way ANOVA. Although a decline in reaching distance was expected, such as decline was not found based on a Pearson Product moment correlation. This was true of reaching with a target and reaching without a target. Increasing age was also not significantly related to standing static sway nor to the number of falls. The subjective fall report was also not related to limits of stability variables. The importance of more precise variable definition was suggested...|$|R

He identified and studied the main features of this concept: health protection through the protection of the environment (air, soil, water), health protection through the proper management of <b>dwellings,</b> <b>healthy</b> living and disease prevention (nutrition, exercise, work and rest, and emotion regulation etc.), disease treatment (medicine and pharmacy). It have been explored and identified 724 species of plants, 150 species of animals, 115 species of minerals used in the traditional medicine of medieval Azerbaijan. It was compiled the list and a detailed systematic review of examined species, and the information on their medicinal properties. information The information on 866 species of multi-component drugs, their classification dosage forms and therapeutic groups was identified and analyzed.|$|R
40|$|Background The MyotonPRO (Myoton Ltd; London) {{is a new}} {{portable}} device for measuring muscle mechanical properties (e. g. tone) and its reliability {{has yet to be}} established. Little is known about between-limb symmetry of mechanical properties in healthy older people, despite symmetry often being used as a measure of unilateral abnormalities in clinical assessment. Since quadriceps is important for mobility, it was selected for the present study. Aims To investigate: (i) between-day intra-rater reliability of a novice user of MyotonPRO; (ii) between-side symmetry of mechanical properties of quadriceps in older males. Methods Twenty <b>healthy,</b> community <b>dwelling,</b> right-lower-limb-dominant males (mean age 71. 7, range 65 – 82 years) were studied. With the participant in relaxed supine lying, the MyotonPRO applied two consecutive sets of 10 taps to induce muscle oscillations of rectus femoris, from which measurements of decrement (elasticity), frequency (tone), and stiffness were obtained. Tests were performed on two occasions {{at the same time and}} day of the week, one week apart. Results Repeated measurements had very high within-day (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC 3, 1 > 0. 90) and high between-day (ICC 3, 2 > 0. 70; mean of two measurement sets) reliability. There was no statistically significant difference between muscle mechanical properties of the dominant and non-dominant muscles ( 0. 05), thereby indicating symmetry. Conclusions High intra-rater reliability was established for MyotonPRO measurements of quadriceps in healthy older males, which were symmetrical between sides. These findings indicate that larger studies are warranted to establish normal reference ranges of data with which to compare patients with muscle abnormalities. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to a balance disturbance, older individuals often require multiple steps to prevent a fall. Reliance on multiple steps to recover balance is predictive of a future fall, so studies should determine the mechanisms underlying differences between older adults who can and cannot recover balance with a single step. This study compared neural activation parameters of the major leg muscles during balance recovery from a sudden forward loss of balance in older individuals capable of recovering with a single step and those who required multiple steps to regain balance. Eighty-one <b>healthy,</b> community <b>dwelling</b> adults aged 70 ± 3 participated. Loss of balance was induced by releasing participants from a static forward lean. Participants performed four trials at three initial lean magnitudes and were subsequently classified as single or multiple steppers. Although step length was shorter in multiple compared to single steppers (F= 9. 64; p= 0. 02), {{no significant differences were}} found between groups in EMG onset time in the step limb muscles (F= 0. 033 - 0. 769; p= 0. 478 - 0. 967). However, peak EMG normalised to values obtained during maximal voluntary contraction was significantly higher in single steppers in 6 of the 7 stepping limb muscles (F= 1. 054 - 4. 167; p= 0. 045 - 0. 024). These data suggest that compared to multiple steppers, single steppers recruit a larger proportion of the available motor unit pool during balance recovery. Thus, modulation of EMG amplitude plays a larger role in balance recovery than EMG timing in this context...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{comprehensively}} investigate the comprehensive relationships between {{depression and the}} characteristics of lifestyle {{and quality of life}} (QOL) of <b>healthy,</b> community <b>dwelling</b> elderly, and compare them according to gender and age groups. 1302 subjects (657 males and 645 females) were used for analysis. The investigators in this study were researchers working at universities in each prefecture. Data collection was conducted in a general delivery survey and interview setting or an education class setting. The geriatric depression scale (GDS) consisting of 15 items with a dichotomous scale was used to assess depression symptoms in the elderly. In addition, 16 items selected from the four factors of economic situation, physical health, social activity, and personal status were used to assess lifestyle. Furthermore, this study investigated life satisfaction, morale, and physical function with the LSI scale, PGC morale scale and the ADL scale of the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, respectively. According to our results, depression characteristics of the elderly differ between gender and age groups. Depression increases in the old-old elderly rather than in the young-old elderly and is highest in old-old females. The factors significantly related to depression in community dwelling elderly were the number of friends and morale. In particular, {{an increase in the number}} of friends was related to a decrease in depression. Depression in the old-old elderly was more significantly related to many lifestyle items compared with the young-old elderly, and especially in the old-old elderly, the extent of social activities related to a decrease in depression...|$|R
40|$|The {{link between}} central {{adiposity}} and cognition {{has been established}} by indirect measures such as BMI or waist-hip ratio. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantification of central abdominal fat {{has been linked to}} elevated risk of cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular disease. However it is not known how quantification of visceral fat correlates with cognitive performance and measures of brain structure. We filled this gap by characterizing the relationships between MRI measures of abdominal adiposity, brain morphometry and cognition, in healthy elderly. Methods: A total of 184 <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> elderly subjects without cognitive impairment participated in this study. Anthropometric and biochemical markers of cardio-vascular risk, neuropsychological measurements as well as MRI of the brain and abdomen fat were obtained. Abdominal images were segmented into subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue compartments. Brain MRI measures were analyzed quantitatively to determine total brain volume, hippocampal volume, ventricular volume and cortical thickness. Results: VAT showed negative association with verbal memory (r= 0. 21, p= 0. 005) and attention (r= 0. 18, p= 0. 01). Higher VAT was associated with lower hippocampal volume (F= 5. 39, p= 0. 02) and larger ventricular volume (F= 6. 07, p= 0. 02). The participants in the upper quartile of VAT had the lowest hippocampal volume even after adjusting for age, gender, hypertension and BMI (b=- 0. 28, p= 0. 005). There was a significant age by VAT interaction for cortical thickness in the left prefrontal region. Conclusions: In healthy older adults, elevated VAT is associated with negative effects on cognition, and brain morphometry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} an association between executive function (EF) and measures of gait, particularly among older adults. This study {{examined the relationship between}} specific components of executive functions and the relative dual task costs of gait (DTC) in community-dwelling non-demented older adults, aged 65 years and older. Methods Temporal (stride time, stride velocity) and spatial (stride length) gait characteristics were measured using a GAITRite ® -System among 62 <b>healthy</b> community <b>dwelling</b> older adults while walking with and without backward counting (BC) at preferred and fast walking speeds. Specific executive functions divided attention, memory and inhibition were assessed using the Test for Attentional Performance (TAP). Other measures included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), amount of daily medications taken, educational level and sociodemographic characteristics. Adjusted and unadjusted multivariable linear regression models were developed to assess the relations between variables. Results High relative DTC for stride time, stride velocity and stride length were associated with divided attention at fast walking speed. High relative DTC for stride time was associated with divided attention at preferred walking speed. The association between high DTC of stride length and memory was less robust and only observable at preferred walking speed. None of the gait measures was associated with inhibition. Conclusions Spatial and temporal dual task cost characteristics of gait are especially associated with divided attention in older adults. The results showed that the associated DTC differ by executive function {{and the nature of the}} task (preferred versus fast walking). Further research is warranted to determine whether improvement in divided attention translates to better performance on selected complex walking tasks. </p...|$|R
40|$|When {{released}} from an initial, static, forward lean angle and instructed to recover {{with a single}} step, some older adults are {{able to meet the}} task requirements, whereas others either stumble or fall. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to use the concept of margin of stability (MoS) to investigate balance recovery responses in the anterior-posterior direction exhibited by older single steppers, multiple steppers and those that are able to adapt from multiple to single steps following exposure to repeated forward loss of balance. One hundred and fifty-one <b>healthy,</b> community <b>dwelling,</b> older adults, aged 65 – 80 years, participated in the study. Participants performed four trials of the balance recovery task from each of three initial lean angles. Balance recovery responses in the anterior-posterior direction were quantified at three events; cable release (CR), toe-off (TO) and foot contact (FC), for trials performed at the intermediate lean angle. MoS was computed as the anteriorposterior distance between the forward boundary of the Base of Support (BoS) and the vertical projection of the velocity adjusted centre of mass position (XCoM). Approximately one-third of participants adapted from a multiple to a single step recovery strategy following repeated exposure to the task. MoS at FC for the single and multiple step trials in the adaptation group were intermediate between the exclusively single step group and the exclusively multiple step group, with the single step trials having a significant, 3. 7 times higher MoS at FC than the multiple step trials. Consistent with differences between single and multiple steppers, adaptation from multiple to single steps was attributed to an increased BoS at FC, a reduce...|$|R
