5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine <b>homosexual</b> women, but not among <b>homosexual</b> women who were not masculine, while adolescent <b>homosexual</b> involvement was important for non-masculine <b>homosexual</b> women but not masculine <b>homosexual</b> women. Bisexual women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in <b>homosexual</b> genital activities in childhood than exclusively <b>homosexual</b> women, but unlike exclusively <b>homosexual</b> women, their <b>homosexual</b> preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively <b>homosexual</b> women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the women}} who {{reported}} <b>homosexual</b> activity had not experienced it more than ten times. Fifty-one percent of women reporting <b>homosexual</b> experience had only one partner. Women with post-graduate education had a higher prevalence of <b>homosexual</b> experience, followed by women with a college education; the smallest occurrence was among women with education no higher than eighth grade. However, Kinsey's methodology was criticized.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homosexual</b> arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while <b>homosexual</b> activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. <b>Homosexual</b> women were more likely to have their first <b>homosexual</b> encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn our {{research}} we explored attitudes toward <b>homosexuals</b> {{in relation to}} social dominance orientation, cross-group friendship and gender. The sample, composed {{of high school students}} of two Sicilian towns, displayed slightly egalitarian and positive attitudes toward <b>homosexuals.</b> In particular, women have shown significantly lower levels of prejudice and apprehension in term of contact with regard to <b>homosexuals</b> than have men. Cross-group friendship with <b>homosexuals</b> had a positive impact on sexual prejudice, apprehension of contact with <b>homosexuals</b> and social dominance orientation. Finally, social dominance was positively correlated with negative attitudes toward <b>homosexuals...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Homosexual</b> men {{tended to}} have had their first <b>homosexual</b> {{encounter}} at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that <b>homosexual</b> males are likely to have been seduced by older men. <b>Homosexual</b> activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; <b>homosexual</b> arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

5|$|Kinsey and {{his staff}} {{reported}} that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female. Of women who had sexual contact with another female, half to two-thirds of them had orgasmed. Single women had the highest prevalence of <b>homosexual</b> activity, followed by women who were widowed, divorced, or separated. The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women; those with previous <b>homosexual</b> experience reported they got married to stop <b>homosexual</b> activity.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} prejudicial attitudes toward <b>homosexuals</b> {{as a function}} of individuals 2 ̆ 7 religious affiliation and orientation. It was predicted that intrinsically oriented individuals would be more prejudiced toward <b>homosexuals</b> than would extrinsically oriented individuals. This trend was expected more for Catholics than for Protestants. Students answered several questionnaires about their attitudes toward <b>homosexuals</b> and their religious beliefs. Although intrinsically oriented individuals were more prejudiced toward <b>homosexuals</b> than were extrinsically oriented individuals, this trend was stronger for Protestants than for Catholics. Understanding how prejudicial attitudes against <b>homosexuals</b> are formed may help to eliminate discrimination toward this group...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) {{production}} {{as well as}} the response of lymphocytes to exogenous IL- 2 was measured in asymptomatic <b>homosexuals,</b> patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and <b>homosexuals</b> with prodromal symptoms. IL- 2 production following lectin stimulation was not significantly different in <b>homosexuals</b> compared to age matched heterosexual controls. In contrast, the response of lymphocytes to exogenous IL- 2 was significantly decreased in AIDS and <b>homosexuals</b> with prodromal symptoms compared to asymptomatic <b>homosexuals</b> and heterosexual controls. These data, combined with the data of others, suggest that an underlying immune defect in AIDS is abnormal IL- 2 receptor expression and resultant poor IL- 2 response...|$|R

A {{tradition}} of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of <b>homosexual</b> activity in Greece. In the West, gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when <b>homosexual</b> acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in <b>homosexual</b> acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting cruising areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, movie theatres, public lavatories (cottages or tearooms), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet <b>homosexual</b> activity.|$|E
