60|$|She {{looked at}} him with startled grey eyes, and her <b>face</b> <b>went</b> <b>pale.</b>|$|E
60|$|But he {{was looking}} unheeding at the music. Then {{suddenly}} the piccolo broke forth, wild, shrill, brilliant. He was playing Mozart. The child's <b>face</b> <b>went</b> <b>pale</b> with anger at the sound. She turned, and went out, closing both doors behind her to shut out the noise.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I and {{my father}} had turned with the crowd, and were close behind the second troop of vagabonds. Joy was on every face. I remarked to papa that [...] "I would not have missed the scene for anything, I might never see such a splendid one," [...] when PLONG went one shot - every <b>face</b> <b>went</b> <b>pale</b> - R-R-R-R-R went the whole detachment, [and] the whole crowd of gentlemen and ladies turned and cut. Such a scene! - ladies, gentlemen, and vagabonds went {{sprawling}} in the mud, not shot but tripped up; and those that went down could not rise, they were trampled over. [...] . I ran a short time straight on and did not fall, then turned down a side street, ran fifty yards and felt tolerably safe; looked for papa, did not see him; so walked on quickly, giving the news as I went.' [It appears, from another letter, the boy was the first to carry word of the firing to the Rue St. Honore; and that his news wherever he brought it was received with hurrahs. It was an odd entrance upon life for a little English lad, thus to play the part of rumour in such a crisis of the history of France.] ...|$|E
60|$|His {{wrinkled}} <b>face</b> <b>went</b> ashy <b>pale</b> as {{the facts}} of the situation were borne in upon him, and he sank back in the chair with both hands uplifted as if in supplication.|$|R
60|$|She had flushed crimson; {{her eyes}} filled but dried again almost at once. And, looking at her <b>face,</b> now <b>gone</b> very <b>pale,</b> and those lips {{tightened}} to a line, Betty stopped in her outburst of ejaculation. When they had wrapped the baby's arm in remedies and cotton-wool, Gyp went into her bedroom, and, throwing herself down on her bed, burst into a passion of weeping, smothering it deep in her pillow.|$|R
60|$|Martin's round {{blue eyes}} flashed, then <b>went</b> <b>pale</b> and dead again.|$|R
60|$|Again {{the youth}} <b>went</b> <b>pale,</b> {{as if the}} spirit were being injured in him.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} so quiet and colourless, it made her heart <b>go</b> <b>pale</b> with fear.|$|R
60|$|He {{ended with}} an odd {{dropping}} of the head in a desperate negation. Gudrun watched him steadily. She had <b>gone</b> <b>pale.</b>|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not till}} {{he was quite}} close that he {{perceived}} the girl. He recoiled, <b>went</b> <b>pale,</b> and said, in a high squealing voice: ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the young}} man’s ominous words, M. le Comte <b>goes</b> <b>pale</b> and demands {{to know what}} {{catastrophe}} could be worse than twenty years of exile? ...|$|R
60|$|William, {{who was a}} tall lad for his years, {{but very}} sensitive, had <b>gone</b> <b>pale,</b> and was looking {{in a sort of}} horror at his father.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{not long}} in telling him, but before I made an end of it he <b>went</b> <b>pale</b> himself. 'See here,' he said, 'are you telling the truth?' ...|$|R
60|$|Gudrun <b>went</b> <b>pale,</b> and a {{darkness}} {{came over}} her eyes, like shame, {{she looked up}} with a certain supplication, almost slave-like. He glanced at her, and jerked his head a little.|$|R
60|$|The youth <b>went</b> <b>pale.</b> He hated these words. But he {{was like}} a gleaming, bright pebble, {{something}} bright and inalterable. He did not think. He sat there in his hard brightness, and did not speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{find the}} very word written there," [...] she whispered. [...] "Well, it's true! I was defenceless--but perhaps {{you were able}} to see that for yourself." [...] Her <b>face</b> coloured, then <b>went</b> deadly <b>pale.</b> [...] "In justice to the man, I want you to {{remember}} that I was. Oh, I was, I was!" ...|$|R
60|$|The Count's impassive face {{remained}} inscrutable, a mask {{of patient}} wonder. By the sudden clenching of his hands alone did he betray how that thrust had smitten him, and his hands none there remarked. Fabrizio da Lodi, standing behind the Duke, <b>went</b> <b>pale</b> to the lips.|$|R
50|$|Leaf venation is {{more evident}} under the leaf. Lateral veins not {{clear on the}} top surface. Mid rib raised {{both sides of the}} leaf. Six or seven pairs of lateral veins. Leaf stems 2 to 7 mm long, and smooth. Old leaves <b>go</b> <b>pale</b> and turn yellow on the stem.|$|R
60|$|And {{the soldier}} turned {{his dark eyes}} to the other's face, {{but there was no}} sight in them: he stared with the {{slightest}} possible cast, holding back his sight, perceiving the blue of his master's eyes, but receiving no look from them. And the elder man <b>went</b> <b>pale,</b> and his reddish eyebrows twitched. He gave his order, barrenly.|$|R
50|$|According to Tanner, Stepinac {{remained}} naive {{about politics}} {{and the nature of}} the Ustaše regime. In 1943, Stepinac travelled to the Vatican and came into contact with the Croatian artist Ivan Meštrović. According to Meštrović, Stepinac asked him whether he thought Pavelić knew about the killings of Serbs. When Meštrović replied that Pavelić must know everything, Stepinac <b>went</b> <b>pale</b> and burst into tears.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl had}} <b>gone</b> very <b>pale.</b> Wolfenden, {{watching}} her closely, {{was surprised at}} her expression.|$|R
60|$|Again over Aaron's <b>face</b> <b>went</b> the ghastly grimace of self-repulsion.|$|R
60|$|Damer's <b>face</b> <b>went</b> awry with pain, but his gesture implied comprehension.|$|R
60|$|One {{night as}} they were sitting thus in the bedroom, at nearly eleven o'clock, they started and listened. Dogs in the {{distance}} had also started to yelp. A mandoline was wailing its vibration in the night outside, rapidly, delicately quivering. Alvina <b>went</b> <b>pale.</b> She knew it was Ciccio. She had seen him lurking {{in the streets of}} the town, but had never spoken to him.|$|R
50|$|Thor then {{prepares a}} strong {{line and a}} large hook and baits it with the ox head, which Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent from the water, and the two face one another, Jörmungandr {{dribbling}} poison and blood. Hymir <b>goes</b> <b>pale</b> with fear, and as Thor grabs his hammer to kill the serpent, the giant cuts the line, leaving the serpent to sink beneath the waves.|$|R
60|$|Her tenseness relaxed, her flushed <b>face</b> <b>went</b> {{gradually}} back to {{its normal}} tint.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan tore {{open the}} envelope, {{and as he}} read his <b>face</b> <b>went</b> white.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Fink's <b>face</b> <b>went</b> {{down again}} despairingly on {{the bosom of}} her friend.|$|R
60|$|Melton's <b>face</b> <b>went</b> blank, and Jacob Welse {{answered}} his own question with shrugging shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucy!" [...] he thundered. It {{was no use}} {{to reason}} with this girl. She had been trapped like a wild thing and could not see any way out. He shot out a strong hand and {{clutched}} her shoulder and with one heave he drew her to him, so her face was under his. It <b>went</b> <b>pale.</b> The telltale eyes dilated in sudden fear. She beat at him with weak fluttering hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Hoden. If a man's {{going to}} be afraid of me at all, that trick will make him more afraid of me. I know it. It works out. When Wright cools down he'll remember, he'll begin to think, he'll realize that I could more easily have killed him than risk a {{snapshot}} at his arm. I'll bet you he <b>goes</b> <b>pale</b> to the gills next time he even sees me." ...|$|R
60|$|Jimmy talked {{some more}} with the Whitefish man, and his <b>face</b> <b>went</b> grave and puzzled.|$|R
60|$|Sir John listened, then {{sank back}} into a chair, while his <b>face</b> <b>went</b> white as ashes.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} Paulvitch looked up. His hideous <b>face</b> <b>went</b> white with terror--the ape was free.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had felt}} himself <b>go</b> <b>pale,</b> {{and a kind}} of rigour had {{affected}} his respiration as he delivered himself. He had been sitting on one of the chairs by the window--the new guest had taken possession of the arm-chair. He turned his head. [...] "Sun Day!" [...] he said over the collar, in the voice of one who warns. [...] "Sun Day!" [...] What people call a [...] "nasty" [...] tone, it was.|$|R
60|$|He stopped {{point blank}} {{when he saw}} the thing in the recess, and his ruddy <b>face</b> <b>went</b> white.|$|R
