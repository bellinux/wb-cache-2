50|$|Lack of equipment/aids such {{as walking}} sticks or walking frames, such as Zimmer frames {{so as to}} improve user stability. Grab bars and <b>hanging</b> <b>straps</b> should be {{supplied}} plentifully, especially in critical areas where users may be vulnerable.|$|R
50|$|Sling {{furniture}} {{is usually a}} suspended, free-swinging chair, bed, or hammock that is made of a framework connected to <b>hanging</b> <b>straps</b> or rope. When attached to poles or a frame for carrying, a sling becomes a stretcher, a simple form of litter.|$|R
50|$|There {{are special}} handles and closed {{handgrips}} available in bathrooms and lavatories to assist users when bending down or over, for example. Extra support for users when moving include walking sticks, crutches and support frames, {{such as the}} Zimmer frame for example. Flexible handles such as <b>hanging</b> <b>straps</b> can also be useful supports.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1990, both {{cars were}} repainted {{into the new}} {{standard}} livery of dark brown and red. DeHa 701 was repainted into a promotional yellow livery in June 1994, and [...] "couple seats" [...] were provided together with heart-shaped <b>hanging</b> <b>straps</b> in a tie-up with a TV Tokyo television programme. It was modified for driver only operation in December 1994.|$|R
5000|$|Ambient {{media are}} out-of-home {{products}} and services determined by some as non-traditional or alternative media. Examples are messages {{on the backs of}} car park receipts, on <b>hanging</b> <b>straps</b> in railway carriages, posters inside sports club locker rooms and on the handles of supermarket trolleys. It also includes such techniques as [...] on the sides of buildings, or slogans on the gas bags of hot air balloons.|$|R
50|$|As built, {{the initial}} {{design of the}} stock was unwelcoming with a cold steel appearance, seats covered in a Rexine-type {{material}} and roof-to-floor grab-poles for standing commuters. Frank Pick, the innovator of so much change on the Underground system, commissioned a well-known artist who improved {{the appearance of the}} upholstery, supplied armrests between individual seats, and replaced the grab-poles with <b>hanging</b> <b>straps.</b> The stock had both first- and third-class accommodation at this time.|$|R
50|$|Internal layout was for {{commuter}} services; low-backed, bus-style 2+2 seating in open saloons, wide gangways with <b>hanging</b> <b>straps,</b> and no lavatory facilities. They {{were the}} first electric multiple units designed by British Rail with electric sliding doors, outside the Scottish Region. They were unable to operate with any other stock due to their new coupling system. Externally, 2001 was finished in unpainted aluminium, while 4001/4002 were painted in all-over Rail Blue. In passenger use, they normally operated together as a ten-car formation.|$|R

5000|$|The Liverpool Overhead Railway was an {{elevated}} railway operating {{in and around}} the dockside of Liverpool that opened on 6 March 1893 with the first electric multiple units operating in the world. The railway opened with 15 two-car trains, built by Brown, Marshall & Co, each lightweight car with a [...] motor and 45 ft long, 8 ft wide with seating for 41 in second class and 16 in first. Power was provided by a third rail between the tracks and air brakes were fitted, the pressure topped up at terminus stations. In the early days, a single motor coach would run off-peak. Leather high-backed seating was provided in the first class compartment, while third class consisted of wooden seating in bays of six, with <b>hanging</b> <b>straps</b> for standees during peak times.|$|R

50|$|Sword-belts were {{generally}} broad and handsomely embroidered. Swords give actual beauty to the Mughal Era. On horseback they were worn on a belt {{hanging over the}} shoulder. Otherwise a man carried his sword by three <b>straps</b> <b>hanging</b> from a waist-belt.|$|R
50|$|It {{is also in}} this tower {{where one}} of the great {{technological}} advances in the world of architecture is captured, a constructive revolution, in which the architect takes to the extreme the structural advances: the floors no longer rest on vertical support elements, but by <b>hanging</b> steel <b>straps</b> operating tensile loads and transmit the weight of the ceramic circular perimeter walls, making them work in compression. This structure, despite being in a confined space is accessible, an important fact to understand their constructive complexity.|$|R
60|$|Groping his {{way about}} in the stables Diogenes found his saddle which he himself had lifted off his horse, and from out the holster he drew a pair of skates. With these <b>hanging</b> by their <b>straps</b> upon his arm, he left the {{building}} behind him and turned {{to walk in the}} direction of the river.|$|R
25|$|There {{are cases}} of young {{children}} playing (on or near bunk beds, trees, clothes lines, play equipment etc.) suffering death or severe brain damage {{as a result of}} <b>hanging</b> by the <b>straps</b> of their bicycle helmets. European Standard EN 1080, which uses a weak retention system designed to open under load, was published in 1997 to address this problem.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just the thing!" [...] {{answered}} his chum. The stick was soon cut, and then both boys went [...] "Fishing" [...] with it. Both {{the gun and}} the rifle were <b>hanging</b> up by <b>straps,</b> {{and it was an}} easy matter to catch the notch under the straps and hoist the weapons up to where the youths stood.|$|R
60|$|The speaker {{had risen}} {{to his feet and}} was {{steadying}} himself by one of the <b>straps</b> <b>hanging</b> from the roof of the car. The other man looked up at him in sudden astonishment, wondering how so trivial a grievance could seem to justify so strong language. He saw that his friend's face was uncommonly pale and that his eyes glowed like living coals.|$|R
50|$|Tanning booths (also {{known as}} {{stand-up}} sunbeds) are vertical enclosures; the tanner stands during exposure, <b>hanging</b> onto <b>straps</b> or handrails, and {{is surrounded by}} tanning bulbs. In most models, the tanner closes a door, but there are open designs too. Some booths use the same electronics and lamps as tanning beds, but most have more lamps {{and are likely to}} use 160-200 watt lamps. They often have a maximum session of 7-15 minutes. There are other technical differences, or degrees of intensity, but for all practical intents, their function and safety are the same as a horizontal bed. Booths have a smaller footprint, which some commercial operators find useful. Some tanners prefer booths out of concern for hygiene, since the only shared surface is the floor.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a line}} {{of workers}} inside the Firestone Rubber Company, ca. 1928. Workers in {{business}} attire stand across a line of tire building machines built into a brick wall. Each device is composed of a series of mechanisms that connect to a circular rubber wheel bearing a tire. Behind each worker stands a cylindrical stand of sorts, across from a wall with rubber <b>straps</b> <b>hanging.</b> Lights line the ceiling and reflect on the spotless floor...|$|R
5000|$|After {{being caught}} in the middle of a gunfight, Amsterdam moved to California and worked writing jokes [...] His {{enormous}} repertoire and ability to come up with a joke on any subject earned him the nickname The Human Joke Machine. He sometimes performed with a mock machine on his chest, <b>hanging</b> by a <b>strap.</b> He turned a hand crank and paper rolled out; he would then pretend to read the machine's joke, although actually the paper was blank [...]|$|R
60|$|The {{youth was}} not clad in monastic garb, but in lay attire, though his jerkin, cloak and hose {{were all of}} a sombre hue, as befitted one who dwelt in sacred precincts. A broad leather <b>strap</b> <b>hanging</b> from his {{shoulder}} supported a scrip or satchel such as travellers were wont to carry. In one hand he grasped a thick staff pointed and shod with metal, while in the other he held his coif or bonnet, which bore in its front a broad pewter medal stamped {{with the image of}} Our Lady of Rocamadour.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, the Gjessing-Nilson {{ergometer}} from Norway used a {{friction brake}} mechanism with industrial strapping applied over the broad {{rim of the}} flywheel. Weights <b>hanging</b> from the <b>strap</b> ensured that an adjustable and predictable friction could be calculated. The cord from the handle mechanism ran over a helical pulley with varying radius, thereby adjusting the gearing and speed of the handle {{in a similar way}} to the changing mechanical gearing of the oar through the stroke, derived from changes in oar angle and other factors. This machine was for many years the internationally accepted standard for measurement.|$|R
5000|$|The Suka was {{a unique}} fiddle that was played vertically, on the knee or <b>hanging</b> from a <b>strap,</b> and the strings were stopped at the side with the fingernails; similar to the Gadulka. The body of the {{instrument}} was {{very similar to the}} modern violin, but the neck was very wide, and the pegbox was crude. This was thought to be the [...] "missing link" [...] between the upside-down or [...] "knee chordophone" [...] instruments, and the modern violin. It died out, and was known only from drawings of a single specimen displayed at an exhibition in 1888.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are cases}} of young {{children}} playing (on or near bunk beds, trees, clothes lines, play equipment etc.) suffering death or severe brain damage {{as a result of}} <b>hanging</b> by the <b>straps</b> of their bicycle helmets. [...] European Standard EN 1080, which uses a weak retention system designed to open under load, was published in 1997 to address this problem.Such helmets are not intended for use anywhere motor vehicles are present. To avoid serious accidents, parents and carers should take care to ensure that children do not wear bicycle helmets during unsupervised play, or when using climbing equipment.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a woman}} {{holding a}} large loch leven trout, ca. 1930. A woman can be seen wearing a {{handkerchief}} tied up around her head, revealing defined curls above her forehead, while smiling down on a large spotted trout, with its mouth wide open, sitting on her hands. A camera case is hooked to a thin <b>strap</b> <b>hanging</b> around her shoulder. It seems that she is standing on swampy grounds. A stream and vegetation are visible in the background.; The back of the photograph says: "Helen Libbals holds 15 -pound loch leven caught in Owens River by Frank Arcularius Jr. largest ever caught in Owens River. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Sonja Hogg {{designed}} the first Lady Techster jerseys with sleeves {{because she did}} not want her ladies showing their armpits. In addition, sports bras did not exist in 1974, and Hogg did not want spectators to see her ladies' bra <b>straps</b> <b>hanging</b> out of sleeveless jerseys either. As Lady Techster basketball rose to national prominence, the jersey sleeves became recognized as part of the Lady Techster brand. Sleeves were a staple of the Lady Techsters jerseys throughout Leon Barmore's tenure as head coach. After Barmore retired in 2002, new head coach Kurt Budke introduced the first Lady Techsters sleeveless jerseys {{at the behest of the}} players.|$|R
5000|$|In 1857, {{when the}} chancel {{of the church}} was demolished, a slab of Purbeck marble was found, about 26 inches by 14, bearing an incised {{portrait}} of {{a man wearing a}} long robe, his hands raised to hold a plain shield or receptacle, with a horn <b>hanging</b> on a <b>strap</b> from his left shoulder. This was tentatively identified as Waleran Venator (Waleran the Huntsman), who held land in the parish and was patron of the living in the 11th century, which was the approximate date of the chancel. However, from the costume being of a later date, Alan de Langford, Verderer of Grovely Wood {{at the end of the}} 13th century, has also been suggested.|$|R
5000|$|Vincent Canby of the New York Times {{called the}} film:More raunchy and less funny {{than any other}} AIP film I've seen. It's a fantasizing {{projection}} of dearly held contemporary myths about romance, sex, humour, ethics, aesthetics, art and movies. In its eclectic way, it's also in bad taste on an almost staggering number of levels. Wit: [...] "non-swimmers shouldn't jump bare ---- into the sea of love." [...] Incidental decor: a jock <b>strap</b> <b>hanging</b> permanently over a screen in Paxton's pad. Style: a mixed up anthology of jump cuts, Resnais-like memory cuts, blown up still photographs all backed up by neo-Simon and Garfunkel. Preliminary box office statistics indicate that {{its going to be}} a smash hit.|$|R
60|$|It {{is quite}} beside the {{question}} to ask which is the better. Neither is. They are different things: that's all. The English newspaper {{is designed to be}} read quietly, propped up against the sugar bowl of a man eating a slow breakfast in a quiet corner of a club, or by a retired banker seated in a leather chair nearly asleep, or by a country vicar sitting in a wicker chair under a pergola. The American paper is for reading by a man <b>hanging</b> on the <b>straps</b> of a clattering subway express, by a man eating at a lunch counter, by a man standing on one leg, by a man getting a two-minute shave, or by a man about to have his teeth drawn by a dentist.|$|R
