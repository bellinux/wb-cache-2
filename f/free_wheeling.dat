Instead, it uses a fine powder of magnetically susceptible material (typically stainless steel) to mechanically link an otherwise <b>free</b> <b>wheeling</b> disc attached to one shaft, to a rotor attached to the other shaft.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} indicates that intrinsic differences and induced changes in aerobic capacity are probably to {{play a critical role}} in the development of chronic diseases like cancer. This study was initiated: (i) to determine how citrate synthase activity, which is routinely used as a marker of aerobic capacity and mitochondrial density in skeletal muscle, was affected by voluntary running on either a motorized activity wheel or a non-motorized <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> and (ii) to investigate the association between aerobic capacity and the carcinogenic response induced in the mammary gland by intraperitoneal injection of 1 -methyl- 1 -nitrosurea. Overall, wheel running reduced cancer incidence (96 versus 72 %, P =[*] 0. 0006) and the number of cancers per animal (2. 84 versus 1. 78, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and induced citrate synthase activity (276 versus 353 U/mg, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001, sedentary control versus wheel running,respectively). Both motorized and <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> running increased citrate synthase activity (373 [*]±[*] 24, 329 [*]±[*] 11 and 276 [*]±[*] 9 U/mg protein, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and reduced the average number of cancers per rat (2. 84, 1. 96 and 1. 63, P[*]<[*] 0. 01), sedentary control, <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> and motorized wheel, respectively. However, regression analyses failed to provide evidence of a significant association between citrate synthase activity and either cancer incidence or cancer multiplicity. Citrate synthase activity is a single measure in a complex pathway that determines aerobic capacity. The multifaceted nature of intrinsic and inducible aerobic capacity limits the usefulness of citrate synthase activity alone in elucidating the relationship between aerobic capacity and the carcinogenic response...|$|R

The biggest part of now {{manufactured}} tram-cars {{is realized}} as a low-floor vehicles. It is very pleasant for passengers, but it brings many difficulties for technical construction {{of such a}} this tramcars. The biggest problem is construction of bogies - it is common, that in the height of classical shaft is the floor, {{so it is not}} possible to use classical mounted axle and it is necessary to use <b>free</b> <b>wheels.</b> The characteristics of classical mounted axle in the rail is quite well known for many years, nor the the characteristics of <b>free</b> <b>wheels,</b> so there is lot of space for research, and more - there is lot of space, how to use features of <b>free</b> <b>wheels,</b> that should be better in the curves, than features of mounted axle. This - and the fact, that Skoda Transportation now manufactures tram-cars type 15 T called ForCity, that are using free-wheels driven by low speed gear-less PMSM - let us to start research project with cooperation with Skoda Electric a VUKV. The project is focused on optimization of control algorithms for upper control system for such a this vehicles. The project has three steps. The first step is simulation of free-wheel driven tram-car in the rail and developement of control algorithms on this simulation. The second step is project and construction of special narrow-track experimental rail car, that would be used for experiments and verification of the algorithms. The last step should be implementation of developed algorithms to control systems of real tram. The experimental rail car is projected as a accumulator powered vehicle with four <b>free</b> <b>wheels</b> driven by four gear-less PMSM suplied from four voltage inverters. These inverters are controled in current, velocity and torque loop by DSPs. The upper control system is realized by National Instruments Compact RIO system, which was chosen because of its good mechanical construction and possibility of graphical programming. Now, there is finishing the construction of the experimetal vehicle and laboratory developement of the algorithms, in a few weeks we are going to start the experimets with the experimetal rail-car at the Mladejov industry railway, so the developed algorithms could be used in 2014 at real tram 15 T.

60|$|His bicycle was {{now very}} old, {{and it is}} one of the concomitants of a bicycle's {{senility}} that its <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> should one day obstinately cease to be free. It corresponds to that epoch in human decay when an old gentleman loses an incisor tooth. It happened just as Mr. Polly was approaching Mr. Rusper's shop, and the untoward chance of a motor car trying to pass a waggon on the wrong side gave Mr. Polly no choice but to get on to the pavement and dismount. He was always accustomed to take his time and step off his left pedal at its lowest point, but the jamming of the <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> gear made that lowest moment a transitory one, and the pedal was lifting his foot for another revolution before he realised what had happened.

Before he got among them he had one of those agonising moments of helpless wrath and suspense that seem to last ages, in which one seems to perceive everything and think of nothing but words that are better forgotten. He sent a column of pails thundering across the doorway and dismounted with one foot in a sanitary dustbin amidst an enormous uproar of falling ironmongery.|$|R
