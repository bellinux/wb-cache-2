25|$|Motorola {{offered a}} 1970s-era {{system based on}} the United States Coast Guard LORAN {{maritime}} navigation system. The LORAN system was intended for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name Metricom. It consisted of an LF LORAN receiver and <b>data</b> <b>interface</b> box/modem connected to a separate two-way radio. The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and longitude in degrees, decimal degrees format based on the LORAN signals. This was sent over the radio as MDC-1200 or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile's approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with electrical noise in urban areas. Sparking electric trolley poles or industrial plants which radiated electrical noise sometime overwhelmed the LORAN signals, affecting the system's ability to determine the mobile's geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a pit mine or port.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Despite {{of all the}} {{advances}} in smartphone tech-nology in recent years, smartphones still remain limited by their battery life. Unlike other power hungry components in a smartphone, the cellular <b>data</b> and Wi-Fi <b>interfaces</b> often continue to be used even when the phone is in its idle state {{in order to accommodate}} background (necessary or unnecessary) data traffic produced by some applications. In addition, bad reception has been proven to greatly increase energy consumed by the radio, which happens frequently when smartphone users are inside buildings. In this paper, we present a Short message service Push based Service (SPS) system to save unnecessary power consumption when smartphones are in idle state, especially in bad reception areas. First, SPS disables a smartphone’s <b>data</b> <b>interfaces</b> whenever the phone is in idle state. Second, to preserve the real-time notification functionality required by some apps, such as new email arrivals and social media updates, when a notification is needed, a push server will deliver a wakeup text message to the phone (which does not rely on <b>data</b> <b>interfaces),</b> and then SPS enables the phone’s <b>data</b> <b>interfaces</b> to connect to the corresponding server to retrieve notification data via the normal data network. Once the notification data has been retrieved, SPS will disable the <b>data</b> <b>interfaces</b> again if the phone is still in idle state. We have developed a complete SPS prototype for Android smartphones. Our experiments show that SPS consumes less energy than the current approaches. In areas with bad reception, the SPS prototype can double the battery life of a smartphone. I...|$|R
