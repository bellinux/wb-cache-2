5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping her <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that}} of Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E

5000|$|Changes in spatial {{attention}} {{can occur}} {{with the eyes}} moving, overtly, or with the eyes remaining fixated, covertly. Within the human eye only a small part, the fovea, is able to bring objects into sharp focus. However, it is this high visual acuity {{that is needed to}} perform actions such as reading words or recognizing facial features, for example. Therefore, the eyes must continually move in order to direct the fovea to the desired goal. Prior to an overt eye movement, where the eyes move to a target location, covert attention shifts to this location. [...] However, {{it is important to keep}} in mind that attention is also able to shift covertly to objects, locations, or even thoughts while the eyes remain fixated. For example, when a person is driving and keeping their <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> but then, even though their eyes don’t move, their attention shifts from the road to thinking about what they need to get at the grocery store. The eyes may remain focused on the previous object attended to, yet attention has shifted.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the mass}} {{adoption}} of smartphones worldwide, a new issue has emerged: {{the use of}} connected devices in the car.

This raises safety concerns related to distracted driving and also pushes the automotive industry to integrate those devices in a safe manner. [...] "Traditional" [...] car makers increasingly rely on the software and electronics expertise of auto suppliers and technology companies to help them design such systems. Google and Apple's mobile OSs' making the bulk of the market, the two tech companies have developed projection modes (Android Auto, Apple CarPlay) to enable mobile devices to be operated in vehicles through the dashboard head unit so that the vehicle occupants don't manipulate their devices directly, use an interface they are familiar with, and spend more time with their <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

5000|$|On July 27, 2009, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute {{released}} {{preliminary findings}} of {{their study of}} driver distraction in commercial vehicles. Several naturalistic driving studies, of long-haul trucks as well as lighter vehicles driving six million combined miles, used video cameras to observe the drivers and road. Researchers observed 4,452 [...] "safety-critical" [...] events, which includes crashes, near crashes, safety-critical events, and lane deviations. 81% of the [...] "safety-critical" [...] events involved some type of driver distraction. Text messaging had the greatest relative risk, with drivers of heavy vehicles or trucks being more than 23 {{times more likely to}} experience a safety-critical event when texting. The study found that drivers typically take their eyes off the forward roadway for an average of four out of six seconds when texting, and an average of 4.6 out of the six seconds surrounding safety-critical events. The study revealed that when traveling at 55 mph, a driver texting for 6 seconds is looking at the phone for 4.6 seconds of that time and travels the distance of a football field without their <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Some of VTTI's conclusions from this study included that [...] "texting should be banned in moving vehicles for all drivers", and that [...] "all cell phone use should be banned for newly licensed teen drivers".

40|$|A {{simulation}} study compared 36 {{young adult}} drivers ’ task completion time, eye behavior, and driving performance while dialing a flip-phone with tactile pushbuttons and an iPhone {{which provides a}} touch screen interface.

40|$|How can we {{navigate}} {{through the}} information landscape {{that is only}} beginning to come into view? The question is more urgent than ever following the recent settlement between Google and the authors and publishers who were suing it for alleged breach of copyright. For the last four years, Google has been digitizing millions of books, including many covered by copyright, from the collections of major research libraries, and making the texts searchable online. The authors and publishers objected that digitizing constituted a violation of their copyrights.
