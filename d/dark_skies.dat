5|$|Its {{size and}} unusually bright surface make Vesta the {{brightest}} asteroid, {{and it is}} occasionally {{visible to the naked}} eye from <b>dark</b> <b>skies</b> (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart. It will be brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.|$|E
5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into <b>dark</b> <b>skies,</b> {{and although it}} faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began to notice that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very <b>dark</b> <b>skies</b> resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E

5|$|The 55 Cancri {{system is}} located fairly {{close to the}} Solar System: the Hipparcos {{astrometry}} satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 81.03 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 12.3 parsecs (40.3 light years). 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just {{visible to the naked}} eye under very <b>dark</b> <b>skies.</b> The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 AU (one thousand times the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 amid <b>dark</b> <b>skies</b> and the threat of rain; Australia was unable to break through despite taking the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians, playing with a {{straight}} bat and stretching forward onto the front foot to block the ball. Tallon dropped Compton for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston when the batsman was on 73. Lindwall bowled well below his top pace in the morning session and the batsmen slowly accumulated their runs. Bedser was the more defensive of the two Englishmen, and Compton drove Toshack past mid on for a four to register his second century of the series, after 235 minutes of batting. Lindwall then beat Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch, but the Englishman survived. England reached lunch at 323/7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket. Compton was on 123 and Bedser on 37, having brought up their century partnership. Five minutes were lost in the morning session when a stray dog invaded the playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of Australian fielders who attempted to catch it.|$|E

50|$|It is {{generally}} understood that a <b>Dark</b> <b>Sky</b> Preserve, or <b>Dark</b> <b>Sky</b> Reserve, should be sufficiently dark to promote astronomy.

25|$|Under {{exceptionally}} good viewing {{conditions with}} no light pollution, the Triangulum Galaxy {{can be seen}} with the naked eye. It {{is one of the}} most distant permanent objects that can be viewed without the aid of a telescope. Being a diffuse object, its visibility is strongly affected by small amounts of light pollution. It ranges from easily visible by direct vision in <b>dark</b> <b>skies</b> to a difficult averted vision object in rural or suburban skies. For this reason, Triangulum is one of the critical sky marks of the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale.|$|E
25|$|The North America Nebula (NGC 7000) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} nebulae in Cygnus, because it is visible to the unaided eye under <b>dark</b> <b>skies,</b> as a bright patch in the Milky Way. However, its characteristic shape is only visible in long-exposure photographs – it is difficult to observe in telescopes because of its low surface brightness. It has low surface brightness because it is so large; at its widest, the North America Nebula is 2 degrees across. Illuminated by a hot embedded star of magnitude 6, NGC 7000 is 1500 light-years from Earth.|$|E
25|$|As the Milky Way {{runs through}} Puppis, {{there are a}} large number of open {{clusters}} in the constellation. M46 and M47 are two open clusters in the same binocular field. M47 can be seen with the naked eye under <b>dark</b> <b>skies,</b> and its brightest stars are 6th magnitude. Messier 93 (M93) is another open cluster somewhat to the south. NGC 2451 is a very bright open cluster containing the star c Puppis and the near NGC 2477 is a good target for small telescopes. The star Pi Puppis is the main component of a bright group of stars known as Collinder 135.|$|E

The {{purpose of a}} <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> preserve is generally to promote astronomy.

This has led to confusion between the terms reserve, preserve, and park.

25|$|M39 (NGC 7092) is an {{open cluster}} 950 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye under <b>dark</b> <b>skies.</b> It is loose, with about 30 stars {{arranged}} over a wide area; their conformation appears triangular. The brightest stars of M39 are of the 7th magnitude. Another open cluster in Cygnus is NGC 6910, also called the Rocking Horse Cluster, possessing 16 stars with a diameter of 5 arcminutes visible in a small amateur instrument; it is of magnitude 7.4. The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent {{the bottom of the}} toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula. The other stars, approximately 3700 light-years from Earth, are mostly blue-white and very hot.|$|E
