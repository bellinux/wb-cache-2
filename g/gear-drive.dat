5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage <b>gear-drive</b> that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
5000|$|The Hydro 1066 {{had less}} drawbar power than the <b>gear-drive</b> 1066 due to {{hydrostatic}} slippage, {{leading to the}} creation of the Hydro 100.|$|E
5000|$|Internal belt-drive ceiling fans. These {{were also}} similar in design to <b>gear-drive</b> and {{friction}}-drive fans; however, {{instead of a}} rubber friction wheel or toothed gear, a small rubber belt linked the motor to the flywheel. The most notable internal belt-drive ceiling fan was a model sold by Toastmaster.|$|E
5000|$|Planetary {{reduction}} drives {{are typically}} attached between {{the shaft of}} the variable capacitor and the tuning knob of any radio, to allow fine adjustments of the tuning capacitor with smooth movements of the knob. Planetary drives are used in this situation to avoid [...] "backlash", which makes tuning easier. If the capacitor drive has backlash, when one attempts to tune in a station, the tuning knob will feel sloppy {{and it will be}} hard to perform small adjustments. <b>Gear-drives</b> can be made to have no backlash by using split gears and spring tension but the shaft bearings have to be very precise.|$|R

50|$|Every Cummins powered Dodge Pickup (since initial {{production}} in 1989) has come {{equipped with a}} turbocharger. It uses a <b>gear-drive</b> camshaft for extra reliability. Also specified is a deep-skirt engine block and extra-strong connecting rods. A Holset turbocharger is used. The original B Series was updated with 24 valves and an electronic engine management system to become the ISB in 1998.|$|E
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} supercharger is {{a specialized}} type of supercharger that {{makes use of}} centrifugal force in order to push additional air into an engine. Increased airflow into an engine allows the engine to burn more fuel, which results in increased power output of the engine. Centrifugal superchargers are generally attached {{to the front of}} the engine via a belt-drive or <b>gear-drive</b> from the engineâ€™s crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gear-drive</b> ceiling fans. These {{were similar}} to (and even less common than) the {{friction}} drive models; however, instead of a rubber wheel on the motor shaft using friction to turn the flywheel, a gear {{on the end of}} the motor shaft meshed with gear teeth formed into the flywheel, thus rotating it. The company [...] "Panama" [...] made gear driven ceiling fans and sold them through [...] "Family Handyman" [...] magazine in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{attachment}} for a CUT is the front-end loader or FEL. Like the larger agricultural tractors, a CUT will have an adjustable, hydraulically controlled three-point hitch. Typically, a CUT will have four-wheel drive, or more correctly four-wheel assist. Modern CUTs often feature hydrostatic transmissions, but many variants of <b>gear-drive</b> transmissions are also offered from low priced, simple gear transmissions to synchronized transmissions to advanced glide-shift transmissions. All modern CUTs feature government-mandated roll over protection structures just like agricultural tractors. The most well-known brands in North America include Kubota, John Deere Tractor, New Holland Ag, Case-Farmall and Massey-Ferguson. Although less common, compact backhoes are often attached to compact utility tractors.|$|E

40|$|Compensation of {{manipulator}} nonlinear dynamics, {{which is}} typical of model-based control schemes, {{has been shown to}} give tracking performance improvements not only for direct-drive robots but also for <b>gear-drive</b> robots. This paper addresses the problem of robust design of linear independent joint feedback controllers in order to contrast imperfect dynamic modeling and disturbance effects. A new scheme that makes use of additional acceleration feedback is proposed and compared with the classical position + velocity feedback scheme, so as to provide robustness to disturbances at very low expense. Further, it is shown how linear feedforward compensation confers enhanced tracking capabilities to the schemes in the case of good model accuracy. Simulation results are provided...|$|E
