The parameters studied were {{the type of}} polymer [poly(-caprolactone) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) ], nature oil (<b>isodecyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and oleic acid) and the quantity of luteolin. Nanocapsules and nanospheres were also prepared and evaluated. Colloidal suspensions were characterized by evaluating pH, the particle size, the zeta potential, the morphological aspect and the kinetic release. A new High Performance Liquid Chromatography method was developed and validated in order to quantify luteolin in colloidal suspension allowing the analyses of the absolute recovery, entrapment efficiency and the kinetic release. The luteolin-absolute recovery ranged from 61. 6 % to 95 %; entrapment efficiency was nearly 100 % in all formulations and the particle sizes were smaller than 185. 5 nm. The nanoparticles prepared with <b>isodecyl</b> <b>oleate</b> show a negative zeta potential. On the other hand, when oleic acid was utilized, the zeta potential was positive. The nanoparticles prepared by using <b>isodecyl</b> <b>oleate</b> have a more perfect spherical shape with a regular surface and form, homogeneity, and lower size dispersion. Nanocapsules and nanospheres have a similar release mechanism of pure diffusion according with Korsmeyer-Peppas’s model. CNPqCAPESFAPES...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} in vivo the anti-inflammatory effect of creams containing kaurenoic acid (KA), isolated from the acetonic extract of the W. paludosa (stems and roots). The herbal drug was incorporated into anionic cream (Lanette®) at 100 &# 956;g/g. Creams containing different permeation enhancers (urea, alpha bisabolol, <b>isodecyl</b> <b>oleate,</b> isopropyl myristate, soy lecithin) were prepared, and the in vivo topical anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by the croton oil-induced ear edema method in mice using dexamethasone cream (5 mg/g) and Acheflan® (essential oil of Cordia verbenacea 5 mg/g) as positive control. The potential cutaneous irritation was evaluated by the agarose overlay assay. KA cream, KA and isopropyl myristate and soy lecithin cream and dexamethasone cream presented inhibition of ear edema of 61. 73 ± 23. 23 %, 71. 71 ± 15. 77 % and 64. 45 ± 13. 41 %, respectively. These results suggest that KA incorporated in the cream showed a greater anti-inflammatory effect than positive control, while KA cream containing a concentration lower than dexamethasone cream presents a statistically similar ear edema reduction compared with the control, with no potential cutaneous irritation being observed...|$|E

40|$|Introdução: A xerose senil (pele seca) é muito comum em pessoas idosas. Além de causar desconforto, predispõe a diferentes desordens dermatológicas. As emulsões cosméticas são usadas para prevenir e tratar a pele seca. No entanto, não se sabe ainda se o efeito hidratante dos diferentes produtos disponíveis é semelhante em jovens e idosos. Objetivo: Desenvolver emulsões cosméticas, avaliar suas características físico-químicas e comparar suas eficácias de hidratação cutânea em mulheres jovens e idosas, através de métodos biofísicos. Materiais e Métodos: Foram desenvolvidas duas emulsões cosméticas com sistemas de emulsionantes distintos, denominadas emulsão NI (álcool cetoestearílico 20 OE e álcool oleílico etoxilado 3 OE) e emulsão CL (lecitina), contendo os mesmos emolientes (álcoois de lanolina, óleo de prímula, óleo de amêndoas, oleato de isodecila, vaselina). Nas emulsões desenvolvidas, foram determinados pH, espalhabilidade, viscosidade, estabilidade e presença de cristais líquidos na estrutura. Na emulsão NI adicionou-se uréia 2 %, lactato de amônio 2 %, ácido pirrolidônico carboxílico 2 %, isomerato de sacarídio 2 % e ácido hialurônico 2 % (emulsão NIA). Como amostra comparativa foi empregada a emulsão MEG que é usada com excipiente em produtos dermatológicos para pele seca. O efeito hidratante das emulsões foi avaliado por meio de ensaio clínico de curta duração, sendo quantificado duas horas após a aplicação do produto por espectroscopia com atenuação de refletância (FTIR-ATR) ou FTIR-ATR e capacitância. As emulsões NI, CL e MEG foram testadas em 49 mulheres (20 ± 2 anos) e em 30 mulheres (70 ± 7 anos). As emulsões NI, NIA e MEG foram testadas em 50 mulheres (22 ± 2 anos) e as emulsões NI e NIA em 17 mulheres (70 ± 4 anos). Resultados e Discussão: As duas emulsões desenvolvidas NI e CL foram estáveis e apresentaram cristais líquidos em sua estrutura. A emulsão NI apresentou as melhores características reológicas, com menor ponto de fluidez e melhor espalhabilidade. O efeito hidratante das emulsões NI, CL e MEG em mulheres jovens, testado por FTIR-ATR, demonstrou que as emulsões NI e CL hidrataram significativamente mais do que a MEG, sendo que o efeito hidratante da NI foi maior que o da emulsão MEG, independentemente da faixa etária testada. No entanto, a hidratação foi significativamente maior em mulheres jovens do que em idosas. A emulsão NIA hidratou significativamente mais a pele de mulheres jovens do que a emulsão NI e significativamente mais a pele de mulheres jovens do que de idosas. Todavia, não houve diferença de hidratação entre as emulsões NI e NIA em idosas. Os métodos empregados para avaliar a hidratação cutânea, FTIR-ATR e capacitância, apresentaram boa correlação de seus resultados. Os resultados obtidos neste estudo demonstram, com clareza, a necessidade de se desenvolverem produtos especiais para pele de pessoas idosas e comprovar a sua eficácia nessa população. Introduction: Senile xerosis (age-related dry skin) is {{very common}} in elderly people. Besides causing discomfort, it predisposes elderlies to {{different}} skin disorders. Cosmetic emulsions are used to prevent and treat dry skin. However, it is still unknown whether the hydrating effect of the different products available is similar in young and elderly people. Objective: To develop cosmetic emulsions, to evaluate their physico-chemical properties and to compare their cutaneous hydration effect in young and old women, through biophysical methods. Materials and Methods: Two cosmetic emulsions were developed with different emulsifying systems, called NI emulsion (cetostearyl alcohol 20 OE, oleyl alcohol 3 OE) and CL emulsion (lecithin), containing the same emollient (lanolin alcohols, evening primrose oil, almond oil, <b>isodecyl</b> <b>oleate,</b> vaseline). In the emulsions developed, pH, spreadability, viscosity, stability and presence of liquid crystals in the structure were determined. In the NI emulsion, urea 2 %, ammonium lactate 2 %, pyrrolidone carboxylic. The emulsion MEG, dermatological vehicle for products for dry skin, was used as comparative sample. The hydrating effect of the emulsions was evaluated through a short-term clinical trial, quantified two hours after {{the application of the}} product through attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) or FTIR-ATR and capacitance. The NI, CL and MEG emulsions were tested in 49 women (aged 20 ± 2 years) and in 30 women (aged 70 ± years). The NI, NIA and MEG emulsions were tested in 50 women (aged 22 ± 2 years) and the NI and NIA emulsions in 17 women (aged 70 ± 4 years). Results and Discussion: both NI and CL emulsions developed were stable and presented liquid crystals in their structure. The NI emulsion presented the best rheological characteristics, with a lower pour point and better spreadability. The hydrating effect of the NI, CL and MEG emulsions in young women, tested by FTIRATR, showed that the NI and CL emulsions hydrated significantly better than the MEG one; besides, NI’s hydrating effect was higher than that of the MEG emulsion, independently from the age bracket tested. However, hydration was significantly higher in younger women than in elderly ones. The NIA emulsion hydrated the skin of young women significantly more than the NI emulsion, as well as hydrated the skin of younger women considerably more than that of elderly women. Nevertheless, there was no difference of hydration between NI and NIA emulsions in elderly women. The methods employed to evaluate skin hydration, FTIR-ATR and capacitance, showed good correlation between results. The results obtained in this work clearly demonstrated the necessity of developing new special products for the skin of elderly people and proving its efficiency in this population...|$|E
