2500|$|Subsequently, James <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> and {{it formed}} {{part of the}} dower of his Queen, Anne of Denmark. Later again it was held by Prince Charles, later King Charles I, who in 1628 sold it to the City of London in part {{satisfaction}} of the large debts of the Crown. [...] Thus, after more than 600 years, the manor’s long connection with the Crown of England finally came to an end.|$|E
2500|$|A third enemy plane {{appeared}} in my ‘10 o’clock’, {{from the right}} to the left: in simple words, almost in the opposite direction. [...] The first MiG zoomed away and I engaged the afterburner to get in an attack position against this new enemy. [...] I reared up my aircraft in a 45 degree angle, inside his turn. [...] He was turning to the left, so I pulled the stick and barrel-rolled to the right. [...] Thanks to this maneuver, I found myself above him, half upside down. [...] <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> until the MiG finished his turn, calculating the time so that, if I could keep on turning behind him, I would get on his tail, with a deflection angle of 20 degrees, {{at a distance of}} 1,500 yards. [...] That was exactly what happened. [...] He never saw me. [...] Behind and lower than him, I could clearly see his silhouette against the sun when I launched two Sidewinders. One of them impacted and tore apart his right wing.|$|E
2500|$|The Wick {{estate was}} a large area of land north of the ancient village of Hove. [...] Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, part of the Goldsmid banking dynasty, bought {{most of the land}} for {{development}} in 1830. [...] The estate was [...] in size and consisted of farmland, pastures and woodland, all centred on Wick Farm. [...] Its boundaries were the parish of Brighton, the road along the seafront, the Stanford estate (a similar landholding, owned by Sir William Stanford) and Dyke Road at the boundary of the parish of Preston. [...] The Wick estate was first described in print in 1247, and it passed through many owners in the next six centuries; Anthony Stapley, one of the regicides of King Charles <b>I,</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> for nearly 50 years. [...] In 1830, Thomas Scutt and Thomas Read Kemp owned the land, and a portion on the south side was used to build the Brunswick estate. [...] They sold the remaining [...] to Goldsmid for £55,525 (£ as of [...] ).|$|E
6000|$|Now the frying-pan or spider <b>I</b> <b>held</b> out {{had stood}} with its handle {{over an open}} lid of the range, so, though nettled, <b>I</b> still <b>held</b> <b>it</b> turned from her, and {{answered}} shortly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had raised}} my bridle-hand, as <b>I</b> have <b>held</b> <b>it</b> low, The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting {{all in a}} row: If I had bowed my head on my breast, as <b>I</b> have <b>held</b> <b>it</b> high, The kite that {{whistles}} above us now were gorged till she could not fly." [...] Lightly answered the Colonel's son: [...] "Do good to bird and beast, But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.|$|R
6000|$|... "It warn't easy, Pip, for me {{to leave}} them parts, nor yet it warn't safe. But <b>I</b> <b>held</b> to <b>it,</b> and the harder it was, the {{stronger}} <b>I</b> <b>held,</b> for <b>I</b> was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy, I done it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|An {{hour or more}} {{must have}} passed, when, putting the glass over her lips again, I saw no mark on it. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> closer and closer. I dulled it accidentally with my own breath, and cleaned it. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> over her again. Oh, Mary, Mary, the doctor was right! I ought to have only thought of you in heaven! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{did not ask}} by whom, {{for with}} his quick eye he {{perceived}} that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in my hand.|$|E
60|$|I gave a pull. Ye gods! The tooth, was loose! Out {{it came on}} the instant. I was jubilant as <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> aloft in the forceps.|$|E
6000|$|Wallenstein. 'Tis true! {{they saw}} me always as I am-- [...] Always! I did not cheat them in the bargain. [...] 180 [...] <b>I</b> never <b>held</b> <b>it</b> worth my pains to hide [...] The bold all-grasping habit of my soul.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know I have no {{business}} here,' he said, answering the look. 'But I had a great wish to see you, and inquire how you were. You can give your hand to me, seeing how often <b>I</b> have <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in past days?' ...|$|R
60|$|In such case, Paul and I {{were bound}} to carry the sad news back to the volunteers without delay; but while {{there was a chance}} of our being able to give him succor, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> that <b>it</b> was our duty to make every effort in such direction.|$|R
6000|$|I gat some gear wi' mickle care, [...] <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> weel thegither; [...] But now it's gane, and {{something}} mair-- [...] I'll go {{and be a}} sodger! ...|$|E
6000|$|This pledge attentively I view'd, [...] And {{sparkling}} as <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> near, [...] Methought one {{drop the}} stone bedew'd, [...] And ever since I've lov'd a tear.|$|E
6000|$|But {{one might}} take a horse to water----! <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> up before her, but I couldn't make her look at it. [...] "How {{do you know what}} I mayn't, or may, have liked?" ...|$|E
50|$|Arnulf II of Boulogne († 972) was {{a son of}} Count Adalolf. He succeeded as Count of Boulogne in 964 {{after the}} death of his uncle Arnulf <b>I,</b> and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> until his own death. He was the father of Arnulf III, Count of Boulogne.|$|R
6000|$|She {{struggled}} to free her hand; <b>I</b> still <b>held</b> <b>it.</b> She {{tried to change}} the subject. [...] "There is one thing you haven't told me yet," [...] she said, with a faint, forced smile. [...] "Have you seen the apparition of me again since I left you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{that rather}} <b>held</b> <b>it</b> better men should perish one by one, [...] Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon! ...|$|R
60|$|Here I put out my {{hand and}} felt in the dust, and {{presently}} my fingers touched something. It was a human tooth, very yellow, but sound. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> up {{and showed it to}} Ayesha, who laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] I said, {{throwing}} a blanket over my shoulders, {{for the air}} was chilly, [...] "now let us talk," [...] and taking the lantern which Hans had thoughtfully lighted, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> up and contemplated them.|$|E
6000|$|The damask tinge deepened {{a little}} in her cheeks, and she strove to draw the hand away, but <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> fast, continuing: [...] "No man could have behaved more pluckily; but--out of curiosity--were you not just a little frightened?" ...|$|E
50|$|Vicenza {{came under}} rule of Venice in 1404, and its {{subsequent}} history {{is that of}} Venice. It was besieged by the Emperor Sigismund, and Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>held</b> possession of <b>it</b> in 1509 and 1516.|$|R
6000|$|He {{continued}} to look at me; then he gave a laugh which was not the contradiction, but quite the attestation, of the effect produced on him by my grip. If I had wanted to hold him <b>I</b> <b>held</b> him. <b>It</b> only came to me even that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> him too much. I felt this in fact with the next thing he said. [...] "If you're too excited, then, to be coherent now, {{will you tell me}} to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Can {{you doubt}} it?' he said earnestly. 'But even then I was {{surprised}} into the avowal, and <b>I</b> would have <b>held</b> <b>it</b> back if possible, if I had guessed {{what was going}} to happen.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{filled a}} glass with St. Galmier, {{and gave it}} to him to drink. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> to his mouth as though he were a child. He gulped down a mouthful, and some of it was spilt on his shirt-front.|$|E
6000|$|... "She didn't {{make any}} answer, but {{she gave me}} her hand; and she couldn't have done {{anything}} I liked better than that. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> as long as I could, which wasn't very long, and then she went down to her father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be afraid; don't be afraid. We'll break camp again to-morrow--ah me! But I {{want to go}} myself," [...] I added. I {{took her}} hand in farewell, but spoke again while <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "The way you put it, about Linda, was very bad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Resigned! What of that? <b>I</b> <b>held</b> my tongue! <b>It</b> was all I could do! I {{never knew}} {{things could be}} worse till I saw it was killing him, and then all I could do was still to keep silence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|As I {{said this}} <b>I</b> <b>held</b> the {{knapsack}} {{with one hand}} while I quickly turned the screw with the other. In a few moments it was high above my head, while <b>I</b> with difficulty <b>held</b> <b>it</b> down by the straps. [...] "Look!" [...] I cried. And then I released my hold, and the knapsack shot into the air and disappeared into the upper gloom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Washington," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "old Mr. Carvel {{has ever been}} a good friend to me. And, though I could not but {{perceive}} which way the lad was tending, <b>I</b> had <b>held</b> <b>it</b> but a poor return for friendship had I sought by word or deed {{to bring him to}} my way of thinking. Nor have I ever suffered his views in my presence." ...|$|R
60|$|And I dared. I {{would not}} permit these animals to laugh at any fastidiousness of mine. I stooped {{and picked up the}} heart, and while I {{concealed}} and conquered my qualms <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in my hand and felt it beat in my hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was," [...] {{he said in}} a matter-of-fact tone, [...] "a golden, {{transparent}} liquid. Very golden, like a warm-tinted Chablis. When {{water was}} added it became streaked and opalescent, with a kind of living quiver in it. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> up to the light." ...|$|E
6000|$|And I walked as if apart [...] From myself, when I could stand, [...] And I pitied my own heart, [...] As if <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in my hand-- [...] Somewhat coldly, {{with a sense}} [...] Of {{fulfilled}} benevolence, [...] And a [...] "Poor thing" [...] negligence.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{a pretty}} plain demonstration; but I was used to it, as what young man of fortune is not?--and a danger known is a danger avoided. I pressed the hand <b>I</b> <b>held</b> gently, relinquished <b>it,</b> and then observed, in a {{somewhat}} disappointed tone---- ...|$|R
60|$|The chair {{returned}} to us more slowly. Miserrimus Dexter was working {{it with one}} hand only. In the other he held a harp of a pattern which I had hitherto only seen in pictures. The strings were few in number, and the instrument was so small that <b>I</b> could have <b>held</b> <b>it</b> easily on my lap. It was the ancient harp of the pictured Muses and the legendary Welsh bards.|$|R
50|$|In 1295 <b>it</b> was <b>held</b> by Sir Michael Trenchard, and in 1301 by Walter Trenchard. William <b>I</b> Trenchard <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in 1314 and William II Trenchard <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in 1345. The last in {{the male}} line of Trenchard left a {{daughter}} and heiress, Isabella Trenchard (d.1408), who married Thomas Tremayne of Carwithenack in the parish of Constantine, Cornwall, and the manor of Collacombe passed to her descendants from this marriage. She survived her husband and remarried to Sir John Damerell, who by apparent coincidence was of the same family as the Domesday Book holder Robert d'Aumale (alias d'Amarell, Damarell, etc., Latinised to de Albemarle, de Albamara, etc.). As Sir John Damerell died without progeny he bequeathed {{to his wife and}} her progeny by her first husband Thomas Tremayne, the manors of North Huish, Sydenham Dammarel and Whitchurch.|$|R
