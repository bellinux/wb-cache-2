5|$|A {{study by}} Arima et al. {{published}} in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling {{to provide the}} first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to soy production. Previously, the indirect impacts of soy crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a global scale, while the study took a regional approach. The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for cattle production on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC <b>in</b> <b>measuring</b> the carbon footprint of soy crops, whether produced for biofuels or other end-uses.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all particles behave {{to an extent}} like waves. In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles {{is that it is}} mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy <b>in</b> <b>measuring</b> a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, the {{autocorrelation}} function c(r) {{of the electron}} density (also known as the Patterson function) can be computed directly from the reflection intensities, without computing the phases. In principle, this {{could be used to}} determine the crystal structure directly; however, it is difficult to realize in practice. The {{autocorrelation function}} corresponds to the distribution of vectors between atoms in the crystal; thus, a crystal of N atoms in its unit cell may have N(N-1) peaks in its Patterson function. Given the inevitable errors <b>in</b> <b>measuring</b> the intensities, and the mathematical difficulties of reconstructing atomic positions from the interatomic vectors, this technique is rarely used to solve structures, except for the simplest crystals.|$|E
5|$|In 1644, the Italian Jesuit Daniello Bartoli {{reported}} seeing two darker patches on Mars. During the oppositions of 1651, 1653 and 1655, when the planet made its closest {{approaches to the}} Earth, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli and his student Francesco Maria Grimaldi noted patches of differing reflectivity on Mars. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. On November 28, 1659 he made an illustration of Mars that showed the distinct dark region now known as Syrtis Major Planum, and possibly one of the polar ice caps. The same year, he succeeded <b>in</b> <b>measuring</b> the rotation period of the planet, giving it as approximately 24 hours. He made a rough estimate of the diameter of Mars, guessing that it is about 60% {{of the size of}} the Earth, which compares well with the modern value of 53%. Perhaps the first definitive mention of Mars's southern polar ice cap was by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, in 1666. That same year, he used observations of the surface markings on Mars to determine a rotation period of 24h 40m. This differs from the currently-accepted value by less than three minutes. In 1672, Huygens noticed a fuzzy white cap at the north pole.|$|E
5|$|Once a human-only {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required {{to pick the}} best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting {{is due to the}} chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved <b>in</b> <b>measuring</b> the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases.

5000|$|In this piece, Debussy composes {{the music}} using motivic development, rather than {{thematic}} development. After all, “Debussy mistrusted thematic {{development as a}} method of composition.” [...] Fundamentally, the entire piece is made up of two basic motifs, with the first motif existing in three different variations, making 4 fragments in total (not counting the inversions and transpositions of each). [...] The motifs are: 1) D-E-B ascending; 1a) D-E-A ascending; 1b) D-E-G ascending; 2) E-C# descending. Debussy masterfully saturates the entire structure of the piece with these motifs in large- and small-scale ways. For example, motif 1 appears {{in the bottom of the}} right-hand chords on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarter notes of measure 14 (D-E-B), and again in the next three quarter note beats (D-E-B). Not by coincidence, motif 1b is heard in the 4th, 5th, and 6th quarter note beats of measure 14 (B-D-E). Motif 1 is heard on a broader scale in the bass notes (dotted whole notes) <b>in</b> <b>measures</b> 1-16, hitting the notes of the motif in inversion and transposition on the down-beats of measures 1, 15, and 16 (G-C-B). Also within measures 1 through 15 are two occurrences of motif 2 (G <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 1, E <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 5; E <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 5, C <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 15.) Motif 1 is also heard in a soprano voice from measure 1-15: The high D <b>in</b> <b>measures</b> 1, 3, and 5; the soprano E octave that occurs 12 times from measures 6-13; the high B <b>in</b> <b>measures</b> 14 and 15. Throughout all of this motivic repetition, transposition, and inversion, the themes (longer phrases made up of the smaller motifs) stay very much static, with only occasional elongation or shortening throughout the piece: The rising pentatonic theme <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 1 (theme 1) repeats <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 3, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 84, 85, and with a slight variations <b>in</b> <b>measures</b> 28-40 and 72-83.

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>measure</b> 108, the {{beginning}} of the recapitulation begins just as {{the beginning}} of the exposition does—the 2nd violin, viola, and cello sustaining a tonic chord while the 1st violin plays the sunrise motif above it. <b>In</b> <b>measure</b> 135, the allegro con spirito 16th-note section returns in the 1st violin, punctuated by staccato eighth-notes in the other instruments. The 16th-notes trade off to the 2nd violin, culminating in an all-instrument unison <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 140. After this, the opening theme returns again, with the solo line beginning with the cello and moving up through the viola to the 2nd violin. <b>In</b> <b>measure</b> 151, all strings crescendo to the returning 16th-note theme <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 152. <b>In</b> <b>measure</b> 162, the staccato eighth-note trade-off section returns, in the tonic key and piano dynamic. A fortissimo appears <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 172, beginning the lead into the I7 chord fermata. Beginning <b>in</b> the following <b>measure,</b> the viola, and two violins pass each other the opening sunrise motif for a measure at a time, while the remaining instruments sustain chords. The tonic returns <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 181, with a brief teaser of the staccato eighth-note theme, to be replaced by the 16th-notes played by all instruments in the fortissimo dynamic. In the final three bars, all four instruments play a succession of tonic B flat major chords.|$|R

5000|$|The {{opening of}} the {{movement}} begins {{in a way that}} seemingly contradicts the allegro con spirito marking.

The lively 16th-note section returns <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 50, beginning with 16th-notes in the cello which move to the viola, and finally, the violins. <b>In</b> <b>measure</b> 60, all instruments drop to piano for a six-measure staccato eighth-note section before jumping to an all 16th-note ff <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 66 to finish off the exposition.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 69 {{begins with}} the same texture as does {{the opening of the}} movement—with the 2nd violin, viola, and cello sustaining a chord while the 1st violin plays a solo on top. The first chord, sustained from bars 69-72, is a d minor chord, the relative minor of the dominant F major. The second chord, sustained from bars 75-79, is an F sharp diminished seventh chord, resolving to G minor <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 80, which signifies the return of trading moving 16th-notes. The following 5 measures revolve around G minor, only to modulate to E-flat major <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 86. The major tonality lasts but two measures, as it shifts to F minor <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 88, F sharp diminished in 89, and G minor <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 90. <b>In</b> <b>measure</b> 96, the violins play staccato eighth-notes followed by eighth note rests, while the viola and cello fill in the violins' eighth note rests with their own eighth notes. This sets up a pattern {{for the rest of the}} development section, in which one instrument, mainly the 1st violin (<b>in</b> <b>measures</b> 98-102), fills <b>in</b> an eighth-rest with a lone eighth-note, thus giving each measure a steady eighth-note pulse. Throughout this section, the dynamic gradually drops from forte to pianissimo by means of a poco a poco decrescendo. When the pianissimo is finally reached <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 105, the retransition to the recapitulation begins, ending on the dominant seventh chord (F) of the original key, B flat Major.|$|R

The A section leads to a new section that starts with solo violin alone <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 222 where the materials are worked out. This section again finishes with a small cadenza by the solo violin <b>in</b> <b>measure</b> 266. The coda begins at measure 267 with a faster tempo marking.
