5000|$|Hannemann was {{the first}} {{employee}} of a German Jobcenter to publicly criticise the labour market policy of Agenda 2010. She claimed in her Altona-Blog and many presentations and interviews that [...] "support and demand" [...] (Fördern und Fordern) - the proclaimed goal of the Hartz-concept gave way to technocratic specifications long ago. Hartz IV does not aim at offering a perspective to unemployed people to reenter the labour market but instead force them out of receiving benefits through sanctions. The <b>federal</b> <b>labour</b> agency declared during the <b>labour</b> <b>court</b> trial that the abuse described by Hannemann doesn't exist {{and that she was}} endangering thousands of Jobcenter employees. Instead she simply chose the wrong job. Hannemann objected and claimed to be able to prove her allegation with documents.|$|R
