40|$|One of <b>epileptology's</b> {{fundamental}} aims is {{the formulation}} of a universal, internally consistent seizure definition. To assess this aim's feasibility, three signal analysis methods were applied to a seizure time series and performance comparisons were undertaken among them and {{with respect to a}} validated algorithm. One of the methods uses a Fisher's matrix weighted measure of the rate of parameters change of a 2 n order auto-regressive model, another is based on the Wavelet Transform Maximum Modulus for quantification of changes in the logarithm of the standard deviation of ECoG power and yet another employs the ratio of short-to-long term averages computed from cortical signals. The central finding, fluctuating concordance among all methods' output as a function of seizure duration, uncovers unexpected hurdles in the path to a universal definition, while furnishing relevant knowledge in the dynamical (spectral non-stationarity and varying ictal signal complexity) and clinical (probable attainability of consensus) domains.

Our research was realized on rat hippocampal slices in vitro and it compares the experimental biochemical models (low-Mg 2 +, high-K+, Carbachol, Bicuculline and 4 -Aminopyridine model). These changes in the environment of slice should evoke the epileptiform activity in the nervous tissue of the rat. The final aim of the thesis is to create an experimental model of epileptiform activity in vitro in our setup for imaging techniques and NO detection. Methods: Experiments were performed in rat hippocampal slices in vitro. Rats were deeply anaesthetized with ether and decapitated.

40|$|The most {{reliable}} technique for {{the diagnosis of}} nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is nocturnal video-polysomnography, which is an expensive procedure and unavailable in many Departments of Neurology and <b>Epileptology</b> around the world. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the role of routine video-EEG and video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime, in the diagnosis of NFLE. We studied 23 patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks using a 3 -level neurophysiological evaluation, including video-EEG when awake (level 1), video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime (level 2) and nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3). All the patients had a normal video-EEG when awake. The video-EEG after sleep deprivation (level 2) allowed a diagnosis of NFLE in 52. 2 % of the patients, while the nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3) allowed this diagnosis in 87. 0 % of the same sample. In the patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks, a video-EEG after sleep deprivation performed during the daytime, could be useful for diagnosis in about one half of cases. This methodology is routinely performed in many Departments of Neurology and <b>Epileptology,</b> and is much less binding and expensive than nocturnal video-polysomnography and so it could be important economically for the health service...|$|E

40|$|The {{distinction}} between generalized and partial epilepsies is probably one, {{if not the}} most, pregnant assertions in modern <b>epileptology.</b> Both absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the prototypic seizures found in generalized epilepsies, are classically seen {{as the result of}} a rapid, synchronous recruitment of neuronal networks resulting in impairment of consciousness and/or convulsive semiology. The term generalized also refers to electroencephalographic presentation, with bilateral, synchronous activity, such as the classical 3 Hz spike and wave discharges of typical absence epilepsy. However, findings obtained from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies over the last few years, contradict this view, showing a rather focal onset for most of the so-called generalized seizure types.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{impact of}} a {{scientific}} article {{is proportional to the}} citations it has received. In this study, we set out to identify the most cited works in <b>epileptology</b> in order to evaluate research trends in this field. METHODS: According to the Web of Science database, articles with more than 400 citations qualify as "citation classics". We conducted a literature search on the ISI Web of Science bibliometric database for scientific articles relevant to epilepsy. RESULTS: We retrieved 67 highly cited articles (400 or more citations), which were published in 31 journals: 17 clinical studies, 42 laboratory studies, 5 reviews and 3 classification articles. Clinical studies consisted of epidemiological analyses (n= 3), studies on the clinical phenomenology of epilepsy (n= 5) – including behavioral and prognostic aspects – and articles focusing on pharmacological (n= 6) and non-pharmacological (n= 3) treatment. The laboratory studies dealt with genetics (n= 6), animal models (n= 27), and neurobiology (n= 9) – including both neurophysiology and neuropathology studies. The majority (61 %) of citation classics on epilepsy were published after 1986, possibly reflecting the expansion of research interest in laboratory studies driven by the development of new methodologies, specifically in the fields of genetics and animal models. Consequently, clinical studies were highly cited {{both before and after the}} mid 80 s, whilst laboratory researches became widely cited after 1990. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the main drivers of scientific impact in the field of <b>epileptology</b> have increasingly become genetic and neurobiological studies, along with research on animal models of epilepsy. These articles are able to gain the highest numbers of citations in the time span of a few years and suggest potential directions for future research. </span...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEpilepsy is {{a common}} {{neurological}} condition which affects {{the central nervous system}} that causes people to have a seizure and can be assessed by electroencephalogram (EEG). Electroencephalography (EEG) signals reflect two types of paroxysmal activity: ictal activity and inter-ictal paroxystic events (IPE). The relationship between IPE and ictal activity is an essential and recurrent question in <b>epileptology.</b> The spike detection in EEG is a difficult problem. Many methods have been developed to detect the IPE in the literature. In this paper we propose three methods to detect the spike in real EEG signal: Page Hinkley test, smoothed nonlinear energy operator (SNEO) and fractal dimension. Before using these methods, we filter the signal. The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) filter is used to remove the noise in an EEG signal...|$|E

The spatial and temporal dynamics of the epileptogenic process is still not clear completely especially the most challenging aspects of <b>epileptology</b> which is the anticipation of the seizure.
