25|$|Classical {{figures have}} not {{discussed}} {{the subject as}} it has only {{come up in the}} 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Koran.</b> The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).|$|E

In addition to his faith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Koran</b> and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions; he learnt Sanskrit, read the Bhagavad Gita {{and he was a}} vegetarian. Kalam also enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena (a South Indian string instrument), and listening to Carnatic devotional music every day. In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming President, he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating that [...] "uring the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of all religions ... I would like to endeavour to work for bringing about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country". Describing Kalam as a unifier of diverse traditions, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor stated, [...] "Kalam was a complete Indian, an embodiment of the eclecticism of India's heritage of diversity". BJP leader L. K.

The data analyzed consists of a sample of 107 words and phrases which are categorized as: metaphors of ear, eye, face, and hand. Out of the seven procedures proposed by Newmark for translating metaphors, the translators applied five procedures. None of the translators applied Newmark’s fourth or sixth procedure and no new procedure was observed. The results reveal that among 107 metaphors examined, there is a general tendency (57. 94 %) towards reproducing <b>the</b> same image <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TL, and the three translators translated 68 metaphors (63. 55 %) using similar procedures. This study concludes that the likely and the most frequent metaphor translation procedures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holy <b>Koran</b> are: (1), to reproduce <b>the</b> same image <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TL, Newmark’s first procedure; and (2), to convert metaphor to sense (literal meaning), Newmark’s fifth procedure...|$|R
