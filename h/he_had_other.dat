5|$|Although Charles {{had been}} criticised {{severely}} for granting the large ransom payment to the Vikings, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> more critical issues {{to deal with}} at the same time, including disputes with his brothers, regional revolts and disgruntled nobles, as well as pressure from abroad. Since he would have trouble trusting his own counts to assemble and lead troops to defeat Ragnar's large force militarily, paying them off instead would buy Charles time, and possibly peace from further Viking raids—at least in the near future.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack to Game of Thrones was {{originally}} to be composed by Stephen Warbeck. On February 2, 2011, only ten {{weeks prior to}} the show's premiere, {{it was reported that}} Warbeck had left the project and Ramin Djawadi had been commissioned to write the music instead. The music supervisor of Game Of Thrones Evyen Klean first suggested Djawadi to showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss as the replacement for Warbeck, and although Djawadi was reluctant as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> commitments at that time, they managed to persuade him to accept the project.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hearing}} into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt {{testified that he}} offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt testified that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E

5|$|In late 2002, Miller {{divorced}} {{his wife}} Peg, {{with whom he}} had four sons. He did so to marry his long-term mistress Marie Challman, {{with whom he had}} been living since 1999. Challman was a hospital receptionist and Miller reasoned that he would receive more effective medical treatment by moving to Melbourne to live with her, as his specialist doctors also lived there. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> long-term mistresses, including an Australian beauty queen with whom he was photographed in public. During his later years, his illness contributed to what his family felt was a deteriorating attitude and he fell out with his sons, but they were reconciled shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Pee-wee's Playhouse aired from September 13, 1986, until November 10, 1990. Reubens had {{originally}} {{agreed to do}} two more seasons after the third, and when CBS asked Reubens {{about the possibility of}} a sixth season he declined, wanting to take a sabbatical. Reubens had been suffering from burnout from playing Pee-wee full-time and had been warning that Pee-wee was temporary and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> ideas he would like to work on. The parties agreed to end the show after five seasons, which included 45 episodes and a Christmas Special. Playhouse garnered 15 Emmy Awards, all of them in the Creative Arts Emmy Award category.|$|E
5|$|Washington countered Trotter's attacks with {{a variety}} of tactics. He took various legal actions against Trotter, {{including}} at least one libel suit and criminal charges. In addition, he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others. Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter's radical voice. As a result of such activities, Trotter's printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client. But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the Guardian despite the setback.|$|E

Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> sponsors during his career, his No. 3 is associated in fans' minds with his last sponsor GM Goodwrench and his last color scheme— a predominantly black car with bold red and silver trim. The black and red No. 3 continues {{to be one of the}} most famous logos in North American motor racing.|$|E
25|$|By {{the winter}} of 1904, Scriabin {{and his wife had}} {{relocated}} to Switzerland, where he began work on the composition of his Symphony No. 3. While living in Switzerland, Scriabin was separated legally from his wife, with whom he had had four children. The work was performed in Paris during 1905, where Scriabin was now accompanied by Tatiana Fyodorovna Schloezer—a former pupil and the niece of Paul de Schlözer. With Schloezer, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> children, including a son named Julian Scriabin, a precocious composer of several piano works before he drowned in the Dnieper River at Kiev in 1919 at the age of 11.|$|E
25|$|Grace {{missed a}} large part of the 1879 season because he was doing the final {{practical}} for his medical qualification and, for the first time since 1869, he did not complete 1,000 runs, though he did take 105 wickets. Having qualified as a doctor in November 1879, he had to give priority to his new practice in Bristol for the next five years. As a result, his cricket sometimes had to be set aside. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> troubles including a serious bout of mumps in 1882. He never topped the seasonal batting averages in the 1880s and from 1879 to 1882, he did not complete 1,000 runs in the season.|$|E

25|$|William VI did not {{immediately}} react to this setback; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> things on his mind, being {{at war with the}} Duke of Guelders as he was, and receiving messages of the raids his Hoek enemy William, Lord of Arkel was making on his territories all the time. So in June 1411 he made a truce with the Frisians, which was renewed in the following month. When he began organising a campaign for the middle of August, the Frisians became somewhat more accommodating, and a three-year truce could be negotiated, and the campaign was called off. Under the terms of this truce Hollandic merchants got access to coastal towns and villages in Oostergo and Westergo from Dokkum in the northeast all the way around to Lemmer in the southeast; the Vetkoper refugees were allowed to return home; and William VI was awarded a large sum of money.|$|E
25|$|The {{income from}} the office of the Ordinary was {{irregular}} in both forms and payment. He received a salary of £35 and two, three or four 'freedoms' to the city each year (which could be sold for about £25 each) from the City of London, earned from interests on various bequests and his house on Newgate Street was clear of the land tax. But <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> opportunities of profit beside his salary and usual gifts: several Ordinaries exploited their position to publish religious guides and individual recounts of lives of notorious malefactors. Evidence suggests that the {{income from the}} Accounts must have been substantial too: many criminals refused to confess their crimes {{on the grounds that the}} Ordinary would profit from them, and in one of the Ordinary's Accounts one Charles Brown alluded to how every number of the Accounts earned him £25, which the Ordinary didn't deny.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately for John V, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> European {{connections}} — {{his mother}} was Anna of Savoy, and her nephew (being John V's cousin) was concerned {{for the safety of}} his Greek counterpart. Sailing from Venice in June 1366 with dreams of initiating yet another Crusade, Amadeo VI of Savoy arrived at and seized the fortress of Gallipoli from the Ottomans and handed it back to the Byzantines, hoping that this would stem the tide of Turkish emigration into Thrace. However, the Turks had by now firmly established themselves in Thrace. Amadeo and John spent much time between 1367 and 1369 thinking of ways to stave off defeat. Amadeo returned to Europe via Rome and brought with him Byzantine envoys. The Pope again was uninterested, but called for John V to visit him. In 1369, when the Ottomans finally captured Adrianople (though some sources indicate 1365), John V rushed to Rome and confessed his Catholic faith both privately and at a public spectacle.|$|E

While he took his job seriously, he cultivated an informal rapport with players, who called him [...] "Ara" [...] rather than [...] "coach" [...] or [...] "Mr. Parseghian". Given his closeness in age {{to many of the}} players, he [...] "empathizes with us well", Northwestern tackle Andy Cvercko said in 1959. Parseghian occasionally joined in practices with the players and organized games of touch football. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>other</b> quirks, like lowering the intensity of practices as game day approached to let the players [...] "build up psychologically", something he learned from Paul Brown.|$|E
