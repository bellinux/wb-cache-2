5000|$|... 1987 also {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of the AppleShare product, a <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> server that ran on any Mac with 512 kB of RAM or more. A common AppleShare machine was the Mac Plus with an external SCSI hard drive. AppleShare was the #3 network operating system in the late 1980s, behind Novell NetWare and Microsoft's MS-Net. AppleShare was effectively the replacement for the failed Macintosh Office efforts, which had been based on a <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> server device.|$|E

50|$|Users can {{authenticate}} through Microsoft Active Directory or any LDAP or CAS server. Support {{for additional}} authentication mechanisms, including single sign-on, {{can be implemented}} using an open API. Ulteo includes a <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> server into which other file servers (such as CIFS/Samba/Windows file servers) can be integrated as backends.|$|E
50|$|BeeGFS on-demand {{allows the}} {{creation}} of BeeGFS {{on a set of}} nodes with one single command line. Possible use cases for the tool are manifold; a few include setting up a <b>dedicated</b> parallel <b>file</b> system for a cluster job, cloud computing or for fast and easy temporary setups for testing purposes.|$|R
50|$|Slyck.com is {{a website}} once <b>dedicated</b> to <b>file</b> sharing, {{updating}} {{the public on}} file sharing news, presenting reviews of file sharing software and opinion on file sharing, and interviewing the developers of file sharing software. At present, Slyck.com links to news articles on other websites, posted by members, and has a user forum.|$|R
50|$|In two {{interviews}} on The Real News Network, Michael Ratner, President Emeritus of the US-based Center for Constitutional Rights {{and president}} of the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, said that Shurat HaDin was a Zionist propaganda arm for Israel, <b>dedicated</b> to <b>filing</b> suits all over the place, without necessarily expecting to win them.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{computer}} labs with wireless network, two Super Micro servers, one QNAP server and one IBM server and two Dell servers. The labs have computers on a LAN {{running with}} a <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> server. The computer labs {{are equipped with}} Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbit/s) for multimedia and video network.|$|E
50|$|Network {{operating}} {{systems can be}} based on a client-server model (architecture) in which a server enables multiple clients to share resources.Client-server network {{operating systems}} allow networks to centralize functions and applications in one or more <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> servers. The server is the center of the system, allowing access to resources and instituting security. The network operating system provides the mechanism to integrate all the components on a network to allow multiple users to simultaneously share the same resources regardless of physical location.|$|E
50|$|Palm OS 1.0 {{does not}} {{differentiate}} between RAM and file system storage. Applications are installed directly into RAM and executed in place. As no <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> system is supported, {{the operating system}} depends on constant RAM refresh cycles to keep its memory. The OS supports 160x160 monochrome output displays. User input is generated through the Graffiti handwriting recognition system or optionally through a virtual keyboard. The system supports data synchronization to another PC via its HotSync technology over a serial interface. The latest bugfix release is version 1.0.7.|$|E
50|$|Sezam BBS {{was founded}} on November 11, 1989 as one of many one phone line / night only Bulletin Board Systems in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Contrary to many BBS systems <b>dedicated</b> to <b>file</b> download, Sezam focused on conferences. The {{original}} BBS software, specially developed by Sezams founders, Zoran Životić and Dejan Ristanović, enabled users to share their comments on various topics, such as: computers, education, sports, politics etc.|$|R
5000|$|Semi-synchronous {{replication}} - {{this usually}} {{means that a}} write is considered complete as soon as local storage acknowledges it and a remote server acknowledges that it has received the write either into memory or to a <b>dedicated</b> log <b>file.</b> The actual remote write is not performed immediately but is performed asynchronously, resulting in better performance than synchronous replication but offering no guarantee of durability.|$|R
50|$|The center also {{houses a}} separate, smaller IBM iDataPlex cluster named Erebus {{to support the}} {{operational}} forecasts of the NSF Office of Polar Programs’ Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS). Erebus has 84 nodes similar to Yellowstone’s, an FDR-10 InfiniBand interconnect, and a <b>dedicated</b> 58-terabyte <b>file</b> system. If needed, Yellowstone will run Erebus’ daily weather forecasts for the Antarctic continent {{to ensure that the}} worldwide community of users receives these forecasts without interruption.|$|R
50|$|Inspired by {{the success}} of file servers from Novell, IBM, and Sun, several firms {{developed}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> servers. While 3Com was among the first firms to build a dedicated NAS for desktop operating systems, Auspex Systems {{was one of the first}} to develop a dedicated NFS server for use in the UNIX market. A group of Auspex engineers split away in the early 1990s to create the integrated NetApp filer, which supported both the Windows CIFS and the UNIX NFS protocols, and had superior scalability and ease of deployment. This started the market for proprietary NAS devices now led by NetApp and EMC Celerra.|$|E
50|$|On system {{firmware}} versions 5.4.0, 5.5.0 and 5.5.1, an exploit {{is available}} {{that allows a}} specially-crafted MP4 video file to run code within the browser. Once again, this only allows user-land permissions, and does not allow access to any hardware that the browser doesn't use. Due {{to the nature of}} this exploit, a developer can only use up to 21.5kB of code in an MP4 file, otherwise the browser will crash trying to execute it. An ELF loading mechanism has been released, which allows the code to be stored in a <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> (which can be of a much larger size) and loaded separately.|$|E
50|$|Some FTP server {{implementations}} {{implement the}} SFTP protocol; however, outside of <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> servers, SFTP protocol support is usually provided by an SSH server implementation, as it shares the default port of 22 with other SSH services. SFTP implementations may include an SSH protocol implementation to leverage integration of SSH connection details with preexisting FTP server access controls, where an alternative SSH server is tolerable or where alternative ports may be used. An SSH2 server which supports subsystems may be leveraged {{to keep a}} uniform SSH implementation while enhancing access controls with third party software, {{at the cost of}} fine-grained integration with connection details, and SSH1 compatibility.|$|E
50|$|Aside from {{managing}} channel permissions, a bot {{can also}} perform {{functions such as}} logging what is posted to an IRC channel, giving out information on demand (very popular in IRC channels dealing with user support), creating statistics tracking the channel's top posters and longest-lived lurkers, or hosting trivia, Uno and other games. These functions are usually provided by scripts, often written in a scripting programming language such as Tcl or Perl by the bot's users. Channels <b>dedicated</b> to <b>file</b> sharing often use XDCC bots to distribute their files.|$|R
50|$|The cards {{themselves}} can be formatted with {{any type of}} file system such as Ext, JFS, NTFS, or {{by one of the}} <b>dedicated</b> flash <b>file</b> systems. It can be divided into partitions as long as the host device can read them. CompactFlash cards are often used instead of hard drives in embedded systems, dumb terminals and various small form-factor PCs that are built for low noise output or power consumption. CompactFlash cards are often more readily available and smaller than purpose-built solid-state drives and often have faster seek times than hard drives.|$|R
5000|$|Adobe Flash Player {{does not}} allow {{third-party}} local shared objects to be shared across domains. For example, a local shared object from [...] "www.example.com" [...] cannot be read by the domain [...] "www.example.net". However, the first party website can always pass data to a third party via some settings found in the <b>dedicated</b> XML <b>file</b> and passing the data in the request to the third party. Also, third party LSOs are allowed to store data by default. [...] By default LSO data is shared across browsers on the same machine. As an example: ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{sticking}} point with the ST's floppy drives was that, whilst double-sided drive equipped STs could happily read discs formatted under MS-DOS on IBM PCs, PCs could not themselves read Atari disks, because the initial versions of TOS could recognise, read, and write to but not themselves create discs {{in the same}} particular specification used and indeed demanded by MS-DOS because of different field usage on the FAT filesystem. Achieving successful data interchange between the two platforms using floppies thus required pre-formatting <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> transfer discs under MS-DOS, and copying the necessary data onto them from any unsuitable Atari formatted discs. This formatting issue was soon resolved {{by the emergence of}} third-party formatting and file copier software, MS-DOS disc imaging software capable of reading the unusual formats used by the ST and various other machines (such as the Commodore Amiga) and, a few years later, Atari's own version 1.4 (and later) TOS upgrades.|$|E
50|$|By January 1985 Apple {{was ready}} to launch the LocalTalk network which would allow a small office to inexpensively share its newly {{introduced}} LaserWriter printer. But the <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> server was {{up to two years}} away. The networked hard disk was closer, but still over a year away. By early 1985, Apple did not even offer a hard drive that worked on the Macintosh, much less a networked one. Unfortunately, Apple's newly announced network could do little else but print. As a stopgap measure, Apple had re-branded the Lisa 2/10 as the Macintosh XL and dropped the price substantially. With its built-in 10MB hard drive, greater RAM and Macintosh System emulation software MacWorks, the XL was positioned to act as the file server until Apple could develop the replacement. However, there was no file-sharing software {{to take advantage of the}} Macintosh XL. Nevertheless, based on the premise promised by the Macintosh Office, the Macintosh XL sold well at its reduced price, so well that Apple ran out of parts, forcing it to be discontinued long before the replacement network server was ready.|$|E
30|$|The data {{acquisition}} system (DAQ) at LCLS is the set of hardware and software responsible for correctly and coherently transporting data from the instruments’ imaging detectors and diagnostic devices to a <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> system. The DAQ is used to configure, calibrate, and control both custom and commercial devices. Each instrument has its own independent DAQ system of hardware and software, allowing all instruments to be run simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|BitTorrent {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{protocols}} for transferring large files, such as digital video files containing TV shows or video clips or digital audio files containing songs. Peer-to-peer networks have been estimated to collectively account for approximately 43% to 70% of all Internet traffic (depending on location) [...] In November 2004, BitTorrent was responsible for 25% of all Internet traffic. As of February 2013, BitTorrent was responsible for 3.35% of all worldwide bandwidth, more than half of the 6% of total bandwidth <b>dedicated</b> to <b>file</b> sharing.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} {{for reducing the}} power dissipation {{in the course of}} writebacks and committments in a datapath that uses a <b>dedicated</b> architectural register <b>file</b> (ARF) to hold committed values. Our mechanism capitalizes on the observation that most of the produced register values are short–lived, meaning that the destination registers targeted by these values are renamed by the time the results are written back. Our technique avoids unnecessary writebacks into the result repository (a slot within the Reorder Buffer or a physical register) as well as writes into the ARF by caching (and isolating) short–lived operands within a small <b>dedicated</b> register <b>file.</b> Operands are cached in this manner till they can be safely discarded without jeopardizing the recovery from possible branch mispredictions or reconstruction of the precise state in case of interrupts or exceptions. The power/energy savings are validated using SPICE measurements of actual layouts in a 0. 18 micron CMOS process. The energy reduction in the ROB and the ARF is in the range of 20 – 25 % and this is achieved with no increase in the cycle time, little additional complexity and no IPC drop. 1...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{trend in}} the design of storage subsystems is a move toward direct network attachment. Network-attached storage offers the opportunity to off-load distributed file system functionality from <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> server machines and execute many requests directly at the storage devices. For this strategy to lead to better performance as perceived by users, the response time of distributed operations must improve. In this paper, we analyze measurements of an Andrew File System (AFS) server that we recently upgraded in an effort to improve client performance in our laboratory. While the original server 2 ̆ 7 s overall utilization was only about 3...|$|E
40|$|The Coda File System is a {{descendant}} of the Andrew File System. Like AFS, Coda offers location-transparent accessto a shared Unix file namespace that is mapped on to a collection of <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> servers. But Coda represents a substantial improvement over AFS because it offers considerably higher availability {{in the face of}} server and networkfailures. The improvement in availability is achieved using the complementary techniques of server replication and disconnected operation. Disconnected operation proven especially valuable in supporting portable computers. Thisdocument is a reference manual for Coda users and system administrators.

40|$|Currently, most {{companies}} and institutions are relying on <b>dedicated</b> <b>file</b> servers {{in order to}} provide both shared and personal files to employees. Meanwhile, a lot of desktop machines have a lot of unused hard drive space, especially if most files are stored on these servers. This report tries to create a file system which can be deployed in an existing infra structure, and is completely managed and replicated on machines which normally would hold nothing more than an operating system and a few personal files. This report discusses distributed file systems, files, and directories, {{within the context of a}} UNIX-based local area network (LAN), and how file operations, such as opening, reading, writing, and locking can be performed on these distributed objects...|$|E
40|$|National audienceToday, {{flash memory}} are {{strongly}} {{used in the}} embedded system domain. NAND flash memories are the building block of main secondary storage systems. Such memories present many benefits in terms of data density, I/O performance, shock resistance and power consumption. Nevertheless, flash does not come without constraints: the write / erase granularity asymmetry and the limited lifetime bring the need for specific management. This can be done through the operating system using <b>dedicated</b> Flash <b>File</b> Systems (FFSs). In this document, we present general concepts about FFSs, and implementations example that are JFFS 2, YAFFS 2 and UBIFS, {{the most commonly used}} flash file systems. Then we give performance evaluation results for these FFSs...|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{the success}} of UoSAT-OSCAR-11's Digital Communications Experiment, AMSAT-OSCAR-16 was {{designed}} to be a <b>dedicated</b> store-and-forward <b>file</b> server in space. Using 1200 bit per second Mode JD radio links, AMSAT-OSCAR-16 interacts with ground station terminal software to appear as a packet radio bulletin board system to the user. Anyone wishing to download files, personal mail from anywhere in the world, or news bulletins could request the information be [...] "broadcast" [...] to all under the footprint of the spacecraft, or directed specifically to that ground station. This broadcast protocol differs from terrestrial packet radio communications, but allows a greater number of ground stations access to the spacecraft's resources during the limited time of a pass.|$|R
5000|$|OS4000 also {{provides}} a non-hierarchical temporary filesystem. This supports exactly {{the same types of}} file as permanent filesystems, except for CAT, REF, ODP, and symlinks. The file contents are stored in <b>dedicated</b> temporary <b>filing</b> disk regions, but the file metadata is stored in memory. Each logged in user has a private temporary filing name space which cannot be seen by any other logged in user (nor even another logged in user with the same username). A user's temporary files are deleted when the user logs out (and implicitly if the system is rebooted). Temporary filenames start with a percent [...] "" [...] or ampersand [...] "" [...] and are limited to 8 characters.|$|R
