Insertion of the gene in the <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> is performed by recombinant DNA technology. The gene is inserted to this host, it can be integrated into the host DNA causing permanent expression, or not integrated causing transient expression of this gene.

5000|$|At the {{transcript}} level, {{disruption of the}} EAR motif leads to {{a significant decrease in}} the expression of distally located eps genes (epsF-O) without affecting proximal genes (epsC-E). Consistent with this observation, several potential intrinsic terminator hairpins were found inside the epsF coding region. [...] A wild-type EAR element is capable of promoting transcriptional readthrough of these epsF terminator sites. In contrast, mutational disruption of EAR instead permits termination at the epsF terminators. The EAR element also promotes readthrough of heterologous termination sites. From these data it was hypothesized that the EAR element controls eps expression through a processive antitermination mechanism to ensure the complete synthesis of the 16 kilobase operon. [...] Processive antitermination, as opposed to {{the transcript}}ion attenuation mechanism typically used by other cis-acting regulatory RNAs, is a process wherein the transcription elongation complex is altered by accessory factors to become resistant to pausing and termination signals. So far, EAR is the only processive antitermination system specific for Gram-positive bacteria. Further experiments failed to reconstitute EAR-mediated processive antitermination mechanism in vitro or in a Gram-negative <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> (E. coli), suggesting that additional B. subtilis-specific factor(s) may also be required for EAR antitermination.|$|E

Because many of the natural hosts that produce polyketides are difficult to culture or manipulate, establishing a universal <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> that is genetically tractable has become an important goal toward the engineered biosynthesis of polyketides and analogues. Here, we summarize the recent progresses in engineering Escherichia coli as a <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> for reconstituting PKSs of different types.

40|$|Abstract Although many {{secondary}} metabolites {{with diverse}} biological activities have been isolated from myxobacteria, most strains of these biotechnologically important gliding prokaryotes remain difficult to handle genetically. In {{this study we}} describe the new fast growing myxobacterial thermophilic isolate GT- 2 as a <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> {{for the expression of}} natural product biosynthetic pathways isolated from other myxobacteria. According to the results of sequence analysis of the 16 S rDNA, this moderately thermophilic isolate is closely related to Corallococcus macrosporus and was therefore named C. macrosporus GT- 2. Fast growth of moderately thermophilic strains results in shorter fermentation and generation times, aspects which are of significant interest for molecular biological work as well as production of secondary metabolites. Development of a genetic manipulation system allowed the introduction of the complete myxochromide biosynthetic gene cluster, located on a transposable fragment, into the chromosome of GT- 2. Genetic engineering of the biosynthetic gene cluster by promoter exchange leads to much higher production of myxochromides in the <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> C. macrosporus GT- 2 in comparison to the original producer Stigmatella aurantiaca and to the previously described <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> Pseudomonas putida (600 mg/L versus 8 mg/L and 40 mg/L, respectively) ...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{polyketides}} {{possess an}} enormous range of chemical diversity and biological function. Many polyketides such as tetracycline, epothilone, and rapamycin {{have been developed}} into key clinical pharmaceuticals in {{a broad range of}} therapeutic areas. Sequencing of bacterial genomes has shown that there are many more polyketide biosynthetic pathways than there are polyketides isolated from standard cultivation techniques. These genetically encoded polyketide natural products from cultivatable and uncultivatable bacteria represent one of the greatest remaining untapped reservoirs of new natural product diversity. To access this untapped diversity of polyketide products, a general method for heterologous expression of these pathways is needed.

Identification of genomic loci for the biosynthesis of lasiodiplodin from Lasiodiplodia theobromae and resorcylide from Acremonium zeae revealed collaborating iterative polyketide synthase (iPKS) pairs whose efficient heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided a convenient access to the RAL 12 scaffolds desmethyl-lasiodiplo-din and trans-resorcylide, respectively. Lasiodiplodin production was reconstituted in the <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> by co-expressing an O-methyltransferase also encoded in the lasiodiplodin cluster, while a glutathione-S-transferase was found not to be necessary for heterologous production.

The S. avermitilis cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster, which is proposed to be under the control of an AHFCA-dependent signalling system, has not been investigated before and genome mining predictions suggest the biosynthetic gene cluster could be involved in the biosynthesis of novel azoxy compounds.

Intracellular S. enterica uses the SPI 2 -encoded T 3 SS to translocate a set of effector proteins into the host cell, which modify host cell functions, enabling intracellular survival and replication of the bacteria. We sought to determine whether specific functions of the SPI 2 -encoded T 3 SS can be transferred to <b>heterologous</b> <b>hosts</b> Salmonella bongori and Escherichia coli Mutaflor, species that lack the SPI 2 locus and loci encoding effector proteins. The SPI 2 virulence locus was cloned and functionally expressed in S. bongori and E. coli.

An SPI 2 -mediated cellular phenotype was induced by S. bongori harboring the SPI 2 if the sifA locus was cotransferred. An interference with the host cell microtubule cytoskeleton, a novel SPI 2 -dependent phenotype, was observed in epithelial cells infected with S. bongori harboring SPI 2 without additional effector genes. S. bongori harboring SPI 2 showed increased intracellular persistence in a cell culture model, but SPI 2 transfer was not sufficient to confer to S. bongori systemic pathogenicity in a murine model.

The 29. 5  kb gene cluster, which was predicted to encode an unusual biaryl metabolite, which we named venemycin, and potentially halogenated derivatives, contains 16 genes including one—vemR—that encodes a transcriptional activator of the large ATP-binding LuxR-like (LAL) family. Constitutive expression of vemR in the ΔbldM mutant led to the production of sufficient venemycin for structural characterisation, confirming its unusual biaryl structure. Co-expression of the venemycin biosynthetic gene cluster and vemR in the <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> Streptomyces coelicolor also resulted in venemycin production.

Furthermore, expression of the sensor gene fixL and of the activator gene fixJ under the control of two different promoters allowed us to show that FixL mediates microaerobic induction of nifA when the level of FixJ is low and aerobic repression of nifA when the level of FixJ is high. Similarly, activation of fixK occurred in microaerobiosis when the FixJ level was low in the presence of FixL. In contrast to nifA, fixK expression was not affected by FixL in aerated cultures when the level of FixJ was high. We conclude that R. meliloti FixL senses oxygen in the <b>heterologous</b> <b>host</b> E. coli consistent with the microaerobic induction of nifA and fixK in R. meliloti and that nifA and fixK promoters are differentially activated by FixJ in response to the oxygen signal...|$|E

The VR-ACS 1 promoter exhibits a very unusual behavior when studied in plants different from its original host, mung bean. GUS and luciferase in situ assays of transgenic plants containing VR-ACS 1 promoter fusions show strong constitutive reporter gene expression throughout tobacco and Arabidopsis development. In vitro quantitative analyses show that transgenic plants harboring VR-ACS 1 promoter-reporter constructs have on average 4 - 6 fold higher protein and activity levels of both reporter genes than plants transformed with comparable CaMV 35 S promoter fusions. Similar transcript levels are present in VR-ACS 1 and CaMV 35 S promoter lines, suggesting that {{the high levels of}} gene product observed for the VR-ACS 1 promoter are the combined result of transcriptional and translational activation. All tested deletion constructs retaining the core promoter region can drive strong constitutive promoter activity in transgenic plants.

Here we provide experimental data supporting FdmR 1 as a SARP-type activator. Inactivation of fdmR 1 abolished FDM biosynthesis, and FDM production could be restored to the fdmR 1 ::aac(3) IV mutant by expressing fdmR 1 in trans. Reverse transcription-PCR transcriptional analyses revealed that up to 26 of the 28 genes within the fdm gene cluster, with the exception of fdmR and fdmT 2, were under the positive control of FdmR 1, directly or indirectly. Overexpression of fdmR 1 in S. griseus improved the FDM titer 5. 6 -fold (to about 1. 36 g/liter) relative to that of wild-type S. griseus. Cloning of the complete fdm cluster into an integrative plasmid and subsequent expression in <b>heterologous</b> <b>hosts</b> revealed that considerable amounts of FDMs could be produced in Streptomyces albus but not in Streptomyces lividans. However, the S. lividans host could be engineered to produce FDMs via constitutive expression of fdmR 1; FDM production in S. lividans could be enhanced further by overexpressing fdmC, encoding a putative ketoreductase, concomitantly with fdmR 1. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the viability of engineering FDM biosynthesis and improving FDM titers in both the native producer S. griseus and <b>heterologous</b> <b>hosts,</b> such as S. albus and S. lividans.
