25|$|Due to the {{expanding}} human population, competition for water is growing such {{that many of}} the world's major aquifers are becoming depleted. This is due both for <b>direct</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> as well as agricultural irrigation by groundwater. Millions of pumps of all sizes are currently extracting groundwater throughout the world. Irrigation in dry areas such as northern China, Nepal and India is supplied by groundwater, and is being extracted at an unsustainable rate.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another problem}} is {{bringing}} the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled out of the water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids. Experiments {{have been carried out}} to pump krill, while still in water, through a large tube on board. Special krill nets also are currently under development. The processing of the krill must be very rapid since the catch deteriorates within several hours. Its high protein and vitamin content makes krill quite suitable for both <b>direct</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> and the animal-feed industry.|$|E
25|$|EU {{legislation}} currently {{states that}} there are total allowable catches for each species, which are sub-divided between European Union member states, the intention {{of which is to}} conserve fish stocks. The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for quota allocation to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that any fish which is caught outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board any fish for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common Fisheries Policy and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 the law will be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land bycatches, it is the obligation to do so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or minimum sizes, have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for <b>direct</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is based on regulation formats in Norway and Iceland.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{efficiency}} in livestock production {{and reducing the}} share of animal products in <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> are two strategies to curb the adverse environmental impacts of the livestock sector. Here,we explore the roomfor sustainable livestock production by modelling the impacts and constraints of a third strategy in which livestock feed components that compete with <b>direct</b> <b>human</b> food crop production are reduced. Thus, in the outmost scenario, animals are fed only from grassland and by-products from food production. We show that this strategy could provide sufficient food (equal amounts of human-digestible energy and a similar protein/calorie ratio as in the reference scenario for 2050) and reduce environmental impacts comparedwith the reference scenario (in the most extreme case of zero human-edible concentrate feed: greenhouse gas emissions 218 %; arable land occupation 226 %, N-surplus 246 %; P-surplus 240 %; non-renewable energy use 236 %, pesticide use intensity 222 %, freshwater use 221 %, soil erosion potential 212 %). These results occur {{despite the fact that}} environmental efficiency of livestock production is reduced compared with the reference scenario, which is the consequence of the grassland-based feed for ruminants and the less optimal feeding rations based on by-products for non-ruminants. This apparent contradiction results from considerable reductions of animal products in human diets (protein intake per capita from livestock products reduced by 71 %). We show that such a strategy focusing on feed components which do not compete with <b>direct</b> <b>human</b> food <b>consumption</b> offers a viable complement to strategies focusing on increased {{efficiency in}} production or reduced shares of animal products in consumption...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} oldest genetically {{identified}} {{dog in the}} Americas, directly dated to 9, 260 ± 170 Cal. B. P. The DNA was extracted from an occipital condyle imbedded in a human paleofecal sample from Hinds Cave in southwest Texas. A 368 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial genome control region was sequenced. These data were analyzed with comparable data, which included other ancient dogs and extant dogs, wolves and coyotes from around the world. Compiled with published data, our results characterize ancient American dogs within clades rooted by Eurasian wolves. In the Americas, these data provide no evidence of local interbreeding with wolves. This is {{a departure from the}} genetic pattern {{in other areas of the}} world where interbreeding with local wolf populations is apparent. Our discovery of domestic dog bone in a human paleofecal sample provides the earliest <b>direct</b> evidence for <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> of dogs in the New World.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{aflatoxins}} M 1 detoxification of bovine milk by adsorption processes. Several types of natural and industrial sorbents have been analyzed by considering their effects {{on the quality of}} the treated milk and their removal efficiencies. Treated milk characterization tests in terms of organic acids, lactose, chlorides, pH and protein contents show a moderate alteration of the milk properties proportionally with the sorbent dosage. On the other hand, experimental evidences reveal that the highest removal efficiencies (η > 90 % for AFMs = 0. 5 μg/kg) have been obtained for the activated carbons due to the concurrent effects of high surface area, sufficiently wide micropore size and higher affinity between the AFM molecules and the aromatic structure of the carbons. Also the bentonite shows significant removal efficiency, combined with lower side effects on the treated milk. Therefore, this preliminary analysis shows that an optimization of sorbent dosage should be considered to account for both a reliable detoxification of the milk and for assuring the acceptability of the treated milk in light of its <b>direct</b> reuse for <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> or as raw material for dairy products...|$|R

40|$|Human infections with EHEC such as O 157 :H 7 {{have been}} a great concern for {{worldwide}} food-industry surveillance. This pathogen is commonly associated with bloody diarrhea that can evolve to the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. Animals are the natural reservoir where this pathogen remains asymptomatically, in steps of ingestion and colonization of the bowel. The bacterium is shed in the feces, contaminating the surroundings, including water and food that are <b>directed</b> for <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> A major player in this colonization process is intimin, an outer membrane adhesion molecule encoded by the E. coli attachment and effacement (eae) gene that {{has been shown to be}} essential for intimate bacterial attachment to eukaryotic host cells. In an attempt to reduce the colonization of animal reservoirs with EHEC O 157 :H 7, we designed a vaccine model to induce an immune response against intimin gamma. The model is based on its recombinant expression in attenuated Salmonella, used as a suitable vaccine vector because of its recognized ability to deliver recombinant antigens and to elicit all forms of immunity: mucosal, systemic, and humoral responses. To test this model, mice were orally immunized with a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain carrying the pYA 3137 eaeA vector, and challenged with E. coli O 157 :H 7. Here we show that immunization induced the production of high levels of specific IgG and IgA antibodies and promoted reduction in the fecal shedding of EHEC after challenge. The live recombinant vaccine reported herein may contribute to the efforts of reducing animal intestinal mucosa colonization.
