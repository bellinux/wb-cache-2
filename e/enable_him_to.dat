5|$|England {{announced}} their final 15-man squad at The Oval on 14 February 2007. Jon Lewis {{was replaced by}} Stuart Broad on 4 April 2007 to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> attend to a personal situation (return home to his wife as she was experiencing complications in the latter stages of her pregnancy).|$|E
5|$|MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer {{assigned}} the script to Donald Ogden Stewart—one {{of his favorite}} screenwriters. Mayer's choice seemed unusual, because {{up to that time}} Stewart had written only light romantic comedies featuring wealthy East Coast socialites, but Mayer felt Stewart's strongly leftist political leanings would <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> chalk out a better screenplay.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} at Romani, Murray moved his {{headquarters}} back from Ismailia on the canal to Cairo. This move to Cairo was to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be {{in a more}} central position {{to carry out his}} duties and responsibilities which extended from the Western Frontier Force, waging a continuing campaign against the Senussi in Egypt's Western Desert, to the Eastern Force in the Sinai. Another consequence of the victory was that Major General H. A. Lawrence, who had been in command of the Northern Sector of the Suez Canal defences and Romani during the battle, was transferred to the Western Front.|$|E

5000|$|His long {{political}} career, {{military service}} and Masonic and other associations <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> build many successful business interests. His resulting wealth <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> build a [...] "family mansion" [...] in Peekskill.|$|R
50|$|After being {{sucked into}} a mysterious black hole, Gravity gained {{the ability to}} {{manipulate}} gravitons in various ways. He can decrease his own gravity, <b>enabling</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly, decrease the gravity of objects around <b>him,</b> <b>enabling</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> simulate super-strength, and attract or repel objects.|$|R
5|$|Collecting {{butterflies}} {{was once}} a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, {{at a rate of}} four per year, to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force {{to be able to}} traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|In case {{a doctor}} was needed, Major Charles H. Morhouse was summoned from Bataan to {{accompany}} the party. The remaining thirteen were members of MacArthur's staff. They were loyal and experienced, {{and some of them}} had been with MacArthur for years. Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> commence work soon after arrival in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers. Promoted from private that day, Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to post.|$|E

50|$|His {{capability}} as tenor <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> record twelve albums {{of romantic}} songs, {{as well as}} three albums of poetry and fourteen books to tape. His vocal ability and acting skill <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make a number of appearances when time allowed on the BBC's Edwardian era music hall programme, The Good Old Days.|$|R
50|$|Pappaiah {{is known}} for his ‘down to earth' {{speaking}} style. His command of Tamil <b>enables</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get complex literary issues across to the common man. This has <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take social themes to the masses and bring about a social awakening in the evolution of patti mandrams in Tamil Nadu and beyond.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} year he became Home Secretary in India {{in the administration of}} Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, and in 1909 was temporarily a member of the governing council. His experience of administrative matters, including with regard to policing, proved to be useful to Curzon during the government's 1905 partition of Bengal along communal lines. So useful was his knowledge and ability that his term in India was extended for two years beyond the usual retirement age. This was to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> provide the summarisation, negotiation and drafting skills necessary to ensure success in administrative reform of the Provincial Councils by Curzon's successor as Viceroy, Lord Minto.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the series, the {{pioneering}} scientist Professor Humbert invented the Minimiser, a device capable of shrinking people or objects to one third of their original size. After Humbert's death, it was passed down to Father Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a copy of Milner's Gallery of Nature. The regular focus of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6m) to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> infiltrate situations to which no ordinary-sized person could make a discreet entry. In this manner, the Harding puppet interacts with life-sized sets and live actors whose faces are excluded from shots. The Minimiser is also used to shrink enemy agents, literally bringing them down to Harding's size.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes's {{pursuit of}} the {{exclusive}} mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the British Empire {{as part of his}} personal ambition for a Cape to Cairo Railway—winning the concession would <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> gain a royal charter from the British government for a chartered company, empowered to annex and thereafter govern the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed on Britain's behalf. He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and Matabele peoples and then sent Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital Bulawayo against Edward Arthur Maund, a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of izinDuna (tribal leaders).|$|E

50|$|In 1954 a British Council {{scholarship}} <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> study under Petrassi in Rome. He {{also worked}} in Italy as the musical director {{of an independent}} ballet company. In 1957 a further British Council scholarship <b>enabled</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> study with Carl Orff in Munich. In 1958 he returned to New Zealand, staying there until 1960 teaching and composing.|$|R

5|$|Torres faced his old rivals Real Madrid on 10 March 2009 in the Champions League last 16 {{and due to}} {{an ankle}} injury, he had a painkilling {{injection}} before the game to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play. He scored the first goal of the game, which ended as a 4–0 victory, meaning Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals 5–0 on aggregate. Four days later, he lined up against Manchester United at Old Trafford and he scored the equaliser {{in a game that}} finished as a 4–1 victory. He was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the second season running in April 2009. Torres scored his 50th goal for Liverpool on 24 May 2009 against Tottenham {{on the final day of}} the 2008–09 season, his 84th appearance.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's family {{assumed that}} he would follow his father in {{becoming}} a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of Merchant Navy officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in Croydon while he attended the Whitgift School. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, Leon Quartermaine, who later won recognition {{on the stage and}} in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce Sent to the Tower. Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a part-time worker at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity founded by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett which attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> attend Oxford University and study for holy orders. In the face of his father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.|$|E
5|$|Following {{improvements}} to the River Arun in 1615, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham, they could also navigate part of the Rother, as far upstream as Fittleworth. The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783, and was recalled in 1790, when he surveyed it below Midhurst. In the same year, {{the construction of the}} Arun Navigation was finished, and in 1791, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, who was based at Petworth House, obtained an Act of Parliament which would <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> improve the Rother. The Act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth. Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river, the precise route of the navigation was not specified, and he was free to improve the channel or make cuts as he saw fit. The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds. Compared to most other canals at the time, the charges for using the navigation were low, as the Earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{realised}} {{that the}} direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed. Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but {{he was forced to}} burn them since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet. Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates. By now satisfied that Montagu was safely to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly work its way north to find the French track again. The detour did however <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{offers to}} manage Georgia Brooks' (Saskia Hampele) singing career and gets her to sign over {{the rights to}} her song. Paul then gives the song to Amali Ward, but she decides against {{recording}} it. Paul attempts to sue Georgia, but drops the case when he learns Jack has died. He then asks for his fraud conviction {{to be removed from}} his criminal record, so he can run for mayor. Karl unsuccessfully runs against him. Paul seeks to separate the hotel from the Lassiter's chain to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sack Terese. However, Terese quits her job and Paul threatens to sue her. Lucy persuades Paul to re-hire Terese and he keeps the hotel within the Lassiter's chain. Paul learns Rebecca works for a civic project called Twin Cities and forges Karl's signature on a cover letter to get Rebecca to return. Paul tells Rebecca that he became mayor for her because he still loves her. Paul asks Rebecca to move back to Erinsborough, but she refuses. Paul disapproves when Kate gets back together with Mark Brennan. They reconcile just before she is fatally shot. Paul blames Mark for Kate's death.|$|E

5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power of his voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. Many people had their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E
5|$|Sibelius's {{national}} stature was recognised in 1897 when he {{was awarded}} a state pension to <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> spend more time composing. In 1904 he and Aino settled in Ainola, a country residence he built {{on the shores of}} Lake Tuusula in Järvenpää, where they lived for the remainder of their lives. Although life at Ainola was not always calm and carefree—Sibelius was often in debt and prone to bouts of heavy drinking—he managed over the following 20 years to produce a large output of orchestral works, chamber music, piano pieces and songs, as well as lighter music. His popularity spread across Europe to the United States where, during a triumphant tour in 1914, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Yale University. At home his status was such that his 50th birthday celebrations in 1915 were a national event, the centrepiece of which was the Helsinki premiere of his Fifth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{produced}} a 'Panoptic Stereoscope' in 1855, which was financially successful. Stereoscopes had sold for five shillings each– Stanley discovered a simpler method to make them, which <b>enable</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sell them for one shilling. He {{was able to}} take an additional shops at 3–4 Great Turnstile and 286 High Holborn, as well as a skilled assistant. He did not patent the Panoptic, so it was soon copied around the world, but he had sold enough to provide the capital required to manufacture scientific instruments. In 1861 he invented a straight line dividing machine for which he won first prize in the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Stanley brought out the first catalogue of his products in 1864. By the fifth edition, Stanley was able to list important customers such as several government departments, the Army, the Royal Navy, railways at home and abroad, and London University. From 1865, he worked on improving the elegance and stability of surveying instruments, especially the theodolite, whose construction he simplified. It had a rotating telescope for measuring horizontal and vertical angles and able to take sights on prominent objects at a distance. The component parts were reduced to fewer than half of the 226 used in the previous version, making it lighter, cheaper and more accurate.|$|E
