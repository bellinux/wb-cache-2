Dobbs opened the interview with [...] "You have accomplished so much", and later said to Trump that he was “one of the most loved and respected” presidents “in history.” The New York Times described the interview as a love-fest and [...] "courtier-like session", as Dobbs [...] "didn’t so much ask questions as open his mouth and let rose petals fall out".|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the generative mechanisms and underlying contingencies of innovative search. Extending behavioral arguments to the public sector context, it proposes that changes in innovative activity reflect either of two organizational search processes. The first process, commonly known as problemistic search, is triggered by negative performance feedback and initiated to identify appropriate solutions for the performance problem at hand. The second process is known as slack search. It {{is driven by the}} availability of excess resources, which decision makers seek to employ most fruitfully. In addition to these fundamental driving forces of innovative search, the proposed behavioral model attributes important moderating roles to organizational slack and regulatory endorsement. In particular, it suggests that public service organizations with high levels of available slack are most likely to engage in problemistic search following perceived performance shortfalls. Similarly, it is assumed that problemistic search is most salient among organizations with <b>full</b> regulatory <b>endorsement.</b> Conversely, when endorsement is low, slack search gains in importance. These behavioral propositions are tested based on novel panel data from the entire population of public nonspecialis...|$|R

50|$|For years, the FRA {{has been}} recommending the {{standardization}} of operating {{rules and practices}} for cost-effectiveness in both safety and efficiency. In 1992, the American Association of Railroad Superintendents (AARS) convened a special committee, which suggested to its Board of Directors, Executive Council, and membership that “the AARS sponsor a full conference on the standardization of railroad operating rules, practices, and procedures, and that this conference be conducted on the highest level possible, with the <b>full</b> and complete <b>endorsement</b> and involvement of chief operating officers.” A standard set of operating rules, it was argued, would minimize the confusion that exists when employees operate over joint lines and are governed by two rule books instead of one. Of particular concern are situations where different operating rules govern identical, or similar, signal aspects on different railroads.|$|R

50|$|Karnabatt had a {{controversial}} career, particularly so during World War I.

5000|$|Between 1907 and {{the entry}} into the world war, the PNL governments had been under {{pressure}} to generate a feasible land reform project. Even more reluctant, the opposition Conservatives became split into factions: the traditional wing, led by Alexandru Marghiloman, was [...] "Germanophile", and reserved about the [...] "Greater Romania" [...] project; the Conservative-Democratic Party, under Take Ionescu, {{had a history of}} cooperation with the PNL, and gave <b>full</b> <b>endorsement</b> to the Entente.

50|$|Keiko Fujimori was {{a highly}} {{polarizing}} figure during the election.

She was viewed unfavorably by a number of people who oppose Fujimori for human rights abuses and corrupt practices, and who feared that her victory would mark a return of Fujimorismo. Mendoza, who placed third and could not stand in the runoff election, gave her <b>full</b> <b>endorsement</b> to Kuczynski, in order to prevent Fujimori's victory.|$|E

5000|$|After the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes, {{there was}} still strong {{opposition}} to William among the Norman nobles, but {{they were forced to}} declare a [...] "Truce of God" [...] at Caen in October 1047. This truce, backed by the <b>full</b> <b>endorsement</b> of the Church, stated that private wars or vendettas were prohibited from Wednesday evening to Monday morning. The truce gave William special rights to defend his title and the public order; he did not, along with King Henry I, have to abide by the order. Even though William's position was still weak, with Gui of Burgundy still holding out and William having to pardon many of the barons who had opposed him, it would be five years before he had to face another major revolt.|$|E

The combination of the unpopularity of Johnson, the Chicago demonstrations, and the discouragement of liberals and African-Americans when both Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated during the election year, were all contributing factors that caused him to eventually lose the election to former Vice President Nixon.|$|E
5000|$|The report {{met with}} both <b>full</b> <b>endorsement</b> and rejection. Hanan Ashrawi, {{a member of}} the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said: [...] "This is incredible.

The UN Human Rights Council's call for sanctions against Israel is crucial because it clearly expresses the idea that the settlement enterprise leads to [...] "ethnic cleansing" [...] in the West Bank." [...] Israeli newspaper Haaretz ran an Opinion Editorial by Saeb Erekat, the Chief Negotiator of the Palestinian Authority, in which he urged that [...] "The UN report on Israeli settlements should be read by every single Israeli citizen. It is an opportunity for the international community to hold Israel accountable and end a culture of impunity that has all but destroyed the possibility of a two-state solution." ...|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{its long}} {{exposure}} to the West and rich heritage of messianic unrest, the lower Congo region, homeland of the Kongo people, was the first area to emerge as a focal point of militantly anti-Belgian sentiment and activity. ABAKO and Kasa-Vubu spearheaded ethnic nationalism there and in 1956 issued a manifesto calling for immediate independence. The move came about {{as a response to}} a far more conciliatory statement by a group of non-Kongo intellectuals identified with the editorial committee of a Léopoldville newspaper, Conscience Africaine. In it they gave their <b>full</b> <b>endorsement</b> to the ideas set forth by Professor A.A.J. Van Bilsen in his newly published Thirty-Year Plan for the Political Emancipation of Belgian Africa. Far more impatient in tone and radical in its objectives, the ABAKO manifesto stated: [...] "Rather than postponing emancipation for another thirty years, we should be granted self-government today." ...|$|E
50|$|Later, the Brody {{family is}} {{en route to}} a {{political}} fundraiser hosted by Rex Henning (John Finn), a wealthy potential contributor to Vice President Walden's (Jamey Sheridan) campaign. On the way, Jessica (Morena Baccarin) informs Brody of Mike's (Diego Klattenhoff) suspicion that he really killed Tom Walker. Brody reluctantly admits to being complicit in the killing, framing it as a CIA mission that went awry. After arriving, Brody complains to Carrie about Mike's continued interference. During the fundraiser, Rex and Brody talk privately, where Rex - who has noticed the untoward interest several guests have about Brody's time in captivity - discloses that he served in Vietnam, and compliments Brody on not 'breaking' while in captivity. Rex later announces his <b>full</b> <b>endorsement</b> of a Walden/Brody presidential ticket. Previously, however, Rex admitted to Brody that he dislikes the self-absorbed Walden, and is really interested in when Brody succeeds Walden as president. Brody protests that he is not the man Rex thinks he is.|$|E
5000|$|The {{response}} {{to the civil rights}} movement in effect split the PCUS into three factions: a liberal group desiring <b>full</b> <b>endorsement</b> of the movement's platform, a moderate faction desiring church-wide consensus before taking positive action, and a conservative/traditionalist group vigorously opposing what it believed was the meddling of the church in the civil and cultural traditions of its native region. Conservatives argued that church activity on behalf of racial desegregation and voting rights constituted a violation of the doctrine of [...] "the spirituality of the church," [...] a principle developed by 19th century Presbyterian theologian James Henley Thornwell, that declared that social reform and political participation were duties or pursuits to be taken up by individuals, not church courts. In particular, the conservative group defended that teaching aggressively, a doctrine that liberal critics deemed a justification for maintaining racial segregation and preserving the social standing of historic upper-class elites within Southern society, a fair percentage of which were PCUS members.|$|E
5000|$|There were a {{great many}} successes {{attributed}} to the Kenton's West Side Story none of which is more interesting then the visit by Mirisch representatives to the Capitol Tower in Hollywood, California. [...] With the movie nearly complete Lee Gillette had invited the Mirisch people {{to hear what the}} Kenton/Richards collaboration had produced (listen to the mix and mastering). The movie producers were very impressed, [...] "We had no idea! If we only knew!". [...] The implication being the Capitol produced West Side Story could or would {{have been part of the}} soundtrack. In the end, <b>full</b> <b>endorsement</b> was given by Mirisch to allow a still photo from the movie to be used as the cover of Kenton's West Side Story. As it happened both the Kenton LP and Columbia Records produced sound track co-existed beautifully on the commercial market with both winning Grammys in 1962 for Best sound track LP and Best large ensemble jazz LP.|$|E
