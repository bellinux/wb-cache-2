Despite considerable damage, she was repaired and placed back in service. In late 1921, Siboney was switched to New York–Cuba–Mexico routes, which were a popular and inexpensive way <b>for</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> escape Prohibition. In late 1940, she was chartered to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing Europe {{at the outset of}} World War II, making seven roundtrips from Jersey City, New Jersey, to Lisbon.|$|E

The Marine Corps has realized that the fastest growing group in both the United States and the Marines are Hispanics, and have joined {{the rest of the}} United States in the celebration of the contributions which Hispanics in the United States Marines Corps have made to that military institution by celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month from September 15 through October 15.|$|E

However, on October 23, the effective legal deadline for applying for health insurance via HealthCare.gov without getting a penalty via the individual mandate was extended to March 31, 2014, possibly because of the problems with HealthCare.gov and some of the state healthcare exchanges (but without a de jure explanation as such given).|$|E

25|$|After World War II, {{an appeal}} in the Freie Arbeiter Stimme {{detailing}} {{the plight of}} German anarchists and called <b>for</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. In 1947, Rocker published Zur Betrachtung der Lage in Deutschland (Regarding the Portrayal of the Situation in Germany) about the impossibility of another anarchist movement in Germany. It became the first post-World War II anarchist writing to be distributed in Germany. Rocker thought young Germans were all either totally cynical or inclined to fascism and awaited a new generation to grow up before anarchism could bloom {{once again in the}} country. Nevertheless, the Federation of Libertarian Socialists (FFS) was founded in 1947 by former FAUD members. Rocker wrote for its organ, Die Freie Gesellschaft, which survived until 1953. In 1949, Rocker published another well-known work. In Pioneers of American Freedom, a series of essays, he details the history of liberal and anarchist thought in the United States, seeking to debunk the idea that radical thought was foreign to American history and culture and had merely been imported by immigrants. On his eightieth birthday in 1953, a dinner was held in London to honor Rocker. Messages of gratitude were read by the likes of Thomas Mann, Albert Einstein, Herbert Read, and Bertrand Russell.|$|E
500|$|Les Roberts {{gave the}} book a {{favourable}} review for The Plain Dealer and wrote, [...] "Much of Innes' narration is East London slang, generously laced with profanities and hard <b>for</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> grasp.

[...] Writing for Electric City, James Crane suggested readers read The Maltese Falcon before beginning Banks' book, {{and said the}} story is a step-down from Guy Noir and Sin City. Crane wrote, [...] "I enjoy the hard-boiled style... It certainly isn't a new formula, though Ray Banks does follow it well." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the tour}} began, it {{was marred by}} protests and disturbances. Telephone threats were received, and concerts were picketed by the Ku Klux Klan. Daily Express writer Robert Pitman, {{responding}} to the US outcry, wrote, [...] "It seems a nerve <b>for</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> hold up shocked hands, when week in, week out, America is exporting to us a subculture that makes the Beatles seem like four stern old churchwardens."

500|$|Art Spiegelman's {{parents were}} Polish Jews [...] (1906–1982) and [...] (1912–1968) Spiegelman. [...] His father was born Zeev Spiegelman, with the Hebrew name Zeev ben Avraham. Władysław was his Polish name, and Władek (or Vladek in Russified form) was a {{diminutive}} of this name. He was {{also known as}} Wilhelm under the German occupation, and upon immigration to the United States he took the name William. His mother was born Andzia Zylberberg, with the Hebrew name Hannah. She took the name Anna upon her immigration to the US. In Spiegelman's Maus, from which the couple are best known, Spiegelman used the spellings [...] "Vladek" [...] and [...] "Anja", which he believed would be easier <b>for</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> pronounce.

500|$|The {{economy was}} a great concern during the Ford administration. One of the first acts the new {{president}} took {{to deal with the}} economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board. In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to [...] "Whip Inflation Now". As part of this program, he urged people to wear [...] "WIN" [...] buttons. At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment. To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending. To try to mesh service and sacrifice, [...] "WIN" [...] called <b>for</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> reduce their spending and consumption. On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the [...] "WIN" [...] campaign. Over the next nine days 101,240 Americans mailed in [...] "WIN" [...] pledges. In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems. The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals. This plan would also take $4.4billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300billion. At the time, inflation was over twelve percent.|$|E

His rules simplified the game to make it easier <b>for</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|Scranton is {{the only}} city in the Eastern United States with the vestiges of the era of {{industrialization}} (1840-1920) in plain sight, 40 acres {{in the middle of}} downtown, with car shops, locomotive shops, roundhouse, turntable, grand passenger station, a working yard, iron furnaces, passenger excursions — the whole works and a restored coal mine nearby.
