Contact temperature measurement is impossible because of the chemically aggressive and abrasive nature of the hot clinker, and optical methods such as infrared pyrometry are difficult because of the dust and fume-laden atmosphere in the burning zone. The traditional method of assessment was to view the bed of clinker and deduce the amount of liquid formation by experience. As more liquid forms, the clinker becomes stickier, and the bed of material climbs higher up the rising side of the kiln. It is usually also possible to assess {{the length of the}} zone of liquid formation, beyond which powdery [...] "fresh" [...] feed can be seen. Cameras, with or without infrared measurement capability, are mounted on the kiln hood to facilitate this.
