40|$|Abstract: Compared with batch systems, <b>flowthrough</b> and countercurrent {{reactors}} {{have important}} potential advan-tages for pretreating cellulosic biomass, including higher hemicellulose sugar yields, enhanced cellulose digestibility, and reduced chemical additions. Unfortunately, they suffer from high {{water and energy}} use. To better understand these trade-offs, comparative data are reported on xylan and lignin removal and enzymatic digestibility of cellu-lose for corn stover pretreated in batch and <b>flowthrough</b> reactors over a range of flow rates between 160 j and 220 jC, with water only and also with 0. 1 wt % sulfuric acid. Increasing flow with just water enhanced the xylan dissolution rate, more than doubled total lignin removal, and increased cellulose digestibility. Furthermore, adding dilute sulfuric acid increased the rate of xylan removal for both batch and <b>flowthrough</b> systems. Interestingly, adding acid also increased the lignin removal rate with flow, but less lignin was left in solution when acid was added in batch. Although the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated cellulose was related to xylan removal, as others have shown, the digestibility was much better for <b>flowthrough</b> comparedwith batch systems, for {{the same degree of}} xylan removal. Cellulose digestibility for <b>flowthrough</b> reactors was related to lignin removal as well. These results suggest that altering lignin also affects the enzymatic digestibility of corn stover.

Mass transfer or other physical effects could influence the hydroly-sis rate, and two models reported in the literature for other applications were adapted to investigate whether incorporation of mass transfer into the kinetics could explain xylan removal in both batch and continuous <b>flowthrough</b> reactors on a more consistent basis.

40|$|<b>Flowthrough</b> {{pretreatment}} {{with hot}} water only offers many promising features for advanced pretreatment of biomass, and a better understand-ing of the mechanisms responsible for <b>flowthrough</b> behavior could allow researchers to capitalize on key attributes while overcoming limitations. In this study, the effect of fluid velocity {{on the fate of}} total mass, hemicellulose, and lignin was evaluated for hot water only pretreatment of corn stover in tubular <b>flowthrough</b> reactors. Increasing fluid velocity significantly accel-erated solubilization of total mass, hemicellulose, and lignin at early times. For example, when fluid velocity was increased from 2. 8 to 10. 7 cm/min, xylan removal increased from 60 to 82 % for hot water only pretreatment of corn stover at 200 °C after 8 min. At the same time, lignin removal increased from 30 to 46 %. Dissolved hemicellulose was almost all in oligomeric form, and solubilization of hemicellulose was always accompanied by lignin release. The increase in removal of xylan and lignin with velocity, especially in the early reaction stage, suggests that chemical reaction is not the only factor controlling hemicellulose hydrolysis and that mass transfer and other physical effects may also {{play an important role in}} hemicellulose and lignin degradation and removal.

40|$|Cellulosic ethanol as a {{transportation}} fuel can cut {{greenhouse gas emissions}} for a sustainable earth and lower dependence on fossil fuels. However, successful penetration into an oil dominated market can only come through cost-competitiveness with gasoline, but biological conversion of cellulosic biomass to fuels is currently stymied by the need for high enzyme doses to realize commercially relevant yields for the widely pursued biological route of pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to produce fermentable sugars. Achieving high sugar yields at low enzyme loadings can benefit from {{a better understanding of}} factors that contribute to biomass recalcitrance to deconstruction. When poplar varieties with lower lignin content due to a rare natural mutation associated with lignin biosynthesis were subjected to a high throughput pretreatment and co-hydrolysis platform, they gave higher sugar yields than standard poplar, but temperature pretreatment severity affected their rankings. In another approach to understand factors responsible for recalcitrance, application of <b>flowthrough</b> and batch pretreatment with dilute acid and just liquid hot water to standard poplar indicated that <b>flowthrough</b> pretreatment solubilized and removed 65 to 70 % of the lignin before it could react further to low solubility lignin rich fragments that otherwise deposit on biomass in batch operations and hinder enzyme action. In subsequent work, combinations of enzymes and bovine serum albumin applied to solids produced by aqueous <b>flowthrough</b> and batch pretreatments revealed how polysaccharides in poplar were successively deconstructed layer by layer through pretreatment and subsequent hydrolysis by cellulase and xylanase combinations and through BSA addition. The standard strong acid hydrolysis procedure for measuring carbohydrate and lignin content in biomass was shown to be robust over a range of particle sizes, reaction times, and filtration strategies. Finally, elimination of shaking resulted in enzyme loadings of only 5 mg protein/g glucan able to realize nearly complete cellulose conversion, similar yields to those achieved with shaking if surfactants were added.

A model of virus migration in the soil columns was created by using a one-dimensional transport model in which kinetic sorption was used.

Plasma is a unique sample, possessing proteins that span the entire human proteome. Analysis of plasma can provide valuable information for the discovery of new biomarkers and novel drug targets. However, the tremendous complexity of the plasma proteome presents extreme analytical challenges in proteome characterization. High-abundant proteins such as albumin, IgG, transferrin, haptoglobin, IgA, anti-trypsin and fibrinogen comprise up to 90 % of the total protein mass in plasma. These high-abundant protein components interfere with the identification and characterization of important low-abundant proteins by limiting the dynamic range of mass spectral and electrophoretic analyses.

40|$|Up to {{the present}} time the main tool used in the {{hydraulic}} design of <b>flowthrough</b> rockfill drains {{appears to have been}} Wilkins' (1956) equation. In this Paper the assumptions associated with this equation are discussed in detail. The authors note that piezometers are sometimes installed in rockfill drains to permit mine operators to ensure that a drain is functioning as expected, yet little effort seems to have been expended in verifying whether the observed water levels are in agreement with levels which could be estimated using theoretical considerations. Such modelling can indicate whether the values of parameters assumed in Wilkins' equation were correct and may therefore also indicate whether appreciable clogging of the drain has occurred. This Paper discusses an adaptation of the theory of gradually varied flow for computing the phreatic surface within a rock drain. Wilkins ' (1956) equation for non-Darcy flow through porous media utilizes the parameter known as the hydraulic mean radius.

40|$|The {{development}} of transportation fuels with low {{greenhouse gas emissions}} is imperative due to growing demand for transportation fuels, decreasing conventional petroleum supplies, and global warming. Ethanol from cellulosic biomass could address all of these challenges but current conversion technologies are not commercially feasible. Expensive pretreatments and enzymes are needed to recover fermentable sugars from cellulose and hemicellulose. Lignin represents an additional barrier to sugar recovery. The pretreatment step, key to the conversion process, hydrolyzes xylan, part of hemicellulose, and disrupts lignin. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are closely associated in the cell wall but {{the effect of these}} associations during pretreatment has not been studied despite suggestions that they are important. Better knowledge of hemicellulose and lignin deconstruction during pretreatment could lead to breakthroughs that would bring cellulosic ethanol one step closer to reality. Key to this study of biomass deconstruction was the use of a fixed bed <b>flowthrough</b> pretreatment reactor. Pretreatment products are swept out of the reactor quickly thus facilitating the tracking of products as a function of time, limiting side and degradation reactions, and product precipitation at the end of pretreatments. The implementation of a metal 96 well plate for pretreatment resulted in the implementation of indirect steam heating, which raised questions about the adequacy of fluidized sand baths for heating. The results of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis using each system were not significantly different although indirect steam did prove to be the superior heating system. Confident in the performance of the fluidized sand bath, baseline-operating conditions for <b>flowthrough</b> pretreatment were selected based on review of the literature, modeling, and trial and error. Populus trichocarpa, a potential bioenergy crop, was subjected to batch and <b>flowthrough</b> pretreatment along with model substrates: holocellulose, the hemicellulose and cellulose portion of P. trichocarpa, birchwood xylan, and cellulolytic enzyme lignin isolated from P. trichocarpa. The differences in the pretreatment results among these substrates indicate that the associations between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin limit the hydrolysis of xylan but increase the extractability of lignin.

40|$|Owing to {{its high}} {{efficiency}} and environmental compatibility, electroreduction holds great promise for the detoxification of aqueous Cr(VI). However, the typical electroreduction system often shows poor mass transfer, {{which results in}} slow reduction kinetics and hence higher energy consumption. Here, we demonstrate a flow-through electrode of polyaniline supported on lamellar-structured graphene (LGS-PANI) for electrocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). The reaction kinetics of the LGS-PANI flow-through electrodes are 6. 4 times (at acidic condition) and 17. 3 times (at neutral condition) faster than traditional immersed parallel-plate electrodes. Computational fluid dynamics simulation suggests that the <b>flowthrough</b> mode greatly enhances the mass transfer and that the nanoscale convection induced by the PANT nanodots increases the nanoscale mass transport in the interfacial region of the electrode/solution. In situ Raman spectroscopy shows that the PANI-Cr(VI) redox reactions are dominated by the leucoemeraldine/emeraldine transition at 1. 5 V cell voltage, which also remarkably contributes to the fast reaction kinetics. Using single-pass <b>flowthrough</b> mode, the LGS-PANI electrode reaches an average reduction efficiency of 99. 8 % with residual Cr(VI) concentration of 22. 3 ppb (initial [Cr(VI) ] = 10 ppm, flux = 20 L h(- 1) m(- 2)).

The acetylene (C 2 H 2) inhibition method is a simple technique for estimating denitrification. However, potential problems, such as inhibition of nitrification and incomplete inhibition of nitrous oxide reduction, may influence rate estimates. Recently, membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) has been used to measure denitrification in aquatic systems. Comparable results were obtained with MIMS and C 2 H 2 inhibition methods when chloramphenicol was added to C 2 H 2 inhibition assay mixtures to inhibit new synthesis of denitrifying enzymes. Dissolved-oxygen profiles indicated that surface layers of sediment cores subjected to the MIMS <b>flowthrough</b> incubation remained oxic whereas cores incubated using the C 2 H 2 inhibition methods did not. Analysis of the microbial assemblages before and after incubations indicated significant changes in the sediment surface populations during the long <b>flowthrough</b> incubation for MIMS analysis but not during the shorter incubation used for the C 2 H 2 inhibition method. However, bacterial community changes were also small in MIMS cores at the oxygen transition zone where denitrification occurs.
