5|$|Cabaniss's {{academic}} rankings remained {{generally the}} same in his following year at the academy. His scores in drawing, mathematics, and physics were above average, while his merits in French language and history were among the worst. He finished 33rd {{in the class of}} 66. He maintained <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> as the most disciplined in his class, earning fewer than half the demerits than the second-best.|$|E

50|$|Dalmatian - Billy, the Polkadot Dalmatian, {{is given}} to Claire {{as a gift for}} her birthday. When he is given the Witch's spot on the bed, the Witch casts a spell on him and steals <b>his</b> <b>spots.</b> Fearing that Claire will no longer love him, he ventures into the Forest of Fantasy to {{retrieve}} <b>his</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Witch, mortified {{at having}} been cast aside, decides {{to put a}} spell on the Dalmatian. She steals all of <b>his</b> <b>spots</b> and hides them in the Forest of Fantasy. She then escapes to the Forest herself, where the others {{will not be able}} to find her. When the toys wake up, Dalmatian is horrified to find that <b>his</b> <b>spots</b> have vanished. The others try to console him, but he is {{convinced}} that Claire, seeing that he is defective, will throw him away just like she did to the Witch. Piglet, the smartest of the toys, deduces that the Witch must have sent <b>his</b> <b>spots</b> to the Forest of Fantasy. She explains that the Forest is where all fairy tales take place. In order to get there, the toys must fall asleep while walking. This will put them in a place thats between sleeping and waking; where anything is possible ("Forest of Fantasy").|$|R

However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> was surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect, who accepted it in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993.|$|E
5|$|Despite injury troubles, Totti {{recovered}} {{in time to}} join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, {{despite a lack of}} match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti's desire to work even harder to overcome {{what could have been a}} career-ending injury and make it to the World Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media's opinion).|$|E
5|$|Greene {{retired as}} a player {{following}} the 1981 season. He finished his career having played in 181 {{out of a possible}} 190 games, and recorded 78.5 sacks (unofficially, as sacks were not an official statistic until 1982) and 16 fumble recoveries. <b>His</b> <b>spot</b> in the lineup was technically not replaced; the Steelers switched to a 3–4 defensive alignment for the 1982 season, which has only one nose tackle as opposed to two defensive tackles. The team has used the 3–4 as its base alignment continuously in the years since Greene's retirement, and more recently have used alignments that deploy only two true linemen.|$|E

In the Irani Trophy, the traditional season opener between the reigning Ranji champions—Mumbai—and the Rest of India, Kartik orchestrated the demise of the title-holders. After taking 4/73 in Mumbai's 260, Kartik scored 22 in the Rest of India's 389. He then took 9/70 to cut down Mumbai for 184, and his batting colleagues accumulated the 55 needed for victory without loss. Kartik then took 3/82 and 1/45 against Madhya Pradesh to secure <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> in the Test team.|$|E
5|$|Next year he {{finished}} eleventh at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, {{his first major}} international final. His performance and throw of 77.75metres was slightly disappointing as he had thrown 79.44metres in the qualifying round, having travelled to Paris with a personal best of 85.72 metres, established in June in Ventspils. On the lighter side he took his second national title, consolidating <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> as Norway's leading javelin thrower.|$|E

5|$|The White Sox {{acquired}} Orlando Cabrera to play shortstop in 2008, forcing Uribe {{to compete}} with Alexei Ramírez, Danny Richar, and Pablo Ozuna for the position in spring training. Uribe won the second base job, but after an injury in May, Uribe lost <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> in the White Sox starting lineup to Ramírez. However, Uribe took over third base from Josh Fields (who had spent a week filling in for an injured Joe Crede) on August 1. In 110 games (324 at-bats), Uribe had 80 hits, 22 doubles, seven home runs, and 40 RBIs. On October 30, Uribe filed for free agency.|$|E

Adenhart earned <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> in the Angels' 2009 starting rotation during spring training. He appeared in six starts and had a 3–0 record with a 3.12 ERA over 26 innings pitched. He allowed only nine earned runs and five walks, while striking out 18. Adenhart opened the 2009 season as the third starter in the Angels' rotation. In his season debut on April 8, 2009, he earned a no-decision, giving up seven hits and no runs while striking out five batters and walking three in six innings against the Oakland Athletics at Angel Stadium of Anaheim.|$|E
5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|As Manchester United and Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup respectively, {{both teams}} met in another heated match at the Millennium Stadium {{a month earlier}} for the 2003 Community Shield.

Yellow cards were also given to Quinton Fortune and Paul Scholes for United and Patrick Vieira for Arsenal, Arsenal substitute Francis Jeffers was shown a straight red for a kick on Phil Neville and, despite originally going unpunished, Sol Campbell was later given a three-match ban by the FA for kicking out at Eric Djemba-Djemba. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and United eventually won the Shield 4–3 on penalties.

5|$|From {{his debut}} onwards, Carrick {{was a regular}} in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 {{appearances}} {{in his first season}} with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in 2006–07, their first title success in four years. The following season {{he was part of the}} side that won the 2008 Champions League final, playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6–5 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> kick, to help achieve the European Double. He has enjoyed continued success since then, and as of 2017, he is the only English player alongside Wayne Rooney to win the Premier League title, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Europa League and FIFA Club World Cup. In winning the 2016 FA Cup, Carrick completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season with the Giants, Tenney led MLB with 684 plate {{appearances}} and finished third in runs scored, with 101. In {{a game against the}} Chicago Cubs on September 23, Tenney could not play due to an attack of lumbago; it was the only game he did not play in during the season. Rookie Fred Merkle took <b>his</b> <b>spot</b> at first base. The game was at a 1–1 tie {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. Merkle, after hitting a single, was at first, and Moose McCormick was at third, with two outs. Al Bridwell singled to center field, but Hank O'Day called Merkle out because Merkle had not touched second base. O'Day ruled the game a 1–1 tie due to darkness. With both teams finishing the season at a 98–55 record, a replay game had to be played to determine who would win the National League pennant. The game was held on October 8, with the Cubs winning, 4–2.|$|E
