5|$|An arc diagram or linear <b>embedding</b> places {{vertices}} of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book <b>embedding</b> with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book <b>embedding</b> by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book <b>embedding.</b> For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an <b>embedding</b> in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the <b>embedding,</b> and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique <b>embedding,</b> and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the <b>embedding</b> is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E

5|$|In graph theory, a book <b>embedding</b> is a {{generalization}} of planar <b>embedding</b> of a graph to embeddings into a book, {{a collection of}} half-planes all having the same line as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of the graph are required to lie on this boundary line, called the spine, and the edges are required to stay within a single half-plane. The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book <b>embedding</b> of the graph. Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number.|$|E

40|$|An <b>embedded</b> {{system is}} a hybrid of {{hardware}} and software, which combines software’s flexibility and hardware real-time performance. <b>Embedded</b> systems {{can be considered as}} assemblies of hardware and software components. An Open <b>Embedded</b> System Model (OESM) is currently being developed at NIST to provide a standard representation and exchange protocol for <b>embedded</b> systems and system-level design, simulation, and testing information. This paper proposes an approach to representing an <b>embedded</b> system feature-based model in OESM, i. e., Open <b>Embedded</b> System Feature Model (OESFM), addressing models of <b>embedded</b> system artifacts, <b>embedded</b> system components, <b>embedded</b> system features, and <b>embedded</b> system configuration/assembly. The approach provides an object-oriented UML (Unified Modeling Language) representation for the <b>embedded</b> system feature model and defines an extension to the NIST Core Product Model. The model provides a feature-based component framework allowing the designer to develop a virtual <b>embedded</b> system prototype through assembling virtual components. The framework not only provides a formal precise model of the <b>embedded</b> system prototype but also offers the possibility of designing variation of prototypes whose members are derived by changing certain virtual components with different features.

5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book <b>embedding</b> in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book <b>embedding.</b> Thus, a book <b>embedding</b> of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed <b>embedding</b> on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E

40|$|Advancements in silicon technology, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), {{wireless}} communications, computer networking, {{and digital}} electronics {{have led to}} the proliferation of <b>embedded</b> systems in a plethora of application domains (e. g., industrial and home automation, automotive, space, medical, defense, etc.). To meet the diverse application requirements of these application domains, novel trends have emerged in <b>embedded</b> systems. Many times, the <b>embedded</b> systems in an application domain are networked together to form a multi-unit <b>embedded</b> system, also referred to as a distributed <b>embedded</b> system, which permits sophisticated applications of greater value as compared to an isolated single-unit <b>embedded</b> system. An emerging trend is to connect these distributed <b>embedded</b> systems via a wireless network instead of a bulky, wired networking infrastructure. Another emerging trend in <b>embedded</b> systems is to leverage multi-core (many-core) architectures to meet the continuously increasing performance demands of many application domains (e. g., medical imaging, mobile signal processing). Both single-unit and multi-unit distributed <b>embedded</b> systems can leverage multi-core architectures for attaining high performance and energy efficiency. The burgeoning of multi-core architectures in <b>embedded</b> systems induces parallel computing in <b>embedded</b> domain, which was previously used predominantly in supercomputing domain only. For both parallel and distributed <b>embedded</b> systems, modeling and optimization at various design levels (e. g., verification, simulation, analysis) is of paramount significance. Considering the short time-to-market for many <b>embedded</b> systems, <b>embedded</b> systems designers often resort to modeling approaches for evaluation of design alternatives in terms of performance, power, reliability, and/or scalability. In this dissertation, we focus on modeling, analysis, and optimization of parallel and distributed <b>embedded</b> systems.

However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph <b>embedding</b> can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the <b>embedding)</b> are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E
