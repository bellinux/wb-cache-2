5|$|Different {{units of}} the {{regiment}} were stationed at other forts throughout the island {{under the command of}} William P. Burnham. Lieutenant Teófilo Marxuach, the officer of the day, was stationed at El Morro Castle at San Juan Bay on 21 March 1915. The Odenwald, built in 1903 (not {{to be confused with the}} German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the San Juan Bay and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship from the walls of the fort. Sergeant Encarnación Correa then manned a machine gun and fired warning shots with little effect.|$|E
5|$|Within Wayne County, {{the area}} around NY21 becomes more {{developed}} as it enters the village of Palmyra, where the road is village-maintained from the southern village line to its junction with NY31 in the village's historic center. The route briefly overlaps NY31 along East Main Street before crossing both the Erie Canal and the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the village. From Palmyra to Williamson, the land surrounding NY21 is predominantly rural in nature. However, midway between the two locations, NY21 comes close to the hamlet of Marion, which it bypasses to the west. In Williamson, NY21 passes through the town center at a junction with Ridge Road before ending at an intersection with NY104 in a more commercial section of the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} French and Spanish fleet under Villeneuve's command numbered 33 {{ships of}} the line. Napoleon Bonaparte had intended for Villeneuve to sail into the English Channel {{and cover the}} planned invasion of Britain, but the entry of Austria and Russia into the war forced Napoleon to call off the planned invasion and transfer troops to Germany. Villeneuve had been reluctant to risk an engagement with the British, and this reluctance led Napoleon to order Vice Admiral François Rosily to go to Cádiz and take command of the fleet, sail it into the Mediterranean to land troops at Naples, before making port at Toulon. Villeneuve decided to sail the fleet out before his successor arrived. On 20 October 1805, the fleet was sighted making <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> harbour by patrolling British frigates, and Nelson was informed that {{they appeared to be}} heading to the west.|$|E

5|$|The two routes {{serve as}} Oneonta's main street, {{following}} Chestnut and Main streets across the city's western and central areas. Along the way, NY7 and NY23 pass Hartwick College and serve Oneonta's central business district. NY23 breaks from NY7 just northeast of downtown to follow James F. Lettis Highway, a four-lane divided highway, south into the southern {{half of the}} city. As it heads south on the arterial, it connects to Interstate88 (I-88) at an interchange on the northern bank of the Susquehanna River. NY28—which overlaps with I-88 from Oneonta to exit17 northeast of the city—leaves the freeway here, following NY23 across the river to a large commercial district on the south bank.

5|$|Jones and Mutt are {{captured}} by Mac and the Soviets {{and taken to}} their camp in the Amazon jungle, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who reveals that Mutt is Jones' son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power, and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull, but Marion and Jones get caught into a dry sandpit, to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a CIA double-agent to regain Jones' trust, and Jones' team fights <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by siafu ants. Jones and his allies cause many of the Soviets to fall from a cliff, and they survive three waterfalls in an amphibious vehicle. Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent, is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} problem facing Attlee and his ministers remained the economy, {{as the war}} effort had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain {{about a quarter of}} her national wealth. Overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the balance of trade. This resulted in strict rationing of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports, boost exports, and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its financial state.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, amid {{a growing}} {{economic}} and political crisis, Cripps tried to persuade Attlee to retire in favour of Ernest Bevin; however, Bevin was in favour of Attlee remaining. Cripps was instead appointed to the new post of Minister for Economic Affairs. Six weeks later Hugh Dalton resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Cripps succeeded him, with the position of Minister for Economic Affairs now merged into the Chancellorship. He increased taxes and forced a reduction in consumption {{in an effort to}} boost exports and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its crisis.

40|$|One major {{strategy}} to incorporate social {{media in the}} organizational structure is erecting a ‘social media hub’, a relatively independent organization within a standing organization. The standing organization with its divisions do not change, but the hub has considerable possibilities to operate independently within and in between these divisions. The introduction of a social media hub has deep impact on the organization. New people with distinct competences are entering and have to find their positions. How to accommodate these ‘marsians’, these different employees claiming their autonomy {{to do their jobs}} well? Based on theory about ambidextrous organizations we formulated three hypothetical dilemmas, one about structure, one about behavior and one about leadership. These dilemmas have been input to interviews to four major companies erecting a social media hub.

25|$|Serotonin {{secreted}} {{from the}} enterochromaffin cells eventually finds <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tissues into the blood. There, it is actively {{taken up by}} blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it {{can serve as a}} vasoconstrictor and/or a vasodilator while regulating hemostasis and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II, norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Additionally, it inhibits the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various serotonin receptors.|$|E
