25|$|Germany, {{through its}} {{development}} bank KfW, finances improvements in {{water supply and}} sanitation in Batumi since 2006. Prior to the project untreated wastewater was discharged into the Black Sea, tap water was not drinkable and water supply was intermittent. The project is also supported through a 9.5m EUR grant of the European Union. It includes the construction of a modern wastewater treatment plant, a functioning stormwater <b>discharge</b> <b>system</b> and the installation of about 37,300 water meters in multi-apartment buildings. These households will be billed based on their consumption, which is expected to be reduced from about 750 litres per day to below 200.|$|E

Three are Lighter aboard ships (LASH) which carry barges called Lighters that contain Army ammunition to be ferried ashore: MV American Cormorant, SS Green Harbour, (LASH), SS Green Valley, (LASH), MV Jeb Stuart, (LASH). There were Logistics Vessels to service the rapid delivery requirements of the United States Air Force, United States Navy and Defense Logistics Agency. These included container ships for Air Force munitions, missiles and spare parts; a 500-bed hospital ship, and floating storage and offloading units assigned to Military Sealift Command supporting the Defense Logistics Agency, and an offshore petroleum <b>discharge</b> <b>system</b> (OPDS) tanker.

2500|$|Reconstructing the Howard Street Tunnel to {{accommodate}} double-stacked intermodal containers had been {{once thought to}} cost $13 billion. However, in April 2016, a $425 million plan was revealed that would create the needed [...] of additional clearance in the tunnel by trimming and notching its arched ceiling, lowering its floor, and using steel crossties, which have a lower profile than wood crossties. The Maryland Department of Transportation subsequently applied for a $155 million FY2016 FASTLANE grant to help fund a project based on this lower-cost plan, but the grant was not received. In December 2016, MDOT reapplied for a FASTLANE grant of the same amount in the FY2017 round of funding. In addition to the federal funds expected from the grant, the State of Maryland would contribute $145M, and CSX $125M, towards {{the cost of the}} project. In expectation of the grant funding, CSX is investing $25M in the tunnel$21M to improve its water <b>discharge</b> <b>system,</b> and $4M for engineering and design of the clearance improvements. The project, which would also increase the clearance at nine bridges north of the tunnel, would last 45 years (due to having to be scheduled around active rail traffic), create about 500 construction jobs, and would result in 178,000 containers per year being moved by rail from the Port of Baltimore instead of by truck. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said that the state would explore other funding solutions if the FY2017 FASTLANE grant is not received.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} investigate the behavior of inclined negatively buoyant jets. Such jets arise when brine is discharged from desalination plants and improved knowledge of their behavior is required for designing <b>discharge</b> <b>systems</b> that cause a minimum of environmental impact on the receiving waters. In the present experiment, a turbulent jet with a specific salinity was discharged through a circular nozzle {{at an angle to}} the horizontal into a tank with fresh water and the spatial evolution of the jet was recorded. In total, 72 experimental cases were carried out where four different initial jet parameters were changed, namely the nozzle diameter, the initial jet inclination, the jet density (or salinity), and the flow rate (or exit velocity). The measurements of the jet evolution in the tank included five geometric quantities describing the jet trajectory that are useful in the design of brine <b>discharge</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
