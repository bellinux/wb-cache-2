5|$|In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, {{he spent}} {{a week in the}} {{religious}} class <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills. He also attended Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart.|$|E
5|$|In Toraja society, {{the funeral}} ritual {{is the most}} {{elaborate}} and expensive event. The richer and more powerful the individual, the more expensive is the funeral. In the aluk religion, only nobles {{have the right to}} have an extensive death feast. The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called rante, is usually prepared in a large, grassy field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased family. Flute music, funeral chants, songs and poems, and crying and wailing are traditional Toraja expressions of grief with the exceptions of funerals <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> and poor, low-status adults.|$|E
5|$|Visual scene {{displays}} are {{a different}} method of organizing and presenting symbols. These are depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions in a picture, photograph, or virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience. They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary {{that is associated with}} specific activities or routines. For example, a photo of a child's room may be included in the child's AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication. Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use.|$|E

5|$|His {{most popular}} work {{was that of}} Tableau de l'état {{physique}} et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation, published in the year 1840. The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Myron {{published}} , {{written with}} the help of Bret Witter, which reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list of nonfiction books. The book told the story of Dewey's life at the library, interspersed with the difficulties faced by the town and Myron in her personal life, and how Dewey helped ease those burdens. Based on their first book, Myron and Witter published two children's books: Dewey: There's a Cat in the Library!, a picture book <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> and Dewey: The Library Cat, a book for middle-grade readers. Later in 2008, Meryl Streep was cast to star in a film based on the book. By May 2012, a final script had not been approved, and the film option was due to expire in June 2012. Myron and Witter published a sequel, Dewey's Nine Lives, in 2010, detailing previously unreleased stories about Dewey, as well as tales Myron heard about other cats after Dewey's death. That same year, Myron and Witter published a children's book, Dewey's Christmas at the Library, intended for 3–6 year-olds.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

5|$|Scottish kinship in {{this period}} was agnatic, with descent judged through a common ancestor, helping to create the surname system in the Borders and the clans in the Highlands, with these systems {{beginning}} to break down in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries respectively. There was considerable concern over the safety of children. The abolition of godparents in the Reformation meant that baptism became a mechanism for emphasising the role and responsibilities of fathers. Wet-nurses were used <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> but in most families mothers took the primary role in bringing up children, while the Kirk emphasised the role of the father for older children. After the Reformation there was an increasing emphasis on education, resulting in the growth of a parish school system, but its effects were limited for the children of the poor and for girls. Most children left home for a period of life-cycle service, as domestic or agricultural servants or as apprentices before marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{facilities}} are utilised by the Route 26 Community Project, a registered charity {{based at the}} centre that works towards the betterment of lives in Deckham and neighbouring wards. The project works with Gateshead Council and the Gateshead Housing Company to provide a community cafe promoting healthy eating (the T–Junction), a gymnasium, indoor sports hall, outdoor Five-a-side football pitches and a meeting place for resident groups. The project has education provision <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> as a registered day–care provider and it also offers adult education and training. The project hosts the Carnival on the Hill/Deckham Festival, a collaborative enterprise between Route 26, Gateshead Council and Home Group, offering free activities such as go-karting and children's soft play, {{against the backdrop of}} a steel band. The second Carnival on the Hill was held on 3 September 2011 and attracted more than 1,000 visitors, including the Mayor of Gateshead and BBC local weatherman Paul Mooney.|$|E
