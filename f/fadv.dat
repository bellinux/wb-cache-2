40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Aviadenovirus (<b>FAdV)</b> {{was investigated in}} chickens from the poultry industry of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The investigation was conducted due to the scarcity of recent data {{in the country and}} its description in neighboring countries. For this purpose, livers were collected from layer chicks (n= 25), older layers (n= 25), broilers (n= 300), and livers (n= 25) and stool (n= 25) samples from broiler breeders, representing the major poultry regions of the state. <b>FAdV</b> DNA was demonstrated using a previously described PCR protocol for amplifying part of the hexon gene encoding sequence. <b>FAdV</b> was found in layer chicks (36 %), widespread (100 %) in older layers, and with regional differences in broilers (24 - 86 %). Although all broiler breeder stools were negative, <b>FAdV</b> DNA was detected in livers (16 %, 4 / 25) of stool-negative birds. In order to obtain additional information on the circulation of the infection, livers of subsistence chickens collected from one poultry intensive region, were evaluated (n = 12), with <b>FAdV</b> being detected in all samples. <b>FAdV</b> was found in young and old layers, broilers, broiler breeders and free-range chickens, and results suggest the circulation of <b>FAdV</b> among different types of chickens. The detection in older layer chickens may indicate an extended risk of horizontal transmission in regions of Minas Gerais with mixed activity of egg and meat type chickens and poor biosecurity strategies. The infection in breeders may indicate vertical transmission and the continuous production of infected progenies. The hexon-gene-targeted PCR amplicon sequences aligned with <b>FAdV</b> of species D of Aviadenovirus. Results indicate the necessity for biosecurity, especially for breeders, separating flocks according to origin, age and health status, which will be an advantage regarding any pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Adenoviruses {{have been}} {{isolated}} from both clinically healthy and diseased birds worldwide. The pathogenic role {{of most of}} the FAdVs is still questionable. They can quickly take on the role of opportunistic pathogens when additional factors, particularly concurrent infections, adversely affect the health of the avian host. Immnosuppressing agents especially chicken infectious anemia and infectious bursal disease viruses are known to enhance the pathogenicity of FAdVs upon coinfection. The aim {{of the present study was}} to screen for the involvement of <b>FAdV</b> in poultry flocks affected with respiratory disease complex by RT-PCR. The samples were also screened by RT-PCR/PCR for other respiratory pathogens. Thirty two commercial poultry flocks with the history of respiratory disease complex from various parts of India. <b>FAdV</b> nucleic acid could be detected in tissue samples of 13 out of 34 farms investigated. Out of 13 <b>FAdV</b> positive farms, <b>FAdV</b> and CIAV were alone detected in 4 / 13 (31 %) whereas, in other farms more than two respiratory pathogens were detected together. CIAV was detected in all the farms (34 / 34) investigated. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were noticed in <b>FAdV</b> infected laryngeal and tracheal epithelium under light microscopy. The findings of the study assert that <b>FAdV</b> can play the role of primary respiratory pathogen in immunocompromised birds and also in the presence of other respiratory pathogens...|$|E

A total of 218 000 chickens, 2 – 29 days of age, were affected over a 1 -year period, all testing positive by microscopy, virus isolation and confirmation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Affected birds were depressed, lost body weight, were weak and had watery droppings. Pathological changes observed during necropsy indicated consistent changes in the liver, characterised by hepatomegaly, cholestasis and hepatitis. Lesions were also discernible in the spleen, kidney and gizzard wall and were characterised by splenomegaly, pinpoint haemorrhages, nephritis with haemorrhage, visceral gout and serosal ecchymosis of the gizzard wall. Histopathological lesions were most consistently observed in the liver but could also be seen in renal and splenic tissue. Virus isolation was achieved in embryonated eggs and most embryos revealed multifocal to diffuse hepatic necrosis, with a mixed cellular infiltrate of macrophages and heterophils (necro-granulomas), {{even in the absence}} of macroscopic pathology. Virus isolation results were verified by histopathology and PCR on embryonic material and further characterised by nucleotide sequence analysis. Two infectious bursal disease virus isolates were also made from the Klerksdorp flock.

40|$|Comparative {{pathogenicity}} {{of liver}} homogenate and cell culture propagated agents of hydropericardium syndrome was studied in broiler birds. In Experiment I, 25 -day-old while in experiment II, broiler birds at different ages were inoculated through different routes. In Experiment I, liver homogenate caused 64 % mortality through intramuscular route and 33. 33 % mortality through oral route. The cell culture propagated HPS virus caused 60 and 13. 33 % mortality in broiler birds through intramuscular and oral routes, respectively. In Experiment II, {{none of the}} day-old-chicks died when challenged with liver homogenate and cell culture propagated HPS virus through S/C and oral route. The liver homogenate and cell culture propagated HPS virus caused higher mortality in different age groups of broiler birds through s/c route compared to oral route. The values of hemoglobin (Hb) and packed cell volume (PCV) showed highly significant (P< 0. 05) reduction indicating anemia. The values of Hb and PCV of the broiler birds inoculated with infectious liver homogenate were significantly lower as compared to birds inoculated with cell culture propagated HPS virus. The {{results indicated that the}} liver homogenate is more pathogenic than cell culture propagated HPS virus. These changes may be due to adoptability of the original <b>FAdVs</b> (fowl adenovirus) after continued passages in the culture of chicken embryo liver cells.

40|$|Inclusion body {{hepatitis}} (IBH) {{has been}} occurring as an economically important, emerging disease of broiler chickens in several countries. Historically, IBH {{has been identified}} as a secondary disease, often associated with common immunosuppressive diseases. However, few studies have identified IBH as a primary disease with no apparent association with immunosuppressive diseases. The objectives of this study were to develop an animal model of IBH in commercial broilers, to demonstrate vertical transmission of fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) in broiler breeders and to control IBH in broilers by vaccinating their parents with an inactivated <b>FAdV</b> vaccine. In order to develop an animal model of IBH in commercial broilers, fourteen-day old broilers were inoculated intramuscularly with 1 x 104 – 1 x 107 CCID 50 of either <b>FAdV</b> x 11 a-like virus, two strains of FAdV- 8 a (FAdV- 8 a strain TR- 59 and FAdV- 8 a strain T 8 -A) or FAdV- 11 strain 1047. Four days following <b>FAdV</b> inoculation, 5 % - 15 % mortality was observed and dead birds showed histologic lesions of hemorrhagic necrotizing hepatitis. This animal model reproduced the clinical disease, and pathological lesions of IBH that have been described in commercial broilers. In order to demonstrate vertical transmission of the <b>FAdV,</b> 35 -week-old broiler breeders were inoculated with 1 x 106 CCID 50 of either <b>FAdV</b> x 11 a-like virus, FAdV- 8 a strain TR- 59, FAdV- 8 a strain T 8 -A or FAdV- 11 strain 1047. Eggs from infected breeders were collected and hatched seven days post-inoculation. Clinical signs or mortality were not observed in parents; however broiler progeny derived from broiler breeders inoculated with FAdV- 8 a strain T 8 -A had 30 % IBH mortality by seven days of age. The hexon gene loop 1 sequence of the virus isolated from affected broiler progeny showed 100 % identity to FAdV- 8 a strain T 8 -A. In order to demonstrate protection of broilers against IBH by vaccination of their parents, four groups of broiler breeders were vaccinated with either FAdV- 8 a strain T 8 -A (2 x 107 or 2 x 104 CCID 50) formulated with 20 % oil-in-water emulsion, or <b>FAdV</b> x 11 a-like virus (2 x 107 or 2 x 104 CCID 50) formulated with 20 % oil-in-water emulsion at the age of 12 and 15 weeks. The control group was inoculated with 20 % oil-in-water emulsion. Broiler progeny were challenged with FAdV- 8 a strain T 8 -A to study the immunoprotective effect of the vaccine. Although, survival of broilers following FAdV- 8 a strain T 8 -A challenge was not significantly different among vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups (P> 0. 05), immunoprotective effect was enhanced by the increase dose of <b>FAdV</b> antigens (P> 0. 05). Further studies are necessary to improve the vaccine efficacy to protect broilers against IBH. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} support the hypothesis that IBH in broilers in Canada is a vertically-transmitted primary disease with no known immunosuppressive involvement. The results also demonstrated that inactivated antigens of <b>FAdV</b> are able to partially protect broilers against IBH by vaccinating their parents. Further studies with different formulations, and priming the immune system of broiler breeders with live <b>FAdV</b> prior to vaccination with inactivated <b>FAdV</b> vaccines are necessary to improve the efficacy of inactivated IBH vaccine...|$|E

40|$|Fowl adenoviruses (<b>FAdV)</b> are {{generally}} considered ubiquitous, but certain serotypes and strains {{are known to}} be associated with primary diseases, such as inclusion body hepatitis (IBH). Fifty-two <b>FAdV</b> isolates were collected from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec over a 4 -year period. These 2 provinces have the largest poultry industries in Canada. Except for one virus, which originated from a guinea fowl, all other viruses were isolated from chicken samples. Most of these were from broilers, although some were from broiler breeders, and one was from layer pullets. Thirty-four isolates were from clinical IBH cases with the final laboratory diagnosis of IBH; however, for 18 isolates, the varied case diagnosis was seemingly unrelated to <b>FAdV.</b> All IBH-associated viruses had deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiles compatible with <b>FAdV</b> species E (28 cases) or species D (6 cases), and the DNA fragment profiles of 26 species E viruses were indicative of serotype 8.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of clinical cases of inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) associated with fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) {{is a growing concern}} {{in different parts of the}} world, including Canada. After an outbreak of IBH in a 10 -d-old pullet broiler breeder flock, we serologically monitored the flock from 8 to 46 wk of age, using the agar gel precipitation test (AGPT) offered by diagnostic laboratories and an <b>FAdV</b> group-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbemt assay (ELISA) developed earlier. In addition, we tested 1 -d-old progeny for possible vertical transmission of <b>FAdV</b> when the breeder flock approached the peak of egg production by performing virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures on target organs. As in previous studies comparing the 2 tests, ELISA was more sensitive than AGPT. With ELISA, a few birds had weakly positive results at 8 wk of age, and all the birds had strongly positive results from 12 wk of age until the end of the study. This group-specific ELISA is therefore a sensitive and practical way to monitor <b>FAdV</b> antibodies in commercial flocks. None of the 1 -d-old chicks tested were positive by PCR, nor was <b>FAdV</b> isolated from the same tissues, indicating an absence of transmission of infectious virus to the progeny.

40|$|Fowl {{adenovirus}} (<b>FAdV)</b> is {{a member}} of the genus Aviadenovirus and causes a number of economically important poultry diseases. One of these diseases, inclusion body hepatitis (IBH), has a worldwide distribution and is characterised by acute mortality (5 % – 20 %) in production chickens. The disease was first described in the United States of America in 1963 and has also been reported in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Ireland, but until now, not in South Africa. Adenoviruses isolated from the first outbreak of IBH in South Africa were able to reproduce the disease in chicken embryo livers. The aim of the present study was to characterise the viruses and determine the pathogenicity of the <b>FAdV</b> strains responsible for the first reported case of IBH in South Africa. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the L 1 loop region of the fowl adenovirus hexon gene using degenerate primer pair hexon A/B was used to identify the viruses that were isolated. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the amplification products was used for the differentiation of 14 isolates of fowl adenovirus. Sequencing of the PCR products followed by amino acid comparison and phylogenetic analysis using the L 1 loop region of the hexon protein was done to determine the identity of the isolates. Amino acid sequences of the hexon genes of all the South African isolates were compared with those of reference strains representing <b>FAdV</b> species. Amino acid comparison of 12 South Africa field isolates to <b>FAdV</b> reference strains revealed a high sequence identity (> 93. 33 %) with reference strains T 8 -A and 764. Two of the isolates had high sequence identity (93. 40 %) with reference strains P 7 -A, C 2 B and SR 48.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Fowl {{adenovirus}} (<b>FAdv)</b> serotype 2 causes {{inclusion body}} hepatitis (IBH) disease which adversely affects the broiler industry in Thailand. We developed an indirect ELISA based on the recombinant hexon protein produced by E. coli. The recombinant hexon protein was tested with sera, in both infected and noninfected chickens. The recombinant hexon protein was standardized with an antigen concentra-tion of 3. 75 µg/ml and test sera. The intra- and inter-assays were repeatable. The cutoff value from TG-ROC curve analysis was 0. 106. The specificity and sensitivity were 80 and 80 %, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) of absorbance values from this ELISA compared with the serum neutralization test was 0. 76. This ELISA might be helpful for IBH diagnosis and surveillance.

40|$|Adenoviruses are {{frequent}} infectious agents in different poultry species. The traditional, serological typing of new isolates by virus neutralisation tests {{is now in}} transition {{to be replaced by}} PCR and sequencing. The first PCRs, recommended for the detection of adenoviruses, had been designed to target the gene of the major capsid protein, the hexon. In birds, members of three different genera of the family Adenoviridae may occur. Accordingly, three specific hexon PCRs had to be elaborated for the detection of adenoviruses in poultry. A significantly more sensitive PCR, targeting the viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene, has been described recently. This method proved to be an efficient alternative for the general detection of adenoviruses irrespective of their genus affiliation. Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs), isolated from chicken to date, comprise twelve serotypes classified into five virus species (FAdV-A to E). The polymerase gene sequence has been determined yet only from three <b>FAdV</b> types representing three species. In the present work, the panel of polymerase gene sequences was completed with those of the rest of FAdVs. The newly determined sequences will facilitate the identification of new <b>FAdV</b> isolates as an existing species or as a putative new <b>FAdV.</b> Once the polymerase sequence is known, more specific PCRs for the amplification of the hexon and other genes can be designed and performed according to the preliminary species classification...|$|E

In this study, real-time PCR and subsequent high-resolution melting (HRM) -curve analysis of three regions of the hexon gene were developed and assessed for their potential in differentiating 12 <b>FAdV</b> reference serotypes. The results were compared to previously described PCR and restriction enzyme analyses of the hexon gene. Both HRM-curve analysis of a 191 -bp region of the hexon gene and restriction enzyme analysis failed to distinguish a number of serotypes used in this study. In addition, PCR of the region spanning nucleotides (nt) 144 to 1040 failed to amplify FAdV- 5 in sufficient quantities for further analysis. However, HRM-curve analysis of the region spanning nt 301 to 890 proved a sensitive and specific method of differentiating all 12 serotypes. All melt curves were highly reproducible, and replicates of each serotype were correctly genotyped with a mean confidence value of more than 99 % using normalized HRM curves. Sequencing analysis revealed that each profile was related to a unique sequence, with some sequences sharing greater than 94 % identity. Melting-curve profiles {{were found to be}} related mainly to GC composition and distribution throughout the amplicons, regardless of sequence identity.

The pathogenicity test showed that mortality for chickens infected with HBQ 12 and JSJ 13 within 21 days post infection (dpi) was 8. 6 % and 28. 6 %, respectively. Necropsy displayed mild or severe hepatitis and hydropericardium at 3 and 5 dpi as well as dead chickens. Viral DNA was detected in almost all tissues sampled from dead chickens.

A substantial variation {{in the degree of}} susceptibility was observed with mortalities of 100 and 96 % in the FAdV-E and D infected SPF broiler groups, respectively, whereas in the groups of infected SPF layers mortalities of only 20 and 8 % were noticed. Significant changes in clinical chemistry analytes of all infected birds together with histopathological lesions indicated impairment of liver and pancreas integrity and functions. Furthermore, significantly lower blood glucose concentrations were recorded at peak of infection in both inoculated SPF broiler groups, in comparison to the control group, corresponding to a hypoglycaemic status. High viral loads were determined in liver and pancreas of SPF broilers already at 4  days post-infection (dpi), in comparison to SPF layers, indicating a somewhat faster viral replication in the target organs. Overall, highest values were noticed in the pancreas of SPF broilers independent of the virus used for infection. The actual study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of IBH, a disease evolving to a metabolic disorder, to which SPF broilers were highly susceptible.

40|$|Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) are a {{potential}} alternative to human adenovirus-based vaccine vectors. Our previous studies demon-strated that a 2. 4 -kb region {{at the left}} end of the FAdV- 9 genome is nonessential for virus replication and is suitable for the inser-tion or replacement of transgenes. Our in vivo study showed that the virus FAdV- 94, lacking six open reading frames (ORFs) at the left end of its genome, replicates less efficiently than wild-type FAdV- 9 (wtFAdV- 9) in chickens that were infected intramus-cularly. However, the fecal-oral route is the natural route of <b>FAdV</b> infection, and the oral administration of a vaccine confers some advantages compared to administration through other routes, especially when developing an adenovirus as a vaccine vec-tor. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of FAdV- 9 in orally inoculated chickens. In the present study, we orally inocu-lated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens with FAdV- 9 and FAdV- 94 and assessed virus shedding, antibody response, and viral genome copy number and cytokine gene expression in tissues. Our data showed that FAdV- 94 replicated less efficiently than did wtFAdV- 9, as evidenced by reduced virus shedding in feces, lower viral genome copy number in tissues, and lower anti-body response, which {{are consistent with the}} results of the intramuscular route of immunization. Furthermore, we found that both wtFAdV- 9 and FAdV- 94 upregulated the mRNA expression of alpha interferon (IFN-), IFN-, and interleukin- 12 (IL- 12).

40|$|Hydropericardium {{syndrome}} (HPS) is a {{viral disease}} of poultry {{which is caused}} by Fowl adenovirus (<b>FAdV).</b> This virus belongs to family Adenoviridae and genus Aviadenovirus. In recent years, Hydropericardium syndrome (HPS) has {{emerged as one of the}} important diseases occurring in Pakistan and has caused heavy economic loss. Efforts have been made to develop conventional vaccines against this disease. These vaccines were formulated from infected liver homogenate. Unfortunately, formalin-inactivated liver organ vaccines failed to protect the poultry industry in the country. Hence, there is a need to develop a suitable vaccine to combat this disease. Currently, recombinant vaccine candidates are being developed for the prevention and control of some infectious diseases in several laboratories elsewhere. The present work is an effort to develop a recombinant protein, using molecular biology, biotechnological and immunological approaches for effective control and diagnosis of HPS. In the present study, the viral particle was isolated from natural outbreak of Hydropericardium syndrome in broilers, Punjab province of Pakistan using conventional methods. The existence of the virus was initially observed by Scanning Electron Microscopic examination. Icosahedral shaped viral particles of 70 â€“ 80 nm in diameter were observed. Further, the presence of <b>FAdV</b> was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) by amplification of 730 bp variable region (L 1 and part of P 1 loop) of hexon gene. DNA sequence analysis and Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR product revealed that isolate is closely related with Indian fowl adenovirus â€“ 4 isolate. To investigate which gene product encoded by fowl adenovirus plays vital role in immune response against the disease, two genes representing structural proteins of the virus (Penton base & short fiber) and one gene representing non structural protein (100 K) were selected to develop recombinant constructs. To achieve this, the Penton base (1587 bp), Short fiber (1437 bp) and 100 K (2397 bp) genes were amplified by PCR and cloned in an expression vector (pET 28 a). The histidine residues along with thrombin protease site were engineered upstream to inserts (viral genes). The presence of recombinant DNA fragments were confirmed by double digestion method, PCR amplification of insert using gene specific primers and DNA sequencing of the inserts. Nucleotide sequences of inserts revealed that two genes (Penton base and Short fiber) of local isolate have > 98 % homology with the Indian FAdV- 4 isolates, while one gene (100 K) has 96 % homology with the Russian FAdV- 10 isolate. The recombinant constructs were expressed in E. coli. The expression of recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of histidine tagged recombinant proteins i. e. short fiber (60 Kda), penton base (65 Kda) and 100 K (95 Kda) using anti His tag antibody. The three recombinant proteins were purified by Nickle affinity chromatography. The biological and immunological activity of recombinant proteins were assessed for potential use as antigen in vaccine and diagnostic (ELISA). The purified recombinant proteins were adjuvanted separately with Freundâ€™s complete adjuvant and broilers were immunized. ELISA test was performed and antibody titers were determined against the respective recombinant proteins. The results indicated that protein constructs pSMJ- 2 (penton base) and pSMJ- 3 (short fiber) are more immunogenic antigens as compared to protein construct pSMJ- 1 (100 K) and commercial vaccine. Challenge protection test also proved that penton base (pSMJ- 2) and short fiber (pSMJ- 3) protein constructs conferred 90 % and 80 % protection respectively against pathogenic virus challenge. Whereas 100 K (pSMJ- 1) protein construct and commercial inactivated vaccine provided 50 % and 70 % protection respectively. The results obtained by ELISA and challenge test in this study indicated that the constructed recombinant proteins are suitable candidates to develop subunit vacci...|$|E
