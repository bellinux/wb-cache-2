5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view {{is different from that}} of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E

50|$|Scalability {{can also}} <b>be</b> {{achieved}} by <b>combining</b> separate laser beams. Completely independent beams cannot usually <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> {{to produce a}} beam with higher radiance than each beam has alone.

5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Shulgin says in {{his book}} PiHKAL, that he didn't observe any effects from 1600 mg phenethylamine alone. Also, Dr. Duke's Phyto{{chemical}} and Ethnobotanical Databases record on Theobroma cacao beans measure 5600 ppm (5.6 mg/g) phenylalanine, the chemical precursor to phenylethylamine. R.

5|$|Among the {{agricultural}} activities practised {{during the dry}} season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.|$|E
50|$|In 1861 part of Watauga County <b>was</b> <b>combined</b> with {{parts of}} Burke, Caldwell, McDowell, and Yancey {{counties}} to form Mitchell County.

Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds.

5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect {{that provides a}} small variation in pitch while a note is being played, and a chorus effect where a note's sound <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E
5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E

5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is {{the song of the}} golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
5|$|The dish is {{traditionally}} held to have originated {{from the village}} of Mousehole in Cornwall and {{is traditionally}} eaten during the festival of Tom Bawcock's Eve to celebrate his heroic catch during a very stormy winter. According to the modern festival, which <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> with the Mousehole village illuminations, the entire catch was baked into a huge stargazy pie, encompassing seven types of fish and saving the village from starvation. The story of Bawcock was popularised by Antonia Barber's children's book The Mousehole Cat, which featured the star-gazy pie. In 2007 contestant Mark Hix won the BBC's Great British Menu with a variant of the dish.|$|E

5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} excimer lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas <b>is</b> <b>combined</b> with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.|$|E

The sub-surface station and the deep-level station ticket halls are linked via the ticket hall under the mainline station, but not to each other directly. Entrances are on Praed Street and from within the mainline station.
