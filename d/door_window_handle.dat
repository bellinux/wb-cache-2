Today the wood is perfectly used in handmade artwork and for producing some parts of musical instruments (for example, grand piano keys, necks, string holders and tripods for instruments), turnery (including chess pieces), knife hafts, brush holders and chopsticks.

5000|$|When {{launching}} the M24 Volga, GAZ envisioned an average, for the USSR, production run of a decade. The newer designs were produced by smaller numbers due to development of other {{projects in the}} Soviet automotive industry, in particular the coming about of the VAZ plant and a much bigger Moskvitch, the project 3-5, to replace the 408 and 412 series. The latter's being more economic would have proved a natural relieve the Volga of its traditional taxi role, leaving GAZ's new vehicle as a more exclusive personal luxury car for the mid-range Soviet nomenklatura. With this in mind, the vehicle's mock-up demonstrated in 1976was to grow in size, have the V6 powerplant as standard, and a perspective 4.2 litre V8 optional with many other features of the contemporary foreign cars of the 1970s. In 1976-7, the new GAZ-3101 appeared in prototype form, but it {{was little more than}} [...] "a cosmetic tart-up of the mainstream Volga", with new front <b>door</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and lights; it also got longer front overhang and longer trunk. This would be renamed the 3102 in time. A few were built with a [...] V8 as the 31011, but this never entered serial production, nor did the continuing GAZ-desired V6 model. (Among its standard features were a fire extinguisher.) It was powered by a twelve-valve version (ZMZ 402.10) of the venerable [...] inline four with electronic ignition, producing , enough for 94 mph. Disk brakes were fitted in front, while the rear drums were equipped with a crude antiskid system.|$|R

In 1837, a dam was built across the Kennebec where the falls drop 15 {{feet at the}} head of tide. By 1838, 10 sawmills were contracted. With the arrival of the Kennebec & Portland Railroad in 1851, Augusta became an even more productive mill town. In 1883, the property of A. & W. Sprague Company was purchased by the Edwards Manufacturing Company, which erected extensive brick mills for manufacturing cotton textiles. In the late 19th century, a paper and pulp plant was constructed. Other Augusta firms produced lumber, sash, <b>doors,</b> <b>window</b> shutters, broom <b>handles,</b> stone cutters' tools, shoes, headstones, ice and furniture. The city developed as a publishing and shipping center. Today, government and post-secondary education are important businesses.|$|R
40|$|DNA is {{nowadays}} swabbed routinely {{to investigate}} serious and volume crimes, but research remains scarce {{when it comes}} to determining the criteria that may impact the success rate of DNA swabs taken on different surfaces and situations. To investigate these criteria in fully operational conditions, DNA analysis results of 4772 swabs taken by the forensic unit of a police department in Western Switzerland over a 2. 5 -year period (2012 - 2014) in volume crime cases were considered. A representative and random sample of 1236 swab analyses was extensively examined and codified, describing several criteria such as whether the swabbing was performed at the scene or in the lab, the zone of the scene where it was performed, the kind of object or surface that was swabbed, whether the target specimen was a touch surface or a biological fluid, and whether the swab targeted a single surface or combined different surfaces. The impact of each criterion and of their combination was assessed in regard to the success rate of DNA analysis, measured through the quality of the resulting profile, and whether the profile resulted in a hit in the national database or not. Results show that some situations - such as swabs taken on <b>door</b> and <b>window</b> <b>handles</b> for instance - have a higher success rate than average swabs. Conversely, other situations lead to a marked decrease in the success rate, which should discourage further analyses of such swabs. Results also confirm that targeting a DNA swab on a single surface is preferable to swabbing different surfaces with the intent to aggregate cells deposited by the offender. Such results assist in predicting the chance that the analysis of a swab taken in a given situation will lead to a positive result. The study could therefore inform an evidence-based approach to decision-making at the crime scene (what to swab or not) and at the triage step (what to analyse or not), contributing thus to save resource and increase the efficiency of forensic science efforts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fomites are {{inanimate objects}} that {{serve in the}} spread of {{infectious}} disease. Our hypothesis was that door handles may aid in the spread of microbes between individuals and {{that they may be}} a reservoir of microbial contamination. In our experiments, we assessed the prevalence of specifically the Gram negative bacteria that were found on door handles of Olin Hall. It was hypothesized that during times where the building was near its peak usage, a larger percentage of the bacteria sampled from the door handles of Olin Hall would be Gram negative. The results showed that of total microbial colonies observed, 49 % were Gram negative bacteria. Further statistical analysis revealed an interesting observation and the data showed differences in prevalence of Gram negative bacteria found on individual doors. Introduction: The spread of infectious diseases through hand contact has been an area of major concern. According to a study conducted by Itah et al, Gram (+) Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram (-) enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Citrobacter species, was found to contaminate various contact surfaces including chairs, tables, <b>windows,</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and many other common household fixtures (Itah 2004) ...|$|R
