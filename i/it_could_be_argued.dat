5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|One {{commonly}} held misconception connected to Dyer {{is that he}} holds the second longest unbeaten record of fights of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information was published in Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912. Although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss. This therefore challenges Fleischer's claim.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
25|$|After this {{decision}} <b>it</b> <b>could</b> plausibly <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the overall}} ban on translations announced in the encyclicals of 1836 and 1839 {{was no longer in}} force.|$|R

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> (as, for example, Justice Breyer has) that constitutions {{are meant}} to endure over time, {{and in order to}} do so, their {{interpretation}} must therefore be more flexible and responsive to changing circumstances than the amendment process.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of Mike Gascoyne as {{technical}} director, alongside the announcements of Jarno Trulli and Ralf Schumacher for 2005, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the Toyota F1 operation took on a slightly different feel {{over the course of}} the 2004 season.|$|E
50|$|Watchmen: The {{character}} of Silk Spectre II, Laurie Juspeczyk, is partially based on Nightshade, though <b>it</b> <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the {{character of}} Silhouette had more of her visual style.|$|R
5000|$|The {{book was}} adapted into an Emmy award winning miniseries also called The Corner. Simon {{served as the}} show's writer and {{executive}} producer. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that this book serves as an inspiration for the TV series [...] "The Wire".|$|R
50|$|But, in this case, the Court {{held that}} Sony {{did not have}} actual {{knowledge}} of the infringing activities of its customers. At the most <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argues</b> that Sony had constructive knowledge {{of the fact that}} “its customers may use that equipment to make unauthorised copies of copyrighted material.” The court then relied on the “staple article of commerce” doctrine of patent law and applied it to copyrights. The 'staple article of commerce' defence is available under Patent law in the United States and it lays down that when an infringing article is capable of 'substantial non infringing uses', it would become a 'staple article of commerce' and therefore, not attract any liability for infringement.|$|R
25|$|Afterwards another truce was {{concluded}} between Holland and the Frisians, which was extended {{again and again}} without many difficulties. No acts of war were undertaken anymore, although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that a warlike state continued to exist for over a century, until, in 1524, Holland and Friesland both came under Habsburg rule.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Grossman {{has written}} that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be {{considered}} to have an Erdős number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day. Erdős numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.|$|E
25|$|During his tenure, Sánchez Vilella {{tried to}} change his party's membership, urging a younger {{generation}} to rise in the friends party's organization. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Sánchez Vilella {{was influenced by the}} youth movement that the island was experiencing countrywide during the 1960s, a period where many social areas in Puerto Rico, including television, music and sports, were being introduced to fresh, younger personalities.|$|E
50|$|The cave {{system is}} {{disposed}} {{more or less}} in a level plane and consists of four interconnected caverns. Two of these caverns are further subdivided by 'walls' composed of dripstone, and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> thus <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Karaca comprises not four but six chambers.|$|R
50|$|Overpopulation, {{immigration}} and imperialism (of both the militaristic and cultural kind) are reasons {{that have been}} suggested to explain any such decline. However, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that {{with the advent of}} globalism, a decline in cultural diversity is inevitable because information sharing often promotes homogeneity.|$|R

25|$|A seventh step {{could in}} {{principle}} be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system. In that case, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> the false masks are torn off, {{and people have}} to stand up for what they really are, and what they really believe in. But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in Das Kapital.|$|E
25|$|Lankester {{therefore}} had a {{far better}} education than most English biologists of the previous generation, such as Huxley, Wallace and Bates. Even so, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the influence of his father Edwin {{and his friends were}} just as important. Huxley was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met Hooker, Henfrey, Clifford, Gosse, Owen, Forbes, Carpenter, Lyell, Murchison, Henslow and Darwin.|$|E
25|$|Space {{manufacturing}} {{could enable}} self-replication. Some think it {{the ultimate goal}} because it allows an exponential increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of self-replication. Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as integrated circuits, medicines, genetic material and tools.|$|E
50|$|Schottky's {{contributions}} in surface science/emission electronics and in semiconductor-device theory now form {{a significant and}} pervasive part of the background to these subjects. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that - perhaps {{because they are in}} the area of technical physics - they are not as generally well recognized as they ought to be.|$|R
50|$|Rӧmerstadt {{failed to}} achieve its socialist, utopian goals mainly due to the {{hyperinflation}} of the 1920s, {{which led to a}} prohibitive power prices. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that <b>it</b> failed to truly consider the working class. Despite this, as a concept and achievement it was unique and has left a planning legacy worth remembering.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the first objection, the court declared that since the Fifteenth Amendment had been accepted as valid for more than fifty years, and dealt with a similar matter (in this case, that voting rights <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> denied on account of race), <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the new amendment was invalid due to its subject matter.|$|R
25|$|But {{discrimination}} {{was perhaps}} less overt than such events suggest. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that some politicians and publicists may have promoted and disseminated controversial ideologies through popular {{books such as}} H. Glynn-Ward’s 1921 The Writing on the Wall and Tom MacInnes’s 1929 The Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. Newspapermen such as L. D. Taylor of the Vancouver World and General Victor Odlum of the Star generated a glut of editorials analyzing and warning about the “Oriental Menace,” as did Danger: The Anti-Asiatic Weekly.|$|E
25|$|West Frisian: Frysk-Hollânske oarloggen), were {{a series}} of short medieval wars (ranging from single battles to entire campaigns) {{consisting}} of the attempts made by the counts of Holland to conquer the free Frisian territories, which lay {{to the north and}} east of their domain. These wars were waged off and on from 1256 to 1289, 1296 to 1299, and from 1345 to 1422, although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that a state of war continued to exist between the County of Holland and the Frisian territories till well after the year 1500.|$|E
25|$|Johns' {{breakthrough}} move, {{which was}} to inform much later work by others, was to appropriate popular iconography for painting, thus allowing a set of familiar associations to answer the need for subject. Though the abstract expressionists disdained subject matter, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that in the end, they had simply changed subjects. Johns neutralized the subject, so that something like a pure painted surface could declare itself. For twenty years after Johns painted Flag, the surface could suffice – for example, in Andy Warhol's silkscreens, or in Robert Irwin's illuminated ambient works.|$|E
50|$|Some {{might suggest}} adherents of worm {{theology}} have inner wounds {{that they are}} not necessarily aware of, and such a belief just matches what they feel about themselves and sometimes others. On the other hand, God detests sin so much because it separates us from Himself; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> then <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that in our sin we are as worms in God's sight.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{distinction}} between the categories can be seen as artificial since any given cognitive task may entail a number of processes. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> even <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that any attempt to nicely categorize cognitive processes into clean, cut-and-dried classifications undermines the holistic, highly connective and interrelated nature of cognition. This is a criticism that can be directed at taxonomies of mental processes in general.|$|R

25|$|In Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are parodied as Bravd and the Weasel. Although Ankh-Morpork bears {{more than}} a passing {{resemblance}} to Lankhmar, Pratchett, known for the use of pastiche in his early works, has been quoted as not intending a direct takeoff. Some of the features of similarity (e.g. a thieves' guild, and a general air of degeneracy) may instead be common tropes of fantasy literature, although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> {{especially in the case of}} the thieves' guild, that many of the tropes in question originated with Leiber.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there were}} a number of {{objections}} to these proposals, amongst them from Strathclyde Bus Holdings, who <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> did so out of fear of their profit margins being affected by such an initiative. This necessitated a public inquiry, which lasted around 10 weeks. The Parliamentary Commissioners appointed to deliberate on the matter met and discussed the conclusions of this inquiry in a matter of hours before finding in favour of the objections raised thus killing off the Strathclyde Tram Project. The reasoning of the Commissioners is unknown as there existed no obligation for them to reveal it.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that at his peak, Fulci's {{fame and}} {{popularity}} {{were on a}} par with that of Dario Argento, another famous Italian horror film director whom Fulci had avoided working with as a result of Fulci publicly criticizing Argento from time to time. Fulci was most likely resentful of Argento since Argento had always received critical acclaim and recognition in Italy and abroad, whereas Fulci had been regarded there as something of a horror film hack. Fulci always joked that when he died, the Italian newspapers would all misspell his name, if they even mentioned him at all.|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> of course, that zu Hause is {{literally}} [...] "to house," [...] and that translating it [...] "at home" [...] effectively renders {{the two words}} not as two words but as a coherent idiom.
