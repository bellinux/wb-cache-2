25|$|Industrial {{agriculture}} {{also produces}} undesirable environmental effects. Large scale growing operations of commodity crops {{rely on the}} use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Modified corn is a greedy plant that consumes more fertilizer that any other crop. Without either of these, the soil alone could not have supported the large number of hybrid corn plants that helped America’s food industry explode. The production of both synthetic pesticides and fertilizers requires the use of natural gas and petroleum. Currently, it is relatively inexpensive to produce fertilizers and pesticides in this fashion, since the product is efficient and can be produced in huge quantities. Petrochemical fertilizers are preferred over sustainable options (manure) for these reasons. Fossil fuels are also crucial for transportation of product, manufacturing, and for running tractors and <b>harvesting</b> <b>equipment.</b> It is estimated that every bushel of corn requires the equivalent of between one quarter and one third of a U.S. gallon of petroleum to grow (37 to 50 liters per metric ton). For every acre of corn, about 50 U.S. gallons of petroleum are needed (470 L/ha). The use of fossil fuel in farming is standard; without this relatively affordable and convenient fuel source aiding in the fertilization, pest resistance, harvesting and manufacturing corn crops would not meet a high enough yield to satisfy the needs of the farmer or the demands of the consumer.|$|E

It incorporates crop residues, solid manures, limestone and commercial fertilisers along with oxygen.

It erases wheel tracks and ruts caused by <b>harvesting</b> <b>equipment.</b> It controls many perennial weeds and pushes back the growth of other weeds until the following spring. It accelerates soil warming and water evaporation in spring because of the lesser quantity of residues on the soil surface. It facilitates seeding with a lighter seeder. It controls many enemies of crops (slugs, crane flies, seedcorn maggots-bean seed flies, borers). It increases the number of [...] "soil-eating" [...] earthworms (endogea) but is detrimental to vertical-dwelling earthworms (anecic).|$|E

The main {{goal of this}} research was to evaluate performance parameters of fresh tomato <b>harvesting</b> aid <b>equipment</b> and compare it to traditional harvest, in the state of São Paulo.
