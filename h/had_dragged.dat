5|$|In {{the first}} few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was {{responsible}} for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E

5|$|It {{was late}} on 1 August when the British fleet {{appeared}} in the bay, and the French were at anchor in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack {{the head of the}} French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift down the line, while preventing the French rear from reinforcing the van and centre. Bellerophon was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards the French centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error {{on the part of the}} crew or because the anchor <b>had</b> <b>dragged,</b> Bellerophon came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun Orient.|$|E
5|$|While abbot, Foliot {{supervised}} {{the acquisition of}} a dependent priory {{in the city of}} Hereford for the monastery. Most of the abbey buildings predate Foliot's time as abbot, and there is no sure evidence of any buildings he added to the monastery. During his abbacy, a dispute that <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> on between Gloucester and the Archdiocese of York over some manors was finally settled in Gloucester's favour. This was done with a group of forged charters that Foliot may have helped to create. Forging charters was a common practice in English monasteries of the time. Foliot also had disputes with the Welsh bishop Uhtred, Bishop of Llandaff, over Goldcliff Priory and a church in Llancarfan, concerning tithes and new chapels that had been built without Gloucester Abbey's permission.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sudden}} and {{unexpected}} death of Carneiro Leão in September 1856, his cabinet only {{managed to survive}} him by a few months. The Emperor, although critical {{of the way the}} Conciliation had been implemented, had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue. PedroII's support gave the Conciliation another chance, and allowed Paranhos to return to government once more as Foreign Minister on 12 December 1858. The most pressing issue facing Paranhos was the Paraguayan government's persistent refusal to allow Brazilian ships access to Mato Grosso province. At that time, the best and fastest way to reach that distant Brazilian province was to travel via the Atlantic and from there up the rivers which flow between the nations south of Brazil. One of the reasons for Brazil's war against Argentina in 1851 was to assure the free passage of its ships. The crisis between Brazil and Paraguay <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> on since Paranhos's tenure as Foreign Minister in Carneiro Leão's cabinet. On 12 February 1858, Paranhos signed a treaty with Paraguay which allowed Brazilian ships unrestricted navigation of Paraguayan rivers. This prevented the outbreak of war—or at least deferred the conflict until 1864.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Bartholomew, the Archbishop of Tours, {{after the}} papacy {{agreed to allow}} the consecration. This {{permission}} was secured by {{the intervention of the}} king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support {{as part of an effort}} to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.|$|E

The vessel was described to have been carried away up on the beach and left there high and dry by the receding tide. She was found so far away from water that it would be necessary to dig a channel especially for her to be launched by means of towing power.|$|E

In June 2010 he was ordered to pay RSD3.3 million based upon the interest on the original loan. In the end, the verdict stated he owed the bank RSD2.9 million.

25|$|Over {{the next}} year, Newlywed and Days wore down Password. CBS daytime head Fred Silverman, {{who was not}} a {{personal}} fan of the genre, had seen enough by Spring 1967 and decided to cancel Password. The cancellation occurred after squabbles over where the show would be taped (New York City or Hollywood). Silverman wanted the show permanently moved to CBS Television City (where it was moved for part of the 1966–1967 season to allow the show to tape in color, as CBS' New York studios <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> out its full switch to colorization). Host Ludden had moved to California at that time, and commuted back to New York for {{the last part of the}} 1966–1967 season. During that season, Bern Bennett and Lee Vines (who replaced Jack Clark as primary announcer) shared West Coast announcing duties, and when the show returned to New York, Vines made the commute as well.|$|E
25|$|Allan Border {{would have}} still {{held out a}} faint hope of victory {{on the morning of}} day five, but it seemed unlikely. Fraser failed to add to his {{overnight}} score and was run out for 12 soon after the resumption. Emburey and Graham Dilley added 30 for the ninth wicket, much to the frustration of the Australians before Emburey fell for a well made 26 to a sharp chance taken by David Boon off Lawson. If the ninth wicket stand of 30 had frustrated the Australian bowlers the 10th wicket partnership of 27 between Dilley and Paul Jarvis was just annoying, and made an Australian victory all but impossible. Alderman finally trapped Jarivs LBW with what was fast becoming his trademark of the series, the inswinging yorker, but England had struggled to 242, which although a disappointing score, <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> out their innings long enough to avoid the follow-on and not leave the Australians with enough time for victory.|$|E
25|$|Maloney {{left the}} club {{at the end}} of the 2002 season but his {{replacement}} proved to be a key in Glory finally getting that elusive title. German midfielder Andre Gumprecht was brought into the club thanks to Stange and made an instant impact. With the NSL disintegrating around them, Glory and Olympic were the only two semi-decent teams still left in the league to galvanise their midfield and fought it out for top spot all season. Glory missed out on the league title, finishing one point behind Olympic. In March 2003, the NSL stripped the club of three points after ruling that Gumprecht had been played before he had been registered. Glory picked up Socceroo Simon Colosimo halfway through the season and eventually won the right to host the 2003 Grand Final after coming out on top of a new, confusing and convoluted league table finals format that <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> a poor season out. In the Grand Final Glory took the game to Olympic and following a headed goal from in the first half from Harnwell it was all over late in the match when Mori saw his shot dribble over the line in dramatic fashion. 2–0 was the end result and d'Avray had delivered the Grand Final victory Glory had yearned for.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October, Fromentin's two {{divisions}} {{on the left}} flank and Balland's division in the center skirmished all day. Bellegarde and Clefayt held {{the bulk of their}} strength in their main positions. Jourdan mounted the main French assault against the height of Wattignies in three columns from Dimont, Dimechaux and Choisies. The main attack was also supported by additional artillery. When an early morning fog lifted in mid-morning, the French artillery opened a barrage on Wattignies. Duquesnoy's division formed the two right columns while Jourdan's detachment made up the left column. After being driven back twice by heavy fire, the French columns forced their way into Wattignies in the early afternoon. A counterattack from the northwest briefly pushed back the French, who were rallied by Jourdan. More French troops came up and defeated the Austrian attack. Duquesnoy sent Gratien's brigade forward but it was caught by Austrian cavalry in the open and thrown back. By this time, the French <b>had</b> <b>dragged</b> a battery up to the Wattignies heights to support the infantry. Under pressure from infantry and artillery, Terzi's division recoiled to the north. On the right of Duquesnoy, Beauregard's division attacked Obrechies, which was defended by Hadik with two battalions of regulars and eight squadrons of cavalry. As the French began breaking into the village, Hadik launched attacks from three directions at once, routing Beauregard's men. The French abandoned five cannon and fled back to Solrinnes. According to one observer, they did not stop until they reached Solre-le-Château.|$|E
