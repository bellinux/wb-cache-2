5|$|The {{largest and}} most {{influential}} recording label of the time, The Victor Talking Machine (RCA Victor after 1928) was a restraining influence {{on the development of}} “sweet jazz” until the departure of Eddie King in October 1926. King was well known as an authoritarian who would not permit drinking on the job or severe departure from the written music, unless within solos acceptable by popular music standards of the time. This irritated many Victor jazz artists, including famed trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke. Sudhalter, in Lost Chords, cites an example of a 1927 recording by the Goldkette Orchestra in which musicians were allowed considerable freedom, and remarks “What, one wonders, would this performance <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> Eddie King had been in charge, and not the more liberal Nat Shilkret. Since the Victor ledgers show no less than five recording sessions in January and February 1926, when King actually conducted Goldkette’s Orchestra, comparison between the approach of Goldkette and King is readily available.|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

25|$|They {{looked at}} the case as a murder, with the {{burglary}} staged to throw the police off the trail. Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view atop her dresser and had not been touched. The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed.

While his commitments outside of cricket limited the number of games he played he was a key member of the very strong Yorkshire sides who won 6 county championships during his career (although this did include 1901 when Jackson did not appear in the county championship). His performances in 1896 and 1898 in particular showed what his statistics could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> he had been able to dedicate more time, scoring over 1,000 championship runs at better than 40.00 in each season and taking over 100 wickets across the two seasons at an average of under 20.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} Master, it is {{revealed}} {{that while the}} Seventh Doctor is Time's Champion, the Master is Death's. This {{is a result of}} an incident in their youth, where the Doctor killed a school bully who was trying to drown the Master; unable to cope with his guilt and grief, the child who would become the Doctor accepted a deal with Death (personified as a woman) to take away his pain, unaware that this would result in her erasing his memory of committing the crime and transferring it to the Master. Temporarily restored to the person he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> Death had not marked him, the Master forgives the Doctor for this, understanding that the adult cannot be blamed for the actions of the child that did not foresee the consequences of his actions, but {{the end of the play}} implies that the Master will once again become Death's servant.|$|E
25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected to Deck being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for shackling Deck would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of shackling Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards to the courtroom, and having the {{people who wanted to}} sit in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during voir dire. Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if the shackles biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} a person {{awaiting}} trial has a valid reason, protected under the due process clause, to refuse antipsychotic drugs, referencing Washington v. Harper (1990) and Bell v. Wolfish (1979). Therefore, once Riggins' requested termination of the medication, the State was obligated to establish both {{the need for the}} antipsychotic drug and its medical appropriateness for Riggins' safety and that of others as the less restrictive alternative available. If the state had done this, due process would have been satisfied. The State {{might have been able to}} justify the treatment, if medically appropriate, if it set forth that the adjudication of guilt or innocence could not be established by using less intrusive means. Since the trial court did not do this and allowed the drug's administration to continue without making any of the determinations stated above, it is very likely that this error violated Riggins' trial rights established by the Constitution. However, this is only speculative as there is no way to know what the outcome would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> the proper course had been followed.|$|E

25|$|The {{spending}} saw a good return, with Chelsea finishing as Premiership runners-up (their best league finish for 49 years) {{and reaching}} the Champions League semi-finals after dramatically beating Arsenal in the quarter-finals. But Ranieri {{may have been}} sacked because of some bizarre tactical decisions in the semi-final loss against Monaco (for example, switching central midfielder Scott Parker to right-back and right-back Glen Johnson to centre-back to accommodate more attackers in the team) and for ending the season trophyless. Nevertheless, Ranieri was given a hero's send-off in his final match in charge. That match also gave Chelsea fans {{a glimpse of what}} could easily <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> not for Abramovich's takeover, as Chelsea handily beat Leeds United, who were relegated, managerless, virtually bankrupt and seemingly destined for oblivion. In Ranieri's place, Abramovich recruited José Mourinho (who had lifted two Portuguese league titles, a Portuguese Cup, a Champions League title and a UEFA Cup with Porto) as the club's new manager. Abramovich also brought legendary Dutch scout Piet de Visser, who scouted Ronaldo and Romário for PSV, and {{is considered one of the}} greatest scouts in history.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, SF Line {{asked for}} tenders from various shipyards {{around the world}} for {{construction}} of a 1,700-passenger, 540-car ferry. The cheapest bid, 80 million Finnish markka (20 million United States dollar by exchange rates of the time), was made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan who outbid the Finnish Wärtsilä shipyard by 36 million markka. On 13 September 1977, SF Line signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for construction of a ferry. However, the funding of the project was subject to approval by the Bank of Finland and as at the time the employment level in Finland's shipyards was low, the Bank of Finland decided not to grant its approval to the project's funding with hopes of forcing the company to order a ship from a Finnish shipyard. After prolonged negotiations between both SF Line and the Bank of Finland as well as SF Line and Wärtsilä, SF Line placed an order with Wärtsilä on 17 March 1978. In the end the cost of the ship from Wärtsilä was approximately 15% more expensive than it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> built by Mitsubishi, despite a subvention of 17 million markka from the Bank of Finland.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, the Boheman affair {{caused a}} severe {{conflict}} between Gustav IV Adolf and the ducal couple. The mystic Karl Adolf Boheman (1764–1831) {{had been introduced}} to the couple by Count Magnus Stenbock in 1793 and gained great influence by promising to reveal scientific secrets about the occult. Boheman inducted them into a secret society Yellow Rose (society) in 1801, where both sexes where accepted as members, and to which the Counts and Countesses Ruuth and Brahe {{as well as the}} mother of the queen were introduced. Boheman was arrested upon an attempt to recruit the monarch, who accused him of revolutionary agendas and expelled him. The ducal couple were exposed in an informal investigation by the monarch, and the duchess was questioned {{in the presence of the}} royal council. In 1808, he was again chief commander during Gustav IV Adolf's stay in Finland. He is presumed to <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>if</b> not involved, so aware of the plans to depose Gustav IV Adolf in 1809. He kept passive during the Coup of 1809, and accepted the post of regent by the victorious party after having assured himself of the deposed monarch was not in mortal danger. He was initially not willing to accept the crown, however, out of consideration of the former king's son.|$|E
