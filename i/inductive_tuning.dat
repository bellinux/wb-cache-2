UWB oscillators that should achieve very wide tuning range along with low phase noise performance. Wideband (Ultra Wideband) oscillators {{can be realized}} by carefully designing passive and active devices. The techniques for sizing and layout design of active and passive elements are discussed to optimize the phase noise performance of oscillators. We will design and simulate CMOS VCO capable of multi-GHz and wide tuning range. The VCO {{will be based on}} <b>inductive</b> <b>tuning,</b> realized by the tunable active inductor (TAI) using CMOS technology that can provide a tuning range between 0. 5 – 2. 5 GHz using Hartley structures.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a substrate independent empirical formulation for the bridge inductance of inductively tuned RF MEMS shunt switches, allowing a systematic design approach to tune their isolation bands. <b>Inductive</b> <b>tuning</b> of RF MEMS switches {{is achieved by}} inserting recesses in the ground plane and meanders to the bridges, allowing the tuning of the isolation band of the switch from the X-band to the mm-wave band. The bridge inductance is first extracted from parametric EM simulations of the RF MEMS shunt switches and then fitted to the proposed formulations using empirical coefficients. The accuracy of the formulations is verified with the measurements on the switches that are fabricated using an in-house surface micromachining RF MEMS process on a 500 -µm thick glass substrate. Measurement results verify that the bridge inductances can {{be determined by the}} provided empirical formulation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{advances}} in SIS receiver technology {{since the last}} Asilomar meeting include: superconductor materials, integrated <b>inductive</b> <b>tuning</b> elements, and planar mounting structures. The effect of these advances is to push the upper frequency operating limit from about 600 to 1500 GHz, and to enhance the feasibility of focal plane arrays of heterodyne receivers. A fundamental high frequency operating limit of SIS mixers is set by the superconducting energy gap. A practical limitation for high frequency operation of SIS junctions is their parasitic capacitance and resistance. The performance of the mixer will be degraded by the Resistor-Capacitor rolloff. Several designs were reported for inductive elements integrated on the same substrate as the SIS junctions to tune out the bulk junction capacitance. Most millimeter SIS-based heterodyne receivers have used waveguide coupling structures. Technology has advanced to the state where programs that have a high probability of success can be defined to produce arrays of SIS receivers for frequencies as high as 1500 GHz...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the modeling and subsequent improvements of SIS waveguide mixers for the 200 - 270 and 330 - 370 GHz bands (Blundell, Carter, and Gundlach 1988, Carter et al 1991). These mixers are constructed {{for use in}} receivers on IRAM radiotelescopes on Pico Veleta (Spain, Sierra Nevada) and Plateau de Bure (French Alps), and must meet specific requirements. The standard reduced height waveguide structure with suspended stripline is first analyzed and a model is validated through comparison with scale model and working scale measurements. In the first step, the intrinsic limitations of the standard mixer structure are identified, and the parameters are optimized bearing in mind the radioastronomical applications. In the second step, <b>inductive</b> <b>tuning</b> of the junctions is introduced and optimized for minimum noise and maximum bandwidth. In the 1. 3 mm band, a DSB receiver temperature of less than 110 K (minimum 80 K) is measured from 180 through 260 GHz. In the 0. 8 mm band, a DSB receiver temperature of less than 250 K (minimum 175 K) is obtained between 325 and 355 GHz.

40|$|Communication and {{reconnaissance}} {{systems are}} requiring increasing flexibility concerning functionality and efficiency for multiband and broadband frequency applications. Circuit-based reconfiguration mechanisms continue to promote radio frequency (RF) application flexibility; however, increasing limitations {{have resulted in}} hindering performance. Therefore, {{the implementation of a}} "wireless" reconfiguration mechanism provides the required agility and amicability for microwave circuits and antennas without local overhead. The wireless reconfiguration mechanism in this thesis integrates dynamic, fluidic-based material systems to achieve electromagnetic agility and reduce the need for "wired" reconfiguration technologies. The dynamic material system component has become known as electromagnetically functionalized colloidal dispersions (EFCDs). In a microfluidic reconfiguration system, they provide electromagnetic agility by altering the colloidal volume fraction of EFCDs - their name highlights the special considerations we give to material systems in applied electromagnetics towards lowering loss and reducing system complexity. Utilizing EFCDs at the RF device-level produced the first circuit-type integration of this reconfiguration system; this is identified as the coaxial stub microfluidic impedance transformer (COSMIX). The COSMIX is a small hollowed segment of transmission line with results showing a full reactive loop (capacitive to <b>inductive</b> <b>tuning)</b> around the Smith chart over a 1. 2 GHz bandwidth. A second microfluidic application demonstrates a novel antenna reconfiguration mechanism for a 3 GHz microstrip patch antenna. Results showed a 300 MHz downward frequency shift by dielectric colloidal dispersions. Magnetic material produced a 40 MHz frequency shift. The final application demonstrates the dynamically altering microfluidic system for a 3 GHz 1 x 2 array of linearly polarized microstrip patch antennas. The parallel microfluidic capillaries were imbedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Both E- and H-plane designs showed a 250 MHz frequency shift by dielectric colloidal dispersions. Results showed a strong correlation between decreasing electrical length of the elements and an increase of the volume fraction, causing frequency to decrease and mutual coupling to increase.

40|$|The {{stability}} of high intensity beams {{has been a}} matter of some concern. While anti-proton operation uses beam currents of 10 a or less, it is sometimes useful to have proton beams with currents of the order of 1 ma and narrow (booster sized) momentum spreads. This note describes calculations of what can be expected for coasting beam instabilities and, in particular, the effect of the (high impedance) 53 MHz cavities. This note specifically does not describe transverse instabilities, bunched beam instabilities, or turbulence in the debunching process. The stability limit can be calculated using standard formulae (van der Meer CERN/PS/AA/ 80 - 4 and many others). The result of this calculation is the 'stability plot' shown in figure 1 a. This calculation assumes a 1 ma beam with a {Delta}p ({sigma}) of 2 MeV/c. The curve (allowed impedance) scales inversely with beam current and {Delta}p{sup 2 }. The momentum spread was assumed to be gaussian. Figures 1 b and 1 c are the same plot but with different scales. The interpretation of this plot is that if the impedance of any device (or devices) is outside this curve, then the assumed beam distribution is unstable. More rigorously one can make a so-called 'Nyquist plot' where one plots Z{sub w}(w) /Z{sub b}(w) where Z{sub w} is some wall impedance and Z{sub b} is the beam response (or beam impedance) shown in figure 1. These Nyquist plots are shown in figures 2 abcd for different cavity tunes. Figure 2 a shows the Nyquist plot for the 1 ma of beam assumed above assuming only 1 cavity which is tuned to resonance. The cavity has a shunt impedance of 1. 8 M{Omega} and a Q of 10, 000. The assumed beam distribution is unstable if the curve circles the point (1, 0) {approx} quite close in figure 2 a. Figure 2 b is the same except that 6 cavities are assumed. In figure 2 c the 6 cavities are tuned 100 kHz below the beam revolution frequency (capacitive). In figure 2 d they are tuned 100 kHz above (inductive). The <b>inductive</b> <b>tuning</b> is preferred, but either case should be stable. The standard theory of the {{stability of}} coasting beams indicates that the high impedance 53 MHz Debuncher cavities do not upset the stability of moderate beam currents (1 ma) and narrow momentum spreads ({sigma} = 2 Mev) provided that they are detuned...|$|E
50|$|Inductive {{systems are}} {{non-contact}} systems {{that rely on}} more than the simple {{presence or absence of}} a magnetic field to transmit a message. Inductive systems typically require a beacon or an induction loop to be installed at every signal and other intermediate locations. The inductive coil uses a changing magnetic field to transmit messages to the train. Typically, the frequency of pulses in the inductive coil are assigned different meanings. Continuous inductive systems can be made by using the running rails as one long <b>tuned</b> <b>inductive</b> loop.|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} wireless devices will {{be required}} to support a wide variety of commercial standards and operate over a wide range of frequency bands. Two examples that are already receiving a lot of attention are software-defined and cognitive radios. Therefore, components that are capable of operating over ultra-wide frequency ranges are required. Quadrature oscillators are a major component in any communication system. They are often needed in RF transceivers to support spectrally efficient modulation techniques. Furthermore, modern telecommunication standards require very low phase noise oscillators and because of their outstanding noise performance, LC-oscillators, are a popular choice. Hence, a lot of effort has been invested in studying and improving the figure of merit (FOM) of wide tuning range LC-Quadrature voltage controlled oscillators (QVCO). So far this effort has been primarily focused on three areas, expanding the tuning range, improving phase noise performance, and reducing the power consumption. Although many techniques have been proposed and used successfully in the literature, a lot of them lack sufficient theoretical analysis. First, the recently proposed, <b>inductive</b> current <b>tuning</b> methodology for expanding the tuning range of QVCO beyond capacitive tuning only is fully analyzed. In addition, a new low phase noise architecture that employs current tuning technique is proposed. The phase noise, tuning range and power consumption of two existing architectures and the proposed one are compared. The three designs are simulated and their FOMs are calculated and compared to identify the highest FOM architecture. Next, a popular architecture that is being utilized in the recent literature for the purpose of improving phase noise and expanding the tuning range, the transformer-based (T-based) oscillator, is analyzed. Linear time variant analysis is used to derive a new 1 /f 2 phase noise expression for the T-based oscillators that is distinct from the commonly used expression for the inductor-based (L-based) oscillators. The new analysis allows for new techniques to optimize the FOM of T-based oscillators through improving the phase noise performance. An oscillator that is implemented in a commercially available 130 nm technology is used to demonstrate these techniques. Finally, the FOM of an optimized QVCO that combines the use of transformer and <b>inductive</b> current <b>tuning</b> is compared to an inductively tuned L-based QVCO. In addition to the higher FOM, T-based QVCO proves to be more stable than L-based QVCO. A full analysis of stability and tuning range of both oscillators is presented and verified through simulations using inductor models extracted using ADS momentum...|$|R

40|$|The high {{demands on}} data {{processing}} and bandwidth in wireless/wireline communication and aerospace {{systems have been}} pushing forward circuit design techniques to their limitations to obtain maximum performances with respect to high operating frequency, low noise, small area, and low power consumption. Clock generators are essential components in numerous circuits, for instance, frequency synthesizers for high speed transceivers, clock sources for microprocessors, noise suppressed zero-delay buffers in system-on-chips (SOCs), and clock and data recovery (CDR) systems. Furthermore, clock generators are required to provide low jitter and high precision clocks in fully integrated image reject receivers and an ultra-wide tunability in time-interleaved applications. We explore several circuit design techniques and implementations of low jitter clock generator in this thesis. Firstly, a low jitter and wide range digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) operating 8 ~ 16 GHz is illustrated using a dual path digital loop filter (DLF). In order to mitigate the phase jitter in the phase detector (PD), we implement the separate loop filter and the output is not affected by the proportional path. For the stable operation, a 4 ~ 8 GHz linear phase interpolator (PI) is implemented in the proportional path. In addition, we design a low phase noise digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) using <b>inductive</b> <b>tuning</b> technique based on switched mutual coupling for wide operating range. The proposed DPLL implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology shows an outstanding figure-of-merit (FOM) over other state-of-art DPLLs in term of root mean square (RMS) and deterministic jitter (DJ). Secondly, we discuss a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) PLL using a feedback voltage-controlled oscillator (FBVCO) {{in order to reduce}} DJ due to the radiation attack on the control voltage. Different from a conventional open loop VCO, the proposed FBVCO has a negative control loop and is composed of an open loop VCO, an integrator and a switched-capacitor resistor. Since the input to output of the FBVCO has a low-pass characteristic, any disturbance on the control voltage should be filtered and cannot affect the output phase. We are able to reduce the output frequency variation approximately 75 % compared to the conventional PLL when the radiation pulse strikes on the control voltage. The proposed RHBD PLL is implemented in 130 nm and consumes 6. 2 mW at 400 MHz operating frequency. Thirdly, a novel adaptive-bandwidth PLL is illustrated to optimize the jitter performance in a wide operating frequency range. We achieve a constant ratio of bandwidth and reference frequency with a closed loop VCO and an overdamping system with a charge pump (CP) current proportional to the VCO frequency for the adaptive-bandwidth technique. The proposed adaptive-bandwidth PLL presents 0. 6 % RMS jitter over the entire frequency range from 320 MHz to 2. 56 GHz, which is 70 % smaller than the conventional fixed-bandwidth PLL. Finally, we have developed a new feedback DCO to achieve a linear gain of DCO so that the DPLL can provide stability and a wide operating range in different process variations. Due to the negative feedback loop of the proposed DCO, the feedback DCO presents a linear gain from an input digital word to an output frequency. Moreover, we can control the bandwidth of the feedback DCO to optimize the total output phase noise in DPLL. In simulation, we can obtain 17 MHz/LSB of the peak-to-peak gain of the feedback DCO, which is reduced 96 % over the conventional DCO...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of NbN/MgO/NbN tunnel junctions for use as superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixers. SIS mixers are the most sensitive heterodyne detectors in the millimeter wavelength region. Most SIS mixers use Pb alloy tunnel junction. These tunnel junctions have several {{problems associated with the}} soft nature of Pb and its low superconducting transition temperature. NbN-based tunnel junctions are being developed to overcome these difficulties. These devices are intended to be used as mixers at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. This thesis {{describes the}} fabrication process involved in making NbN junctions, and the results of measurements on these devices. The purpose of these measurements is to determine the future possibilities of NbN tunnel junctions as high-frequency mixers. The first chapter is an introduction to SIS mixers and explains how tunnel junction properties affect mixer performance. The basic theory of tunneling and mixing in SIS mixers is first presented. A description of quantum mixer theory is included in this presentation. This theory makes several interesting predictions that cannot be explained using classical theories. This is followed by a description of how real SIS tunnel junctions differ from ideal junctions. The physical origin of these differences is discussed, along with how they affect SIS mixer performance. Finally, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various superconducting materials available are discussed. The decision to develop NbN devices is based on these material properties. The second chapter describes the methods used to fabricate small-area NbN/MgO/NbN tunnel junctions. The chapter begins with a description of the various methods that have been used to deposit NbN films. Reactive magnetron sputtering is chosen as the best method for tunnel junction fabrication. Details on the vacuum systems and the methods used for depositing superconducting NbN are discussed. Next, the process used for depositing junction trilayers (NbN/MgO/NbN) is described. The probable growth mode of MgO on NbN is presented. The importance of this growth mode to the junction quality is explained in some detail. Next, standard junction processing steps are reported. The details and limitations of each step are put forth. The standard process allows for the fabrication of 1 [square micron] tunnel junctions. Finally, this chapter discusses several methods of fabaricating submicron junctions that are being pursued. The status of this work is given. The third chapter describes the characterization of NbN films and NbN/Mg 0 /NbN tunnel junctions. Film properties are described first. The correlation of these properties to deposition conditions is discussed in some detail. Next, values for the various features of the I-V characteristic are given; typical and exceptional values are noted. How these features limit mixer results is described in detail. Several important device attributes were measured using superconducting-quantum-interference-devices (SQUIDs). These attributes are the junction's specific capacitance and the film's magnetic penetration depth. The theory and results of measuring specific capacitance and penetration depth are presented. Following the SQUID results is a large section on RP testing. Mixer tests were made at 205 GHz. The receiver design used, integral <b>inductive</b> <b>tuning</b> circuit used and results are discussed. These results are well understood, with the exception of the temperature dependence of the mixer performance. Finally, measurements of the uniformity of many junctions on a single wafer are presented. The importance of junction uniformity is also described. The final chapter discusses the ultimate limits on NbN mixers, and tells what future work must be done to achieve these limits. The primary high-frequency limit on NbN junctions is the capacitance of NbN/MgO/NbN junctions. The limit imposed by the junction capacitance and circuits used to tune out this capacitance are discussed. Also, the low-frequency limits on NbN junctions are discussed. The status of submicron devices is presented. Junction area is the most immediate limitation on NbN mixer results. The possibility of using other barrier materials to increase the RC speed of NbN junctions is presented. Finally, the possibility of operating NbN junctions at temperatures above 4. 2 K is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the RL shunt damping of rotationally periodic structures {{with an array}} of regularly spaced piezoelectric patches. The technique is targeted to the damping of a specific mode with n nodal diameters. For this particular case, one {{can take advantage of the}} shape of the targeted mode to organize the piezoelectric patches as a modal filter (in parallel loops) which reduces the demand on the inductors of the <b>tuned</b> <b>inductive</b> shunt. In the case of a perfectly rotationally periodic structure, it is possible to organize 4 n piezoelectric transducers (PZT patches) in two parallel loops of 2 n patches each. In this way, the demand on the inductors is reduced by 4 n 2 as compared to independent loops, which may allow a fully passive integration of the RL shunt in a turbomachinery application. The method is first illustrated experimentally on a circular plate; it is then applied to a prototype of an industrial bladed drum. The influence of blade mistuning is investigated.

40|$|New {{materials}} and new fabrication techniques in turbomachinery lead to monolithic structures with extremely low damping {{which may be}} responsible for severe vibrations and possible high-cycle fatigue problems. To solve this, various techniques of damping enhancement are under investigation. The present work is focused on piezoelectric shunt damping. This thesis considers the RL shunt damping of rotationally periodic structures using an array of piezoelectric patches, with an application to a bladed drum representative of those used in turbomachinery. Due to the periodicity and the cyclic symmetry of the structure, the blade modes occur by families with very close resonance frequencies, and harmonic shape in the circumferential direction; the proposed RL shunt approaches take advantage of these two features. When a family of modes is targeted for damping, the piezoelectric patches are shunted independently on identical RL circuits, and tuned roughly on the average value of the resonance frequencies of the targeted modes. This independent configuration offers a damping solution effective on the whole family of modes, but it requires the use of synthetic inductors, which is a serious drawback for rotating machines. When a specific mode with n nodal diameters has been identified as critical and is targeted for damping, one can take advantage of its harmonic shape to organize the piezoelectric patches in two parallel loops. This parallel approach reduces considerably the demand on the inductors of the <b>tuned</b> <b>inductive</b> shunt, as compared to independent loops, and offers a practical solution for a fully passive integration of the inductive shunt in a rotating structure. Various methods are investigated numerically and experimentally on a cantilever beam, a bladed rail, a circular plate, and a bladed drum. The influence of blade mistuning is also investigated.

In this {{introductory}} chapter, {{we present}} the general properties of conjugated polymers for sensory and electronic applications, {{with a special}} emphasis placed on electron-deficient materials. Chapter 2. In this chapter is presented the synthesis, characterization, and applications {{of a series of}} electron-deficient poly(p-phenylene vinylene) s (PPVs) homopolymers and copolymers. Poly(p-phenylenevinylene) s containing trifluoromethyl substituted aromatic rings (CF 3 - PPVs) exhibited high photooxidative stability to give robust materials suitable for molecular electronic device applications. Chapter 3. Hyperconjugative and Inductive Perturbations in Poly(p-phenylene vinylenes) New approaches that produce high fluorescence quantum yields and also tune electron affinity of conjugated polymers are presented. Novel three-dimensional poly(phenylene vinylenes) having [2. 2. 2] bicyclic ring system were synthesized to give highly efficient solid- state fluorescence and hyperconjugative and inductive electronic perturbations. The ability of hyperconjugative and <b>inductive</b> perturbation to <b>tune</b> the polymers' sensory applications was determined by investigating the fluorescence quenching responses to electron-rich and electron-deficient analytes in solution and solid thin films. Chapter 4. High Ionization Potential Conjugated Polymers In this chapter is presented a series of poly(p-phenylene ethynylenes) (PPEs) with high ionization potentials. Their photophysical properties were investigated using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. (cont.) The ionization potentials of the polymer thin films were determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and those with the highest ionization potentials displayed high sensitivity for the detection of electron-donating aromatic compounds. The effects of sterics and electronic properties on the polymers' sensory responses were investigated by fluorescence quenching experiments in both solution and solid thin films. In addition, in some cases the excited state charge-transfer complexes (exciplexes) of the PPEs with analytes were observed. These effects provide promising opportunities for the formation of sensitive and selective chemical sensors. Chapter 5. Highly Emissive Conjugated Polymer Excimers Conjugated polymers often display a decrease of fluorescence efficiency upon aggregation {{due in large part to}} enhanced interpolymer interactions that produce weakly emissive species generally described as having excimer character. We have found that poly(phenylene ethynylene) s with fused pendant [2. 2. 2] ring structures having alkene bridges substituted with two ester groups function to give highly emissive, broad, and red-shifted emission spectra in the solid state. To best understand the origin of this new solid-state emissive species, we have performed photophysical studies of a series of different materials in solution, spin-coated thin films, solid solutions, and Langmuir films. We conclude that the new, red-shifted, emissive species originate from excimers produced by interchain interactions being mediated by the particular [2. 2. 2] ring system employed. (cont.) The ability to predictably produce highly emissive excimers from conjugated polymers is important for the understanding how solid-state structures can control emissive behaviors. Chapter 6. Electron-Deficient Polyelectrolytes For Biosensory Applications In this chapter is described a novel photo-oxidizing water-soluble fluorescent polymer that was designed for the detection of electron-rich biological analytes. The polymer fluorescence is strongly quenched through an efficient photoinduced electron transfer from electron-donating aromatic moieties in amino acids, neurotransmitters, and proteins to the photo-oxidizing polymer. These efficient fluorescence quenching responses may be further enhanced by rapid exciton migration in the polymer backbone and further facilitated by ion- pairing between the polymer and quencher. by Youngmi Kim.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} system design and circuit {{implementation}} of a 24 GHz-band short-range radar receiver in CMOS technology. The propagation and penetration properties of EM wave offer the possibility of non-contact based remote sensing and through-the-wall imaging of distance stationary or moving objects. The feasibility of realizing these concepts in hardware with a small form factor could accelerate commercialization and initiate new product opportunities. Minimizing the receiver power consumption to the 15 mW range enables 4 hours of continuous operation from a 1. 2 gram button sized lithium battery. CMOS technology {{has the potential for}} realization of both the RF transceiver and baseband processor in a single chip. An understanding of the functional requirements is a prerequisite for system optimization. The 15 mW power budget necessitates the continuous nature of FMCW radar configuration, which obviates the requirement for a power-hungry transmitting amplifier. FMCW radar in short-range applications benefits from the phase noise correlation between transmitted and received waveforms, which may be exploited to lower the power consumption of the LO generation circuits. A choice for the heterodyne receiver architecture mitigates erroneous detection due to second-order intermodulation distortions caused by interfering radar transmitters nearby, accuracy degradation due to frequency pulling of the ultra-wideband VCO, and signal quality degradation due to flicker noise generated by CMOS transistors. The power dissipation and hardware overhead of a heterodyne receiver are relaxed by proper frequency planning and elimination of the image-reject filter due to frequency chirping property of the FMCW signal. A frequency downconverter for the radar receiver is realized by integrating a LNA, a Gilbert-type mixer, and a VCO running at the carrier frequency. A varactorless frequency tuning scheme is proposed for the VCO which breaks through the conventional trade-offs seen in continuous and wideband mm-wave frequency generation between capacitance tuning ratio, quality factor, and operating frequency in CMOS design. <b>Inductive</b> frequency <b>tuning</b> is enabled by a transformer resonant tank which exploits the gyration (90 degree) across the input/output terminal voltages of a transconductor. The parallel resonant frequency is controlled by sweeping the sign and magnitude of the transconductance. The VCO is frequency-agile, and is continuously tunable by altering the DC bias current of the transconductance cell. Adaptability between frequency tuning and power consumption is possible. Two VCO test circuits are reported in this thesis. (1) A proof of concept in 0. 13 um RF-CMOS consumes 43 mW from a 1. 2 V supply. The frequency coverage is from 23. 2 GHz to 29. 4 GHz (23. 6 % tunable range) and the phase noise is - 92. 6 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset. (2) A miniaturized prototype is implemented in 90 nm CMOS for the radar receiver. It consumes 5. 7 mW from a 1. 0 V supply. Its maximum frequency range is from 18. 6 GHz to 21. 2 GHz (13. 1 % tunable range) and phase noise is at 1 MHz frequency offset. Operation of a CMOS LNA in the moderate inversion region and at a frequency approaching the transistor's operational limit deteriorates its power gain and noise figure. A two-step LNA optimization algorithm is proposed in this thesis which addresses both the device and circuit levels. Transistor dimensions and biasing are set for optimal power gain, noise figure, linearity, bandwidth, and matching network loss. Partitioning the limited power budget across multiple gain stages maximizes the overall power gain. Optimizing the transistor's interaction with bilateral power flows in a multi-stage amplifier is facilitated by Smith chart based visualization and a computer-aided design methodology. The advantages of this methodology are demonstrated by design examples. Current-feedback by a 3 -port transformer in a cascode LNA is proposed in this thesis in order to increase the power gain and lower the noise figure performance under low-power conditions. The feedback modifies the relationship between the input referred voltage and current noise sources of a common-gate MOS transistor, and thereby fulfills the internal interface impedance conditions in the cascode LNA for optimal power gain and noise figure matching. A two-stage, single-ended, current-feedback cascode LNA prototype is realized in 90 nm CMOS. Physical implementation with multiple magnetic components, signal integrity associated with current return path, and circuit simulations employing an S-parameter model are addressed and emphasized in the LNA development. Consuming just 3 mW from a 1 V supply, the LNA achieves 14. 5 dB peak power gain, a - 3 dB gain bandwidth of 5. 0 GHz. The noise figure varies from 4. 9 dB to 5. 6 dB across a 22 GHz and 26 GHz RF bandwidth, and the IIP 3 is - 6. 0 dBm. The frequency downconverter is realized by integrating the inductive-tuned VCO and current-feedback LNA with a differential Gilbert-type mixer. Isolation of the LNA single-ended current return path {{from the rest of the}} receiver is maintained by a 8 -port transformer balun preceding the mixer. This receiver RF front-end draws 10. 7 mW from a 1. 0 V supply, and delivers 12. 6 dB peak power gain, - 3 dB bandwidth of 1. 25 GHz. The noise figure varies from 10. 6 dB to 11. 5 dB across the RF bandwidth, and the IIP 3 of the downconverter is - 12. 1 dBm.
