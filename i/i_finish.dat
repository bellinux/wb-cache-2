It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
500|$|Forty-nine {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only 43 raced per NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session only determined {{the first two}} positions, {{while the rest of}} the drivers qualified by the 2011 Gatorade Duels. Earnhardt clinched his 10th pole position during his career, with a time of 48.364seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon. Once the qualifying session completed, Earnhardt commented, [...] "The main thing [...] does for me is take the pressure off Thursday's race. I can go out and have fun and not worry about where <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> or getting a good starting spot for the Daytona 500." ...|$|E
500|$|While he {{was living}} with Maynard, Salinger {{continued}} to write in a disciplined fashion, a few hours every morning. According to Maynard, by 1972 he had completed two new novels. In a rare 1974 interview with The New York Times, he explained: [...] "There is a marvelous peace in not publishing... I like to write. I love to write. But I write just for myself and my own pleasure." [...] According to Maynard, he saw publication as [...] "a damned interruption". In her memoir, Margaret Salinger describes the detailed filing system her father had for his unpublished manuscripts: [...] "A red mark meant, if I die before <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> my work, publish this 'as is,' blue meant publish but edit first, and so on." [...] A neighbor said that Salinger {{told him that he}} had written 15 unpublished novels.|$|E

For example: [...] "Я закончил задание" [...] (lit. <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> task/mission: <b>I</b> <b>finished</b> the task/mission) versus [...] "Задание закончил я" [...] (lit. Task/mission finished I: It was <b>I</b> who <b>finished</b> the task/mission).|$|R

500|$|In 2002, Beyoncé had {{productive}} studio sessions {{while making}} her debut album, Dangerously in Love, recording up to forty-five songs. After {{the release of}} Dangerously in Love in 2003, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the leftover tracks. However, on January 7,2004, a spokesperson for her record label, Columbia, announced that Beyoncé had put her plans on hold in order {{to concentrate on the}} recording of Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child, and to sing the US national anthem at the Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston, which was a childhood dream of hers. In late 2005, Beyoncé decided to postpone the recording of her second album because she had landed a lead role in Dreamgirls, a film adaptation of the 1981 Tony Award-winning Broadway musical of the same name. As she wanted to focus on one project at a time, Beyoncé decided to wait until the movie was completed before returning to the recording studio. Beyoncé later told Billboard magazine: [...] "I'm not going to write for the album until <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> doing the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Verdi {{conducted}} his Requiem in Paris, London and Vienna in 1875 and in Cologne in 1876. It {{seemed that}} it would be his last work. In the words of his biographer John Rosselli, it [...] "confirmed him as the unique presiding genius of Italian music. No fellow composer...came near him in popularity or reputation". Verdi, now in his sixties, initially seemed to withdraw into retirement. He deliberately shied away from opportunities to publicise himself or to become involved with new productions of his works, but secretly he began work on Otello, which Boito (to whom the composer had been reconciled by Ricordi) had proposed to him privately in 1879. The composition was delayed by a revision of Simon Boccanegra which Verdi undertook with Boito, produced in 1881, and a revision of Don Carlos. Even when Otello was virtually completed, Verdi teased [...] "Shall <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> it? Shall I have it performed? Hard to tell, even for me." [...] As news leaked out, Verdi was pressed by opera houses across Europe with enquiries; eventually the opera was triumphantly premiered at La Scala in February 1887.|$|E
500|$|The {{first act}} was {{completed}} by March 1890; {{the rest of the}} opera was not composed in chronological order, as had been Verdi's usual practice. The musicologist Roger Parker comments that this piecemeal approach may have been [...] "an indication of the relative independence of individual scenes". Progress was slow, with composition [...] "carried out in short bursts of activity interspersed with long fallow periods" [...] partly caused by the composer's depression. Verdi was weighed down by the fear of being unable to complete the score, and also by the deaths and impending deaths of close friends, including the conductors Franco Faccio and Emanuele Muzio. There was no pressure on the composer to hurry. As he observed at the time, he was not working on a commission from a particular opera house, as he had in the past, but was composing for his own pleasure: [...] "in writing Falstaff, I haven't thought about either theatres or singers". He reiterated this idea in December 1890, a time when his spirits were very low after Muzio's death that November: [...] "Will <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> it ? Or will I not finish it? Who knows! I am writing without any aim, without a goal, just to pass a few hours of the day". By early 1891 he was declaring that he could not finish the work that year, but in May he expressed some small optimism, which by mid-June, had turned into: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. Maybe I should have done it already in the past in GP2, but it felt pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E

Benaud said: [...] "I'll be doing Australian cricket next year—2010—but I don't do any television at all anywhere else now and when <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> next year, then I'll be doing other things... But that'll be no more television commentary".|$|E

I've been playing first-class cricket for about 10 years and what cricket's given to me I think I've put back into it. It's taken a lot of time out of my life and. I'm married and I've got two kids and I think I've sacrificed a lot in those 10 years just to play cricket, so I think when I [...] finish I'll finish with cricket and start something else".|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{began by}} writing tracks for {{artists such as}} Alesha Dixon, Chipmunk, Professor Green, Devlin, Preeya Kalidas, Cheryl Cole, and Tinie Tempah. While {{trying to get into}} the music {{industry}} she was studying Medicine at the University of Glasgow, but she decided to stop in her fourth year. Sandé always said that her education was the most important thing to her, stating if her music career was to fail, she would have her education to fall back on. Sandé said that her manager, Adrian Sykes, waited patiently since she was 16, saying [...] "Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me. He also knows my parents are keen that <b>I</b> <b>finish</b> university." [...] Sandé first performed publicly when she provided guest vocals on Chipmunk's hit single, [...] "Diamond Rings" [...] which she also wrote in 2009. A year later she returned again to the public's attention when she teamed up with Wiley on his comeback single, [...] "Never Be Your Woman", the song became Sandé second top-ten single on the UK Singles Chart. It was later announced that [...] "Never Be Your Woman" [...] was a trail for Sandé with EMI Records to see how well the song charted, with the success the song had, Sandé later signed a record deal with Virgin Records.|$|E
