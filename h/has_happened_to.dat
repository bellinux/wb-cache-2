5|$|A year passes, with Amy and Rory {{periodically}} travelling {{with the}} Doctor. Brian, after observing Amy and Rory returning from one trip, asks the Doctor what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> his past companions. The Doctor tells some had met a sad fate {{but he will}} not let that happen to Amy or Rory. Humanity forgets about the cubes, using them as paperweights or other functions.|$|E
5|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's {{door and the}} party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie. Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie. She wonders what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the patty-pan she put in her pie, and, not finding it under the crust, is convinced she has swallowed it. She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie.|$|E
5|$|Burns talks Homer into {{cheating}} {{and they}} use a snowmobile to reach the cabin. Arriving early, they settle down in the comfortable surroundings and quickly become friends. While clinking their champagne glasses, they inadvertently cause an avalanche that buries the entire cabin. The two make several attempts at escaping but are unsuccessful. The other employees reach {{what appears to be}} their destination; however, it is actually a ranger station and they begin to realize that something bad <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> their colleagues.|$|E

5|$|Jade completes her {{missions}} for the Republic, but hears that Katarn {{has broken}} contact. She heads to Dromund Kaas {{to try to}} find out what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him. At the temple she discovers that Katarn has been corrupted by the power of the dark side located within the temple. Failing to convince him to turn back, Jade battles him in a lightsaber duel which finally turns him away from the dark path, as she disengages her lightsaber and he finds he cannot go through with killing her.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing rivalries {{result in}} {{numerous}} rematches, especially {{if one of}} the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This {{is one of the reasons}} that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the alien {{substance}} Terrigen was released into the ecosystem, Joey Gutierrez developed metal-melting abilities. Unable to control this power, Gutierrez is confronted in the streets by soldiers {{who are willing to}} use lethal force to detain him. Gutierrez is saved by S.H.I.E.L.D., and Inhuman agent Daisy Johnson attempts to explain to him that he is also an Inhuman, with a dormant gene within him that was activated by the Terrigen. Struggling to help Gutierrez accept what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him, Johnson seeks the help of Lincoln Campbell, the Inhuman who helped her transition but has now renounced the ways of the Inhumans, wishing to live a normal life.|$|E

5|$|While {{driving down}} the road, Mulder and Scully {{discover}} a still-living McAlpin, who doesn't remember what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him. Tetrodotoxin, a chemical Mulder believes is part of Haitian zombification rituals, is found in McAlpin's blood. The agents go to the local graveyard to investigate the corpse of the other dead soldier, but find the grave robbed. They also find Chester, who collects frogs at the cemetery and sells them to Bauvais. Dunham approaches Mulder, telling him that Wharton has begun abusing the refugees {{as a means of}} retaliation against Bauvais; Wharton denies the accusations, but later has Bauvais beaten to death.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 24 clubs {{have reached the}} final, of whom 16 have won the competition. The first winners were Dundee in 1990. The most {{successful}} club is Falkirk with four wins from four final appearances. Ross County, Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South have also reached the final four times, all winning and losing twice each. Three clubs have reached the final in successive seasons; Ayr United did so {{in the first two}} years of the tournament but lost both. The only teams to have successfully defended their title are Hamilton Academical and the original Airdrieonians. It is possible for the winner of the tournament to be unable to defend their title; if a club is promoted from the Scottish Championship (second tier) in the same season to the Scottish Premiership (first tier), the club becomes ineligible to compete in the tournament. This <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Falkirk twice, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, St Mirren and Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Arianna {{refuses to}} talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E

I should have known the moment his spirit left his body; he would have come to me. But I slept without dreams last night, and today I am sure {{there has been no}} crisis. It is impossible it should <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him: I should have known.' ...|$|R
5|$|After Skinner and Scully {{find and}} {{retrieve}} Praise, Skinner takes {{him to the}} nearest hospital, where his friend Thea visits him, {{closing the door behind}} her. In search for Mulder in the desert, Scully sees a bright light in the sky which she thinks is a spaceship, but which is later revealed to be a helicopter. The helicopter lands and Doggett insists Scully travel with him to the hospital; she reluctantly accepts. At the hospital, two other FBI agents assure the two agents that nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Praise; however, they soon discover that he has vanished. Scully leaves to search for Praise, while Doggett stays in an attempt to catch the intruder. He checks the ceiling space, where he finds Skinner badly injured. Meanwhile, Scully finds Praise, along with Skinner, who claims to be protecting the boy. Skinner, who is actually the Alien Bounty Hunter, attempts to kill her but Scully grabs her gun and shoots him in the neck, killing the Bounty Hunter. After Doggett reports the case to Kersh, he is assigned to the X-File division with Scully. The episode ends showing Mulder still held in captivity as six Alien Bounty Hunters look on.|$|E
5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice {{to take a job}} offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his {{surgical}} internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E
60|$|To Bert {{it was no}} {{more than}} the end of a series of disagreeable sensations. He was not curious <b>to</b> know what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the airship, nor what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the battle. For a long time he lay waiting apprehensively for the {{pitching}} and tossing and his qualms to return, and so, lying, boxed up in the locker, he presently fell asleep.|$|R

25|$|As {{early as}} 1 October 2012, {{there have been}} {{suggestions}} for a memorial to Meagher to be erected by the Moreland City Council (which takes in Brunswick). Similarly, there were calls in Drogheda to name a building after her. Nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> date in this regard. Some unofficial memorials, however, have been set up.|$|E
25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record of what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a feel for what has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.|$|E

25|$|Set as {{a sequel}} to John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name, the story focuses on Captain Blake, {{a member of a}} U.S. Special Forces team sent to the Antarctic outpost {{featured}} in the film to determine what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the research team. The game was endorsed by John Carpenter, who voices a character in an uncredited cameo.|$|E

It is unclear what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> this manufacturing site since Youngman exited the passenger automobile business.|$|E
