50|$|The {{second problem}} is the {{sequencing}} problem. Some functionality of the system may only be accomplished with a sequence of GUI events. For example, to open a file a user may have to first click on the <b>File</b> <b>Menu,</b> then select the Open operation, use a dialog box to specify the file name, and focus the application on the newly opened window. Increasing the number of possible operations increases the sequencing problem exponentially. This can become a serious issue when the tester is creating test cases manually.|$|R
