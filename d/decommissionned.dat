40|$|On July 21, 1997, the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{published}} the final rule on Radiological Criteria for License Termination (the License Termination Rule or LTR) as Subpart E to 10 CFR Part 20. NRC regulations require that materials licensees submit <b>Decommissioning</b> Plans {{to support the}} <b>decommissioning</b> of its facility if it is required by license condition, or if the procedures and activities necessary {{to carry out the}} <b>decommissioning</b> have not been approved by NRC and these procedures could increase the potential health and safety impacts to the workers or the public. NRC regulations also require that reactor licensees submit Post-shutdown <b>Decommissioning</b> Activities Reports and License Termination Plans to support the <b>decommissioning</b> of nuclear power facilities. This paper provides an update on the status of the NRC's <b>decommissioning</b> program that was presented during WM' 02.

The paper discusses the status of permanently shut-down commercial power reactors and the transfer of complex <b>decommissioning</b> sites and sites listed on the SDMP to Agreement States.

The questions were taken {{from a variety of}} sources over the past several years, including written inquiries to the NRC and questions asked at public meetings and during informal discussions with the NRC staff. In responding to the questions, the NRC staff attempted to provide the answers in a clear and non-technical form. With the increase in the number of power reactors beginning the <b>decommissioning</b> process and significant changes that occurred in the regulations since 1996, the staff realized that there was a general lack of understanding of the <b>decommissioning</b> process and the risks associated with <b>decommissioning.</b> This document was developed in response to the staff’s concerns. The report contains a definition of <b>decommissioning</b> and a discussion of alternatives. It also provides a focus on <b>decommissioning</b> experiences in the United States and how the NRC regulates the <b>decommissioning</b> process. Questions related to spent fuel, low-level waste, and transportation related to <b>decommissioning</b> are answered. Questions related to license termination, the ultimate disposition of the facility, and finances for completing <b>decommissioning</b> and hazards associated with <b>decommissioning</b> are also addressed.

40|$|The {{aging of}} {{research}} reactors worldwide {{has resulted in}} a heightened awareness in the international technical <b>decommissioning</b> community of the timeliness to review and address the needs of these research institutes in planning for and eventually performing the <b>decommissioning</b> of these facilities. By using the reactors already undergoing <b>decommissioning</b> as test beds for evaluating enhanced or new/innovative technologies for <b>decommissioning,</b> it is possible that new techniques could be made available for those future research reactor <b>decommissioning</b> projects. Potentially, the new technologies will result in: reduced radiation doses to the work force, larger safety margins in performing <b>decommissioning</b> and cost and schedule savings to the research institutes in performing the <b>decommissioning</b> of these facilities. Testing of these enhanced technologies for decontamination, dismantling, characterization, remote operations and worker protection are critical to furthering advancements in the technical specialty of <b>decommissioning.</b> Furthermore, regulatory acceptance and routine utilization for future research reactor <b>decommissioning</b> will be assured by testing and developing these technologies in realistically contaminated environments prior to use in the research reactors.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{international}} flavor of cooperation in the commercial development of nuclear power. This cooperation is most strongly established {{with the development of}} strategies for <b>decommissioning.</b> Many countries are beginning this phase at about the same time; Japan, Canada, Germany, and the United States all are involved in dismantlement projects. This chapter, along with the next four chapters, addresses various aspects of the methodological approaches being developed to estimate <b>decommissioning</b> costs. Each country has adopted a different strategy for reactor <b>decommissioning,</b> taking its political and technical situations into consideration. Japan also has its own strategy of reactor <b>decommissioning,</b> reflecting the geographic and economic positions peculiar to Japan. The Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR) <b>decommissioning</b> program {{is in the process of}} establishing a <b>decommissioning</b> data base and a cost estimation methodology, as well as developing new technology for reactor <b>decommissioning.</b> Various information about the JPDR dismantling has been accumulated in the <b>decommissioning</b> data base, which will be used for: (1) planning future <b>decommissioning</b> of commercial nuclear power reactors; (2) verifying the developed code system for management of reactor decommissioning; and (3) managing the ongoing JPDR dismantling.

This paper gives a short overview on <b>decommissioning</b> and dismantling strategies and techniques as {{an introduction to the}} applicability of radioactive metal waste recycling and reuse. General estimations suggest that majority of the waste mass resulting from <b>decommissioning</b> and dismantling is radiologically unrestricted material. Remaining one-third is the radioactive material with different ranges of radioactivity. To present radioactive metal scrap recycling in practice, paper addresses estimations on metal waste amounts resulting from <b>decommissioning,</b> use of melting as a possible recycling method (with regard to secondary waste generated) and aspects of environmental and health impacts. Additionally, a best practice example of <b>decommissioning</b> process in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology NPP is given to provide context for possible future <b>decommissioning</b> of NPP Krško.
