5|$|The {{derivative}} of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition {{by considering the}} difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives of a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using rules for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.|$|E

5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> elements.|$|E

5000|$|Different {{computer}} architectures vary greatly {{as to the}} number of addressing modes they provide in hardware. There are some benefits to eliminating complex addressing modes and using only one or a <b>few</b> <b>simpler</b> addressing modes, even though it requires a few extra instructions, and perhaps an extra register. [...] It has proven much easier to design pipelined CPUs if the only addressing modes available are simple ones.|$|R
5|$|The player {{controls}} Diermot's {{movements and}} actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot {{can pick up}} various objects; these can then be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be}} done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> action-oriented battle scenes are also included.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, 45% of the {{necessary}} repairs {{had been made to}} Altes Stadthaus by a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> expedients such as emergency roofing. In the immediate post-war years, neither manpower, supplies, nor financing was available to undertake repairs on a larger scale. The reconstruction took place between 1950 and 1955 in five phases; the first focused on building up the courtyard wing on the Stralauer Straße side while the second phase, completed in early 1952, focused on the Stralauer Straße/Judenstraße wing and included construction of additional offices on the fourth floor and a 300-person dining hall with kitchen. However, {{for a number of reasons}} most significant of which was that the building was not the seat of government, the remaining three phases were not carried out. In addition, the reconstruction of Wilhelmine architecture was not a high priority, where as housing was and so funding for the restoration work was not included in the economic plan.|$|E
5|$|Chapter X {{examines}} whether {{patterns in}} the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, {{but not at the}} same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower is}} linked to the baptistery by a narrow doorway, which {{originally}} had a timber doorcase. Excavations have revealed a font base buried in the floor of the room. Externally, it is plainer than the tower, with even <b>fewer,</b> <b>simple</b> windows. On {{the opposite side of the}} tower to the baptistery, a chancel was constructed. Foundations of a permanent altar and a screen have been found under this space. Both baptistery and chancel would have had flat ceilings with attics above.|$|R

The later may be replaced by a ceiling-suspended lead glass panel. Additional lead curtains can be installed at the table side to protect the lower body region. Even more restrictive rules apply to pregnant staff members.|$|E

40|$|Operator {{splitting}} is {{a widely}} used procedure in the numerical solution of complex problems. The point in operator splitting is {{the replacement of the}} original model with one in which appropriately chosen groups of the sub-processes, described by the model, take place successively in time. This de-coupling procedure allows us to solve a <b>few</b> <b>simpler</b> problems instead of the whole one. In this paper we investigate the application of the operator splitting method to real-life problems from a practical point of view, with great emphasis on long-range air pollution transport. We discuss the main benefits and drawbacks of this approach...|$|R

25|$|Die {{deterioration}} doubling is {{a result}} of a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> causes, but {{it can be difficult to}} positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, it looks more like a weak strike than doubling.|$|E

In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent.

25|$|Soviet {{designers}} {{were aware}} of design deficiencies in the tank, {{but most of the}} desired remedies would have slowed tank production and so were not implemented: the only changes allowed on the production lines through to 1944 were those to make production simpler and cheaper. New methods were developed for automated welding and hardening the armour plate, including innovations by Prof. Evgeny Paton. The design of the 76.2mm F-34 gun Model 1941 was reduced from an initial 861 parts to 614. The initial narrow, cramped turrets, both the cast one and the one welded of rolled armour plates bent to shape, were since 1942 gradually replaced with the somewhat less cramped hexagonal one; as it was mostly cast with only a <b>few,</b> <b>simple</b> flat armour plates welded in (roof etc.), this turret was actually faster to produce. Limited rubber supplies led to the adoption of all-steel, internally sprung road wheels, and a new clutch was added to an improved five-speed transmission and engine, improving reliability.|$|E

Because the reduction potential for fluorine to fluoride is so high, +2.87V, cobalt(III) fluoride is one of the <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> stable cobalt(III) compounds. Cobalt(III) fluoride, which is used in some fluorination reactions, reacts vigorously with water.|$|E
500|$|Darwin's ideas, {{along with}} those of Adam Smith and Karl Marx, had a {{profound}} influence on 19th century thought, including his radical claim that [...] "elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner" [...] evolved from the simplest forms of life by a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> principles. This inspired some of Darwin's most ardent supporters—and provoked the strongest opposition.

500|$|This {{story is}} about a king who wants to keep all magic to himself. To do this he needs to solve two problems: he must capture and imprison all of the sorcerers in the kingdom {{and he has to}} learn magic. He creates a [...] "Brigade of Witch Hunters" [...] and calls for an {{instructor}} in magic. Only a [...] "cunning charlatan" [...] with no magical ability responds. The charlatan proves himself with a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> tricks and begins to ask for jewellery and money to continue teaching. However, Babbitty, the king's washerwoman, laughs at the king one day as he attempts to do magic with an ordinary twig. This causes the king to demand the charlatan join him in a public demonstration of magic and warns that the charlatan will be beheaded if anyone laughs. The charlatan later witnesses Babbitty performing magic in her house. He threatens to expose her if she does not assist him. She agrees to hide and help the demonstration.|$|E
500|$|In January 1837 Cooke {{proposed}} a {{design for a}} 60-code telegraph to {{the directors of the}} Liverpool and Manchester Railway. [...] This was too complicated for their purposes; the immediate need was for a simple signal communication between the Liverpool station and a rope-haulage engine house {{at the top of a}} steep incline through a long tunnel outside the station. [...] Rope-haulage into main stations was common at this time to avoid noise and pollution, and in this case the gradient was too steep for the locomotive to ascend unaided. [...] All that was required were a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> signals such as an indication to the engine house to start hauling. [...] Cooke was requested to build a simpler version with fewer codes, which he did by the end of April 1837. [...] However, the railway decided to use instead a pneumatic telegraph equipped with whistles. [...] Soon after this Cooke went into partnership with Wheatstone.|$|E
500|$|Verdi's three {{last major}} works {{continued}} to show new development in conveying drama and emotion. The first to appear, in 1874 was his Requiem, scored for operatic forces {{but by no}} means an [...] "opera in ecclesiastical dress" [...] (the words in which Hans von Bülow condemned it before even hearing it). Although in the Requiem Verdi puts to use many of the techniques he learned in opera, its musical forms and emotions are not those of the stage. Verdi's tone painting {{at the opening of the}} Requiem is vividly described by the Italian composer Ildebrando Pizzetti, [...] writing in 1941: [...] "in [...] murmured by an invisible crowd over the slow swaying of a <b>few</b> <b>simple</b> chords, you straightaway sense the fear and sadness of a vast multitude before the mystery of death. In the [...] Et lux perpetuum the melody spreads it wings...before falling back on itself...you hear a sigh for consolation and eternal peace." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{original}} mode {{of communication}} (i.e., written vs. spoken language) {{is particularly important}} with respect to linguistic cues that distinguish between truth tellers and deceivers. As noted in IDT, deception is strategic and the spontaneity of the interaction is important [21],[24]. Thus, for example, a team tasked with writing the text to include with financial statements has months in which to develop a document that may include strategic misrepresentation or obfuscation via increasing word count and employing words of more than three syllables [14],[15]. On the other hand, a person calling a 911 operator after committing a crime has far less time for strategic wordsmithery and may use <b>fewer,</b> <b>simpler</b> words to suppress or control verbal cues for deception.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to first do a hearing test, in case the patient cannot clearly hear the words or sentences needed in the speech repetition test. In the speech tests, the person is asked to repeat a sentence with common words; if the person cannot identify the word but {{he or she can}} describe it, then the person is highly likely to have anomic aphasia. However, to be completely sure, the test is given while a test subject is in an fMRI scanner, and the exact location of the lesions and areas activated by speech are pinpointed. <b>Few</b> <b>simpler</b> or cheaper options are available, so lesion mapping and speech repetition tests are the main ways of diagnosing anomic aphasia.|$|R
