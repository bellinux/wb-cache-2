5|$|By {{the time}} Hamnet was four, {{his father was}} already a London playwright and, as his {{popularity}} grew, he was probably not regularly at home in Stratford with his family. <b>Honan</b> believes that Hamnet may have completed Lower School, {{which would have been}} normal, before his death at the age of eleven (possibly from the Bubonic Plague). He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England about a third of all children died before age 10.|$|E
5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but <b>Honan</b> disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of this young man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park <b>Honan</b> suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E

25|$|The replay {{just under}} {{three weeks later}} {{was the first time}} an All-Ireland hurling decider was played on a Saturday. Clare emerged as champions {{for the first time since}} 1997 after {{defeating}} Cork by 5-16 to 3-16 in a classic at Croke Park. Shane O'Donnell, a late call-up to the starting line-up in place of Darach <b>Honan,</b> justified his inclusion with a stunning individual haul of 3-3, all from play. O'Donnell hit all three goals in the opening nineteen minutes of the first half and while Cork came from eight points down to draw level during the second half, the winners had a kick left in them as goals from Conor McGrath and sub <b>Honan</b> secured a fourth Liam MacCarthy Cup success for Clare. With 18 minutes left on the watch, the scores were level at 1-16 to 3-10 and they were deadlocked again with ten minutes left as Séamus Harnedy's goal brought Cork on terms, 2-16 to 3-13. But Clare’s response was magnificent as McGrath crashed home a magnificent 62nd-minute goal into the top corner of the Davin Stand netting. Clare pushed six points clear, 4-16 to 2-16, before Stephen Moylan’s stoppage time goal for Cork brought a spellbound Croke Park to life once more. But in the second minute of stoppage time, <b>Honan</b> cut in from the left touchline and somehow managed to bundle the ball over the line for the eighth goal of a quite incredible spectacle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Honan</b> Chapel is internationally {{regarded}} as representing the best artwork of the Irish Arts & Crafts Movement (1894–1925). However, socially, {{the commission was}} also significant because the project generated much needed work in Cork during the First World War (1914–18). The project fostered the revival of silver and textile craft working, once central to the Cork economy, and supported local firms, through patronage, such as the builders John Sisk & Son. Today Sisk is a construction firm of national importance. Egan’s of Patrick Street continued making liturgical altar plate and textiles until it ceased trading in 1986. As a central figure behind the <b>Honan</b> commission, Rev. Sir John Robert O’Connell was a catalyst in Irish cultural life {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century. His collaboration with Sir Bertram Windle between 1914-17 greatly assisted the physical expansion of University College Cork and the revival of craft industry in Cork.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the <b>Honan</b> Chapel was laid on 18 May 1915. The architectural style of the chapel cites the Hiberno-Romanesque tradition of the Middle Ages. The Chapel is most similar to the 12th-century church of St. Cronan in Roscrea, County Tipperary, while its bell-tower on the north wall is inspired by round towers of monastic settlements so common in Ireland from the 9th century onwards.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} <b>Honan</b> {{transferred}} to the University of Chicago, from which he received his BA and, in 1951, his MA. He continued {{to work in a}} variety of jobs, including as a publisher in New York. There he met, and in 1952 married, a French Fulbright scholar, Jeannette nee Colin (died 2009), and the couple eventually had three children: Corinna, a writer and editor, and twins Matthew and Natasha. <b>Honan</b> was drafted into the US army {{at the end of the}} Korean War, but as a conscientious objector, he refused to fight. He was jailed briefly, but allowed to serve in a non-combat role in France. Upon discharge, under the GI Bill, he qualified for a grant to study anywhere he chose. He moved with his wife and baby daughter to England in 1956 to study at the University of London, gaining the degree of Ph.D, with a thesis on Robert Browning, in 1959 (which was published in 1961 as Browning's Characters), while also writing a novel, two plays, poems, short stories and academic papers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Honan</b> {{began his}} career specializing in Victorian {{literature}} but later broadened his scope, becoming {{an expert in the}} Elizabethan period. From 1959, he taught at Connecticut College and then Brown University before relocating permanently to England in 1968, where he taught at the University of Birmingham until becoming Professor of English and American Literature at the University of Leeds in 1984. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of Reynolds' first administration later in 1992, O'Malley retired from {{the leadership of the}} party. Following the 1992 general election, John Dardis (Agricultural Panel) and Cathy <b>Honan</b> (Industrial and Commercial Panel) were elected to Seanad Éireann as part of an election pact with their politically polar opposites Democratic Left. Mary Harney became the new leader after a bitter electoral contest with Pat Cox who later left the party. Harney was the first woman to lead any of the major Irish political parties. Harney served as Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) from May 1997 until September 2006 after a return to government in coalition with Fianna Fáil.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{spread to}} Ireland, representing an important {{time for the}} nation's cultural development, a visual counterpart to the literary revival of {{the same time and}} was a publication of Irish nationalism. The Arts and Crafts use of stained glass was popular in Ireland, with Harry Clarke the best-known artist and also with Evie Hone. The architecture of the style is represented by the <b>Honan</b> Chapel (1916) in Cork in the grounds of University College Cork. Other architects practicing in Ireland included Sir Edwin Lutyens (Heywood House in Co. Laois, Lambay Island and the Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Dublin) and Frederick 'Pa' Hicks (Malahide Castle estate buildings and round tower). Irish Celtic motifs were popular with the movement in silvercraft, carpet design, book illustrations and hand-carved furniture.|$|E
25|$|The chapel, and its liturgical collection, was {{produced}} {{during the late}} phase of the Irish Arts and Crafts movement (1894–1925). Both the building and furnishings were designed and produced as a single commission. This accounts for an overall unity of style and design and the rich interplay of Celto-Byzantine motifs {{in the fabric of}} the building and the ornate furnishings, altar plate, hangings and vestments. The traditions of Celtic art and Hiberno-Romanesque architecture were blended with tastes for Symbolism (arts) and Art Nouveau popular in Europe before the outbreak of the First World War (1914–18). In Ireland this was known, artistically, as the Celtic Twilight: a time for rediscovering a lost national identity through Celtic art and myths. This is seen in the poetry of W. B. Yeats and the plays of J. M. Synge. Visually, the patrons of the <b>Honan</b> commission were searching for a new sense of Irish national identity on the threshold of political independence from Britain.|$|E
25|$|After an {{incredible}} championship, which saw the three favourites fail to {{even make the}} semi-final stage, Cork and Clare emerged {{at the top of}} the pile to contest the All-Ireland final. In front of a crowd of 81,651, Clare started brightly with early scores from Darach <b>Honan</b> and Colin Ryan. Clare led by 0-12 to 0-10 at the break, and they continued to bring a remarkable intensity to the contest, forcing the Rebels into errors, which they exploited with further scores from Tony Kelly and the unerring Ryan, who steered over his sixth free for a four-point lead. Cork were far from finished, however, and when Pa Cronin saw his chance, he picked his spot with an accurate finish to the net, and the sides were level going into the final five minutes. Patrick Horgan appeared to have won it for them with his tenth score in stoppage-time, but there was still time for Domhnall O'Donovan to pop up with a dramatic leveller in the 73rd minute.|$|E
25|$|Built by John Sisk & Son, it {{illustrates}} {{the role played}} by the Dublin schools in helping to renew Cork craftsmanship in {{the first decades of the}} twentieth-century. Rev. Sir John Robert O’Connell, educated by the Jesuits at Belvedere College, Dublin, was a driving force in its construction. The Irish Jesuits educated a number of the leading patrons of the Irish Arts & Crafts movement. Thomas Bodkin had attended Belvedere College and Clongowes Wood. He became Director of the National Gallery, Dublin (1927–35). One of the movement's internationally best-known craftsmen, Harry Clarke, a stained glass artist and book illustrator, was educated at Belvedere College. O'Connell worked closely with the president of University College Cork, Sir Bertram Allan Coghill Windle (1858–1929), to achieve his goals. The chapel and its liturgical collection are products of the Irish Arts & Crafts Movement (1894–1925). This accounts for the overall unity of style. It was envisaged that the chapel would serve the needs of college students residing in the nearby <b>Honan</b> Hostel (1914–1991).|$|E
25|$|There {{was great}} {{uncertainty}} regarding {{the future of}} China in the following months, and through The Times Morrison managed to depict a skewed picture before the British public. While Russia and Japan united in opposing any dismemberment of China, the country was nevertheless punished by {{the imposition of a}} heavy indemnity. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out on 10 February 1904 Morrison became a correspondent with the Japanese army. He was present at the entry of the Japanese into Port Arthur (now Lüshunkou) early in 1905, and represented The Times at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA, peace conference. In 1907 he crossed China from Peking to the French border of Tonkin, and in 1910 rode from <b>Honan</b> across Asia to Andijan in Russian Turkestan, a journey of 3,750 miles (6,000km) which was completed in 175 days. From Andijan he took a train to St Petersburg, and then traveled to London arriving on 29 July 1910. He returned to China and, when plague broke out in Manchuria, went to Harbin, where a great Chinese physician, Dr. Wu Lien-teh, succeeded in staying the spread of this mortal sickness which seemed to threaten the whole world. Morrison did his part by publishing a series of articles advocating the launching of a modern scientific public health service in China.|$|E

500|$|In 1804, {{while living}} in Bath, Austen started but did not {{complete}} her novel, The Watsons. The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as [...] "a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women's lives". <b>Honan</b> suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort.|$|E
500|$|In 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, {{descendants}} of the Austen family, published the definitive family biography, Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters—A Family Record. Based primarily on family papers and letters, it is described by Austen biographer Park <b>Honan</b> as [...] "accurate, staid, reliable, and at times vivid and suggestive". Although the authors {{moved away from the}} sentimental tone of the Memoir, they made little effort to go beyond the family records and traditions immediately available to them. Their book therefore offers bare facts and {{little in the way of}} interpretation.|$|E
500|$|Among {{these works}} are a satirical novel in letters titled Love and Freindship , written at age 14 in 1790, where she mocked popular novels of sensibility, and The History of England, a {{manuscript}} of 34 pages accompanied by 13 watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen's History parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's History of England (1764). <b>Honan</b> speculates that not long after writing Love and Freindship in 1789, Austen decided to [...] "write for profit, to make stories her central effort", that is, to become a professional writer. Beginning in about 1793, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{critics have}} been so harsh. The 19th-century writer James Boaden wrote that [...] "to me the {{portrait}} exhibits an aspect of calm benevolence and tender thought, great comprehension {{and a kind of}} mixt feeling, as when melancholy yields to the suggestions of fancy". He added that his friend John Philip Kemble thought this [...] "despised work" [...] was more characteristic of Shakespeare than any other known portrait. More recently, Park <b>Honan</b> has written that [...] "if the portrait lacks the 'sparkle' of a witty poet, it suggests the inwardness of a writer of great intelligence, an independent man who is not insensitive to the pain of others." ...|$|E
500|$|According to <b>Honan,</b> {{life in the}} Austen {{home was}} lived in [...] "an open, amused, easy {{intellectual}} atmosphere" [...] where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed. The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, [...] "the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works." ...|$|E
500|$|Tjunkiya and {{her sister}} Wintjiya did not confine their {{activities}} to painting canvases. In 2001 the National Gallery of Victoria purchased a collaborative batik, created by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists, together with one completed by Wintjiya alone. These works were {{the product of a}} batik workshop run for the women of Haasts Bluff by Northern Territory Education Department staff Jill Squires and Therese <b>Honan</b> in the months following June 1994. The works, including several by Wintjiya, were not completed until 1995. Circular markings, used by Wintjiya in both these batiks and her subsequent paintings, represent the eggs of the flying ant (waturnuma), one of the main subjects of her art. She also portrays [...] "tree-like organic motifs" [...] and representations of hair-string skirts (nyimparra). The sisters also gained experience with drypoint etching; works produced by Wintjiya in 2004 – Watiyawanu and Nyimpara – are held by the National Gallery of Australia.|$|E

Walsh also said that the music video for [...] "The Show" [...] was her least favourite from the band. The story takes place in a salon called [...] "Curls Allowed." [...] Each member of the band plays a character working in the salon, pampering and making-up a variety of men. Nicola Roberts is [...] "Chelsea Tanner," [...] who sprays insulting messages with fake bronzer onto her male customers; Nadine Coyle is [...] "Frenchie", who ineptly tries to give her male customers facials; Sarah Harding is [...] "Supa Styler", a hair stylist who fails to satisfy any of her customers; Cheryl Cole is [...] "Maxi Wax", who makes the waxing process as painful as possible; and Kimberley Walsh is [...] "The Boss", who looks on amusedly as her employees take their revenge on the salon's male customers.|$|E
500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{claim that}} members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, {{at a time when}} practicing Catholicism in England was against the law. Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity. In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church [...] "for fear of process for debt", a common Catholic excuse. In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford. As several scholars have noted, whatever his private views, Shakespeare [...] "conformed to the official state religion", as Park <b>Honan</b> put it. Also, Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptized, and where he is buried. Other authors argue that {{there is a lack of}} evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Honan</b> {{was born}} in Utica, New York, the son of William Francis <b>Honan,</b> a {{thoracic}} surgeon of Irish descent, and Annette Neudecker <b>Honan,</b> a journalist of English descent. His brother was the journalist William <b>Honan,</b> who became culture editor of The New York Times. His father died in 1935, when <b>Honan</b> was seven years old, leaving his mother to raise their sons alone; she rented a small house in Bronxville, New York, where she felt the public schools were excellent. He earned a scholarship to Deep Springs College, a small school in the California desert. While at school, <b>Honan</b> worked as a butcher and a car mechanic, enjoying horseback riding and fascinated with the local reptiles. Of the butcher job, he said: [...] "My boots used to be awash in four inches {{of blood in the}} slaughterhouse. That helped to make me a pacifist." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Honan</b> Chapel (...) , {{formally}} {{known as}} Saint Finbarr's Collegiate Chapel or the <b>Honan</b> Hostel Chapel {{is a small}} collegiate church located adjacent to the grounds of University College Cork in Cork city, Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|The chapel was consecrated on 5 November 1916. Although {{the chapel}} is {{dedicated}} to Cork's patron Finbarr, its name commemorates the chapel's benefactors, wealthy Cork merchants, the <b>Honan</b> family.

Under the foundation charter of Queen's College Cork (1845) the college is non-denominational.
