40|$|In this paper, {{polystyrene}} colloidal microspheres {{have been}} prepared using hexyl acrylate (HA), ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA), isooctyl acrylate (IOA), butyl acrylate (BA), or <b>isobutyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (IBA) as comonomers. Microspheres with diameters from 212 to 332 [*]nm and with a polystyrene content of 65 – 78 % were prepared. The particles prepared in this work do not present the typical core-shell structure; as a consequence, DSC analysis showed that the microspheres exhibited only one Tg. TEM images show that the particles with comonomer content below ~ 30 % were spherical and regular. Microspheres containing comonomer between 21 to 25 % produced the less brittle films showing very iridescent colors. The films prepared from microspheres containing hexyl, ethylhexyl, and isooctyl acrylate as comonomers are firmly attached to the substrate due to their adhesive properties. The large decrease of the fragility observed in these films makes them much more attractive materials in sensing applications...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to the study the {{influence}} of the isomer structures of butyl acrylate monomer on the single-electron transfer/degenerative chain transfer mediated living radical polymerization (SET-DTLRP). The kinetic of <b>isobutyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> is determined for the first time by SET-DTLRP in water catalyzed by sodium dithionite. The plots of number-average molecular weight versus conversion and ln([M] 0 /[M]) versus time are linear, demonstrating a controlled polymerization. The influence of the isomer t-butyl, i-butyl, and n-butyl on the kinetics, properties, and stereochemistry of the reactions was assessed. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report dealing with the synthesis of PiBA by any LRP approach in aqueous medium. The results presented in this work suggest that the stability provided by the acrylate side group has an important influence in the polymerization process. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|A {{new type}} of local thermodilution {{catheter}} is described for measuring portal vein blood flow in unanaesthetized rabbits. Local thermodilution catheters are inserted at a preliminary operation directly through the vein wall and fixed in position with the tissue adhesive methyl 2 -cyanoacrylate or <b>isobutyl</b> <b>acrylate.</b> The presence of the catheter for at least 10 days does not cause intravascular thrombosis. The renal vein catheter does not interfere with total renal blood flow but produces slight depression in the glomerular filtration rate and urine flow on the implanted side. The accuracy of the local thermodilution method has been examined in model experiments and by comparing it with para-amino hippurate estimates of renal blood flow in the same kidney. Good agreement between local thermodilution and independent flow methods was observed, the standard error of a single local thermodilution estimate of flow being ± 8 % of the mean flow value. In 13 unanaesthetized rabbits (mean body weight 2. 7 kg) the renal blood flow was 60 ± 6. 3 (S. E. of mean) ml. /min. /kidney, and the portal vein blood flow was 100 ± 5. 7 (S. E. of mean) ml. /min. Some applications of the local thermodilution method for examining regional blood flow patterns in unanaesthetized animals are discussed...|$|E
