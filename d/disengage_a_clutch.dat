40|$|Power {{shifting}} transmissions, e. g. automatic transmissions, {{are traditionally}} shifted from gear A to B by <b>disengaging</b> <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> belonging to gear A and engaging <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> belonging to gear B. This paper tries out {{the idea of}} employing <b>a</b> third <b>clutch.</b> In practice, such <b>a</b> third <b>clutch</b> {{can be one of}} the clutches which is traditionally used only for other gears. This means that the new concept can be used with only a control software update in an ordinary gearbox. The trade-off between comfort and wear, which is experienced in the traditional control concept, becomes less troublesome. The wear, or the discomfort, can be reduced to roughly half of that corresponding to a traditionally controlled upshift. The work finds the largest potential in using <b>an</b> extra <b>clutch</b> which belongs to a gear higher than the high gear in an upshift. The theoretical study is carried out with a general and simple model, but a simulation example is added using a more detailed model of an existing gearbox...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the control {{strategy}} of shifting time involving multigroup <b>clutches</b> for <b>a</b> hydromechanical continuously variable transmission (HMCVT). The dynamic analyses of mathematical models are presented in this paper, and the simulation models are used to study the control strategy of HMCVT. Simulations are performed in Simulation X platform to investigate the shifting time of clutches under different operating conditions. On this basis, simulation analysis and test verification of two typical conditions, which play the decisive roles for the shifting quality, are carried out. The results show that {{there are differences in}} the shifting time of the two typical conditions. In the shifting process from the negative transmission of hydromechanical ranges to the positive transmission of hydromechanical ranges, the control strategy based on the shifting time is switching the clutches of shifting mechanism firstly and then <b>disengaging</b> <b>a</b> group of <b>clutches</b> of planetary gear mechanism and engaging another group of the clutches of planetary gear mechanism lastly. In the shifting process from the hydraulic range to the hydromechanical range, the control strategy based on the shifting time is switching the clutches of hydraulic shifting mechanism and planetary gear mechanism at first and then engaging the clutch of shifting mechanism...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the design, modeling, {{experimental}} testing and scaling analysis of a novel MAgnetic Variable stiffnEess spRIng-Clutch (MAVERIC) device, which may be used as the elastic element of Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs). The device, comprising two co-axial diametrically magnetized hollow cylinders, has two degrees of freedom: a rotation of the two cylinders around the common axis and a relative translation along the same axis. For small rotations, the torque arising from the magnetic interaction of the two cylinders is almost linearly proportional to their relative rotation, as in mechanical torsion springs. In addition, the stiffness of the equivalent spring can be varied continuously from a maximum value down to exactly zero by changing the axial overlap of the two cylinders. In this way the proposed device can be used both as <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> (i. e., perfectly compliant element) and as a variable stiffness torsion spring. A prototype, designed after magnetostatic FEM simulations, has been built and experimentally characterized. The developed MAVERIC has an experimentally determined maximum transmissible torque of 109. 81 mNm, while the calculated maximum stiffness is 110. 2 mNmrad− 1. The amplitude of the torque-angle characteristic can be tuned linearly with a sensitivity of 12. 63 mNmmm− 1 rad− 1. Further simulations have been computed parameterizing the geometry and the number of pole pairs of the magnets. The maximum torque density reached for one pole pair is 47. 21 · 103 Nm m− 3, whereas for a fixed geometry {{similar to that of the}} developed prototype, the maximum torque is reached for seven pole pairs. Overall, compared to mechanical springs, MAVERIC has no fatigue or overloading issues. Compared to other magnetic couplers, torsion stiffness can be varied continuously from a maximum value down to exactly zero, when the device acts as <b>a</b> <b>disengaged</b> <b>clutch,</b> disconnecting the load from the actuator...|$|R

5000|$|For the 1968 model year, the Volkswagen Beetle {{offered an}} {{optional}} transmission marketed as Automatic Stickshift which {{was essentially a}} three-speed manual without <b>a</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal. Application of the driver's hand to gearshift knob caused the <b>clutch</b> to <b>disengage</b> via <b>a</b> 12 volt solenoid operating the vacuum clutch, thereby allowing shifting between gears. Once the driver's hand was removed, the clutch would re-engage automatically. The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear, like an automatic. The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear. This transmission was first available on the 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and was made available on the Karmann Ghia in 1967. VW dropped the transmission option altogether in 1976.
