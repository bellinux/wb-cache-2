5|$|The {{estate is}} {{strongly}} reminiscent of Romanesque architecture, mainly due to alterations {{made to the}} house and grounds by Davenport. A member of the National Trust, the current owner of Beaumont House, explains how Davenport's travels influenced his styles:Samuel Davenport was a great world traveller. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> involved in the world exposition movement. Every two years there were big world expos happening in different cities around the world. And he would travel to every one of these expos...I'm sure that the influences that he picked up in all of his travels are reflected here in Beaumont House.|$|E
5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to}} the king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E

25|$|Frank Herbert {{used his}} science fiction novels to explore complex ideas {{involving}} philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust {{of his work}} was a fascination {{with the question of}} human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have tried to read everything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a cult, something <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> against.|$|E

To eliminate this evil he dined with a Tamata family of Almora in 1911, and a Mehtar family of Agra in 1912.

He moved to Hartford to live with his sister Harriet and her husband in 1946, and the following year enrolled at the Boston Conservatory. At the Boston Conservatory Gryce developed his theoretical background and studied classical composition, writing three symphonies and a ballet in addition to other works. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> inspired and influenced by the work and philosophy of Boston Conservatory composer Alan Hovhaness, a musical eclectic whose passion was for melodicism and lyricism.|$|E

25|$|He did not {{hesitate}} to express his independent judgement (ijtihad). He stated his assessment as to which of the sources he cited was accurate. This was more understandably an aspect of his theology than of his history. This does not mean he saw himself as innovative. On the contrary, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> opposed to religious innovation. The story goes that when he was near death ibn Kamil suggested he forgive his enemies. He said he was willing to do so, except for the person who had described him as an innovator. In general Tabari's approach was conciliatory and moderate, seeking harmonious agreement between conflicting opinions.|$|E
25|$|Mijatović's name {{became known}} {{around the world}} thanks to a clairvoyant session that he {{attended}} together with a famous Victorian journalist William Thomas Stead. The result of the clairvoyant session that {{took place on the}} night of March 20, 1903, in Stead's opinion was that 'the bloody tragedy in the palace was seen clairvoyantly three months before it took place, and described in the hearing of at least a dozen credible witnesses'. Almost all the British dailies, as well as the American and continental press, commented on the prophecy. Later <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> influenced by Stead and became a leading Serbian adherent of spiritism.|$|E

Kraepelin emphasized the effects of environment and social background on psychological development.

25|$|Rocker became {{convinced}} {{that the source of}} political institutions is an irrational belief in a higher authority, as Bakunin claimed in God and the State. However, Rocker rejected the Russian's rejection of theoretical propaganda and his claim that only revolutions can bring about change. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> attracted by Bakunin's style, marked by pathos, emotion, and enthusiasm, designed to give the reader an impression of the heat of revolutionary moments. Rocker even attempted to emulate this style in his speeches, but was not very convincing. Kropotkin's anarcho-communist writings, on the other hand, were structured logically and contained an elaborate description of the future anarchist society. The work's basic premise, that an individual is entitled to receive the basic means of living from the community independently of his or her personal contributions, impressed Rocker.|$|E
25|$|Born in London but {{brought up}} in West Wales, Evans joined Glamorgan in the mid 1950s and became first-choice wicketkeeper after the {{retirement}} of Haydn Davies {{at the end of}} the 1958 season. For several seasons at the start of the 1960s, he was at or near the top of the wicketkeeping lists of dismissals with 79, 82 and then 89 dismissals in the seasons from 1961 to 1963. The 89 dismissals in 1963 set a new county record for Glamorgan, though it has since been surpassed by Eifion Jones, and made him the leading wicketkeeper of the year. As a right-handed batsman, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a tail-ender, though in a county side that had more than its fair share of rabbits, with Don Shepherd, Jeff Jones and Ossie Wheatley in the team, he often batted higher than he might have done in other sides.

25|$|Contemporary chroniclers are of {{the opinion}} that since Purandar Singha had passed his {{childhood}} through economic hardships during his father’s exile in Bengal, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> attracted to money and wealth. This explains the accusations which he had faced during both of his reigns. During his first reign, Purandar Singha and his father Brajanath Gohain, after being defeated by Burmese, fled to Guwahati taking all the valuables from the Royal treasury worth 3.5 million rupees, due to which the next ruler Chandrakanta Singha faced economic hardships in gathering mercenaries and maintaining the army to fight Burmese. During his second reign, as tributary prince under British, it was found that Purandar Singha was busy gathering personal wealth, instead of taking care of administration, which resulted in the growth of corruption among his officials. Some historians also stated his character as stubborn and firm from the fact that he refused to accept any pensions or grants from British Government. His son, Kameswar Singha also refused to accept pension from the British Government. Some sources said that it was actually Maniram Dewan who advised both father and son, not to accept any pension, as it might weaken their petition to restore their kingdom. After the fall of Ahom kingdom by Burmese invasion and subsequently by British occupation, Purandar Singha got an golden opportunity to restore Ahom rule in Upper Assam, but he ruined the chance by failing to pay the annual tribute of 50,000 rupees, resulted in the annexation of his kingdom by British, putting an end of 600 years of rule by Ahom dynasty.|$|E
