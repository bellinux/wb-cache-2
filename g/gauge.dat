5|$|In the {{prevailing}} Standard Model of physics, the photon {{is one of}} four <b>gauge</b> bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W− and Z0 and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the photon, these <b>gauge</b> bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU(2) <b>gauge</b> symmetry. The unification of the photon with W and Z <b>gauge</b> bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four <b>gauge</b> bosons with the eight gluon <b>gauge</b> bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.|$|E

Transformation operators relating twistors to harmonic spinors are found in terms of potential forms. These constructions are generalized to <b>gauged</b> twistor spinors and <b>gauged</b> harmonic spinors. The operators that transform <b>gauged</b> twistor spinors to <b>gauged</b> harmonic spinors are found. Symmetry {{operators of}} <b>gauged</b> harmonic spinors in terms of <b>gauged</b> conformal Killing-Yano forms are obtained.

5|$|The {{game has}} a tension <b>gauge,</b> {{increasing}} when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is {{stopped for a}} long time. When the <b>gauge</b> is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more damage than regular moves. A full <b>gauge</b> allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension <b>gauge</b> will not charge {{for the remainder of}} that round.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gauge</b> of the {{new line}} was not yet determined, {{although}} the estimates had been prepared {{on the basis that}} it would not exceed 6feet. Many of Grainger and Miller's lines had been to a <b>gauge</b> of 4ft6in; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (1831) had been at 4ft6½in (1,384mm) and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, authorised in 1836, was to be 5ft6in (1,676mm). Connections to local railways were considered important in determining the <b>gauge,</b> but the engineer Joseph Locke urged that conformity to the <b>gauge</b> of the English railways was important, and in the end this was adopted: standard <b>gauge,</b> 4ft8½in (1,435mm).|$|E
5|$|The {{line from}} Sandvika to Oslo was {{substantially}} upgraded between 1917 and 1922. From 27 February 1917 a passing loop was built at Lysaker and standard <b>gauge</b> traffic {{was carried out}} on the northern track. A southern track was then built, which was used by narrow <b>gauge</b> trains. However, both were dual <b>gauge.</b> All–standard <b>gauge</b> operations commenced on 9 February 1920, although the dual <b>gauge</b> was not removed until 1922. Electric traction started operation on 30 August 1922. An interlocking system was installed on 29 July 1924. From 1922 a half-hour headway was introduced on the local trains between Sandvika and Oslo West Station.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Statistical {{analysis}} of mean monthly rainfall measured by 31 <b>gauges</b> in the Freetown Peninsula shows clear differences between those facing the south-westerly monsoon {{and those in}} the peninsular rainshadow. Whilst catches between ocean-facing and rain-shadow <b>gauges</b> were very similar in the drier months of December to May, catches by ocean-facing <b>gauges</b> were considerably greater in the wetter months of June to October, and their catches varied less spatially. Rainfall in the monsoon months increased with altitude, but the relationships between monthly rainfall and altitude were more marked for rain-shadow <b>gauges</b> than for ocean-facing <b>gauges.</b> Rainfall in the monsoon months also tended to decrease with distance from the sea, and whilst the decreases were similar in magnitude for both rain-shadow and ocean-facing <b>gauges,</b> the decreases per km distance were less variable in the rain-shadow than where <b>gauges</b> faced the ocean. Two <b>gauges,</b> one in rain-shadow and one ocean-facing, were found to catch less than expected; and two <b>gauges</b> i...|$|R

5|$|In 1919, local {{politicians}} {{proposed that the}} line be built administratively {{as part of the}} Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow <b>gauge</b> used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard <b>gauge</b> until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow <b>gauge</b> track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard <b>gauge.</b>|$|E

The remainder of the lines beyond Exeter were converted to standard <b>gauge</b> on 21 May 1892 so the extra rails at Temple Meads fell into disuse and were removed to leave a purely standard <b>gauge</b> layout.

5|$|The {{location}} {{brings in}} the need to rely upon native flora and fauna to survive. This is manifested in a stamina <b>gauge,</b> which constantly depletes during gameplay. Failure to restore the <b>gauge</b> by eating has detrimental effects on gameplay, such as decreasing Snake's ability to aim his weapon and being heard by the enemy due to Snake's loud stomach grumbles.

However, some types of food rot over time, and consuming rotten foods may result in Snake developing a stomach ache, causing the stamina <b>gauge</b> to deplete faster.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} possesses several statistics, including hit points, power, and stamina, which can all increase upon gaining an experience level. Magic spells, which expend the character's MP, {{can be used}} to heal oneself or damage enemies. These spells can only be found in certain locations or obtained from other characters at specific plot intervals. In addition, the protagonist has a power <b>gauge</b> that affects his attack strength—the higher the <b>gauge,</b> the stronger his attack will be. The speed at which it fills is directly affected by the character's will level. The <b>gauge</b> will slowly fill up over time, but once the {{main character}} attacks, the <b>gauge</b> is emptied. When the <b>gauge</b> is completely filled up and the main character attacks with a weapon, he will perform a special attack.|$|E
