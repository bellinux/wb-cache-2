25|$|Luke Eger and 39 other farmers began Eagle Grange No. 1 on March 4, 1871 at {{the base}} of Bald Eagle Mountain in {{southern}} Lycoming County. They quickly set about reaching their goals. One of their most important goals was to set up a plan of co-operative purchasing farming supplies to drive down the prices. Merchants that refused to do business with the co-op were summarily boycotted by the members of the Grange. The farmers from Lycoming County also sought to have the rates charged to them by the railroads lowered and they pushed for rural <b>free</b> <b>delivery</b> from the Post Office. Eger and the other members of Eagle Grange No. 1 were quickly successful in establishing themselves as a force with which to be reckoned.|$|E
25|$|Eagle Grange No. 1 in Clinton Township was {{organized}} on March 4, 1871 {{by a group}} of rural farmers who had become concerned about the rising costs of farming in the post Civil War economy. It was the first grange to be organized in Pennsylvania, two years before the formation of the Pennsylvania State Grange and four years after The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, better known as the National Grange was founded in Fredonia, New York by Oliver Hudson Kelley. The chief objectives of the Eagle Grange No. 1 were the establishment of a co-operative purchasing program for farmers, the lowering of railroad rates, and the establishment of rural <b>free</b> <b>delivery</b> by the United States Postal Service. The Grange {{was one of the first}} national organizations to give equal status to female members.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of rural <b>free</b> <b>delivery</b> (RFD) by the Post Office in 1896, and in Canada in 1908, many rural residents had no access to the mail unless they collected it at a post office located many miles from their homes or hired a private express company to deliver it. For this reason, mailboxes did not become popular in rural North America until curbside RFD mail delivery by the Post Office was an established service. Even then, farmers and rural homeowners at first resisted the purchase of dedicated mailboxes, preferring to leave empty bushel baskets, tin boxes, or wooden crates at the roadside for the postman to deposit their mail. Not until 1923 did the Post Office finally mandate that every household install a mailbox or mail slot {{in order to receive}} home delivery of mail.|$|E

25|$|Ward, a young {{traveling}} salesman of dry goods, {{was concerned}} over {{the plight of}} many rural Midwest Americans who were, he thought, being overcharged and under-served {{by many of the}} small town retailers on whom they had to rely for their general merchandise. He opened his first mail-order house in 1872. By heavy use of the railroads centered on Chicago, and by associating his business with the non-profit Patrons of Husbandry (the Grangers), Ward offered rural customers a far larger stock than generally available in small towns and at a lower price. Unlike local country merchants, Ward offered no bargaining and no credit. His free catalog, printed by the most modern methods, was widely mailed to customers, allowing them to see pictures of consumer goods and imagine how they might be used. Later, Ward used the Post Office's Rural <b>Free</b> <b>Delivery</b> service; he lobbied for a parcel post system that came about in 1906. The early 20th century was the heyday of mail orders and Ward's had become an American tradition, along with its rival Sears Roebuck.|$|E

Then, in March 2006, Waitrose announced the purchase of five stores from Somerfield, with the first two stores in Scotland, both of which are in the capital, Edinburgh. In July 2006, Waitrose announced the purchase of six more stores and a distribution centre from Morrisons. In 2007 the first purpose-built Waitrose supermarket in the north of England opened at Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. In January 2009, Waitrose announced the purchase of an additional 13 stores from Somerfield which included a store in Glasgow marking its third opening in Scotland.

The findings are drawn from 54 semi-structured interviews with key informants who had technical and administrative or political responsibility for the policy at national, regional, district and health post level. These were carried out from November 2006 to January 2007. The evaluation findings emphasise the importance of careful planning and communication before a major national policy is implemented, and also of simple and clear definition of the package of 'free' services on offer. Long-term investment in supply will also be needed to increase access for the most remote areas...|$|R
