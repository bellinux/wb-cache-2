5|$|In drug design it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the {{concentrations}} of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures {{that are similar to}} adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.|$|E

The current urban-rural dual structure—or market-driven versus government-centered—is the underlying cause of the urban-rural divide. The digital divide between the two sectors could potentially intensify the current economic differences, causing more inequalities between the rural and urban sectors.

Collins (1991) suggests therapy targeting attainable goals that will have {{the greatest impact on}} an individual’s daily life, such as getting reliable yes/no answers or providing the patient gestures. Individuals with global aphasia usually respond well to treatment that includes personally relevant information, which is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> for therapy.|$|E

25|$|As {{with any}} {{pharmacological}} or hormone treatment, there are potential side effects, {{which in the}} case of hormone therapy include changes in sexual functioning. These have the ability to significantly impact sexual functioning, either directly or indirectly through the various side effects, such as cerebrovascular disorders, obesity, and mood fluctuations. In addition, some research has found an onset of diabetes following feminizing hormone therapy, which impairs sexual response. Whatever route an individual and his or her doctor choose to take, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> both the medical risks of hormone therapy as well as the psychological needs of the patient.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{the context}} in which these terms appear in the stories since, as a writer of fiction, Tolkien's primary purpose is to engage and {{entertain}} the reader while not being tied to a set terminology the way a military historian must be. Tolkien sometimes adopts just that historian stance going into great detail about tactical movements, weapons and formations as he does in The Battles of the Fords of Isen, or Cirion and Eorl. He can apply the same attention to detail to the drill of a shield-wall formation as to the intricacies of family relationships of the Sackville-Baggins.|$|E
25|$|Folic acid used in {{fortified}} foods is {{a synthetic}} form called pteroylmonoglutamate. It {{is in its}} oxidized state and contains only one conjugated glutamate residue. Folic acid therefore enters via a different carrier system from naturally occurring folate, and this may have different effects on folate binding proteins and its transporters. Folic acid has a higher bioavailability than natural folates and are rapidly absorbed across the intestine; therefore, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) when calculating one's intake. Natural occurring folate is equal to 1 DFE;, however, 0.6µg of folic acid is equal to 1 DFE.|$|E

25|$|The reminiscence bump {{has been}} studied cross-culturally and has been {{observed}} in various cultural backgrounds and experiences. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> {{that the process of}} remembering occurs in the context of culture, and memories found within the reminiscence bump are congruent with the culture's goals, values, and belief systems. The age of occurrence of the reminiscence bump is culturally influenced and reflects the age at which a culture identifies individuals as adults. In Western societies the reminiscence bump corresponds with adolescence and early adulthood, approximately from the ages of 10 to 30. In Asian cultures the reminiscence bump appears later than in Western cultures because adulthood may not be reached until 30.|$|E
25|$|Even during digestion, in general, one or {{two hours}} {{following}} a meal, insulin release from the pancreas is not continuous, but oscillates with a period of 3–6minutes, changing from generating a blood insulin concentration more than about 800 pmol/l to less than 100 pmol/l. This is thought to avoid downregulation of insulin receptors in target cells, and to assist the liver in extracting insulin from the blood. This oscillation is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> when administering insulin-stimulating medication, {{since it is the}} oscillating blood concentration of insulin release, which should, ideally, be achieved, not a constant high concentration. This may be achieved by delivering insulin rhythmically to the portal vein or by islet cell transplantation to the liver.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to depression, {{victims of domestic}} violence also commonly experience long-term anxiety and panic, and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by flashbacks, intrusive images, exaggerated startle response, nightmares, and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse. Studies have indicated that it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother's best efforts, interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events.|$|E

25|$|For Merleau-Ponty, it {{is these}} uses {{of the notion of}} style that lead Malraux to {{postulate}} a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the heart of this problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. (However, Merleau-Ponty's reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux's theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux.) For Merleau-Ponty, style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature.|$|E
25|$|Several {{factors may}} {{determine}} the extent to which circular migration is impactful upon the return of the migrant. First, the size of the returning population is important, as large numbers of migrants may form a critical mass necessary for true change to occur. Second, the duration of the absence of the migrants is influential, as too short of an absence brings little change and too long of an absence leads to difficulties in readjustment. Third, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> social class, as the elite may have a greater impact than unskilled workers. Fourth, the extent to which the origin and destination areas are different can have an effect, as those who migrate to metropolitan areas will have a greater impact if returning to an urban rather than a rural area. Lastly, the quantity and quality of the skills that the migrant acquires while abroad can determine the impact of migration.|$|E
25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, it is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, {{it may be necessary to}} introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
