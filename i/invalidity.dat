5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology fell away, {{leaving only a}} popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of the}} age by printing a derisive Discourse on the <b>Invalidity</b> of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E
5|$|Article 149(1) immunizes the Internal Security Act from <b>invalidity</b> due to {{inconsistency}} {{with five}} of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 12. The reference to Article 12 in Article 149(1) was enacted by Parliament in 1989 to reverse the effect of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), in which the Court of Appeal expressed the view that sections 8 and 10 of the Act violated Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|The {{church does}} not {{recognise}} divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the <b>invalidity</b> of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to <b>invalidity.</b> Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, after Harold Wilson's {{defeat of}} Edward Heath, Castle became Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. While serving in this position, Castle {{introduced}} {{a wide range}} of innovative welfare reforms, including the introduction of the mobility allowance, the Invalid Care Allowance (July 1976) for single women and others who give up their jobs to care for severely disabled relatives, the introduction of a non-contributory <b>invalidity</b> pension for disabled persons who had not qualified for <b>invalidity</b> pension, reforms in child allowances, and the linking of most social security benefits to earnings rather than prices.|$|E
25|$|Rader {{found that}} the Live Traffic paper was in a {{situation}} much more similar to the uncatalogued thesis in In re Bayer than the publicly disseminated posters in In re Klopfenstein. Rader concluded that the pre-publication Live Traffic paper could not be considered catalogued or indexed {{in a meaningful way}} and was not intended to be disseminated to the public. Rader concluded that, without additional information about the structure of SRI's FTP server, genuine issues of fact should have prevented the Delaware District Court from rendering summary judgment on the patent <b>invalidity</b> issues. The Federal Circuit thus vacated and remanded the Delaware District Court's determination of <b>invalidity</b> based on the Live Traffic paper.|$|E
25|$|In {{recognition}} of her war time service she {{was awarded the}} O.B.E. at a ceremony in Maidstone in Kent in 1918. However her grateful nation did not approve an <b>invalidity</b> pension for Lethbridge because she had lied about her age {{in order to work}} at the munitions factory.|$|E
25|$|We do {{not believe}} that Congress {{contemplated}} that such a taxpayer, without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of <b>invalidity</b> to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of <b>invalidity,</b> constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, and, when he did, was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of <b>invalidity</b> and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who “willfully” refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must take the risk of being wrong.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{support was}} {{provided}} for nursery school building, and a long-term capital investment programme in school building was launched. A Family Fund {{was set up}} to provide assistance to families with children who had congenital conditions, while new benefits were introduced benefiting hundreds of thousands of disabled persons whose disabilities had been caused neither by war nor by industrial injury. An Attendance Allowance was introduced for those needing care at home, together with <b>Invalidity</b> Benefit for the long-term sick, while a higher Child Allowance was made available where <b>invalidity</b> allowance was paid. Widow's Benefits were introduced for those aged between forty and fifty years of age, improved subsidies for slum clearance were made available, while Rent Allowances were introduced for private tenants. In April 1971, the right to education was given to all children with Down's syndrome for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Edward Heath's {{government}} {{brought in}} a raft of new social security payments including <b>Invalidity</b> Benefit, which was introduced in 1971 to go some way towards replacing the wages {{of people who had}} been 'invalided out' of their occupation after developing a long-term illness or a disability. It was worth more than basic Unemployment Benefit paid to people without disabilities.|$|E
25|$|His father began {{claiming}} long-term {{sickness benefit}} – known then as <b>Invalidity</b> Benefit – {{the year before}} Crabb was born. His mother separated from his father when Crabb was eight years old. She raised him and his two brothers on a council estate, living on benefits and receiving help from family, friends and the Baptist church. His father continued to live in Pembrokeshire, but the two rarely spoke.|$|E
25|$|Icon sets, which {{precede the}} text in a cell with an icon that {{represent}} {{some aspect of the}} value of the cell with respect to other values in a group of cells, can also be applied. Icons can be conditionally applied to show up only when certain criteria are met, such as a cross showing up on an invalid value, where the condition for <b>invalidity</b> can be specified by the user.|$|E
25|$|If {{the horns}} or the hoofs of the Red Cow were black, they were chopped off, and the Red Cow was then valid. The cow's eye, teeth, and tongue could cause no <b>invalidity.</b> And a dwarf-like cow was {{nonetheless}} valid. If the Red Cow had a sebaceous cyst and they cut it off, Rabbi Judah ruled the cow invalid, but Rabbi Simeon ruled it invalid only if no red hair grew in its place.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} times, the Reverend John Jay Hughes, among {{a few other}} Roman Catholic writers, {{concluded}} that there were enough flaws in and ambiguity surrounding the pope's apostolic letter to merit re-examination {{of the question of}} the <b>invalidity</b> of Anglican holy orders. Father Hughes himself had previously been an Anglican priest and was subsequently conditionally (sub conditione) ordained in the Roman Catholic Church. Other Anglican theological critics argued that apostolic succession had never been broken in the first place, due to valid ordinations tracing back to Archbishop Laud and beyond to Archbishop Parker.|$|E
25|$|Paragraph 376 – Any {{person who}} obtains a {{marriage}} certificate knowing {{it to be}} invalid for any reason in secular or canonical law and any person who issues such certificate knowing the marriage to be invalid is punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 7 years or by detention. The penalty will be a term of imprisonment not exceeding 10 years if the spouse, in respect of whom {{the reason for the}} <b>invalidity</b> has arisen, conceals that fact from his partner or consummates the marriage {{on the basis of the}} invalid certificate.|$|E
25|$|Some {{hold the}} view that {{informal}} logic is not a branch or subdiscipline of logic, or even {{the view that}} there cannot be {{such a thing as}} informal logic. Massey criticizes informal logic {{on the grounds that it}} has no theory underpinning it. Informal logic, he says, requires detailed classification schemes to organize it, which in other disciplines is provided by the underlying theory. He maintains that there is no method of establishing the <b>invalidity</b> of an argument aside from the formal method, and that the study of fallacies may be of more interest to other disciplines, like psychology, than to philosophy and logic.|$|E
25|$|In July 1415 {{he enlisted}} with Thomas Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel {{to take part}} in Henry 's first {{expedition}} to France. Arundel's force consisted of 100 men-at-arms and 300 mounted archers, including the Corbet brothers. The Siege of Harfleur brought a devastating outbreak of dysentery, which was the main cause of death and <b>invalidity</b> in his retinue. A quarter of the force were casualties of the siege. Both Burley and Arundel were invalided home and did not take part in the Agincourt campaign. Arundel returned to England on 28 September to recuperate at Arundel Castle, attended by William Burley, but died there on 13 October. Burley returned to England on 4 October.|$|E
25|$|During the War of 1812, Black Hawk, now 45, {{served as}} a war leader of a Sauk band at their village of Saukenuk, which fielded about 200 warriors. He {{supported}} the <b>invalidity</b> of Quashquame's Treaty of St. Louis (1804) between the Sauk and Fox nations and then-Governor William Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory that ceded territory, including Saukenuk, to the United States. The Sauk and Fox are consensus-based decision makers and those representatives sent to the meeting with the US government {{did not have the}} power to cede tribal territory although Quashquame did. The lack of the consensus aspect by each the Sauk and Fox councils the treaty could never be considered valid by Black Hawk and other traditionalists. Black Hawk took part in skirmishes against US forces at the newly constructed Fort Madison in the disputed land; {{this was the first time}} he fought directly against the U.S. Army.|$|E
25|$|Sauk warrior Black Hawk, {{the leader}} of a band of Sauks near Rock Island at Saukenuk, was always in {{opposition}} to ceding Native American lands to white settlers and their governments. Black Hawk supported the <b>invalidity</b> of the Treaty of St. Louis (1804) of both the Sauk and Fox nations negotiated with the then Indiana Territory Governor William Henry Harrison. The treaty ceded territory, including Black Hawk's birthplace Saukenuk, to the United States. The Sauk are a consensus decision making society. Their representatives exceeded the authorization of merely taking under consideration what terms the United States government might put forth, bring them back to reach a consensus and then return with their treaty terms. The lack of the tribe discussing the treaty prior to being made official made it invalid by Black Hawk {{and other members of the}} tribe. The representatives never had the tribal authorization to unilaterally cede its lands.|$|E
25|$|The {{extrinsic}} grounds {{were said}} to be in the fact of the implicit approval of the Holy See given to the constant practice of unconditionally ordaining former Anglican priests who desired to be priests in the Roman Catholic Church and, also, in the explicit declarations of the Holy See as to the <b>invalidity</b> of Anglican orders on every occasion when its decision was given. According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, to attempt to confer orders a second time on the same person would be a sacrilege. Rome, by knowingly allowing the practice of ordaining former Anglican priests, supposed that their orders were invalid. The bull points out that orders received in the Church of England, according to the change introduced into the Ritual under King Edward VI, were thought to be invalid by the Roman Catholic Church. This was not through a custom grown up gradually, but from the date of that change in the ritual.|$|E
25|$|Increases {{were made}} in {{pensions}} and other benefits during Wilson's {{first year in office}} that were the largest ever real term increases carried out up until that point. Social security benefits were markedly increased during Wilson's first two years in office, as characterised by a budget passed in the final quarter of 1964 which raised the standard benefit rates for old age, sickness and <b>invalidity</b> by 18.5%. In 1965, the government increased the national assistance rate to a higher level relative to earnings, and via annual adjustments, broadly maintained the rate at between 19% and 20% of gross industrial earnings until the start of 1970. In the five years from 1964 up until the last increases made by the First Wilson Government, pensions went up by 23% in real terms, supplementary benefits by 26% in real terms, and sickness and unemployment benefits by 153% in real terms (largely {{as a result of the}} introduction of earnings-related benefits in 1967).|$|E
25|$|The early Anabaptists {{believed}} that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships. Therefore, the church should not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor {{by the use of}} the sword; Christianity was a matter of individual conviction, which could not be forced on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it. Protestant ecclesial leaders such as Hubmaier and Hofmann preached the <b>invalidity</b> of infant baptism, advocating baptism as following conversion ("believer's baptism") instead. This was not a doctrine new to the reformers, but was taught by earlier groups, such as the Albigenses in 1147. Though most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. Thomas Müntzer was involved in the German Peasants' War. Andreas Karlstadt disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers. Kaspar Schwenkfeld and Sebastian Franck were influenced by German mysticism and spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, then Peter MacKay, again denied Khadr's application, {{this time}} invoking section 10.1 of the amended Canadian Passport Order. Section 10.1 was later {{challenged}} in Federal Court by Fateh Kamel, whose passport {{had also been}} refused for national security reasons. On March 13, 2008, the Federal Court declared section 10.1 of the Canadian Passport Order to be unconstitutional and therefore invalid, though the court suspended its declaration of <b>invalidity</b> for six months {{in order to allow}} the government time to amend the order. The federal government launched an appeal at the Federal Court of Appeal and a ruling handed down on January 29, 2009 overturned the lower court decision. The court unanimously agreed the denial of passport service on national grounds is in compliance with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, citing the limitation clause (Section 1) as its main decision point. Kamel launched an appeal in 2009 to the Supreme Court of Canada but the court declined to hear his case and thus ended the legality challenge to the Canadian Passport Order.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the powers}} of law {{enforcement}} officers to conduct covert surveillance had been largely unchecked before 2005. The legal basis for covert surveillance first came under scrutiny in two criminal cases in the District Court in 2005. To plug the loophole, the Chief Executive promulgated the Law Enforcement (Covert Surveillance Procedure) Order in August 2005. Leung Kwok-hung and Koo Sze Yiu, two political activists who claimed they had probably been targets of covert surveillance, brought an action to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} practice of covert surveillance. They succeeded at the Court of First Instance, which held that section 33 of the Telecommunication Ordinance and the Order were both unconstitutional. The former created the power to intercept communications without adequate safeguards against abuse. The later failed to comply with the procedural requirement in the Basic Law. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal suspended for six months the declaration of <b>invalidity</b> of the unconstitutional provisions, so that new legislation can be introduced to regulate covert surveillance. The Interception of Communications and Surveillance Ordinance (Cap. 589) was passed by the Legislative Council on 6 August 2006 after a 58-hour debate.|$|E
25|$|Under Olof Palme's premiership tenure, matters {{concerned}} with child care centers, social security, {{protection of the}} elderly, accident safety, and housing problems received special attention. Under Palme the public health system in Sweden became efficient, with the infant mortality rate standing at 12 per 1,000 live births. An ambitious redistributive programme was carried out, with special help provided to the disabled, immigrants, the low paid, single-parent families, and the old. The Swedish welfare state was significantly expanded from a position already {{one of the most}} far-reaching in the world during his time in office. As noted by Isabela Mares, {{during the first half of}} the Seventies “the level of benefits provided by every subsystem of the welfare state improved significantly.” Various policy changes increased the basic old-age pension replacement rate from 42% of the average wage in 1969 to 57%, while a health care reform carried out in 1974 integrated all health services and increased the minimum replacement rate from 64% to 90% of earnings. In 1974, supplementary unemployment assistance was established, providing benefits to those workers ineligible for existing benefits. In 1971, eligibility for <b>invalidity</b> pensions was extended with greater opportunities for employees over the age of 60. In 1974, universal dental insurance was introduced, and former maternity benefits were replaced by a parental allowance. In 1974, housing allowances for families with children were raised and these allowances were extended to other low-income groups. Childcare centres were also expanded under Palme, and separate taxation of husband and wife introduced. Access to pensions for older workers in poor health was liberalised in 1970, and a disability pension was introduced for older unemployed workers in 1972.|$|E

500|$|Another {{provision}} that is rescued from potential <b>invalidity</b> by Article 12(2) is the Government's constitutional mandate to exercise its functions {{in such a}} way as to recognize the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore. The Government has a responsibility to [...] "protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language". The Constitution also requires the Legislature to enact legislation to regulate Muslim religious affairs and to establish a council to advise the President concerning matters relating to Islam. The legislation in question is the Administration of Muslim Law Act.|$|E
500|$|The {{plan was}} {{enacted by the}} Virginia Assembly on September 22, 1956, and {{signed into law by}} Governor Stanley on September 29. A federal court struck down a portion of the Stanley plan as unconstitutional in January 1957. By 1960, nearly all of the major {{elements}} of the plan (including the litigation curbs aimed at the NAACP) had been struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal and state courts. The constitutional <b>invalidity</b> of the Stanley plan led new governor of Virginia, James Lindsay Almond, Jr., to propose [...] "passive resistance" [...] to school integration in 1959. [...] The Supreme Court declared portions of [...] "passive resistance" [...] unconstitutional in 1964 and again in 1968.|$|E
500|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of uncertainty {{that can affect}} the validity of a trust: conceptual uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. [...] "Conceptual uncertainty" [...] is where the language is unclear, something {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. [...] "Evidential uncertainty" [...] is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to <b>invalidity.</b> [...] "Ascertainability" [...] is where a beneficiary cannot be found, while [...] "administrative unworkability" [...] is where the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically carried out.

500|$|Gates {{continued}} to have hopes {{of being able to}} take on [...] J. P. Morgan again-this time with a rival steel trust. [...] After the sale of his Louisville and Nashville Railroad stocks to Morgan in 1902, Gates quietly began buying shares of Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. [...] He and his associates easily owned more than 50 percent of the company's stock shares, but the company's owner and founder, John C. Osgood, claimed the shares were not valid. [...] Osgood said that while the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, any transfer of the shares without his signature and approval, made them invalid. [...] He {{went on to say that}} because of their <b>invalidity,</b> those who held shares of the company's stock without them, were not eligible to attend the annual stockholders' meeting. [...] Osgood was upheld in this opinion by the company's board of directors.|$|E
500|$|In 1944, Erich Pommer and Hans Janowitz each {{separately}} {{attempted to}} obtain the legal rights to the film, with hopes of a Hollywood remake. Pommer attempted to argue he had a better claim to the rights because the primary value of the original film came not from the writing, but [...] "in the revolutionary way the picture was produced". However, both Janowitz and Pommer ran into complications related to the <b>invalidity</b> of Nazi law in the United States, and uncertainty over the legal rights of sound and silent films. Janowitz wrote a treatment for a remake, and in January 1945 was offered a minimum guarantee of $16,000 against a five-percent royalty for his rights to the original film for a sequel to be directed by Fritz Lang, but the project never came to fruition. Later, Janowitz planned a sequel called Caligari II, and unsuccessfully attempted to sell the property to a Hollywood producer for $30,000.|$|E
