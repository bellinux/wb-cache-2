5000|$|... "Invasion of the Bite Lice" [...] (1) - The Dragozaur's base {{begins to}} crumble without {{a supply of}} life force, and Diamond Ryugu sends Drago Wing to Earth to command an army of <b>bite</b> <b>lice.</b> At the same time, Rick visits the Dinotarium {{for the first time}} while staying over at Kaito's home. Soon, a {{miniature}} Drago Wing and his <b>bite</b> <b>lice</b> army invade the Earth, covering it with Diamond Ryugu's dark energy. The Dino Knights are disabled, and so the kids venture out to observe what is going on. The <b>bite</b> <b>lice</b> are deployed and begin covering everything in sight, terrorizing the city's inhabitants, as Diamond Ryugu begins a search for something important to her on Earth. Rick summons the Cerasaur brothers to help fight the <b>bite</b> <b>lice,</b> and after Dino Ictheo and the Dino Weapons join the fray, discover that the lice are afraid of chickens, they are all able to drive the lice away. Unfortunately, their victory is short-lived as Diamond Ryugu finds and kidnaps Dino Rhamph, for use in a giant planet-killer life force extractor. All of the assembled Dino Knights then begin a final desperate attack on Ryugu and her device.|$|R
25|$|Limpkins in Florida were {{examined}} for parasites, which included trematodes, nematodes and <b>biting</b> <b>lice.</b> Two <b>biting</b> <b>lice</b> species were found, Laemobothrion cubense and Rallicola funebris. The trematode Prionosoma serratum {{was found in}} the intestines of some birds, this species may enter the bird after first infecting apple snails (this {{has been shown to be}} the route of infection for a closely related trematode to infect snail kites). Nematodes Amidostomum acutum and Strongyloides sp. are also ingested and live in the gut.|$|R
40|$|A study {{into the}} death rate and pathomorphological changes in the tissues of {{chickens}} experimentally infected with <b>biting</b> <b>lice</b> from the species Eomenacanthus stramineus Nitzsch (1818), Menacanthus cornutus Schömmer (1913), Menopon gallinae L.

Following necropsy of dead birds and after histological investigation of skin, muscle, spleen, liver, lungs and kidney specimens, multiple wounds and haemorrhages were macroscopically observed on skin surface, while histologically in all cutaneous layers, {{as well as in}} the other studies, tissue hyperaemia, haemorrhages, haemosiderosis, pseudoeosinophilic and hystiocytic infiltration were present. Inflammation of the small intestines was also noticed. The evidenced changes were of both local and systemic character. Local lesions were due to the direct aggression of Mallophaga. The systemic changes were manifestations of the sensitization and intoxication that occurred in the avian organism following the <b>biting</b> <b>lice</b> infestation...|$|R
5|$|Wolves {{are often}} infested {{with a variety}} of {{arthropod}} exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite), though they rarely develop full blown mange, unlike foxes. Lice, such as Trichodectes canis, may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The tick Dermacentor pictus also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include <b>biting</b> <b>lice,</b> sucking lice and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis.|$|R
50|$|The Mallophaga are a {{suborder}} of lice, {{known as}} chewing <b>lice,</b> <b>biting</b> <b>lice</b> or bird lice, containing more than 3000 species. These lice are external parasites that feed mainly on birds, although some species also feed on mammals. They infest {{both domestic and}} wild animals and birds, and cause considerable irritation to their hosts. They have paurometabolis or incomplete metamorphosis.|$|R
50|$|Ectoparasites {{known to}} infest polecats include flea {{species such as}} Ctenocephalides felis, Archaeospylla erinacei, Nosopsyllus fasciatus and Paraceras melis. The tick Ixodes hexagonus is the polecat's most common ectoparasite, which is {{sometimes}} found in large numbers on the neck and behind the ears. Another, less common species to infest polecats is I. canisuga. The <b>biting</b> <b>louse</b> Trichodectes jacobi is also known to infest polecats.|$|R
50|$|Pediculosis is {{more common}} in cattle than any other type of domesticated animal. This is a {{significant}} problem, as it can cause weight loss of 55 to 75 pounds per animal. Some species of lice infesting cattle include the cattle <b>biting</b> <b>louse</b> (Bovicola bovis), the shortnosed cattle louse (Haematopinus eurysternus), the longnosed cattle louse (Linognathus vituli), and the little blue cattle louse (Solenopotes capillatus).|$|R

It is the type host for the nematode species Aproctella nuda, the feather mite species Euchineustathia tricapitosetosa, and the <b>biting</b> <b>lice</b> species [...] Dennyus dubius, and is also known to carry the tapeworm species Pseudochoanotaenia collocaliae. Its nest is known to host the Hemiptera species Cimexopsis nyctali, {{which is similar to}} the bedbug and can (on rare occasions) become a pest species in houses.|$|R
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of <b>biting</b> <b>louse</b> found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Fractures {{have been}} {{described}} mainly following falling accidents in horse-related injuries. <b>Horse</b> <b>bites</b> are uncommon accidents. We present a case of open fracture of the forearm due to <b>horse</b> <b>bite.</b> Case Report: A 35 -year-old male farm-worker presented {{to the emergency room}} with alleged history of <b>horse</b> <b>bite</b> to the right forearm about 2 hours prior to presentation while feeding the horse. There was deformity of the forearm with multiple puncture wounds, deep abrasions and small lacerations on the distal-third of the forearm. Copious irrigation with normal saline was done and he was administered anti-tetanus and post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was commenced. Radiographs revealed fracture of radius and ulna in the mid-shaft region. He underwent emergency wound debridement, and the ulna was stabilised with an intra-medullary square nail. Seventy-two hours later, he underwent re-debridement and conversion osteosynthesis. He had an uneventful recovery and at three-month follow-up, the fractures had healed radiographically in anatomic alignment. At two-year follow-up, he is doing well, is pain free and has a normal range of motion compared to the contralateral side. Conclusion: <b>Horse</b> <b>bites</b> behave as compound fractures however rabies prophylaxis will be needed and careful observation is needed. Early radical debridement, preliminary skeletal stabilisation, re-debridement and conversion osteosynthesis to plate, and antibiotic prophylaxis were the key to the successful management of our patient.

40|$|The sheep <b>biting</b> <b>louse,</b> Bovicola ovis (Schrank), is an {{economically}} important, worldwide ectoparasite of sheep. In Australia, up to 30 % of sheep flocks are infested with lice. The usual {{method of control}} has been synthetic pyrethroids applied as pour-on {{along the back of}} the sheep, but treatment failures have become widespread since 1985 because of the development of resistance. We used allozyme markers to study the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations of lice on different farms in Western Australia. Genetic variation within populations was similar to previously reported values for other ectoparasitic arthropods. Heterozygote deficiencies were found at 1 locus in a number of population and another 2 loci in 1 other population. However, another variable locus conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and there was little evidence of extensive linkage disequilibrium between loci. Further studies are necessary to establish the breeding system. Genetic differences among populations were not related to geographic separation, which is consistent with an island model of population structure. A small but significant proportion (2. 8 %) of the total genetic variation was distributed among populations' equivalent under the island model to a gene flow of 8. 7 individuals exchanged per generation. The implications of this result are discussed in terms of controlling and managing synthetic pyrethroid resistance in sheep <b>biting</b> <b>lice...</b>|$|R

40|$|Nest ectoparasites {{have been}} linked {{previously}} to patterns of nest-site choice and breeding success in birds. Recent research has shown nestboxes facing south-southwest are occupied less frequently by great tits (Parus major) than identical boxes facing other directions, and are associated with reduced offspring condition. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that these findings are due to ectoparasite load being directionally nonuniform, possibly because of nonuniformity in nestbox internal temperature. Nests contained, in order of prevalence, hen fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae), haematophagous blowflies (Protocalliphora spp.), <b>biting</b> <b>lice</b> (Ischnocera), and ticks/mites (Acari). Although southwest-facing nestboxes were significantly warmer than other boxes, there was no directional difference in total ectoparasite load or abundance of particular species. Similarly, there was no relationship between abundance of any ectoparasite species (either per-nest or per-chick) and avian offspring condition determined using wing length or relative mass.
