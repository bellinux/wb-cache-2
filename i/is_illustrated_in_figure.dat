25|$|As is {{the case}} with {{dimensions}} determined for lines, squares, and cubes, fractal dimensions are general descriptors that do not uniquely define patterns. The value of D for the Koch fractal discussed above, for instance, quantifies the pattern's inherent scaling, but does not uniquely describe nor provide enough information to reconstruct it. Many fractal structures or patterns could be constructed that have the same scaling relationship but are dramatically different from the Koch curve, as <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 6.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the possible in-flight performance and motor skill changes that were described above, the immediate CNS effects (i.e., within 24 hours following exposure to low-LET radiation) are anorexia and nausea. These prodromal risks are dose-dependent and, as such, can provide {{an indicator of the}} exposure dose. Estimates are ED50 = 1.08 Gy for anorexia, ED50 = 1.58 Gy for nausea, and ED50=2.40 Gy for emesis. The relative effectiveness of different radiation types in producing emesis was studied in ferrets and <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> 6-7. High-LET radiation at doses that are below 0.5 Gy show greater relative biological effectiveness compared to low-LET radiation. The acute effects on the CNS, which are associated with increases in cytokines and chemokines, may lead to disruption in the proliferation of stem cells or memory loss that may contribute to other degenerative diseases.|$|E

The difference <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 8, where black represents the best response correspondence and the other colors each represent different smoothed best response functions. In standard best response correspondences, even the slightest benefit to one action will result in the individual playing that action with probability 1.

2500|$|The Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) {{model for}} concerted {{allosteric}} transitions went {{a step further}} by exploring cooperativity based on thermodynamics and three-dimensional conformations. It was originally formulated for oligomeric proteins with symmetrically arranged, identical subunits, {{each of which has}} one ligand binding site. According to this framework, two (or more) interconvertible conformational states of an allosteric protein coexist in a thermal equilibrium. The states [...] - often termed tense (T) and relaxed (R) - differ in affinity for the ligand molecule. The ratio between the two states is regulated by the binding of ligand molecules that stabilizes the higher-affinity state. Importantly, all subunits of a molecule change states at the same time, a phenomenon known as [...] "concerted transition". The MWC model <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> 3.|$|E
