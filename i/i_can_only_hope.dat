5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon {{magazine was}} critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode {{leading up to the}} heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode {{had little to do with}} the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files [...] "Endgame" [...] promotion strategy. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this was a pleasant yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace. It is the first time that we get a glimpse of what the writers are thinking as the series comes to a close. Now all that's left is the mythology, which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> will end on a similarly pleasant note." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that [...] "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a [...] "paean to medium of television itself" [...] and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.|$|E

2500|$|Game Informer's Matt Bertz {{awarded the}} game a 9 out of 10, concluding: [...] "NBA 2K16 {{is the first}} true classic sports game of this console generation. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> other sports games follow Visual Concepts’ steadfast {{dedication}} to innovating on both the gameplay and game mode fronts." [...] Bertz praised the MyCareer acting, commentary, the visuals, calling it the [...] "best-looking sports game ever made", the [...] "ambitious" [...] changes and [...] "innovations", the [...] "stellar" [...] gameplay, and the depth, saying the game [...] "offers the most value you'll find in a sports game".|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{remarked to}} Lyell, [...] "I {{must be a}} very bad explainer... Several Reviews, & several letters have shown me too clearly how little I am understood. I suppose natural {{selection}} was bad term; but to change it now, I think, would make confusion worse confounded. Nor can I think of better; Natural preservation would not imply a preservation of particular varieties & would seem a truism; & would not bring man's & nature's selection under one point of view. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> by reiterated explanations finally to make matter clearer." [...] It was too illegible for Lyell, and Darwin later apologised [...] "I am utterly ashamed & groan over my hand-writing. It was Natural Preservation. Natural persecution is what the author ought to suffer." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, September 19, {{when the}} regular brigade was falling back, he behaved with most {{conspicuous}} gallantry; {{with a sword}} {{in one hand and}} his bugle in the other, he sounded constantly the [...] "Halt," [...] the [...] "Rally," [...] and the [...] "Forward;" [...] espying a stand of colors belonging to the Eighteenth U. S. Infantry, he rushed up to them and sounded [...] "To the color." [...] His conduct attracted the notice and elicited the admiration of the whole brigade. On Sunday, September 20, before our battalion was engaged, the Eighteenth, being pressed by vastly superior numbers, was falling back; Carson by some means became the possessor of a musket and constituted himself a [...] "provost guard." [...] One of the officers attempted to pass him, but he positively refused to allow it, stating that it was against his orders. All this time he continued to sound the various calls on his bugle. I regret to state that his fate remains a mystery; he was last seen by me late on Sunday afternoon behind the breastworks. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that he is a prisoner."....|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can well}} imagine how {{all this has}} shocked me. Uncle seemed so [...] strong and well that I have always thought he would live to a great [...] age. He is sixty-eight, but I am sure he looks ten years [...] younger--at least he did so; at present he might be ninety. But <b>I</b> [...] <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that the change is temporary, {{and that he will}} soon [...] be his dear self again. The three doctors {{are going to have a}} [...] meeting here to-morrow. I shall be anxious, indeed, to hear the [...] result. I hope that they will order him a change, and that we can [...] go down together, either to his place or mine; then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> always be [...] with him, whereas here he goes his way and I go mine, and except at [...] meal-times we {{scarcely}} meet. If he does go I shall try and persuade [...] him to engage a medical man to go with us. Of course, I do not know [...] whether a doctor could be of any actual use in case of another [...] attack, but it would be a great comfort to have one always at [...] hand." ...|$|R

40|$|First and {{foremost}} I {{would like to}} thank my parents. Without your unending support and guidance I would not {{have had the opportunity to}} pursue this crazy life in the theatre.

Many thanks go to all the graduate professors and faculty members who have guided me along the way.

Thank you to Joanna Battles, Rick Holden, Les Wade, and Molly Buchmann for helping me become a more versatile actor. Thanks to David Rodriguez, EJ Cho, Kristin Sosnowsky, Vastine Stabler, Ken White, Jim Bussolati, John Raley, and Jim Murphy for creating a model of professionalism I hope to always be a part of. John Dennis, you truly are a one-of-a-kind teacher. When <b>I</b> <b>can</b> “get out of my head ” it is because of you.

George Judy, I thank you for the opportunities you have given me and the times you too...|$|R
2500|$|Lind said of {{assuming}} the role, [...] "The audition for Bianca {{felt like an}} amusement park ride. It was such a thrill {{to go to an}} audition by plane rather than subway! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> I do half of what [...] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it." [...] Regarding Bianca being the [...] "moral center of Pine Valley" [...] and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did feel pressure in the beginning. [...] "I did look at some of [...] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca." [...] Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me feels very strongly that [...] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone else’s interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting to support your family and be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, [...] "I can feel the pressure, but I am going to let it go." [...] The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.|$|E

Last time he boldly avowed his share in the murder; this time, most conveniently for him, the Parisians are ready and eager to do his work for him. Dismiss from your mind all doubt; you can rely upon everything that I have told you as being true. Whether you can convince these young knights is a matter that concerns me not; but remember that if you fail to convince your mistress, her life and those of her children are forfeited; and that, so far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see, her <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> of safety is in taking refuge here." ...|$|R
