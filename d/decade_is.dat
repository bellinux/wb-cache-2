5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course. She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time to rein in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next <b>decade</b> <b>is</b> to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} <b>decade</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded as}} the most successful in the club's history as they finished second during the 1923–24 season, losing out on winning the league title on the goal average system used {{at the time to}} Huddersfield Town. During this period, they reached two FA Cup finals, losing 1–0 to Sheffield United in 1925 before returning to the final two years later, beating Arsenal 1–0 at Wembley Stadium in 1927. They also won the FA Charity Shield after beating amateur side Corinthians 2–1. Cardiff remain the only non-English side to have ever won the FA Cup or FA Charity Shield.|$|E
5|$|The town centre, {{which has}} seen {{significant}} regeneration {{over the past}} <b>decade,</b> <b>is</b> dominated by its distinctive town hall (Hôtel de Ville) at Place du Soldat Inconnu. It {{was built in the}} Flemish Renaissance style between 1911 and 1925 to commemorate the unification of the cities of Calais and Saint Pierre in 1885. A previous town hall had been erected in 1818. One of the most elegant landmarks in the city, its ornate 74 metre (246ft) high clock tower and belfry can be seen from out to sea and chimes throughout the day and has been protected by UNESCO since 2005 as part of a series of belfries across the region. The building parts have also been listed as a series of historic monuments by government decree of 26 June 2003, including its roofs and belfry, main hall, glass roof, the staircase, corridor serving the first floor, the rooms on the first floor (including decoration): the wedding room, the VIP lounge, the lounge of the council and the cabinet room. The hall has stained glass windows and numerous paintings and exquisite decor. It houses police offices.|$|E

25|$|One {{problem the}} extreme {{southern}} part of the state has had in the past <b>decade</b> <b>is</b> the contamination of water from the drainage of the Valley of Mexico. Mexico City pumps out excess water from the area, as the valley has no natural drainage, to the north into Mexico and Hidalgo states. This water is increasingly polluted and is causing damage to these northern zones. The state is negotiating federal and other help to treat and recycle this water so that it does not do further damage to state agriculture and environment.|$|E
25|$|The <b>decade</b> <b>is</b> {{seeing a}} , {{with a large}} number of all-female heavy metal bands forming and gaining {{mainstream}} attention. Although not the first to form, Aldious have been cited as the initiators of the movement when their debut album Deep Exceed (2010) topped the Oricon Indies Albums Chart and reached number 15 on the main chart. Another notable girls metal band is Cyntia, who formed in 2011 and are {{believed to be the first}} of the movement to sign to a major record label. Band-Maid also earned international attention in 2016 after signing with Crown Stones in Japan and JPU Records in the UK.|$|E

25|$|The 64 braille {{patterns}} are arranged into decades {{based on the}} numerical order of those patterns. The first decade are the numerals 1 through 0, which utilize only the top and mid row of the cell; the 2nd through 4th decades are derived from the first by adding dots to the bottom now; the 5th <b>decade</b> <b>is</b> created by shifting the first decade downwards. In addition, for each decade there are two additional mirror-image patterns, and finally there are three patterns that utilize only the bottom row of the cell. The final pattern, the empty cell , {{is used as a}} space; it has the same width as the others.|$|E
25|$|A logical {{scheme is}} to produce {{resistors}} {{in a range of}} values which increase in a geometric progression, so that each value is greater than its predecessor by a fixed multiplier or percentage, chosen to match the tolerance of the range. For example, for a tolerance of ±20% it makes sense to have each resistor about 1.5 times its predecessor, covering a decade in 6 values. In practice the factor used is 1.4678, giving values of 1.47, 2.15, 3.16, 4.64, 6.81, 10 for the 1–10-decade (a <b>decade</b> <b>is</b> a range increasing by a factor of 10; 0.1–1 and 10–100 are other examples); these are rounded in practice to 1.5, 2.2, 3.3, 4.7, 6.8, 10; followed, by 15, 22, 33, … and preceded by … 0.47, 0.68, 1. This scheme has been adopted as the E48 series of the IEC 60063 preferred number values. There are also E12, E24, E48, E96 and E192 series for components of progressively finer resolution, with 12, 24, 96, and 192 different values within each decade. The actual values used are in the IEC 60063 lists of preferred numbers.|$|E

500|$|Jamieson Cox, from Time, {{wrote that}} [...] "if {{you needed a}} {{reminder}} of just how thoroughly Mariah Carey dominated the 90s, or a refresher on the staggering force of the numbers she’s put up throughout her career, #1 To Infinity will do just fine", but also pointing out {{that most of the}} songs were released from 1990 to 1995, just 20% of Carey's entire recording career, as well as criticizing the lack of material released from 2005 onwards; [...] "in 2015, we’re as far away from 'We Belong Together' as that song was from 'Fantasy', and that lost <b>decade</b> <b>is</b> the root of this compilation’s greatest tragedy [...] the great majority of the fine work Carey’s done in the last decade might as well not exist". Nonetheless, he praised the compilation for highlighting [...] "the sheer athleticism and skill that propelled Carey’s early work. She took very simple songs—both in terms of arrangements and theme—rooted in pop, gospel, and R and turned them into feats of strength, granting them dynamism and drama with a voice that juggled power, clarity, and agility with ease".|$|E
500|$|Brian Linder of IGN commented [...] "2004's Greatest Hits: My Prerogative [...] {{captured}} the highlights from Britney's heyday, but lacks the more mature club-oriented material that she's churned out in recent years. That helps make this collection a justifiable fan purchase". Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't just make a mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, and deserve better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a high-gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the <b>decade,</b> <b>is</b> it any wonder this compilation is so good?".|$|E
