40|$|Use {{of motor}} {{vehicles}} {{need to be}} followed by efforts to conserve the environment, because the flue gas from the combustion process is very real impact on air pollution and environmental. Reduction of gas emissions of vehicles carried the results of the combustion process by using additional tools are installed on gasoline lines. Where has conducted emissions testing on vehicles using gasoline, gasoline with alcohol and pertamax. Tests were conducted on lap five times in 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 rpm were applied on Karisma Honda motorcycles, 125 cc. This test was conducted in Mechanical Engineering Laboratory Universitas Muhammadiyah malang, Jl. Raya Tlogomas Mo. 246 Malang 464318. The fuel mixing device is made with aluminum size Ø = 13 mm. diameter <b>gasoline</b> <b>inlet</b> Ø = 2. 5 mm and diameter alcohol inlet Ø = 1. 1 mm and exit hole Ø 3. 5 mm. where the obtained ratio 6 : 4 and the resulting octane number is 91, 2...|$|E
