The copolymers investigated covered a comonomer content ranging between 4 and 23 percent ethylene.

40|$|Abstract Most polymer blends are {{thermodynamically}} immiscible, {{leading to}} a phase-segregated morphology. Control of this morphology, including the domain sizes and interfacial regions, along with partitioning of compounding ingredients such as filler and curatives between the phases, provides opportunities for achieving properties that are otherwise unattainable. This chapter reviews funda-mental aspects of phase-separated rubber blends, with {{a survey of the}} important literature on the topic. Due to the vanishingly small entropy gain accompanying the mixing of high polymers, most polymer blends are phase-separated; there is no mixing at the segmental level, and the morphology is heterogeneous. The few thermodynamically miscible rubber blends include those having components exhibiting specific inter-actions (e. g., chlorinated polymers with epoxidized rubber [1, 2]); trivial blends of copolymers (siloxanes [3], polyolefins [4 – 6], nitrile <b>rubbers</b> (NBR) [7], <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>rubbers</b> [8, 9], butyl and polyisobutylene [10, 11], 1, 4 -polybutadiene (PBD) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) [12, 13]); and miscellaneous cases such as 1, 2 -polybutadiene/ 1, 4 -polyisoprene (NR) [14], polyisobutylene/head-to-head polypropylene [15], polyepichlorohydrin/poly(vinylmethylether) [16, 17], and acrylate rubber/fluorocarbon copolymers [18]. The focus of this chapter is immis-cible blends, in which the components are segregated into spatially distinct domains. These domains can range in size from a few hundred nm to microns, and usually have a very broad size distribution (Fig. 1) [19]. Except at the interface of these phases, the dynamics of the components are essentially the same as for the pure materials. However, immiscible blends can still yield novel and useful properties, provided the components are ‘‘compatible’’, a term loosely defined as a blend that does not undergo macroscopic phase separation and has some advantageous prop-erties. Unlike miscible blends, the properties of which are roughly the average o...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} {{energy and the}} entropy components of the elastic restoring force in rubbers were determined for natural rubber up to an extension ratio of about 3. 0. Four different experimental measurements were necessary to determine these components: (1) the force-temperature coefficient at constant temperature and length; (2) the force-pressure coefficient at constant temperature and length; (3) the thermal expansion coefficient at constant length; and (4) the isothermal compressibility at constant length. The force-temperature and the force-pressure coefficients were functions of strain whereas the expansion coefficients and the isothermal compressibilities were independent of strain. These measurements gave an {{internal energy}} contribution of 23 % for natural rubber independent of the strain over the range of extensions studied. To describe the thermal {{as well as the}} elastic behavior of rubbers a new phenomenological description of elastomers based on a generalized measure of strain was developed. The incompressible form of the strain energy function correctly described the elastic data on various elastomers (natural rubber, styrene-butadiene <b>rubber,</b> chlorinated <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer <b>rubber)</b> in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous deformation fields. For a given rubber the same set of parameters fitted the data in simple tension, simple compression, equal biaxial tension and pure shear up to the point of rupture. The compressible form of the strain energy function also described the thermoelastic data on natural rubber. The thermoelastic data on chlorinated <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer <b>rubber,</b> taken out of the literature, were also predicted. From the new strain energy function it was possible to determine the interchain interactions. For natural rubber the interchain energy effects were found to be small (4 %) as compared to the intrachain energy effects. The experimental results on natural rubber established the range of validity of the statistical mechanical (molecular) and the continuum mechanical (phenomenological) theories.

The screening testing protocol involved exposing the respective materials to approximately 3 kGy of gamma radiation followed by 14 -day exposures to the waste simulants at 60 C.

Dicumyl peroxide and triallylcyanurate under similar conditions were used for curing the rubbers. The molecular mechanisms of chemical degradation at the surface were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which demonstrate that several oxygenated species evolve during exposure. The primary process of degradation is hydrolytic attack on the crosslink sites, which is manifested by a decrease in crosslink density. The surface degradation is found to be strong enough to alter the bulk mechanical properties as observed by the change in retention in tensile strength, elongation at break, modulus at 50 % elongation and, the change in micro-hardness. Retention in modulus at 50 % elongation is found to follow a negative linear correlation with decrease in crosslink density. With higher molar mass and level of long chain branching more crosslinking occurs and thus comparatively more hydrolytic attack ensues. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the surface topography is significantly altered upon exposure and supports the notion of the dependence of degradation on the crosslinking density of the samples. Importantly, the coagent used in this study is shown to enhance the chemical degradation through formation of weaker sites for hydrolysis. The results also show that upon prolonged exposure the resulting oxygenated species tend to combine with each other...|$|R
40|$|Thermoplastic polyolefins {{are a new}} {{generation}} of single-ply roofing. Polyolefin roof membranes were introduced to the international markets already from 1991 with the North American designation as TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefins) or with the European as FPO (Flexible Polyolefins). Flexibility of such membranes depends on internal chemical structure: unlike other thermoplastic membranes, they do not contain plasticizers. This fact provides the membranes with the property of a pronounced longevity. A special type of polyolefin is represented by TPO-FPA (Flexible Polypropylene Alloy), obtained from polypropylene semi-crystalline matrix (PP), in which is incorporated an high percentage of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> <b>rubber</b> (EPR), through a patented catalloy process. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the results of a research commissioned by a company manufacturer, oriented to estimate the durability and the residual properties of TPO-FPA non-reinforced membranes, exposed in different latitudes directly to the solar radiation after 5 / 10 exposition year...|$|E
