The formation of antibiotic resistant biofilms on internal biomedical devices has contributed to a recent {{growth in the number of}} pernicious nosocomial infections (Ikeno, 2007). Ultrasound has been previously demonstrated to kill planktonic bacteria via oxidation, DNA damage and membrane disruption (Vollmer, 1998). In order to study the destructive effect of <b>insonification</b> on biofilms, we have developed three biofilm growth systems that incorporate ultrasonic transducers for direct delivery of ultrasonic energy to the biofilm. E. coli and P. aeruginosa biofilms were grown for 18 - 24 hours under a continuous flow of growth medium. Subsequently, biofilm destruction by <b>insonification</b> was observed in real time by confocal microscopy. <b>Insonification</b> at 810 kHz for 10 minutes at a O. 2 V power level is sufficient to remove approximately 50 % of P. aeruginosa biofilm density from a glass microscope slide, and up to 90 % removal is possible using a 0. 6 V power level. Pre-treatment with low levels of the antibiotics chloramphenicol or tetracycline results in greater effectiveness of ultrasound in destroying the biofilm. We conclude that <b>insonification</b> in combination with other antimicrobial agents may be a useful tool for removing biofilms from medical and environmental systems...|$|E

Recently, we have introduced a 3 D Fourier-based formalism for the reconstruction of 3 D sectorial images with DW <b>insonifications</b> and validated with numerical simulations [Zhang et al. IUS 2016]. The proposed method can provide comparable image quality as DAS but with a much lower computational complexity. This study aims to experimentally verify these theoretical conclusions in vitro. Statement of Contribution/MethodsA 32 -by- 32 matrix array centered at 3 MHz with a 0. 3 mm pitch (Vermon, Tours, France) interfaced with 4 Verasonics systems was used to transmit 3 D DW sequences and acquire the reflected echoes. The experiment was performed on an ultrasound phantom (CIRS model: 054 GS). Each DW was emitted from a virtual source point with an angular aperture of 90 º and a sub-aperture of 16 × 16 elements as in [Provost et al. 2014]. The received rawdata was post-processed in Matlab using the proposed Fourier-based algorithm in [Zhang et al., IUS 2016].

40|$|International audienceBackground, Motivation and ObjectiveUltrafast imaging {{based on}} plane wave (PW) / {{diverging}} wave (DW) {{is an active}} area of research in ultrasound acquisitions because of its capacity of reaching high frame rate. Beamforming of received echoes in Fourier domain provides comparable image quality but lower computational complexity {{with respect to the}} conventional DAS approach [Zhang et al., UFFC, 2016]. However, the current state-of-the-art Fourier-based techniques only perform the reconstruction on radio frequency (RF) data. To process less data without loss of information, we adapted in this study the Fourier-based formalism of Lu [Lu et al., UFFC, 1997] to IQ data reconstruction for both PW and DW imaging. Statement of Contribution/MethodsThe original PW imaging method of Lu performs 2 D FFT on the received RF signals and remaps the echoes spectrum to obtain the object spectrum, followed by a 2 D IFFT to get the beamformed image. We demonstrated in this work that this method can be adapted for IQ data reconstruction by explicitly taking into account the demodulation frequency in thespectrum remapping relation. The proposed method can be easily extended to DW imaging from IQ data by using a space transformation introduced in one of our previous work [Zhang et al., UFFC, 2016]. However, the space transformation introduces time shifts that cause phase rotation and thus degrade compounding strategies. We thus integrated thosetime shifts into our formalism to compensate for the phase rotation during the reconstruction process. Results/DiscussionThe proposed approach is validated experimentally with an ultrasound phantom (CIRS model: 054 GS) with PW / DW <b>insonifications</b> using a standard linear / phased array interfaced with a Verasonics system. The RF data was demodulated and downsampled 4 times to obtain the IQ data. Figure 1 shows B-mode images reconstructed from RF data and IQ datausing 9 PW / 15 DW in transmission. This results show the feasibility of performing IQ data reconstruction in the Fourier domain. It allows reconstructing the same image quality as from RF data but with 4 times less data samples, thus the beamforming process could be increased 4 times faster...|$|R

40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{study of the}} {{dynamics}} of the break-up of curved liquid jets is presented. This work is motivated by an industrial process called prilling which is used in the manufacture of pellets. In this process a sieve-like cylindrical can spins rapidly on its central vertical axis. Molten liquid is pumped into the top of the can and flows from the holes in the form of curved liquid jets. Experiments are described which were carried out on a pilot scale rig. Some differences between the break-up modes observed in this study and previous work using a small laboratory scale rig are discussed. Previous theories describing break-up mechanisms of curved liquid jets were extended to include viscosity and gravity. Break-up lengths and drop sizes were obtained theoretically and compared with experimental results. Experiments were carried out using <b>insonification,</b> a process where sound waves are fired at the jet to control satellite drop formation. Three different frequencies of wave were used, 10, 100 and 200 Hz at four different rotation rates. It was observed that <b>insonification</b> was successful at eliminating satellite drops at low rotation rates and when frequencies of 100 or 200 Hz were used. <b>Insonification</b> was included in the theory.

40|$|The {{backpropagation}} {{method of}} image reconstruction {{has been known}} for some time with the advantage of fast processing due to the use of Fast Fourier Transform. But its applicability to underwater imaging has been limited. At present the shift-and-add method is the more widely used method in underwater imaging. This {{is due to the fact}} that backpropagation has been derived for plane wave <b>insonification,</b> with the scattered waves detected in transmission-mode, or synthetic aperture set-up. One of the methods being used for underwater imaging is to use a point source for the <b>insonification</b> of the target and the scattered waves detected in reflection-mode by a receiver array. An advantage of this scanning method is only one transmission of the source is required to capture an image, instead of multiple transmissions. Therefore motion artifacts are kept to minimum. To be able to exploit the processing speed of the backpropagation method, it must be adapted for point source <b>insonification.</b> The coverage of this configuration in the literature has been scant, methods for spherical sources have been proposed for transmission mode and arbitrary surfaces in geophysical applications. These methods are complex and difficult to use. A novel point source compensation method is proposed in this thesis so that the backpropagation image formation method can be used for the point source <b>insonification</b> set-up. The method of investigation undertaken to derive this new backpropagation method was through theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental verification. The effect of various compensation factors on the image quality was studied in simulation. In the experimental verification, practical issues relating to the application of the new method was addressed. The final proof of concept of our method was undertaken with our experimental verification. The quality of images formed with the point source compensation methods has also been compared with that with the shiftand- add method.

Recently, techniques that utilize angular displacement estimates obtained from multiple angular <b>insonification</b> of tissue have been reported. Angular displacement estimates obtained along different angular <b>insonification</b> directions have been utilized for spatial-angular compounding to reduce noise artifacts in axial-strain elastograms, and for estimating the axial and lateral {{components of the}} displacement vector and the corresponding strain tensors. However, these angular strain estimation techniques {{were based on the}} assumption that noise artifacts in the displacement estimates were independent and identically distributed and that the displacement estimates could be modeled using a zero-mean normal probability density function.

40|$|Most {{frequently}} applied {{ultrasonic inspection}} techniques measure the reflectivity of geometric scatterers that {{are caused by}} impurities, flaws and defects in the material. Based on the echo sounder principles, the reflector has to be insonified by directed sound pulses. This requires {{a large number of}} transducers with different incident angles and sound field patterns, which are more and more replaced by phased array sensors. Phased array inspection systems can control the <b>insonification</b> direction and the focus of the applied sound field, but they do not alter the principles of multi-angle and multifocus inspection; the resulting scanning speed limitation is obvious. In addition, flaw imaging only displays the position and amplitude height of the reflection and does not provide an image of the actual shape of the reflector. Thus, the evaluation of state-of the-art ultrasonic imaging is based on the extension and maximum amplitude of the identified reflector applied to specified reference reflectors. A more quantitative assessment of the findings requires human or future artificial expert knowledge. We have developed a new concept for real-time quantitative ultrasonic imaging at high speed scanning. The "Sampling Phased Array" ultrasonic system and the use of distributed apertures based on "SynFoc" algorithms permit imaging of reflectors independent from the <b>insonification</b> direction.

The obtained AL results are confronted with classical scanning hydrophone experiments as well as with ultrasonic holography, showing good correspondence...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{method is}} derived for {{computing}} the acoustic field in a cylindrically symmetric ocean with an irregular water—sediment interface {{and a general}} depth-dependent sound-speed profile. The approach {{is based on a}} stepwise-coupled mode solution which was originally developed for a homogeneous water column. The extension to a general sound-speed profile is carried out with the aid of Galerkin's method. Numerical examples are given for a shallow-water waveguide with an upward-refracting sound-speed profile. The first example shows that propagation loss is significantly greater in a rough-bottomed waveguide than in a smooth-bottomed waveguide. In the second example, it is shown that upward refraction reduces the effect of bottom roughness on sound propagation by reducing the <b>insonification</b> of the rough water—sediment interface...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of reconstructing algorithms like the Ultrasonic Synthetic Aperture Focussing Method allows to image defects in components. How close an "image" approaches {{the shape of}} a "real defect" depends on the quality of data. With a software package " 3 D-Ray-Tracing" the propagation of SH-, SV-, and longitudinal waves could be visualized including mode conversion at the seams of the weld. The weld has been modeled by its elastic constants and grain orientation. Two types of defects have been simulated: a surface connected crack and a lack of side wall fusion. Simulating different <b>insonification</b> angles, it could be shown, that the 60 ø probe is superior to that of the 45 ø probe...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} second harmonic imaging of an Ultrasound Contrast Agent (UCA) under chirp <b>insonification</b> is considered. By solving the UCA's dynamical equation analytically, {{the effect that}} the chirp signal parameters and the UCA shell parameters have on the amplitude of the second harmonic frequency are examined. This allows optimal parameter values to be identified which maximise the UCA's second harmonic response. A relationship is found for the chirp parameters which ensures that a signal can be designed to resonate a UCA for a given set of shell parameters. It is also shown that the shell thickness, shell viscosity and shell elasticity parameter should be as small as realistically possible in order to maximise the second harmonic amplitude.
