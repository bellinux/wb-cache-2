40|$|Due to {{increasing}} shortage of raw materials, traditionally used for {{production of wood}} based panels and other composite materials, {{there is a growing}} call for the use of raw materials from agricultural production. <b>Hemp</b> <b>shive,</b> a by-product of hemp straw processing, is in eager demand due to its wood-like material properties. In order to be suitable for industrial use, respective agricultural raw material must be competitive in price, as well as be available in respective quantity and quality. ATB has developed a new processing technology for the cleaning of shive-fibre mixes for better accommodation such requirements. Ultimate goal is the generation of dust and fibre free shives as well as the recovering of high quality short fibres from shive fractionation. This is facilitated by a new type of axial fractionators, which utilizes a multi-stage paddle screw and a screen drum, corresponding with the screw. This allows classification and cleaning of the shives as well as recovering of the short fibres in only one processing step. Finished products are widely dust and fibre-free, high value shives; and shive-free short fibres. The shives can be used for the production of particle boards without further preparation. The recovered short fibres are mainly suitable for the use as reinforcing fibres in composite materials due to their short fibre length (< 50 mm).

40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa) is an {{agricultural}} crop {{that can be}} used as a building material in combination with lime and cement. A composite building material that combines a cementitious binder (building limes and cement) with <b>hemp</b> <b>shives,</b> the woody core of the hemp stalk is generally referred to as hemp concrete (HC). However, industrial facilities to separate <b>hemp</b> <b>shives</b> and fibres are currently not available in Sweden. HC has many advantages as a building material but it is not load-bearing and must be used in combination with a load-bearing wooden frame. The aim of this research was to elucidate the feasibility of using both <b>hemp</b> <b>shives</b> and fibres in a HC to determine an optimal mix of the different binding agents and to investigate if adding undensified microsilica to the mix and using calcinated gypsum as a binder would improve mechanical strength of the material. The effects on compressive strength of pre-mixing the binder or creating perforations in the test specimens were also investigated. Cube and cylinder specimens cured for 40 days in a carbonation room (4. 5 vol% CO 2) were tested for mechanical properties, water sorption and frost resistance. Including more hydraulic lime or undensified microsilica in the mix did not significantly affect mechanical strength, whereas adding more cement to the mix increased mechanical strength. Calcinated gypsum as a binder gave mechanical properties of the same magnitude of a contemporary HC. Pre-mixing the binder created a more homogeneous material but it did not seem to play an important role in final mechanical properties. The perforations created in some of the test specimens produced a material with a lower Young’s modulus and higher deformation at rupture.
