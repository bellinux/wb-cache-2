30|$|The novel {{concept of}} the cold-electron bolometers (CEB)[7, 8] has been invented to {{overcome}} these problems. The CEB concept {{is based on a}} unique combination of the RF (radio frequency) capacitive coupling of the absorber to the antenna through the capacitance of the superconductor-insulator-normal (SIN) tunnel junctions[7] and the <b>direct</b> electron <b>cooling</b> of the absorber by the same SIN tunnel junction[8]. The noise properties of this device are improved considerably by decreasing the electron temperature. <b>Direct</b> electron <b>cooling</b> leads to a considerable increase in the saturation power due to the removal of the incoming power from the sensitive nanoabsorber. The <b>direct</b> electron <b>cooling</b> also provides strong negative electrothermal feedback for the signal[9], analogous to the TES[5]; but here, the artificial DC heating is replaced by <b>direct</b> electron <b>cooling</b> from the SIN tunnel junctions[10 – 12] to a minimum temperature (possibly less than phonon temperature).

50|$|Because {{the entire}} anode {{assembly}} {{has to be}} contained within the evacuated tube, heat removal is a serious problem, further exacerbated by the higher power rating available. Due to the high heat generation, a matched thermal expansion of glass and the anode material is necessary. For this, high-borate borosilicate glass pioneered by Otto Schott is often used. <b>Direct</b> <b>cooling</b> by conduction or convection, as in the Coolidge tube, is difficult. In most tubes, the anode is suspended on ball bearings with silver powder lubrication which provides almost negligible cooling by conduction.|$|E
50|$|Quartz flashlamps are {{the most}} common type used in lasers, and, at low {{energies}} or high repetition rates, can operate at temperatures as high as 900 °C. Higher average powers or repetition rates require water cooling. The water usually has to wash across not only the arc length of the lamp, but across the electrode portion of the glass as well. Water-cooled flashlamps are usually manufactured with the glass shrunken around the electrode to allow <b>direct</b> <b>cooling</b> of the tungsten. If the electrode is allowed to heat much more than the glass thermal expansion can crack the seal.|$|E
5000|$|A {{core shroud}} is a {{stainless}} steel cylinder surrounding a nuclear reactor core whose main function is to <b>direct</b> the <b>cooling</b> water flow. The nuclear reactor core is where the nuclear reactions take place. Because the reactions are exothermic, cool water is needed to prevent the reactor core from melting down.

50|$|Most designs take {{advantage}} of the fact that water {{has one of the highest}} known enthalpy of vaporization (latent heat of vaporization) values of any common substance. Because of this, evaporative coolers use only a fraction of the energy of vapor-compression or absorption air conditioning systems.

50|$|The F12berlinetta {{makes use}} of {{aerodynamic}} techniques based on Ferrari's 599XX and Formula One programmes, developed with wind tunnel and CFD testing. A notable feature is the Aero Bridge, an air channel running from the bonnet, through the flanks and {{along the sides of}} the vehicle, creating an effect that increases downforce. Another feature is Active Brake Cooling ducts, which open to <b>direct</b> <b>cooling</b> air only when the brakes are hot, keeping them closed at other times to reduce aerodynamic drag. The F12berlinetta produces 123 kg of downforce at 200 kph mph - an increase of 76% over the 599 GTB - and has a drag coefficient of 0.299.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s the {{opposition}} to the construction of new plants increased in importance.

Since the KKG should also have been cooled by the Aar, the project had to be adapted by adding the cooling tower.|$|E

Low-exergy refers to the possibility to utilize ‘low quality energy’ (i.e. dispersed energy that has little ability to do useful work).

The low temperature difference requires that the heat transmission takes place over relative big surfaces as for example applied in ceilings or underfloor heating systems.Radiant systems using low temperature heating and high temperature cooling are typical example of low-exergy systems.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to illustrate how a number of parameters influence the heating and cooling demands and energy use in shopping malls situated in cold climates. The parameters of particular interest are: lighting power, infiltration through the building envelope and entrances and the use of <b>direct</b> <b>cooling</b> (also known as free cooling). The approach includes monitoring of an existing shopping mall situated in Sweden. An extensive foundation of input data concerning the building construction, building shape, HVAC systems, internal and external heat loads and measured energy use was collected. Based on the case study shopping mall, a simulation model was developed. The model facilitates studies of the effect of parameter changes, separately and in different combinations. The results are illustrated in duration diagrams, divided between day and night conditions. An interesting combination is, for instance, future energy efficient lighting in combination with <b>direct</b> <b>cooling</b> by means of low-temperature outdoor air supplied by ventilation systems with very low Specific Fan Power (SFP). Studies have showed that lighting power dominates the cooling demands in shopping malls and this implies that the size of current internal loads make the energy demand less sensitive to other parameters such as the shape of the building envelope and the proportion of window facade area. However, emerging technologies for energy efficient lighting systems and the increasing awareness of the shop owners will most likely lead to drastic reduction of the cooling demands. The simulations presented in this paper illustrate the impact this will have for the overall HVAC system, especially for the possibility of utilizing <b>direct</b> <b>cooling</b> by allowing lower supply air temperatures. In the case study building, the supply air temperature is regulated depending on the heating demand between 16 °C [60. 8 °F] to 20 °C [68 °F].
