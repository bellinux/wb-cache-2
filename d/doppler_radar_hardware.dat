40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} microwave <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> used for capturing different types of breathing patterns {{in addition to the}} respiration rate. Finding therespiration rate is equally important as identifying abnormal breathing patterns which it could be used to gain a better insight into respiratory disorders. Various known breathing disorders were role played and captured using a non-contactmicrowave <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> which further supports the feasibility of <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> in obtaining an accurate detection of different types of breathing patterns. The results obtained for all the experiments were compared with a standard measurementapparatus, respiration strap, yielding a good correlations with the <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> signals. In a nutshell, <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> can be potentially used as an alternative approach, not only for finding the respiration rates, but also for identifying respiration patterns replacing the conventional contact methods...|$|R

40|$|Introduction In 1997, Canada {{began the}} {{implementation}} of a plan to install 29 <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> across the country after a canceled effort in 1994 when the Atmospheric Environment Service (AES) of Canada underwent a 30 % reduction in budget. The justification for the radars were based on several mandates other than the traditional use for severe weather. These include the use of radar for hydrology, climate applications, numerical weather prediction/data assimilation, environmental monitoring and commercial applications which include aviation. While weather radar have been used for these purposes on an ad hoc basis, they were never officially recognized as part of their primary purpose. An in-house approach to integrating <b>radar</b> <b>hardware</b> components has been adopted. With this, the AES assumes a greater responsibility and risk for {{the implementation of}} the radars than a commercial procurement.

40|$|<b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> can be {{implemented}} for sensing physiological parameters wirelessly at a distance. Detecting respiration rate, an important human body parameter, is essential {{in a range of}} applications like emergency and military healthcare environments, and <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> records actual chest motion. One challenge in using <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> is being able to monitor several patients simultaneously and in different situations like standing, walking, or lying. This paper presents a complete transmitter-receiver <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> system, which uses a 4 GHz continuous wave radar signal transmission and receiving system, to extract base-band data from a phase-shifted signal. This work reports experimental evaluations of the system for one and two subjects in various standing and walking positions. It provides a detailed signal analysis of various breathing rates of these two subjects simultaneously. These results will be useful in future medical monitoring applications...|$|R

Also presented is a new method that combines <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> data and sea ice velocity-extracted using the cross-correlation method-to derive a high-spatial-resolution horizontal distribution of the velocity of sea ice floes. These methods will contribute to short-term forecasting of sea ice conditions and navigation through ice-covered seas and the development and verification of high-resolution dynamic sea ice models...|$|R

50|$|For {{the precise}} {{establishment}} of drag or air resistance effects on projectiles, <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> measurements are required. Weibel 1000e or Infinition BR-1001 <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> {{are used by}} governments, professional ballisticians, defence forces and a few ammunition manufacturers to obtain real-world data of the flight behavior of projectiles of their interest. Correctly established {{state of the art}} <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> measurements can determine the flight behavior of projectiles as small as airgun pellets in three-dimensional space to within a few millimetres accuracy. The gathered data regarding the projectile deceleration can be derived and expressed in several ways, such as ballistic coefficients (BC) or drag coefficients (Cd). Because a spinning projectile experiences both precession and nutation about its center of gravity as it flies, further data reduction of <b>doppler</b> <b>radar</b> measurements is required to separate yaw induced drag and lift coefficients from the zero yaw drag coefficient, in order to make measurements fully applicable to 6-dof trajectory analysis.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{investigation}} of wind velocity observed by the <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar.</b> The first phase of paper is the observation of wind using the <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar.</b> Observations {{have been carried out}} by using the <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> which is installed in the suburb of Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Horizontal and vertical wind components are estimated by applying the VAD (Velocity Azimuth Display) method to the Doppler data. We make sure that the VAD method can precisely estimate the wind components. The second phase is the utilization of wind data for investigation of rainfall field. The geostrophic wind observed by the <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> is incorporated into the Kao model so that three dimensional wind components are estimated in the planetary boundary layer. The rainfall field is simulated by applying such wind distribution to the Kessler parameterization. The above methodorogy offers considerable promise for the progress of physics-based rainfall models and forecast methods...|$|R

40|$|Current Continuous Wave (CW) <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> speed {{measurement}} systems lack {{the ability to}} distinguish multiple targets. Most systems can only identify the strongest (closest) target or the fastest target. This dissertation is related to a fusion algorithm for a VIdeo-Doppler-radAR (Vidar) traffic surveillance system. The Vidar systems uses a robust matching algorithm which iteratively matches the information from a video camera and multiple <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> corresponding to the same moving vehicle, and a stochastic algorithm which fuses the matched information from the video camera and <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> to derive the vehicle velocity and angle information. We use two heterogeneous sensors of very different modalities, the first a high resolution (1024 x 768 pixels) video camera operating at 30 Hz with a 1 / 32 ̆ 2 sony CCD fitted with a narrow field-of-view lens {{and the other a}} CW <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> operating in the unlicensed Ka band (35 GHz) with a maximum detection range of 3000 ft. First, a high resolution Time-Frequency representation of the radar signal is obtained by employing the method of Time-Frequency reassignment. Then, the angle information obtained from the video camera is fused with the information from the <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> to produce a velocity and angle track of the targets within the surveillance region...|$|R
