40|$|Tombstone, 73 miles {{southeast}} of Tucson, has been a site of extensive dewatering for mining operations. During an 8 -year period between 1901 and 1911, a total of 36, 900 acre-feet of water was withdrawn from <b>ground-water</b> <b>storage</b> in the mine rocks with a maximum decline in water level of 440 feet. For the 8 -year period of pumping, this volume of water could have supported a city of 30, 000 population. The sedimentary rocks within the mining district have a composite thickness of 8, 600 feet and include the normal stratigraphic sequence of southeastern Arizona from the Precambrian Pinal Schist {{to the top of}} the Cretaceous Bisbee Formation 0 Siliceous and quartzoseclastic rocks within the mining district have been altered to quartzite, hornfels, and jasperoid and have the best porosity and permeability as a result of innumerable fractures and fissures. Among the siliceous rocks, the Bolsa Quartzite and Bisbee Formation are the best waterbearing units within the district,. The carbonate rocks, predominant in the section, have been fractured and subjected to solutioning 0 They have their best porosity and permeability within the zone of maximum circulation near the water table. The mining district is bordered on the west by the impermeable Schieffelin Granodiorite and related intrusives that partly isolate the district from areas of natural ground-water discharge along the San Pedro River. The district is bordered on the south and east by predominantly crystalline carbonate rocks, The igneous core of the Mule and Dragoon Mountains lies farther to the east, An alluvial valley with large <b>ground-water</b> <b>storage</b> lies immediately north and northeast of the mining district A review of the history of previous water development indicates that the magnitude of the yield of the aquifer complex has been exaggerated out of proportion as a result of circumstances connected with dewatering operations. For comparative purposes the coefficient of transmissibility of the aquifer complex is estimated as 10, 000 to 15, 000 gallons per day per foot and the coefficient of storage is estimated as. 01. Prediction of the aquifer performance using these two coefficients is greatly modified by anisotropy and boundary conditions within the aquifer complex, and the yield is rapidly reduced with time. As a result, empirical loglog approximations of the time-drawdown curves are proposed for predicting the long-term performance of the aquifer complex 0 The geohydrologic evidence indicates that the Tombstone mining district may provide a suitable location for long-term, moderate production of municipal water. With extensive development, the aquifer complex could support a population several times the present size of Tombstone, but this would result in an appreciable drawdown of the water table. On the other hand, the location is moderately good as a site for the consumption of <b>ground-water</b> <b>storage</b> and dewatering that would necessarily accompany mining below the static water level...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} model was used to {{estimate}} {{the potential of the}} ground water resource of the Sana'a basin in central Yemen. Input parameter values were obtained primarily from previous reports. Analysis of the model output indicated that the potential ground water supply in both the Eastern and Western portions of the basin is 0. 15 x 10 ⁶ m ³/day. This amount is adequate to satisfy the needs of the city of Sana'a and its vicinity up to the year 2000, provided that the use of the resource is accompanied by a proper ground water management policy. A maximum of 30 meters drawdown was projected up to the year 2000, considering possible increases in use with time. This amount of drawdown should not endanger <b>ground-water</b> <b>storage.</b> However, any additional increase in ground water use greater than an estimated amount of 0. 13 x 10 ⁶ m ³/day would result in excessive drawdown. This would greatly increase investment and operational costs...|$|E

These standards are found in Part 197 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR Part 197). The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed, and gave the authority to, EPA to take this action based upon input from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The final standards {{were published in the}} Federal Register (66 FR 32073) on 13 June 2001. The 40 CFR Part 197 standards have four major parts: (1) individual-protection during storage activities; (2) individual-protection following closure of the repository; (3) human-intrusion; and (4) <b>ground-water</b> protection. The <b>storage</b> standard is 150 microsieverts (Sv) annual committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) to any member of the general public. The disposal standards are: (1) 150 Sv annual CEDE for the reasonably maximally exposed individual (RMEI) for 10, 000 years after disposal; (2) 150 Sv received by the RMEI within 10, 000 years after disposal as a result of human intrusion; and (3) the levels of radionuclides in the ground water cannot exceed 40 Sv from beta and gamma emitters, 5 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) of radium- 226 and - 228, and 15 pCi/L of gross alpha activity. There are also requirements related to the post- 10, 000 -year period, the basis of compliance judgments, and performance assessments.

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{the field}} of land-use {{hydrology}} it is frequently of value to keep a chronological account or balance {{of the components of}} the water resource of a water-shed. In this paper a time period for studying this balance is described. Essentially it is the annual period between times of maximum watershed storage {{at the end of the}} dormant season. Changes in <b>ground-water</b> <b>storage</b> are taken into account, and by choosing the beginning and end points of the year at times of field capacity, water storage changes in the soil mass are eliminated. Sample data for an experimental watershed are given. In the management of water resources, it is of considerable value to be able to keep accounts of the resource in all of its phases of the hydrologic cycle. This is particularly true when an at-tempt is made to evaluate the effects of land use changes and land management practices on sev-eral components of the water cycle. Much progress has been made in establishing practical ac-counting methods with the use of the storage equation inflow = outflow + storage and other balanc-ing procedures [see "References " at end of paper; HURSH, HOOVER, and FLETCHER, 1942; HOYT and others, 1936; HOUK, 1921; VERMULE, 1894]...|$|E
40|$|The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) {{satellite}} {{mission has}} proven as valuable tool to observe hydrological mass variations, e. g., in the Amazon basin, groundwater depletion in Northwest India, inland glacier mass losses. The long time span {{of more than}} 10 years of GRACE observations now allows also the detection of smaller inter-annual mass variations. In our study, we address the permafrost-regime in Siberia, Russia. We use GRACE data to study water mass variations in the Lena basin between 2003 and 2011. The observed mass changes indicate long-term changes in the hydrological budget of the large Siberian watersheds. For selected lakes in the Lena basin, we employ satellite radar altimetry observations to estimate water storage changes related to lake level variations. Large parts of Siberia are covered by thousands of lakes. As consequence of a strong wetting trend in this region lake levels are rising. We compare the total mass variation derived from GRACE and the mass variations related to changes in lake level. The lake level changes can explain between 15 % to 40 % of the water storage changes observed by GRACE. Other potential reasons for water storage variations {{could be related to}} changes in lake surface extension, soil moisture changes, increase in sub-permafrost <b>ground-water</b> <b>storage</b> and talik formation...|$|E
40|$|This {{circular}} {{summarizes the}} results of recent studies of Lake Mead and its environs. Area-capacity tables, prepared {{on the basis of}} a hydrographic survey of the lake in 1948 - 49, show that the capacity of the reservoir was reduced 4. 9 percent during the first 14 years after Hoover Dam was completed, but the usable capacity was reduced only 3. 2 percent. Practically all of this reduction was caused by accumulation of sediment in the reservoir. Studies of inflow and outflow indicate that the reservoir has a total storage capacity about 12 percent greater than that shown by the area-capacity table, because of 2 ̆ 2 bank 2 ̆ 2 storage, or <b>ground-water</b> <b>storage</b> in the bottom and sides of the reservoir. Thus the total capacity in 1949 was greater than the quantity shown by the original area-capacity table, even though large quantities of sediment had been deposited in the reservoir during the 14 years. According to computations of the volume and weight of the accumulated sediment, about 2, 000 million tons were deposited in the reservoir by the Colorado River in 14 years; this is within 2 percent of the amount calculated from measurements of the suspended sediment carried by the inflowing rivers. It is estimated that the sediment capacity of the reservoir, when filled to the level of the permanent spillway crest, is about 75, 000 million tons. The sediment contributed by the Colorado River averages about 45 percent sand and 55 per-cent silt and clay. If the sediment carried by the river in the years 1926 - 50 represents the long-term average rate of accumulation in Lake Mead, it will be a century before the sediment at the dam reaches the level of the lowest gates in the intake towers, and more than 4 centuries before the reservoir is filled with sediment to the level of the permanent spillway crest. The rate of sedimentation since the first year of Lake Mead (1935) has been about 20 percent lower, and if that rate continues in the future, the life of the reservoir will be correspondingly greater. Construction of upstream reservoirs to capture some of the inflowing sediment, or transportation of sediment in the outflow through Hoover Dam, would also increase the life of the reservoir. In the first 12 years of Lake Mead, the dissolved mineral matter in the outflowing water was significantly greater than the average in the inflowing water, owing in part to solution of gypsum and rock salt from the bed of the reservoir. Currently the increased dissolved solids in the outflowing water can be accounted for almost entirely by evaporation from the reservoir, which is about 5 to 7 percent of the annual inflow. The water from Lake Mead is habitually of better quality than that diverted from the river for irrigation prior to regulation by Hoover Dam, because it represents an average of the poor water of low stages and the excellent water from melting snow. Geodetic surveys of the Lake Mead area show that the weight of water has caused subsidence of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s crust amounting to about 120 millimeter at Hoover Dam, and an even greater amount in the principal area of storage in the reservoir...|$|E
