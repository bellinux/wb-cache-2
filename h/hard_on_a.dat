During the subsequent evacuation, two more landing craft ran aground and although one managed to float free, the other remained stuck <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> reef. Over {{the course of the}} next couple of days, the men in the landing craft were subjected to heavy Japanese attack and it was not until 11 June that rescue efforts were completed. The battalion lost 23 men killed or missing, presumed dead, while a further 106 were wounded in the operation.|$|E

Fall Out Boy later announced on October 13, 2008, that the early November date was in doubt, citing concerns over the planned election day tie-in. The band was stressed out and worked very <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tight deadline to get the album out on November 4.

The episode also has music similar to Die Hard, including the song [...] "Ode to Joy". Reginald VelJohnson reprises his role of LAPD officer Al Powell from Die Hard and Die Hard 2. While Powell bought several Twinkies for his wife in Die Hard, in this episode he and Big Mike are shown eating Twinkies at the same time. Chuck later parodied Die <b>Hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> much larger scale in [...] "Chuck Versus the Leftovers".|$|E

500|$|Prior to filming, {{director}} Guillem Morales worked <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> story board. For Shearsmith, {{the small}} space {{added to the}} need to meticulously plan the production process; he explained that every shot was worked out in advance. The set, which was situated in Twickenham Studios for the filming, was shaken manually by an assistant director to create the effect of motion; something which surprised Hesmondhalgh. The production crew filmed the episode by removing walls from the [...] "carriage" [...] one at a time, and shooting from the various angles, meaning that they had to effectively dismantle and reassemble the set five times. Benton noted that the tight space created a challenge for the camera crews, but, for the actors, it was [...] "great".|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{began working}} with his father as a {{draughtsman}} at the glass factory in Harworth. He was riding well; although not selected by Great Britain for the amateur world championships, he made the 4,000-metre team pursuit squad for the 1956 Olympics. In mid-September, Simpson competed for two weeks in Eastern Europe against Russian and Italian teams {{to prepare for the}} Olympics. The seven-rider contingent began with races in Leningrad, continuing to Moscow before finishing in Sofia. He was nicknamed [...] "the Sparrow" [...] by the Soviet press because of his slender build. The following month he was in Melbourne for the Olympics, where the team qualified for the team-pursuit semi-finals against Italy; they were confident of defeating South Africa and France but lost to Italy, taking the bronze medal. Simpson blamed himself for the loss for pushing too <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> turn and being unable to recover for the next.|$|E
500|$|Alguersuari, who {{qualified}} eleventh, was {{the fastest}} driver not {{advancing to the}} final session. His best time of 1:47.666 was 1.8 seconds slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alguersuari's time was followed by Hülkenberg, who was backed up by Sutil on his first run in the second session, and described his car's balance like [...] "night and day". However, Hülkenberg was demoted five positions on the grid after the Williams team changed his gearbox after the race at Monza. As a consequence, Petrov inherited 12th position having pushed <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> set of option tyres. He had lost control of his car after he went deep, under braking, heading for turn five (a corner that was damp from the earlier rain shower), with his right-rear wheel hitting the wall. Petrov's crash meant he took no further part in qualifying. He was ahead of Buemi, in the slower of the two Torro Rossos, who lost {{a large amount of}} grip and got stuck in traffic. Heidfeld took 14th ahead of his fellow countryman Sutil in 15th. Liuzzi had a problem with his front brakes on the first run of the second session and managed 16th. Timo Glock, Heikki Kovalainen and Lucas di Grassi were the quickest drivers unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying. The eleventh row of the grid was filled by Jarno Trulli and Klien. Senna took 23rd. Massa was unable to set a timed lap as his gearbox seized without warning forcing him to stop on the circuit; Ferrari chose to replace his engine and gearbox as a precaution. Massa's engine change was his ninth of the season which incurred a ten-place grid penalty, but since he started from 24th position, the penalty was nullified.|$|E

2500|$|A graphic {{account of}} some of the vicissitudes of the Argosy Lemal and its mixed crew came from S/Sgt. Arthur B. Dunning, Headquarters Company, 60th Signal Battalion. He and six other enlisted men of that unit were ordered aboard her on 9 September 1943, at Oro Bay, New Guinea, to handle Army radio traffic. The {{commander}} of the ship reported to naval authorities, not to General Akin. After six months' service along the New Guinea coast, the skipper was removed for incompetence. His replacement was no better. Among other things, he obeyed to the letter Navy's order forbidding the use of unshielded radio receivers at sea. Since the Signal Corps receivers aboard the ship were unshielded and thus liable to radiate sufficiently to alert nearby enemy listeners, the men were forbidden to switch them on in order to hear orders from Army headquarters ashore. As a consequence, during a trip in the spring of 1944 from Milne Bay to Cairns, Australia (on naval orders), the crew failed to hear frantic Signal Corps radio messages to the Argosy Lemal ordering her to return at once to Milne Bay to make ready for a forthcoming Army operation. On the way to Australia the skipper, after a series of mishaps attributable to bad navigation, grounded the Argosy <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> reef. Most of the crew already desperately ill of tropical diseases, now had additional worries. The radio antennas were swept away along with the ship's rigging, and help could not be requested until the Signal Corps men strung up a makeshift antenna. Weak with fevers and in a ship on the verge of foundering, they pumped away at the water rising in the hold and wondered why rescue was delayed till they learned that the position of the ship that the skipper had given them to broadcast was ninety miles off their true position. As they threw excess cargo overboard, [...] "some of the guys," [...] recorded Dunning, [...] "were all for jettisoning our skipper for getting us into all of this mess." [...] Much later, too late for the need the Signal Corps had for the ship, the Argosy Lemal was rescued and towed to Port Moresby for repairs to the vessel and medical attention to the crew, many of whom were by then, according to Dunning, [...] "psycho-neurotic." [...] Besides Dunning, a radio operator, there were T/4 Jack Stanton, also a radio operator; T/Sgt. Harold Wooten, the senior non-commissioned officer; T/4 Finch and T/5 Burtness, maintenance men; and T/5 Ingram and Pfc. Devlin, code and message center clerks. Dunning described the Argosy as a 3-mast sailing vessel with a 110-horsepower auxiliary diesel engine. [...] "She was the sixth vessel," [...] he wrote, [...] "to be taken over by the Small Ships Section of the U.S. Army, her primary purpose was handling [...] traffic between forward areas and the main USASOS headquarters." ...|$|E
