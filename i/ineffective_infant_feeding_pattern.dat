40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} nursing diagnoses {{and theoretical}} frameworks used in neonatal units through a literature review. METHOD: Cinahl, Medline and Lilacs, database {{were used to}} perform this study. The descriptors used were: "Nursing Diagnosis" AND "Models, Nursing" OR "Nursing Theory" AND "Infant" OR "Newborn". The search was limited to articles published from 2000 to November 2013. Studies were selected only if they were written in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. RESULTS: In the literature review two taxonomies and six major theoretical frameworks were identified. The most frequently detected nursing diagnoses were: activity intolerance, impaired spontaneous ventilation, ineffective breathing pattern, risk for aspiration, delayed growth and development, Ineffective breastfeeding, <b>Ineffective</b> <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern,</b> hyperthermia / hypothermia, risk for infection, impaired tissue integrity, Interrupted family processes, risk for impaired parenting, risk for impaired attachment, interrupted family processes. Diagnoses applying to parents' psychosocial sphere were identified, enabling the newborn's integral evaluation, including the family. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing diagnoses provide nurses working in neonatal units the opportunity of an effective management of the care process {{as well as the}} availability of the needed data in order to continuously improve a quality-based nursing care.

40|$|Background: Most {{studies have}} looked at {{breastfeeding}} practices {{from the point of}} view of the maternal behavior only, however in counseling women who choose to breastfeed it is important to be aware of general <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> in order to adequately provide information about what to expect. Available literature on the differences in infant breastfeeding behavior by sex is minimal and therefore requires further investigation. Objectives: This study determined if at the age of 2 months there were differences in the amount of breast milk consumed, duration of breastfeeding, and infant satiety by infant sex. It also assessed whether infant sex is an independent predictor of initiation of breastfeeding. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data obtained from the <b>Infant</b> <b>Feeding</b> Practices Survey II (IFPS II) which was a longitudinal study carried out from May 2005 through June 2007 by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The questionnaires asked about demography, prenatal care, mode of delivery, birth weight, infant sex, and breastfeeding patterns. A total of 3, 033 and 2, 552 mothers completed the neonatal and post-neonatal questionnaires respectively. ^ Results: There was no significant difference in the initiation of breastfeeding by infant sex. About 85 % of the male infants initiated breastfeeding compared with 84 % of female infants. The odds ratio of ever initiating breastfeeding by male infants was 0. 93 but the difference was not significant with a p-value of 0. 49. None of the other <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> differed by <b>infant</b> gender. ^ Conclusion: This study found no evidence that male <b>infants</b> <b>feed</b> more or that their mothers are more likely to initiate breastfeeding. Each baby is an individual and therefore will have a unique <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern.</b> Based on these findings, the major determining factors for breastfeeding continue to be maternal factors therefore more effort should be invested in promoting breastfeeding among mothers of all ethnic groups and social classes. ...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{prevention}} of HIV mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) strategies, HIV-positive women {{are asked to}} choose between two options regarding <b>infant</b> feeding: replacement <b>feeding</b> or exclusive breastfeeding with early weaning. Health services must offer women counseling, guidance, and support {{to enable them to}} make an informed choice. This article aims to shed light on the content of counseling and its adaptation to local situations, including women's perceptions, in three resource-poor countries with different <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> (Burkina Faso, Cambodia, and Cameroon). The qualitative study included observations in health facilities and interviews with HIV-positive mothers and health workers. The results show that counseling practices vary, including prescriptive counseling proposing only one option to all women, an option based on the mother's economic level assessed by health care providers, and the choice between options. While health workers consider economic aspects first, women mostly consider social aspects related to the risk of being stigmatized as a "bad mother'" or as HIV-positive. Overall trends identify some limits to counseling effectiveness when considering women's perceptions and needs, such as: the content of information provided by health care providers, duration and timing of counseling, discrepancies between information provided during counseling and from the health system, and ranking of preventive options by health workers. Women's agency for feeding choices is related to local practices and local authorities' abilities to provide more or less comprehensive counseling based on the organization of the health and aid system. Local practices also depend on institutions' interpretations of international recommendations based on public health considerations regarding standard of care and women's and the health system's respective responsibilities.

40|$|Abstract Background The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relationship between the attitudes of the mother and her family towards breastfeeding and the actual <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern</b> in a Bolivian population. A second objective was to study the relationship between breastfeeding information, specified according to source and timing, and <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern.</b> Methods Cross-sectional interviews with 420 – 502 Bolivian mothers with an infant less than or equal to 1 year of age. Duration of exclusive breastfeeding, use of prelacteal food and/or colostrum were the main outcome measures. Results The attitudes of the mother, her partner (the infant's father) and the infant's grandmother towards breastfeeding did not influence the <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern.</b> Women who had received breastfeeding information from health care personnel before birth or on the maternity ward breastfed exclusively for a longer duration (adjusted p = 0. 0233) and avoided prelacteal food to a greater extent (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0. 42; 95 % confidence interval for adjusted odds ratio (95 % CI AOR) = 0. 23 – 0. 72). Information from a doctor before birth or on the maternity ward was associated with less use of prelacteal food (AOR = 0. 53; 95 % CI AOR = 0. 31 – 0. 93), an increased use of colostrum (AOR = 3. 30; 95 % CI AOR = 1. 16 – 9. 37), but was not linked to the duration of exclusive breastfeeding (p = 0. 1767). Conclusion The current study indicates that breastfeeding information delivered by health care personnel in a non-trial setting may affect the <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern</b> including the use of prelacteal foods and colostrum. There was no evidence that the attitudes of the mother, or the infant's father or grandmother influenced actual feeding behavior. The lack of a "negative or neutral attitude" towards breastfeeding in the participants of the current study does, however, diminish the chances to link attitude to feeding behavior. </p...|$|R

40|$|The UNICEF {{conceptual}} framework for child undernutrition indicates that malnutrition {{occurs as a result}} of inadequate dietary intake and disease. Exclusive breastfeeding for six months is the "gold standard" in <b>infant</b> <b>feeding,</b> yet the majority of women in sub-Saharan Africa do not practice EBF for the recommended duration. Additionally, diarrhea remains one of the leading causes of child death in developing countries, with Cryptosporidium {{as one of the most}} common diarrhea-causing parasites. Despite the health consequences of Cryptosporidium infection in childhood, little is known about the natural history of and risk factors associated with infection. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in mothers and infants up to six months post-partum and the factors associated with infection, namely duration of exclusive breastfeeding and immune composition of breast milk. In a prospective cohort of 125 mothers and infants we found that maternal post-partum prevalence of Cryptosporidium was high, yet prevalence of infant infection remained low until six months of age. Factors associated with an increased risk of infant Cryptosporidium infection included maternal Cryptosporidium infection and maternal hand washing prior to <b>infant</b> <b>feeding.</b> We also saw increases in infant Cryptosporidium infection that corresponded to changes in <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns.</b> Using the same cohort of mothers, we collected breast milk and blood samples to determine how concentrations of immunoglobulins and cytokines evolved over the six months post-partum period. We found that there were no differences in breast milk immune composition based on maternal HIV-status or maternal nutritional status. However, we did find that concentrations of breast milk immunoglobulins increased as the duration of exclusive breastfeeding increased and with increased breastfeeding frequency. Breast milk cytokine concentrations were associated with indicators of maternal illness, such as mastitis and fever. Finally, we explored the relationship between <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> and breast milk immune concentrations to determine if they were associated with infant Cryptosporidium infection. We found that an increased duration of exclusive breastfeeding and higher doses of breast milk immunoglobulins and cytokines were associated with a decreased risk of infant Cryptosporidium infection, while the feeding of certain complementary foods was associated with an increased risk of infection. We conclude that Cryptosporidium is an important gastrointestinal parasite in this region of Tanzania. The research underscored the importance of appropriate <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> in the first six months as optimal <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviors were associated with both an increase in breast milk immune molecules as well as a decreased risk of infant Cryptosporidium infection...|$|R

This study was conducted as part of Hawaii’s surveillance system to identify <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> in Hawaii; specifically, to identify factors influencing duration of breastfeeding among ethni-cally diverse mothers. Methods: All women who delivered an infant in Hawaii between January 1 and March 31, 1989, were mailed surveys 14 to 19 months after delivery. Fifty-one percent (n 4 2011) of women responded, of whom 1574 (78 %) did some breastfeeding and {{are included in the}} analysis of prediction of weaning (cessation of breastfeeding). Cox regression (survival) analysis was used to predict weaning. Results: The median duration of breastfeeding was 150 days; 45 percent of infants were still breastfeeding at age 6 months and 16 percent at age 1 year. Factors associated with early weaning were Japanese ethnicity; mother born in a country other than the United States, Japan, or the Philippines; first language other than English, or two languages at home; employed full-time outside the home; introduced formula or fruit before age 6 months; received formula from the WIC program; and stopped breastfeeding for convenience, breast problems, problems getting breastfeeding started, insufficient milk, baby refusing the breast, and a sick baby. Factors associated with late weaning were older maternal age; college education; living on a rural island; previous breastfeeding experience; helpful breastfeeding advice from family or friends; receiving WIC for breastfeeding mothers; introducing the cup before age 6 months; and not giving fruit to the baby. Conclusion: In Hawaii, programs that address how and when to introduce foods, use of formula, and management of outside employment and breastfeeding should be made available to those groups of women at risk for early weaning to lengthen their duration of breastfeeding.

The objective {{was to assess the}} mothers' practices and attitudes regarding several key aspects of breast-feeding and 'rooming-in'. The study found that most of the women breast-fed their babies, with many believing infants should be breast-fed for 18 months or longer. However, many mothers lacked information about ideal <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> and were unaware of how to solve problems that may arise. Only 38 % recognized the value of feeding colostrum, and many feared the effect of breast-feeding on breast shape. They often gave supplementary formula. Almost none understood the importance of frequent suckling in promoting milk production. Only 50 % of infants were kept in the same hospital room with their mothers for 24 hr a day, or full rooming-in. Women who kept their infants in the nursery (39 %) were generally younger, better educated, primiparous, or had non-normal deliveries. They knew little about rooming-in, and if given more information to allay their doubts, they might consider rooming-in as a viable and safe arrangement. The results of this study reinforce the importance of identifying the perceptions and the knowledge of women concerning breast-feeding and rooming-in, so that hospital administrator, and health professionals can design programs and provide environments that encourage women to breast-feed their infants in optimal ways.

Lower prevalence and severity of malocclusions in breastfed children, in comparison with those that were bottle fed, have been reported. There exists substantial documentation that further credits breastfeeding with enhanced oral development and the formation of proper swallowing technique. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the influence of <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> on the deciduous second molar relationship in 3 - 5 -year-old children of selected preschools in and around Mangalore. Materials and Methods: Semi-structured questionnaires were given to parents of children between the ages of 3 and 5 years.

Among the bottle-fed children, the conventional nipple group showed 23. 52 % of mesial step occlusion while in the physiologic nipple group, 55. 26 % had a mesial step occlusion. Conclusion: This study supports a correlation between <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> methods and primary molar relationship. Exclusively breastfed children showed better development of dental arches with a higher incidence of mesial step occlusion when compared to bottle-fed children...|$|R
40|$|Background: Data {{regarding}} {{the association between}} breast milk composition and <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> (frequency and amount of breast milk taken) would help in understanding the regulation of food intake in breastfed infants. Objective: This study {{examined the relationship between}} breast milk macronutrient concentration and patterns of milk intake in breastfeeding infants over a 24 -hour breastfeeding period. Methods: Mothers of healthy term infants (n = 15) collected pre- and postfeed breast milk samples from each feed at each breast over a 24 -hour period. Breast milk samples were analyzed for fat, lactose, total protein, casein, and whey protein content. The energy content for each feed was calculated. Results: Breastfeeding patterns and milk composition varied greatly between individuals. The fat content of milk significantly differed over 24 hours (P =. 01), whereas the concentration of lactose and protein content remained the same. The mean 24 -hour total protein, whey, and casein intake was inversely (P 3 ̆c. 01), whereas lactose concentration was positively (P =. 03) related to the number of breast feeds per day. No relationship was seen either between fat or energy content and <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns.</b> The mean (SD) concentration of fat, lactose, and total protein over the 24 -hour period was 43 (12) g/L, 68 (7) g/L, and 13 (2) g/L, respectively. Conclusion: The association between milk protein intake and the breastfeeding frequency suggests that the protein intake {{may play a role in}} infant appetite control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Infant</b> <b>feeding</b> categories, often {{referred}} to as breastfeeding definitions, form the basis to describe <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> patterns; especially, breastfeeding duration and degree of breastfeeding exclusivity. Researchers use a variety of algorithms and no validated tool exists to measure <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> for research purposes. The goal of this research project was to develop and test a tool to measure <b>patterns</b> of <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> for breastfeeding and lactation research. Methods We used a literature review, survey methods, and statistical analysis to develop and test this health measurement tool. The work was completed in three phases: 1) development of the tool; 2) assessment of content validity with a panel of experts; and 3) testing for inter-rater reliability by comparing the conclusions of 2 independent research assistants (RAs) and by comparing mothers’ feeding diaries with the RAs’ findings. For the third phase, an a priori analysis determined we needed to recruit 75 participants. Inclusion criteria were women who had given birth to a single healthy newborn, planned to breastfeed and were able to breastfeed freely, were able to read and write in English or French, were willing and able to maintain a weekly feeding diary for 6  weeks and to answer 6 English telephone questionnaires (twice within 24  hrs x 3 times over 6  months. To measure inter-rater reliability, we used intraclass correlation coefficient. Results The final tool, The FeedCat Tool, contains two parts: 1) questions asked to determine what and how the baby was fed and 2) a chart to indicate the feeding category for each time point and recall period. We recruited 75 breastfeeding mothers to measure inter-rater reliability. Inter-rater reliability for classification of feeding categories by the two RAs and for agreement between the RAs’ findings at 1  month and mothers’ diaries at 4  weeks indicated excellent agreement. Conclusion We produced a feeding categories tool that can be used by researchers to describe the type, amount, and mode of feeding, and we tested the tool for content validity and reliability. Researchers should consider The FeedCat Tool for lactation and research projects requiring data about <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
40|$|To prospectively {{investigate}} {{the association between}} maternal long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) status and ratio during pregnancy and children's risk of problem behavior at 5 years of age. Maternal LCPUFA status in plasma phospholipids during pregnancy (M = 13. 3, SD = 3 weeks) was available for 4336 women. Children's behavior was rated by their mother (n = 2502) and teacher (n = 2061). When using multivariate logistic regression analyses, we found that greater concentrations of omega- 3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (OR 0. 75; 95 % CI 0. 56 - 0. 99; P =. 05) decreased children's risk for emotional symptoms. Although lower eicosapentaenoic acid and a greater omega- 6 :omega- 3 LCPUFA (ie, arachidonic acid/[docosahexaenoic acid + eicosapentaenoic acid]) tended to increase the risk for emotional symptoms {{and the risk of}} hyperactivity/inattention problems for the omega- 6 :omega- 3 LCPUFA, the results were nonsignificant (P =. 07). No evidence was found for mediation by preterm birth and being small for gestational age. The child's sex and <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern</b> did not modify the associations. Our results suggest long-term developmental programming influences of maternal LCPUFA status during pregnancy and stress the importance of an adequate and balanced supply of fatty acids in pregnant women for optimal fetal brain development and subsequent long-term behavioral outcome...|$|R

METHODS: Subjects were 3614 men and women born 1914 - 1935. Information on <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> was gathered from original midwife's birth records. Adult ESR, triglycerides, total cholesterol, blood pressure, fasting glucose, weight and height were measured. RESULTS: The number of subjects bottle-fed in early infancy was 186 (5. 2 %). The geometric mean of ESR was 15. 9 % (95 % CI 1. 8 %- 31. 8 %) higher in those who were bottle-fed compared with those breastfed, p = 0. 026, when adjusting for age and gender. Those who had been breastfed in early infancy had on average 2. 9 % higher BMI in adulthood (p = 0. 012). The hazard ratio for event of CHD for bottle-fed persons versus breastfed was 1. 18 (95 % CI 0. 88 - 1. 57), adjusting for potential confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Higher adult ESR, a moderate risk factor for CHD, among those bottle-fed compared to those breastfed in early infancy might indicate a long term anti-inflammatory influence of breast milk...|$|R

ObjectiveTo study early-life food-related characteristics associated with child’s liking for different foods at 5 y with a longitudinal study. Design 1142 5 y- old children completed a liking test for “fruit and vegetables”, “meat, fish and eggs”, desserts and cheese. Data related to maternal food intake before pregnancy, <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> {{during the first year}} of life, maternal feeding practices at 2 y, child’s food intake at 3 y, and child’s food neophobia from 1 to 4 y were collected prospectively from the mother. The associations between these factors and child‘s liking for each category of foods were analyzed using structural equation modelling. ResultsHigh food neophobia at 4 y was related to lower child’s liking for all food groups. Maternal feeding practices at 2 y were associated with liking for dessert: negatively for the practices allowing child to control his/her own food intake, positively for restriction of child’s food intake for weight reasons. Moreover, child’s food intake at 3 y was positively associated with child’s liking for “fruit and vegetables” as well as for cheese. Finally, adherence to the <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>pattern</b> “long breastfeeding, later introduction of main meal components and use of home-made products” was positively associated with child’s liking for meat/fish/eggs. ConclusionsFor all food groups, food neophobia was a common determinant of child’s liking for food at 5 y, whereas other factors were associated with food liking for specific food groups...|$|R

It began with {{interview}} check-lists (guides) and specific methodological examples developed by Susan Scrimshaw for Chloe O'Gara for research on <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> in Honduras in 1981. It grew considerably in Guatemala in 1983 {{under the direction of}} Elena Hurtado and Susan Scrimshaw with Germana Sanchez and Aracely Espuivel working on an INCAP project on Health Seeking Behaviour funded by the United Nations University. The methodology was refined through research at INCAP in 1983 and formed the nucleus for the December 1983 Workshop in Geneva, Switzerland sponsored by the UNU and UNICEF to develop a methodology for the study of health-seeking Behaviour at the household level. The manual as revised in that workshop was edited and then published (Scrimshaw and Hurtado, 1984). In 1984, components on diarrhoeal disease, infectious diseases, and growth and development were added at INCAP. Elena Hurtado and Susan Scrimshaw also developed the check-lists for health care providers as part of an INCAP project on child survival. The revised manual was then tested and further modified in a two week training course for 15 Central American social scientists held at INCIENSA in Costa Rica in April of 1985.

40|$|International audienceBackground <b>Infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> may {{influence}} lifelong health. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} longer duration of breastfeeding and later introduction of complementary foods in infancy are associated with reduced adult cardiovascular risk. Methods Data were pooled from 10, 912 subjects aged 15 - 41 years from five prospective birth cohort studies in low/middle-income countries (Brazil, Guatemala, India, Philippines, South Africa). Associations were examined between <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> (duration of breastfeeding and age at introduction of complementary foods) and adult blood pressure, plasma glucose concentration, and adiposity (skinfolds, waist circumference, percentage body fat, overweight/obesity). Analyses were adjusted for maternal socio-economic status, education, age, smoking, race and urban/rural residence, and infant birthweight. Results There were no differences in outcomes between adults who were ever breastfed compared with those who were never breastfed. Duration of breastfeeding {{was not associated with}} adult diabetes prevalence or adiposity. There were U-shaped associations between duration of breastfeeding and systolic blood pressure and hypertension; however these were weak and inconsistent among the cohorts. Later introduction of complementary foods was associated with lower adult adiposity. BMI changed by - 0. 19 kg/m 2 (95 %CI - 0. 37,- 0. 01) and waist circumference by - 0. 45 cm (95 % CI - 0. 88,- 0. 02) per 3 -month increase in age at introduction of complementary foods. Conclusions There was no evidence that longer duration of breastfeeding is protective against adult hypertension, diabetes or overweight/adiposity in these low/middle-income populations. Further research is required to determine whether exclusive breastfeeding may be protective. Delaying complementary foods until 6 months, as recommended by WHO, may reduce the risk of adult overweight/adiposity, but the effect is likely to be small...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There are no data {{regarding}} {{the relationship between}} maternal adiposity and interaction and <b>feeding</b> of <b>infants</b> and possible contribution to childhood obesity. In this study we determined the relationship between maternal body weight and composition and <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> and maternal-infant interaction during 24 -hour metabolic rate measurements in the Enhanced Metabolic Testing Activity Chamber (EMTAC). Methods The amount of time four obese (BMI = 33. 5 ± 5. 3 kg/m 2) and three normal weight (BMI = 23. 1 ± 0. 6 kg/m 2) biological mothers, spent feeding and interacting with their infants, along with what they ingested, was recorded during 24 -hour metabolic rate measurements in the EMTAC. The seven infants were 4. 9 ± 0. 7 months, 69 ± 3 cm, 7. 5 ± 0. 8 kg, 26 ± 3 % fat and 29 ± 25 percentile for weight for length. Energy and macronutrient intake (kcal/kg) were assessed. Maternal body composition was determined by air displacement plethysmorgraphy {{and that of the}} infants by skin-fold thicknesses. Pearson correlations and independent t-tests were utilized for statistical analysis (p Results Infants born to obese biological mothers consumed more energy (87. 6 ± 18. 9 vs. 68. 1 ± 17. 3) and energy as carbohydrate (25 ± 6 vs. 16 ± 3; p Conclusion Greater maternal body weight and percent body fat were associated with greater infant energy intakes. These infants were fed less frequently and consumed more carbohydrates in a shorter period of time as compared to infants from normal weight biological mothers.

40|$|Introduction & aims: The {{identification}} of determinants of childhood overweight {{is crucial to}} early diagnosis and prevention. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess perinatal and parental related risk factors concerning children for having excessive body weight. Methods: Cross-sectional study involving 3, 101 children participating in the programme “Alimenta su salud” conducted in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). Anthropometric and sociodemographic data were obtained from a general questionnaire. Analysed factors as potential predictors of childhood overweight were sex, age, birth weight, <b>infant</b> <b>feeding,</b> number of siblings, as well as parental marital status, educational level and obesity. Prevalence of overweight stratified by potential determinants was assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between variables and the likelihood of being overweight. Results: The overweight prevalence (including obesity) was 30. 3 % in boys and 28. 3 % in girls, according to the IOTF criteria. Higher rates in younger subjects and some gender differences were observed. Parental obesity was the most important predictive variable for childhood overweight in both sexes and birth weight over 3, 500 g in girls (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 3). Having one or more siblings (OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 5 - 0. 9) and higher paternal education (OR 0. 8, 95 % CI 0. 6 - 0. 9) in boys, and older age in girls (OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 5 -. 09), resulted protective factors against childhood overweight. No independent effects of marital status, maternal education and <b>infant</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>patterns</b> on childhood excess weight were identified. Conclusions: Perinatal and parental factors could contribute to predict the risk of being overweight/obese in children aged 6 to 12 years, which should be considered when formulating obesity prevention and intervention strategies, stressing the importance of targeting obese parents with young children...|$|R
