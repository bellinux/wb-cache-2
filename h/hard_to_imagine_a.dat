The New York Times reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment {{that this was the}} orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by Jonathan Kent—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in The Independent, recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: [...] "Do we really need to see a dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit {{in order to understand the}} Holocaust?" [...] Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive, commenting that [...] "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> more effective version than Kent's, shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." [...] Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result [...] "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time, in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.|$|E

500|$|For {{several months}} the Allies had been {{planning}} an attack upon Brest, the French port in the Bay of Biscay. The French had received intelligence alerting them to the imminent assault, enabling Marshal Vauban to strengthen its defences and reinforce the garrison. Inevitably the attack on 18 June led by Thomas Tollemache ended in disaster; most of his men were killed or captured, and Tollemache himself died of his wounds shortly afterwards. Despite lacking evidence, Marlborough's detractors claimed that {{it was he who}} had alerted the enemy. Macaulay states that in a letter on 3 May 1694 Marlborough betrayed the Allied plans to James, thus ensuring that the landing failed and that Tollemache, a talented rival, was killed or discredited as a direct result. Historians such as John Paget and C. T. Atkinson conclude that he probably did write the letter, but did so only when he knew that it would be received too late for its information to be of any practical use (the plan of the attack on Brest was widely known, and the French had already begun to strengthen their defences in April). To Richard Holmes the evidence linking Marlborough with the Camaret Bay letter (which no longer exists), is slender, concluding, [...] "It is very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> man as careful as Marlborough, only recently freed from suspicion of treason, writing a letter which would kill him if it fell into the wrong hands". However, David Chandler surmises that, [...] "the whole episode is so obscure and inconclusive that it is still not possible to make a definite ruling.
