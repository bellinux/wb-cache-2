5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a 7–2 start. But {{the team}} quickly began to collapse, as starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's {{new approach to}} a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, {{the rest of the}} team became more inconsistent.|$|E

5|$|With a new first-time head coach, {{the team}} <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to slow starts. It started {{the season with}} a 1–5 record, but won 18 of its final 24 games and started its conference {{schedule}} with a 2–3 record, but won 8 of its final 9 games. The recovery enabled the team to qualify for its 32nd post season appearance (24 NCAA, 5 NIT and 2 CBI).|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E

After a second loss to maegashira Tochinonada on day five, he {{pulled out of the}} tournament on the sixth day citing pain in his elbow. The September tournament {{unfolded}} in a similarly poor fashion. After compiling a lacklustre 5–4 record through the first nine days, Asashōryū forfeited his tenth-day match to maegashira Gōeidō and withdrew. He had elbow pain, and presented a medical certificate.|$|E
5|$|Batista and Orton {{decided to}} work {{together}} to assault Bryan, and the original referee returned to the match. At ringside, Batista threw Bryan down with a Batista Bomb onto the Spanish announce table, while Orton immediately combined with an inverted version of his signature RKO maneuver. As both Bryan and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table, only Batista emerged unscathed. Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a stretcher. Batista attacked Orton, who retaliated with a DDT onto the floor. Suddenly, Bryan <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the stretcher and crawled back to the ring, where he was set upon by Orton.|$|E

5|$|Bayern <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a {{good start}} under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, they managed to clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that found them in third place.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E
5|$|Benzema <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a {{good start}} for the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse. The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E

The Australian captain did {{the majority of the}} scoring in the late afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. The tourists batted with little discomfort on a pitch that was still offering even bounce at a gentle pace.|$|E

The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In 1927–28 Australian season, Woodfull {{played in}} five matches and was highly {{productive}} {{in the last}} three. He scored 99 and 191 not out in a victory over New South Wales, before adding 106 in an innings triumph over South Australia. He rounded off the season with 94 and 81 not out in a draw in the return match against New South Wales. He ended the Australian campaign with 645 runs at 129.00.
