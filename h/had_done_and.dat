5|$|Once in Ravenna, Helmichis and Rosamund rapidly became estranged. According to Paul, Longinus persuaded Rosamund {{to get rid}} of {{her husband}} so that he could marry her. To {{accomplish}} this, she made him drink a cup full of poison; before dying, however, Helmichis understood what his wife <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> forced her to drink the cup too, so they both died. According to Wolfram, there may be some historical truth in the account of Longinus' proposal to Rosamund, as it was possible to achieve Lombard kingship by marrying the queen, but the story of the two lovers' end is not historical but legendary. The mutual murder as told by Agnellus is given a different interpretation by Joaquin Martinez Pizarro: he sees Helmichis' last action as a symbol of how the natural hierarchy of sexes is at last restored, after the queen's actions had unnaturally modified the proper equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Phrynichus, {{fearing that}} Alcibiades if {{restored}} would avenge himself upon {{him for his}} opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, {{to tell him that}} Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation {{of the rest of the}} intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at Magnesia and communicated to them Phrynichus's letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.|$|E

Others saw President Lincoln's invasion of Tennessee as an unprecedented invasion {{of their homes and}} an incursion by Federal power; these people became strong Confederates. Rogersville was spared destruction during the war. In fact, structures such as the Hale Springs Inn were used by the different occupying armies.|$|E

25|$|On April 26, 1945, {{in what is}} now the Piazza della Repubblica in Milan, Borghese finally {{ordered the}} Xª MAS to disband. He was soon arrested by partisans, but rescued by OSS officer James Angleton, who dressed him in an American uniform and drove him to Rome for {{interrogation}} by the Allies. Borghese was tried and convicted of war crimes, sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, but released from jail by the Italian Supreme Court in 1949. The Americans were keenly interested in infiltrating the Italian Communist groups, something which Borghese <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> he was enlisted to help create counterintelligence units for the Americans.|$|E
25|$|That desire {{manifested}} in two attempted murders. The first happened when Jesperson was around 10 years old. He was {{friends with a}} boy named Martin, and the two would often get into trouble together. Jesperson claimed he was punished many times for things Martin <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> blamed on Jesperson. This led Jesperson to attack Martin, violently beating him until his father pulled him away. He later claimed his intention was to kill the boy. Approximately a year later, Jesperson was swimming in a lake when another boy held him under water until he blacked out. Some time later, at a public pool, Jesperson attempted to drown the boy, holding his head under water until the lifeguard pulled him away.|$|E
25|$|Helms said filming The Hangover {{was more}} {{physically}} demanding {{than any other}} role he <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> that he lost eight pounds while making the film. He said the most difficult day of shooting was the scene when Mr. Chow rams his car and attacks the main characters, which Helms said required many takes and was very painful, such as when {{a few of the}} punches and kicks accidentally landed and when his knees and shins were hurt while being pulled out of a window. The missing tooth was not created with prosthetics or visual effects, but is naturally occurring: Helms never had an adult incisor grow, and got a dental implant as a teenager, which was removed for filming.|$|E

25|$|Tik-Tok informs Dorothy and Billina {{that they}} are in the Land of Ev, which has {{recently}} lost its royal family due to the King of Ev selling them to the Nome King, who rules in a neighboring underground kingdom. Afterwards, the King regretted what he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> in despair jumped off a cliff into the sea and was drowned. Tik-Tok protects Dorothy and Billina from the Wheelers and takes them to the royal residence where Princess Langwidere resides. Langwidere is the spoiled and highly vain niece of the deceased king of Ev, and she has many exchangeable, detachable heads. When Dorothy refuses to let Langwidere take her head and add it to her collection, Langwidere has a tantrum and locks Dorothy in a high tower within the palace.|$|E
25|$|Legend {{has it that}} Glooscap {{lived on}} Cape Blomidon, across the basin from Partridge Island. His heroic {{exploits}} account for key features of the landscape, including perhaps, the dramatic tides of the Minas Basin. When his enemy, Beaver, built a dam across the Minas Channel from Cape Split to the Cumberland side, the waters not only flooded Glooscap's herbal medicine garden at Advocate Harbour, they inundated the Annapolis Valley. Glooscap arrived on the scene, saw what the Beaver <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> angrily smashed the dam with his paddle releasing the pent-up waters. According to anthropologist Anne-Christine Hornborg, the daily breaking and re-building of a giant beaver dam serves {{as a metaphor for}} the powerful tides of the Minas Basin — not a literal explanation, but a symbolic representation of the natural environment.|$|E
25|$|Since {{then other}} {{examples}} of this pattern of growing respect for cultures has taken hold in specific instances. Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country, in the United States, the Bahá‘í Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed, in 1960 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khánum asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> praised the great past of the native peoples. And in 1963 anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe, a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that the Bahá‘í Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even country of origin. See Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans. In Papua New Guinea whereas Christian missionaries openly opposed traditional funerary art and performances, the Bahá'ís encouraged their production {{as a form of}} worship. Thus while Nalik Bahá'ís are regarded by other Naliks as arbiters of traditional knowledge and practices, the Christian missions and their followers are seen as antagonistic to kastom. See Bahá'í Faith in Papua New Guinea.|$|E
