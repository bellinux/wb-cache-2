25|$|Considered one of {{the most}} {{hazardous}} airfields in the United States, Hoover Field suffered from short and unpaved runways, numerous life-threatening obstructions around the field, poor visibility (due to a burning garbage <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> its northwest), and poor drainage. It was purchased by the owner of nearby Washington Airport in early 1929, causing a brief merger of the two fields, but was sold to a new owner just 12 months later. It nearly went bankrupt in 1933, and was sold at auction and merged with Washington Airport to become Washington-Hoover Airport on August 2, 1933.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Fenton {{agreed to help}} the IRA and moved {{explosives}} from an arms <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> a safe house. He was then approached by officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch who said he could be prosecuted for the offence. The officers said if Fenton agreed {{to work for them}} as an informer he would not be prosecuted, and he would be paid in addition. After agreeing to a further meeting with the officers, Fenton tried to extricate himself from the situation by attempting {{to start a new life}} in Australia with his wife and four children.|$|E

25|$|In 1999 Loevy {{expanded}} his scope to tackle a new issue that was {{rising to the}} forefront of Israeli consciousness: environmentalism. Fourteen Footnotes to a Garbage Mountain was a documentary film about the Hiriya, once Israel's national garbage dump, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. To Israelis, however, the Hiriya is more than a dumpsite. It is a physical landmark—a flat-topped mountain (87 m)—towering over the heavily urbanized coastal plain and the Ayalon River. Loevy succeeded in capturing the world of the Hiriya in its final days, as it was transformed from a <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> a recycling center and national park. He documented life around the site, and the art that sprouted up from its role—once mocked—as a national compost heap.|$|E
25|$|Two small skirmishes {{occurred}} at Hsin Ho during the operation. Located six {{miles northwest of}} Tangku, Hsin Ho {{was the site of}} one of 1st Division's ammunition stores. On the night of October 3, 1946, a party of Communist raiders snuck into the ammunition <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> steal some of the munitions. However, a sentry from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, guard detachment discovered the break in and opened fire on the raiders. Soon after, a rescue party of Marines in a truck was dispatched to the scene, but it was ambushed and the Marines inside were forced to dismount and form a firing line. Before additional reinforcements could arrive from Tankgu, the Communists slipped away. Later the Americans found that several cases of ammunition had been taken from one of the storage tents near the compound's perimeter fence. The body of one raider was also found. One Marine was wounded.|$|E
25|$|On 20 January, the 1st Cavalry Division {{began moving}} 350km north from Landing Zone English in Bình Định Province to Camp Evans {{as part of}} Operation Checkers. While the {{helicopters}} and men of the Division were soon in position, most of their heavy and support equipment was loaded on trucks {{that would have to}} proceed by convoy up Highway 1. While a new supply port was being constructed on the coast, the Division relied on the Marine supply line at Tân Mỹ Base and supply convoys along Highway 1 from Da Nang. On the night of 31 January, the PAVN/VC launched a mortar attack on Camp Evans which caused an ammunition <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> explode, disabling most of the helicopters of the 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion. Other attacks along Highway 1 damaged or destroyed 20 bridges and 26 culverts between the Hải Vân Pass and Phu Bai and Highway 1 was closed to convoy traffic until early March.|$|E

500|$|A large supply dump was {{established}} at Watten {{next to the}} River Aa. This site was eventually used to store material required for all the V-weapon sites in the Saint-Omer area. Building materials were brought there by barges and trains where they were unloaded onto a Decauville narrow-gauge railway for transportation to the construction site, where concrete mixers operated day and night. A 90 kV power line running to a transformer at Holque north of Watten provided electricity. An old quarry at Wizernes codenamed [...] (Gravel Quarry Northwest), some [...] south of Watten, was also converted into a storage <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> supply the Watten facility.|$|E
500|$|While Mayor Corning {{supported}} the largest purchases of Pine Bush land {{as a city}} preserve, he also approved placing the Albany landfill in the Pine Bush, {{the construction of the}} Washington Avenue Extension, and authorizing much of the development that occurred during his 42 years in office as mayor. These all had adverse environmental effects on the Bush. In 1967, a portion of Albany's waterworks/Pine Bush property in the town of Colonie along Central Avenue was sold to developers who built the Northway Mall. Two years later the city moved its <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> the Pine Bush. The Dunes, a single-family housing development {{in the middle of the}} Pine Bush off the Washington Avenue Extension, was built in the mid-1970s.|$|E

After church Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Springfield <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> dispose {{of their old}} Christmas tree, where they find a box of Japanese dishwasher detergent known as Mr. Sparkle. The face of the character on the box of the detergent strongly resembles Homer. Meanwhile, Marge becomes concerned with Lovejoy's lack of enthusiasm about helping people. He explains to Marge that he was enthusiastic about the ministry and helping his fellow man when he first arrived in Springfield. However, his passion for helping people gradually degraded as he dealt with Ned Flanders and his constant complaints over trivial and common issues. Marge begins working for the Church as [...] "The Listen Lady", listening to people's problems and helping solve them. Reverend Lovejoy soon realizes his inadequacy and begins to feel depressed. While he is alone in the church the stained glass images of saints appear and chastise him for doing little to inspire his congregation.|$|E

However, all of the kinescopes of the Allen shows, which were stored in a warehouse along with other now defunct shows, were thrown into a local rubbish <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> make room for new studios. [...] However, the soundtracks were recorded off-air by Tatum enthusiasts at the time, and many are included in Storyville Records' extensive series of rare Tatum recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{stated that}} the {{character}} of Hermione carries several autobiographical influences: [...] "I did not {{set out to make}} Hermione like me but she is...she is an exaggeration of how I was when I was younger." [...] She recalled being called a [...] "little know-it-all" [...] in her youth. Moreover, she states that not unlike herself, [...] "there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure" [...] beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to Albus Dumbledore, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of her encyclopaedic knowledge, she can always be used as a plot <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> explain the Harry Potter universe. Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, [...] "who's the brightest character" [...] and is a [...] "very strong female character".|$|E
2500|$|In the 15th (Scottish) Division area, {{supported}} by patrols from the 47th Division {{south of the}} Ypres–Roulers railway, the 45th Brigade on the right was to attack behind four tanks, a creeping barrage and overhead fire from [...] but the tanks ditched on the Frezenberg–Zonnebeke road short of the front line. As soon as the infantry advance began, German artillery-fire fell on a line from Frezenberg to Square Farm, followed by machine-gun fire on the attacking troops and on the support and reserve troops even before they left their trenches. The 13th Battalion, Royal Scots (13th RS) and the 11th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (11th ASH) were {{supported by}} the 6th Battalion, Cameron Highlanders (6th Cameron). As soon as the advance began, German small-arms fire became so dense that runners could not go back or reinforcements move forward. Recognition flares were seen later at Potsdam, Borry Farm and Vampir Farm but nothing else was known of their progress. Survivors retreated to join the 6th Cameron along the track running north-west from the Railway <b>Dump</b> <b>to</b> Beck House.|$|E

2500|$|Local {{requests}} to evaluate Nerstrand Woods {{as a state}} park site were received favorably by Minnesota officials in 1934. [...] However the diverse ownership situation which preserved the woods {{in the first place}} also stalled the acquisition of parkland. [...] Legislative bills failed and local interest waned, but in 1938 a new federal law allowed the United States Forest Service (USFS) to purchase land here and swap it for state-owned land within Superior National Forest. [...] By 1944 the USFS had title to [...] and a bill officially authorizing Nerstrand Woods State Park passed the next year. [...] A unique clause was inserted in the legislation giving the University of Minnesota the option to conduct forestry experiments in suitable park areas. [...] The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources purchased more of the woodlots during a series of offers starting in the 1950s, expanding the park to cover approximately two square miles, though some private inholdings remained. [...] Trails and a picnic area were developed, followed by a campground in the 1960s. [...] In 1992 the park's name was modified to Nerstrand-Big Woods State Park to emphasize the habitat it preserved. [...] Acquisition of inholdings and surrounding land continues, with recent acquisitions including the former Nerstrand Town <b>Dump</b> <b>to</b> the northwest of the park, and a former dairy farm to the east.|$|E

60|$|There was no stove, of course, and no hearth in our lodging, so we betook {{ourselves}} to the blacksmith's forge across the platform. If the platform {{be taken as a}} stage, and the out-curving margin of the <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> represent the line of the foot-lights, then our house would be the first wing on the actor's left, and this blacksmith's forge, although no match for it in size, the foremost on the right. It was a low, brown cottage, planted close against the hill, and overhung by the foliage and peeling boughs of a madrona thicket. Within it was full of dead leaves and mountain dust, and rubbish from the mine. But we soon had a good fire brightly blazing, and sat close about it on impromptu seats. Chuchu, the slave of sofa- cushions, whimpered for a softer bed; but the rest of us were greatly revived and comforted by that good creature-fire, which gives us warmth and light and companionable sounds, and colours up the emptiest building with better than frescoes. For a while it was even pleasant in the forge, with the blaze in the midst, and a look over our shoulders on the woods and mountains where the day was dying like a dolphin.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF {{conducted}} three {{attacks on}} Rabaul {{as part of}} the preparations for the landing at Jacquinot Bay. On the night of 26 October a force of 18 Bristol Beaufort light bombers drawn from No. 6, No. 8 and No. 100 Squadrons attacked Japanese stores dumps and anti-aircraft positions at Rabaul. The results of this mission were unclear, however. The next raid by the three squadrons was conducted against stores <b>dumps</b> <b>to</b> the north of Rabaul on the evening of 27 October, and most of the bombs which were dropped landed in the target area. The third raid took place on 29 October, and involved 20 Beauforts from the three squadrons striking stores <b>dumps</b> <b>to</b> the west of Rabaul.|$|R

60|$|I {{have already}} {{mentioned}} and the newspapers have told abundantly of the pluck, daring, and admirable work of our aviators; {{what is still}} untellable in any detail is the energy and ability of the constructive and repairing branch upon whose efficiency their feats depend. Perhaps {{the most interesting thing}} I saw in connection with the air work was the hospital for damaged machines and the <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> which those hopelessly injured are taken, in order that they may be disarticulated and all that is sound in them used for reconstruction. How excellently this work is being done may be judged from the fact that our offensive in July started with a certain number of aeroplanes, a number that would have seemed fantastic in a story a year before the war began. These aeroplanes were in constant action; they fought, they were shot down, they had their share of accidents. Not only did the repair department make good every loss, but after three weeks of the offensive the army was fighting with fifty more machines than at the outset. One goes through a vast Rembrandtesque shed opening upon a great sunny field, in whose cool shadows rest a number of interesting patients; captured and slightly damaged German machines, machines of our own with scars of battle upon them, one or two cases of bad landing. The star case came over from Peronne. It had come in two days ago.|$|E
60|$|By {{playing on}} the oaf's conceit, and {{standing}} closely over him, we got a path made round {{the corner of the}} <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> our door, so that we could come and go with decent ease; and he even enjoyed the work, for in that there were boulders to be plucked up bodily, bushes to be uprooted, and other occasions for athletic display: but cutting wood was a different matter. Anybody could cut wood; and, besides, my wife was tired of supervising him, and had other things to attend to. And in short, days went by, and Irvine came daily, and talked and lounged and spat; but the firewood remained intact as sleepers on the platform or growing trees upon the mountain-side. Irvine, as a woodcutter, we could tolerate; but Irvine as a friend of the family, at so much a day, was too bald an imposition, and at length, on the afternoon of the fourth or fifth day of our connection, I explained to him, as clearly as I could, the light in which I had grown to regard his presence. I pointed out to him that I could not continue to give him a salary for spitting on the floor; and this expression, which came after a good many others, at last penetrated his obdurate wits. He rose at once, and said if that was the way {{he was going to be}} spoke to, he reckoned he would quit. And, no one interposing, he departed.|$|E
60|$|I was {{descending}} a steep, cobbled, excavated {{road between}} banked-up footways, perhaps six feet high, upon which, in a monotonous series, opened {{the living room}} doors of rows of dark, low cottages. The perspective of squat blue slate roofs and clustering chimneys drifted downward towards the irregular open space before the colliery--a space covered with coaly, wheel-scarred mud, with a patch of weedy <b>dump</b> <b>to</b> {{the left and the}} colliery gates to the right. Beyond, the High Street with shops resumed again in good earnest and went on, and the lines of the steam-tramway that started out from before my feet, and were here shining and acutely visible with reflected skylight and here lost in a shadow, took up for one acute moment the greasy yellow irradiation of a newly lit gaslamp as they vanished round the bend. Beyond, spread a darkling marsh of homes, an infinitude of little smoking hovels, and emergent, meager churches, public-houses, board schools, and other buildings amidst the prevailing chimneys of Swathinglea. To the right, very clear and relatively high, the Bantock Burden pit-mouth was marked by a gaunt lattice bearing a great black wheel, very sharp and distinct in the twilight, and beyond, in an irregular perspective, were others following the lie of the seams. The general effect, as one came down the hill, was of a dark compressed life beneath a very high and wide and luminous evening sky, against which these pit-wheels rose. And ruling the calm spaciousness of that heaven was the great comet, now green-white, and wonderful for all who had eyes to see.|$|E
