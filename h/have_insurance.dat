The Congressional Budget Office said that it would not reduce the percentage of working age people who do not <b>have</b> <b>insurance</b> over the next 10 years, and that it estimated it would encourage health insurers to reduce rather than increase insurance coverage as it would remove mandated coverage rules that currently apply in some states. This bill would have given the insurance industry greater access to government funds through new insurance subsidies. It did not have any taxation provisions and though it would reduce the deficit over 10 years by $18 billion, this was a considerably smaller deficit reduction than either the House or the Senate bills.|$|E

500|$|Writing in the New Law Journal, Chris Pamplin {{called the}} {{decision}} [...] "unprincipled" [...] {{and argued that}} the decision [...] "threatens the very foundation of witness immunity", based on an out-of-date view of the expert witness as a [...] "hired gun". [...] Pamplin's view was that the majority had [...] "ignored the fundamental difference" [...] between experts and advocates, saying that advocates {{had no choice but}} to continue in the legal system whereas experts could continue their ordinary work without needing to carry on as an expert witness. [...] Therefore, experts would be more likely to abandon such work than advocates, making them more vulnerable to vexatious litigation. [...] However, he said it would make [...] "little immediate difference" [...] for many experts, since [...] "conscientious professionals" [...] would have little worry about being found negligent and would <b>have</b> <b>insurance</b> in case they were. The ruling would also help develop a [...] "professional class of expert", making it less likely that people would contribute expertise occasionally, and although a professional expert witness would have a better knowledge of their role and duties, this would be at the expense of [...] "freshness and challenge to dogma".|$|E

2500|$|These {{structural}} problems result in worse healthcare and therefore worse health outcomes for impoverished populations. Health care costs can pose absolutely serious threats to impoverished populations, especially in countries without proper social provisions. According to US HHS, [...] "In 2009, children 6–17 {{years of age}} {{were more likely to}} be uninsured than younger children, and children with a family income below 200% of the poverty level {{were more likely to be}} uninsured than children in higher-income families." [...] In elderly populations, individuals below 400% of the poverty line were between 3 and 5 times more likely to lack insurance. Children below 200% of the poverty line were also less likely to <b>have</b> <b>insurance</b> than wealthier families. Also, in 2009 in the US, 20% of adults (ages 18–64) below 200% of the poverty line did not receive their necessary drugs because of cost, compared to only 4% of those above 400% of the poverty line. This can be seen in other nations, where in Asia, payments for healthcare pushed almost 3% of the population of 11 countries below 1 US$ per day.|$|E
