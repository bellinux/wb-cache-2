An elephant population census was conducted in Sabah between July 2007 and December 2008, counting dung piles along 216 line transects in five main elephant managed ranges, covering a total distance of 186.12 km. Results of this survey suggest an elephant population of 1,184-3,652 individuals inhabiting the ranges of Tabin, Lower Kinabatangan, North Kinabatangan, Ulu Kalumpang Forest Reserve and the central forest of Sabah. The elephant density and population size varied throughout the five key ranges affected by (i) conversion of lowland forest; (ii) fragmentation of habitat and (iii) <b>existing</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> activities such as logging.

PT Angkasa Pura I will relocate 35 guest houses to accommodate the expansion, {{which is expected to}} occupy up to 265.5 hectares of land for a new access road to the airport and a new airport building, {{the construction of a new}} flyover, enlarge airport terminal and improve luggage handling system.There have been several plans made seeking a solution to the expansion problems at Ngurah Rai International airport. There have been proposals to develop a north-south runway however <b>existing</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> in the areas adjacent to the airport makes this idea unfeasible due to the considerable land purchase costs. A completely new airport was proposed to ease the airport' congestion due to the area surrounding the existing airport not supporting significant long-term expansion. A masterplan was announced for works at this airport for 2009-2011, which includes a new international terminal with 120,000 square meters in area to be built and the existing international terminal with area of 56.000 square meters will be renovated for use as a new domestic terminal. The new international terminal opened in November 2013, while the domestic terminal opened on 17 September 2014 with an area of 65,800 square meters, eight departure and seven arrival gates, five passenger boarding bridges, five conveyor belts, as well as more number of counters — 62 for check-in, 4 for transit and 19 for ticketing. And can accommodate 25 million passengers a year until 2025. This provided land for building a new horseshoe shaped building for 17 passenger aircraft parking at the east area on the former domestic terminal. The plan also incorporated a runway extension to 3,600 m. Currently airplanes up to the size of Boeing 777-300ER, Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner can use the airport. Although Ngurah Rai International Airport already has a parking slot for the Airbus A380, some taxiway turns are still being widened to accommodate the superjumbo jet.|$|E
40|$|Afforestation {{has many}} {{benefits}} {{at the local}} regional and global scale. The local social impacts of planting new forests, however, depend {{on a variety of}} contextual factors and other details including who is doing the planting, which species are being planted, the location of the planting and, perhaps most importantly, <b>existing</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and their linkage to social and economic circumstances. This article presents case study research into these issues in two places in County Kerry Ireland. Utilising the concept of the differentiated landscape, we examine the somewhat varying social responses to afforestation in the two study sites in light of the different environmental and social and economic circumstances in the two adjacent areas. We conclude that a more locally nuanced approach to forest planting than has been common in the past could well create greater social acceptance of future afforestation and benefits accruing from it...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examined}} the usability of large urban facilities in spatial transformation {{as a case}} study of regional shopping centres (also referred to as shopping malls) in the metropolitan city of Istanbul, Turkey. The research is originated from the idea that large urban developments attract new <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and users to their proximity, and/or repel some <b>existing</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and users around them during the process of benefit and/or profit maximization. This process can also be named as “voluntarily transformation ” process. In this context, we performed user surveys in residential and commercial units as well as at real estate agents in the proximity of two large shopping centres; namely, Akmerkez (Beşiktaş County) and Tepe-Nautilus (Kadıköy County) in Istanbul. In addition, in the study areas data on <b>land</b> <b>use</b> changes collected by the State Statistics Institute (SSI) of Turkey during the last two decades have been examined. It is concluded that the shopping centres stimulated urban transformation on real estates in their close proximity, and in time they created transformations from residential to commercial within their primary influence boundaries, and beyond those up to a certain distance, they became attractive zones for residential use...|$|R
30|$|At low altitude, {{the soils}} under {{farmland}} {{had the highest}} percentage of sand content (41.9 %) while those under grazing <b>land</b> <b>use</b> systems had the lowest (31.5 %). Again, at this altitude, mean percentage sand content at the surface (0 – 15  cm) layer showed no significant difference (P >  0.01) between the soils under all the land use/land cover systems. There was no <b>existing</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> where natural forest cover and savanna vegetation was protected against disturbance either by burning or grazing in this area. Therefore there were high similarities with nonsignificant differences in soil properties under the different <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> in this area. Generally, the results showed that sand content increased when converting natural forest to cropland, and this is most likely resulting from the preferential removal of clay and silt and residual accumulation of sand in soil surface resulting from preferential segregation and evacuation of the smaller silt and clay particles, by accelerated water erosion. These results are in agreement with the findings of Javad et al. (2014) who attesting to the results of Ayele et al. (2013) reported that sand content is a physical parameter affected by soil erosion and, hence, can be measured and used as an indicator for evaluating soil degradation under different <b>land</b> <b>use</b> systems.|$|R
