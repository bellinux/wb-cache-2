5|$|On Election Day, Perot {{finished}} {{in third place}} behind Clinton (the winner) and Bush. Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any states in the Electoral College because of the relatively <b>even</b> <b>distribution</b> of his support, but did win over 30% {{of the vote in}} Maine and 27% in Utah, finishing second in both states. Perot was the first third party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to finish first in a county, winning counties in Alaska (divided into boroughs), California, Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Texas and Maine. He won his largest percentage in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska and Loving County, Texas with over 40%. According to exit polls, 52% of Perot's supporters were male, 94% were white, 63% were aged between 18 and 44, and about 2/3 had not received a college degree. The income of supporters mirrored the general public. In terms of ideology, 53% identified as moderates, 27% were conservative and 20% were liberal, while two-thirds were either members of the Democratic Party or were politically independent.|$|E

5|$|The puffadder shyshark is more slender {{than other}} shysharks, with a short, broad, dorsally {{flattened}} {{head and a}} narrowly rounded snout. The large, oval-shaped eyes have cat-like slit pupils, a simple nictitating membrane (a protective third eyelid), and a prominent ridge underneath. The nostrils are very large, {{with a pair of}} greatly expanded, triangular flaps of skin in front that are fused together and reach the mouth. There is a deep groove connecting the excurrent (outflow) opening of each nostril to the mouth, obscured by the nasal flaps. The mouth is short with furrows at the corners on both jaws. There are 26–30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27–33 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Tooth shape is sexually dimorphic: those of males are longer and three-pointed, while those of females are shorter and five-pointed. Unusually, the two halves of the lower jaw are connected by a special cartilage, which allows a more <b>even</b> <b>distribution</b> of teeth and may increase bite strength.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{wireless}} networks, reducing aggregate {{transmit power}} {{and in many}} cases, having <b>even</b> power <b>distribution</b> increase the network lifetime. Conventional direct transmission (DTX) scheme results in high aggregate transmit power and uneven power distribution. In this paper, we consider location-aware cooperation-based schemes namely immediate-neighbor cooperation (INC), maximal cooperation (MAX), and wireless network cocast (WNC) that achieve spatial diversity to reduce aggregate transmit power and <b>even</b> power <b>distribution.</b> INC utilizes twouser cooperative communication, resulting in good reduction of aggregate transmit power and low transmission delay; however, power distribution is still uneven. MAX utilizes multi-node cooperative communication, providing incremental diversity to achieve <b>even</b> power <b>distribution</b> and substantial reduction in aggregate transmit power. Transmission delay in MAX, however, grows quadratically with network sizes. As a result, the novel WNC is proposed to achieve incremental diversity as in MAX and low transmission delay as in INC. In WNC, mobile units acting as relays form unique linearly-coded signals from overheard signals and transmit them to the destination, where a multiuser detector jointly detects the symbols from all received signals. Performance evaluation in uniformly distributed networks shows that INC, MAX, and WNC substantially reduce aggregate transmit power while MAX and WNC also provide <b>even</b> power <b>distribution.</b> Index Terms—Location-aware, cooperative communication, incremental diversity, cocast, amplify-and-forward, decode-andforward, multiuser detection.
