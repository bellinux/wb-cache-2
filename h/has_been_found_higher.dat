Two-Step Q&P thermal treatments were performed at laboratory scale in a quenching dilatometer Bähr DIL 805 A/D. The fractions of retained austenite were evaluated by X-ray diffraction techniques.

In contrast, the BR difference did not survive controlling for mind wandering (MW questionnaire) whose variability could account for contrasting earlier reports, although no significant hypnotisability-related difference has been observed in MW scores. Findings do not allow to exclude that mechanisms other than dopaminergic ones may be involved in the observed difference in BR. In particular, we suggest that one of the mechanisms possibly sustaining the highs' higher BR may be a reduced cerebellar inhibition. In fact, cerebellar impairment is associated with higher BR and several studies of sensorimotor integration indicate different cerebellar controls in the highs' and lows' behavior...|$|E

This depicts a reduction in the unit cost of Bt cotton, which is the distinct advantage of the new technology. A higher yield of 29 per cent has been obtained by the Bt cotton farmers over the hybrid cotton growers. The study has identified the constraints in production, and marketing of Bt cotton in the area.

40|$|The pathway {{by which}} {{barbital}} reaches {{the brain is}} still unknown. Generally there are two possible pathways through which substances in blood enter into the brain, namely, one, directly through blood vessels and the other, {{by way of the}} choriomeningeal plexus. Barbital will possibly enter the brain by the former pathway but it may enter the brain by way of the cerebro-spinal fluid {{as in the case of}} P. (32) In order to verify this point, I have measured the barbital concentrations in the lumbar fluid and the ventricle fluid, each obtained at the time of lobotomy and at the pneumo-ventriclography, respectively. From these results, it has been found that barbital immigrated into the cerebro-spinal fluid faster than bromine so that there seems to be a possible pathway to the brain through this fluid. Moreover, in the measurements of the barbital concentration in the ventricle fluid after oral administration <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> than that in the lumbar fluid.

30|$|The wash {{fastness}} {{ratings in}} Table  3 show that chitosan-treated and untreated jute fabrics dyed with henna dye have almost identical fastness ratings of “good” to “excellent” (within numerical grades 4 – 5) {{with very little}} variation. Again, the staining of color to adjacent multifiber fabric <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> for chitosan-treated dyed samples (D, E) particularly in cotton and wool fiber (3 – 4 and 3). Moreover, in case of dry rubbing (Table  4), all types of dyed samples have shown almost similar ratings; however, chitosan-treated samples with higher concentrations represent a lower rating (3 – 4) compared to untreated samples (4 – 5) for wet rubbing. In general, deeper shade shows inferior fastness to washing and rubbing than a lighter one on a similar type of fabric for the same dyestuff (Bhuiyan et al. 2013), because in case of deep shade, dye molecules are more saturated and tend to move out from {{the interior of the}} fiber due to washing. As discussed earlier, the chitosan present in the fabric enhances the dyesite causing higher absorption of dye resulting in a higher depth of shade. Hence, as a general consequence of achieving deeper shade, the chitosan-treated fabric samples have shown a slightly lower fastness rating in comparison to lighter, untreated fabric.|$|E
