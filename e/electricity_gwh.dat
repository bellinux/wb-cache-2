40|$|Models for {{electricity}} planning require inclusion of demand. Depending {{on the type}} of planning, the demand is usually represented as an annual demand for <b>electricity</b> (<b>GWh),</b> a peak demand (MW) or in the form of annual load-duration curves. The demand {{for electricity}} varies with the seasons, economic activities, etc. Existing schemes do not capture the dynamics of demand variations that are important for planning. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of representative load curves (RLCs). Advantages of RLCs are demonstrated in a case study for the state of Karnataka in India. Multiple discriminant analysis is used to cluster the 365 daily load curves for 1993 - 94 into nine RLCs. Further analyses of these RLCs help to identify important factors, namely, seasonal, industrial, agricultural, and residential (water heating and air-cooling) demand variations besides rationing by the utility.

30|$|Energy {{generation}} using {{solar photovoltaic}} requires large area. As {{cost of the}} land is growing day by day, there is a strong requirement to use the available land as efficiently as possible. Here, we explored the potential of energy generation using the land above national road highways by constructing a roof structure. This space can contribute to the energy generation without extra cost for the land. It also results in energy efficiency, for example, improved vehicle movement and minimum energy for air conditioning of vehicles. Additionally, it also helps in minimum road repairs and longer vehicle tire life due to the effect of sun shade. Thus, the expenditure for wear and tear for road repairs is reduced considerably. From our modelling study, it is observed that the Ahmedabad-Rajkot highway can generate 104 MW of <b>electricity</b> (163 <b>GWh</b> of annual energy generation) and the Ahmedabad-Vadodara highway space can generate 61 MW of <b>electricity</b> (96 <b>GWh</b> of annual energy generation) for single-layer solar panels. If there are two layers of solar panels one over the other, the annual energy generation of the same highways, Ahmedabad-Rajkot and Ahmedabad-Vadodara, can be increased to 229 GWh and 140 GWh, respectively. If our concept is implemented throughout India, it not only increases the power generation to more than a few gigawatts of electricity but also has other various fringe benefits including longer road life, employment generation, reduced CO 2 emission in environment, etc.|$|R

50|$|Austria {{embarked}} on its energy transition (Energiewende) some decades ago. Due to geographical conditions, energy production in Austria {{relies heavily on}} renewable energies, notably hydropower. 78.4% of domestic production in 2013 came from renewable energy, 9.2% from natural gas and 7.2% from petroleum. (rest: waste). On {{the basis of the}} Federal Constitutional Law for a Nuclear-Free Austria, no nuclear power stations are in operation in Austria.But domestic energy production makes up only 36% of Austria's total energy consumption, which among other things encompasses transport, electricity production, and heating. In 2013, oil accounts for about 36.2% of total energy consumption, renewable energies 29.8%, gas 20.6%, and coal 9.7%. In the past 20 years, the structure of gross domestic energy consumption has shifted from coal and oil to new renewables, in particular between 2005 and 2013 (plus 60%). The EU target for Austria require a renewables share of 34% by 2020 (gross final energy consumption). Austria is on a good way to achieve this target (32.5% in 2013). Energy transition in Austria can be also seen on the local level, in some villages, towns and regions. For example, the town of Güssing in the state of Burgenland is a pioneer in independent and sustainable energy production. Since 2005, Güssing has already produced significantly more heating (58 gigawatt hours) and <b>electricity</b> (14 <b>GWh)</b> from renewable resources than the city itself needs.|$|R

40|$|Sugar cane {{is a major}} commercially grown {{agricultural}} crop {{in the vast majority}} of countries in Africa. It is one of the plants having the highest bioconversion efficiency of capture of sunlight through photosynthesis and is able to fix around 55 tonnes of dry matter per hectare of land under this crop on annually renewable basis. Under current practice, 50 % of this dry matter are harvested in the form of cane stalk for sugar recovery with the fibrous fraction therefrom in the form of bagasse meeting, through combustion, energy requirements for the process. Cane production in Mauritius varies between 5. 0 to 5. 5 million tonnes, 35 % of which are produced by around 28, 000 small growers. Between 550, 000 to 625, 000 tonnes of sugar are recovered from the cane. A number of countries, in particular those devoid of any fossil fuel, have implemented energy conservation and efficiency measures so as to minimise cogenerated energy (steam and electricity) utilised in cane processing and to export excess electricity to the grid. In Mauritius 10 out of 11 factories are exporting electricity to the grid during crop season out of which three are using coal as a complementary fuel to export electricity during the intercrop as well. Such <b>electricity</b> (725 <b>GWh</b> including 318 GWh from bagasse accounts for 40 % of the total amount generated. All the power plants are privately owned. This development has been possible through the participation of all the stakeholders (corporate and small planters) with Government providing appropriate policy guidelines, legal framework and incentives. There is thus potential for replication of this successful experience to other sugar cane producing countries in Africa. The current cane production is around 90 million tonnes. A potential for around 10, 000 GWh exists from this annually renewable resource considering the conversion efficiency achieved in Mauritius. ...|$|R

We evaluate the potential for energy savings and CO 2 emission reductions. We start by benchmarking the energy performance of 8 operating plants in 2010, and 12 plants under construction. The benchmarking shows that the energy intensity of local cement facilities is high, when compared to the international best practice, indicating a significant potential for energy efficiency improvement. The average electricity intensity and fuel intensity of the operating plants is 34 % and 36 % higher. For plants under construction, electricity use is 36 % and fuel use 27 % higher.

Bagasse, a residue obtained from the crushing a sugar cane in the sugar factory, is burnt in in an boiler of an annexed cogeneration plant to produce superheated steam which is then fed in a condensing extraction steam turbine coupled with an alternator to produce electricity and low pressure and temperature steam. The latter is used as process heat to produce raw sugar and refined sugar in the sugar factory and refinery respectively. Although the Mauritian sugar cane factories are equipped with the latest technology such as efficient electric motors equipped with variable speed drives, diffusers, automated systems, real-time monitoring of processes, efficient pumps, opportunities exist for a reduction in energy consumption for the evaporating process. Analysis of heat consumed by a flexi-factory shows that the five effect evaporator used by its sugar factory {{is by far the}} largest consumers.

The optimal sets of RE technologies, mix of capacities, operation modes and least cost energy supply were calculated {{and the role}} of storage technologies was analysed. The RE generated was not only able to fulfil the electricity demand of the power sector but also able to cover the 25 % increase in total electricity demand due to water desalination and synthesis of natural gas for industrial use. The results for the power sector show that the total installed capacity is formed of 165 GW of solar photovoltaics (PV), 85 GW of hydro dams, 12 GW of hydro run-of-river, 8 GW of biogas, 12 GW of biomass and 8 GW of wind power. For solar PV and wind electricity storage, 243 GWhel of battery capacity is needed. According to the simulations the existing hydro dams will function similarly to batteries, being an essential <b>electricity</b> storage. 1 <b>GWh</b> of pumped hydro storage, 23 GWh of adiabatic compressed air storage and 1 GWh of heat storage are used as well. The small storage capacities can be explained by a high availability of RE sources with low seasonal variability and an existing electricity sector mainly based on hydro dams. Therefore, only 0. 05 GW of PtG technologies are needed for seasonal storage in the electricity sector. When water desalination and industrial gas sectors’ electricity demand are integrated to the power sector, a reduction of 11 % in both total cost and electric energy generation was achieved.

The study concludes that there is a great potential for increasing the use of waste energy at SSAB. Today many of these flows are pure losses that are cooled away or burnt. The total heat loss for the steel production in one year is approximately 2380 GWh or a total power of 272 MW. From exergy calculations it can be shown that the upper theoretical limit when converting the energy into high quality energy such as <b>electricity</b> is 950 <b>GWh</b> or 108 MW. The conclusion is {{that it is possible to}} recycle an impressive amount of energy. The technologies for this are briefly discussed concerning the ORC and Kalina cycle. Other solutions are also briefly investigated, for example one solution is to use waste heat in the district heating system and by doing so making it possible for the local power company to produce more electricity. Most data regarding these calculations were extracted from a local processing system and then stored in a model describing the plant. The calculations are presented in the result part in the form of tables and diagrams. This study does not consider if an investment is economical feasible, just that it has a great potential.
