5|$|Bell: Clapper-bells made {{of pottery}} {{have been found}} in several archaeological sites. The {{earliest}} metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. Early bells not only <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in generating metal sound, but arguably played a prominent cultural role. With the emergence of other kinds of bells during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and Zhou sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs.|$|E

25|$|Glucocorticoid hormones <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in {{regulating}} aggressive behavior. In adult rats, acute injections of corticosterone promote aggressive behavior and acute reduction of corticosterone decreases aggression; however, a chronic reduction of corticosterone levels can produce abnormally aggressive behavior.

Adult mice with low baseline levels of corticosterone {{are more likely to}} become dominant than are mice with high baseline corticosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong rejects dispositionalism, {{the idea}} that dispositional {{properties}} (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in explaining laws of nature. Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism presents for his account of laws of nature {{is not in the}} case of manifested dispositions (say, a glass dropping on the ground and breaking) but unmanifested dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to drop the glass on the ground, it would break). Armstrong simply states that the disposition is simply {{in the nature of the}} instantiated properties of the thing which is supposed to have the disposition.|$|E

25|$|The {{translation}} of Williams to Canterbury was widely canvassed. As a bishop he had demonstrated {{a wide range}} of interests in social and political matters and was widely regarded, by academics and others, as a figure who could make Christianity credible to the intelligent unbeliever. As a patron of Affirming Catholicism, his appointment was a considerable departure from that of his predecessor and his views, such as those expressed in a widely published lecture on homosexuality were seized on by a number of Evangelical and conservative Anglicans. The debate had begun to divide the Anglican Communion, however, and Williams, in his new role as its leader was to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role.</b>|$|E

His theory about conversion of fats into carbohydrates remained unproven, despite his provision of several indirect proofs. He devoted his spare time to golf, motorcycling and painting. He was married to Mary W. McWalter, but they never had children. He died in 1935 in Aberdeen after several years of suffering from arthritis, despite which he remained active almost until his death. In 1933 he made a lecture tour of the US, and in 1934 he published the 7th edition of his book Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine.|$|E

25|$|Boa constrictors {{are very}} popular within the exotic pet trade, {{and have been}} both {{captured}} in the wild and bred in captivity. Today, most captive boa constrictors are captive-bred, but between 1977 and 1983, 113,000 live boa constrictors were imported into the United States. These huge numbers of wild-caught snakes have put considerable pressure on some wild populations. Boa constrictors have also been harvested for their meat and skins, and are a common sight at markets within their geographic range. After the reticulated python, boa constrictors are the snake most commonly killed for snakeskin products, such as shoes, bags, and other items of clothing. In some areas, they <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in regulating the opossum populations, preventing the potential transmission of leishmaniasis to humans. In other areas, they are often let loose within the communities to control the rodent populations.|$|E
25|$|In an inquisitorial {{system of}} law, the {{examining}} magistrate (also called investigating magistrate, inquisitorial magistrate, or investigating judge), is {{a judge who}} carries out pre-trial investigations into allegations of crime {{and in some cases}} makes a recommendation for prosecution. The exact role and standing of examining magistrates varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; common duties and powers of the examining magistrate include overseeing ongoing criminal investigations, issuing search warrants, authorizing wiretaps, making decisions on pretrial detention, interrogating the accused person, questioning witnesses, examining evidence, and compiling a dossier of evidence in preparation for trial. Examining magistrates <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in the French judiciary, and are also a feature of the Spanish, Dutch, Belgian and Greek criminal justice systems, although the extent of the examining magistrate's role has generally diminished over time. Several countries, including Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, and Italy, have abolished the position of examining magistrate outright.|$|E
25|$|The Oilers were mediocre {{during the}} regular season in their first two seasons, {{finishing}} sixteenth and fourteenth respectively. However, {{due to the fact that}} 16 of the 21 NHL teams made the playoffs at the time, the Oilers were still able to get their young players experience in the playoffs (they would make the playoffs for their first thirteen years in the NHL). They won only one playoff series over this time span though, upsetting the Montreal Canadiens in 1980–81. Gretzky set new NHL records in 1980–81 for assists (109) and points (with 164). Also, they still had great draft positions. This allowed the Oilers to put together a young, talented, experienced team quickly. Within three years, Sather and chief scout Barry Fraser had drafted several players who would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in the team's success, including Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey, Kevin Lowe, Grant Fuhr and Andy Moog.|$|E

25|$|Ottawa's {{role as the}} nation's capital {{also means}} that {{it is home to}} over a hundred foreign missions. These {{embassies}} <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in the city's architecture. Many embassies and ambassadorial residences are located in notable heritage structures. Many of the old mansions built by lumber barons or early politicians now house embassies, and the foreign missions help keep many of these buildings in good condition. This is especially important in older parts of the city such as Sandy Hill and Rockcliffe Park. Examples include the Algerian Embassy in Fleck/Paterson House, the British high commissioner residence at Earnscliffe, and the High Commission of Brunei in Stadacona Hall. Those nations that choose to build a new structure to hold the embassy often incorporate local styles and motifs into their buildings, bringing added diversity to Ottawa's architecture. The new Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti incorporate distinctly Middle Eastern design elements, while the American embassy is a distinctly Federal style structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures, which suggests they will <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in nanotechnology engineering. The highest tensile strength {{of an individual}} multi-walled carbon nanotube has been tested to be 63GPa. Carbon nanotubes were found in Damascus steel from the 17th century, possibly helping {{to account for the}} legendary strength of the swords made of it. Recently, several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic (>1mm in all three dimensions) all-carbon devices. Lalwani et al. have reported a novel radical initiated thermal crosslinking method to fabricated macroscopic, free-standing, porous, all-carbon scaffolds using single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as building blocks. These scaffolds possess macro-, micro-, and nano- structured pores and the porosity can be tailored for specific applications. These 3D all-carbon scaffolds/architectures may be used for the fabrication of the next generation of energy storage, supercapacitors, field emission transistors, high-performance catalysis, photovoltaics, and biomedical devices and implants.|$|E
25|$|In {{central nervous}} system not all bHLH genes are {{involved}} in neurogenesis because NeuroD and ‘’Math3/NeuroM’’ families are also involved in the neuronal-versus-glial cell fate decision. Another pro-neural family (which includes ‘’math1’’ and ‘’math5’’) {{is essential to the}} development of a small number of neural lineages whereas ‘’math1’’ have also a role in the specification interneuron identity. Cell types that depend on ‘’math1’’ expression belong to the proprioceptive sensory pathway. Bertrand et al. (2002) have confirmed the proneural activity of ‘’mash1’’, ngn1 and ngn2, and possibly math1 and ‘’math5’’ in the mouse. Neurogenesis in the {{central nervous system}} depends on proneural gene inhibition by Notch signaling pathway and the absence of this key regulator results in the premature differentiation of neurons. To maintain neural progenitor cells a regulatory loop takes place between neighboring cells, that involves the lateral inhibition process (see lateral inhibition). In the absence of Lateral inhibition some proneural genes such as ASCL1 or ‘’neuroG’’ are capable of inducing the expression of neuron-specific genes leading to the premature formation of early born-neurons. Ratié and colleagues (2013) comprised that Notch proneural gene network <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in cell fate renewal and transition in the mouse.|$|E
