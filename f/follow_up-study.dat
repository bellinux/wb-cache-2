40|$|Objectives: The {{mental health}} of open prison inmates is {{virtually}} un-researched. This study aims to fill that gap. The researcher hypothesised that the open prison inmates would present with significantly fewer mental health problems than is reported in closed prisons. Design: Mental health data from an open prison sample was collected using a battery of tests/tools, and then compared to general population and closed prison data available in the literature. This approach was chosen as to put the {{mental health of}} the open prison inmates in a gradient context. Methods: The sample (N = 74) was collected from an open prison in Ireland. The test (administered in individual interviews) were: STAI, GHQ 12, Brief Jail Mental Health Screen, Correctional Mental Health Screen for Men, England Mental Health Screen, and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being scale. The tests were chosen based on scoring formats and their degree of validation in relevant literature. Analysis was conducted using SPSS. Results: Mental Health tests indicated widespread presence of mental health problems at rates approximating/exceeding those reported for closed prisons. In contrast, the STAI and WEMWBS indicated a) anxiety at general population levels, and b) mental well-being better than general population levels. Conclusions: An open prison setting is conductive to positive mental health, but this by itself does not seem to mitigate the high incidence rate of mental health problems that is found in prisons in general.

40|$|Sweden’s {{environmental}} {{work is to}} set {{out from}} 16 national environmental quality objectives. It aims {{to work for a}} sustainable society and to solve our current environmental problems today and not pass them on to future generations. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate Uppföljning av handlingsprogram för miljömål (a <b>follow</b> <b>up-study</b> of a programme for environmental quality objectives) and to propose new methods to work with the revision of Handlingsprogram – så genomför vi de regionala miljömålen i Hallands län (a programme to implement the regional environmental quality objectives in the County of Halland), a revision which will start in autumn 2010. We focused on the work done by the six municipalities of the County of Halland and by Region Halland, a joint venture organization of these municipalities.   Results: Summaries from 2008 and 2010 both show a wide dissemination of the work done by the six municipalities. The priority of targets and actions are not made by the local officials. Instead, the decisions are made by politicians and are governed primarily by the municipalities and Region Halland's visions and by available funding and existing competence. The environmental target A Sustainable Good Built Environment is the environmental quality objective that contains the most measures Not Yet Started, suggesting that the objective is difficult to implement and that additional support from the County Government would be desirable. To promote future work a good communication between the County Government and the operators is of paramount importance. Our opinion is that the municipalities and the County have not so far been cooperating in the best possible way. The County Government wants to be considered a resource and a supporting organisation, but it is not often seen that way by the municipalities. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{multiple}} mini interview (MMI) is an admissions instrument {{designed to}} replace the personal interview in health care student selection. Its effectiveness has been evaluated in medical student recruitment processes (Eva et al., 2004 a, Roberts et al., 2014). At the commencement of this research no reliability, validity, or acceptability studies had been published specifically in relation to student midwife selection. Study objectives: to develop, pilot and evaluate the reliability, validity and acceptability of MMIs in student midwife selection in a Higher Education Institution (HEI) in the United Kingdom (UK). A dual paradigmatic dialectical enquiry was used in a multi-method case study. A literature review and qualitative work were conducted to identify the desirable personal qualities of a student midwife. This {{was followed by the}} systematic development of a customised eight station, five-minute MMI model. Sixty-two students from the BSc Midwifery Studies, September 2011 and 2012 cohorts, at the University of Surrey, volunteered to undertake ‘mock’ MMIs {{in the first week of}} their programme. Fifty-seven participants were followed up having completed their first year. Predictive validity was assessed using students’ end of year OSCE and mentor grading; station reliability, including inter-station and internal consistency, were also examined. Interviewers’ (n= 9) and candidates’ (n= 62) views of MMIs were obtained from a focus group and semi-structured questionnaires respectively. The literature review revealed that acknowledgement of the importance of ‘emotionality’ or an emotional dimension in the relationship between a woman and her midwife was missing from key professional, regulatory (Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2009, 2010, International Confederation of Midwives, 2011) and government documentation (Department of Health, DH, 2012). According to the Department of Health (DH, 2013), selection to all National Health Service (NHS) funded training posts should incorporate recruitment for the NHS Constitution values (DH, 2012). In the absence of any mention of ‘emotionality’ it is suggested that this requires more specific recognition in considerations of what is important to appraise at selection. No statistically significant associations were found between students’ MMI score and their subsequent performance in clinical practice. The University Registrar would not consent to ‘live’ selection using MMIs in the absence of midwifery-specific evidence; participants were therefore students who had already been accepted onto an undergraduate midwifery programme. This has been addressed in an on-going longitudinal <b>follow</b> <b>up-study.</b> Reliability (internal consistency) was ‘excellent’ with Cronbach’s alpha scores between 0. 91 - 0. 97 across eight stations. Inter-station reliability findings suggested that each station measured different independent constructs with only a moderate positive correlation between two stations, kindness, compassion and respect for privacy and dignity (p< 0. 01). All other stations indicated little or no relationship offering additional support to the reliability of the scales. Candidates stated that undertaking MMIs would not discourage them from applying to the University as they felt they were a fair assessment instrument. They suggested that the multi- interview format was a positive feature which allowed them to recover from a poor performance at any one station. Overall, 23 participants (37...|$|E
40|$|Disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) {{are being}} used in {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) for the last 20 years. Until recently, only interferon beta and glatiramer acetate preparations were available, which are administered by repetitive injections. In {{the last quarter of}} 2010, the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first oral DMD, fingolimod. Fingolimod is a modulator of sphingosine- 1 phosphate (S 1 P) receptors which are present in many tissues such as neural cells and lymphocytes. By inhibiting the S 1 P signalling which is necessary for lymphocytes to leave the lymph nodes, it traps lymphocytes within the lymph nodes causing lymphopenia. However, since it does not harm the lymphocytes, this lymphophenia is quickly reversible after the drug withdrawal. Both preclinical studies and Phase II and Phase III studies carried out in patients with relapsing MS have yielded promising results. In the Phase III trials, fingolimod was effective both against placebo and weekly interferon beta- 1 a injections in preventing relapses and lesion load accumulation. Phase II and Phase III studies showed that fingolimod has a favorable safety profile; long-term safety needs to be shown in long-term <b>follow</b> <b>up-studies.</b> (Archives of Neuropsychiatry 2011; 48 Supplement 2 : 64 - 6...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} if the Norwegian {{guide to}} {{diagnosis and treatment}} of ADHD has included the results form the MTA-study. To find out what the results of the MTA-study can tell us about how we should perform treatment of ADHD today. Background: We have been wondering about what the best treatment for ADHD is for a long time. We have in particular wanted to look at the empery on behaviour treatment vs medication, and if the combination of these has advantages over the two alone. MTA was the only long term study of this theme, and therefore we chose to focus our work on articles published by the MTA-cooperative group. Method: We chose to do a literature study. We used Pubmed and performed the search for ADHD, MTA-study and NIMH. We found that the MTA-cooperative group had published so many studies that we had to make some exclusion criteria to adjust the material to our capacity. We read the articles we chose and also read the Norwegian guide to {{diagnosis and treatment of}} ADHD. Results: After 14 months the MTA-study showed statistically significant superior effect of treatments which included intensive, monitored medication versus the treatments that did not include this. The difference in improvement of ADHD-symptoms between the groups that received intensive, monitored medication and the groups that did not, had diminished by 50 percent after 24 months but was still statistically significant. The 3 year <b>follow</b> <b>up-studies</b> showed that everyone that received treatment improved from baseline on ADHD-symptoms and there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. Some of the additional studies give a more nuanced view on these results. The most important finding is that there is additional improvement when a multimodal approach is used, especially for some subgroups. Conclusion: The authors of the Norwegian guide to diagnosis and treatment of ADHD only used one small study from the MTA-group. The reference list did not contain the main MTA-studies at all. We found that the Norwegian guide was broad and not precise. It leaves the decision on how to treat ADHD up to the clinician. We conclude that the Norwegian guide would benefit from including a more precise strategy on use of medication in the treatment of ADHD.
