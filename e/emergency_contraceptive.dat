Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E

Results: Mean age of onset of menarche was 13. 35 years. Many girls (86. 65 %) had knowledge of menstruation prior to menarche. For 68 % of girls, mother {{was a source of}} menstrual information. Half of the girls reported some form of restriction in activities during menstruation due to religious reasons. 11 % girls suffered from some form of reproductive tract infections (RTIs).

500|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>contraceptive</b> {{methods are}} {{medications}} (sometimes misleadingly {{referred to as}} [...] "morning-after pills") or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse {{with the hope of}} preventing pregnancy. They work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization. They are unlikely to affect implantation, but this has not been completely excluded. A number of options exist, including high dose birth control pills, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, ulipristal and IUDs. Levonorgestrel pills, when used within 3days, decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70% (resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2%). Ulipristal, when used within 5days, decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85% (pregnancy rate 1.4%) and might be a little more effective than levonorgestrel. Mifepristone is also more effective than levonorgestrel while copper IUDs are the most effective method. IUDs can be inserted up to fivedays after intercourse and prevent about 99% of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex (pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2%). This makes them the most effective form of <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptive.</b> In those who are overweight or obese levonorgestrel is less effective and an IUD or ulipristal is recommended.|$|E

40|$|Unwanted and {{unintended}} pregnancies pose major {{reproductive health}} challenges to women throughout the world. Despite {{the availability of}} modern contraceptives, many women and men fail to use contraceptives effectively. This research focussed on reasons for not using contraceptives effectively in the Northern Tshwane area of the Gauteng Province of the Republic of South Africa (RSA). Structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 83 women and 71 men about their contraceptive practices. Age, religion, educational level and residential areas influenced clients' contraceptive practices. These results were categorised for adult males and females as well as for adolescent males and females. Adolescents encountered problems in accessing contraceptive services. Adult females knew most about traditional contraceptives, although men knew about some of these methods, and adolescents used some of them. All respondents could gain additional knowledge about modern contraceptives. The respondents' knowledge about Â· <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptives</b> was extremely limited. Although most respondents knew about legalised choice on. termination of pregnancy (CTOP) services in the RSA, they did not know when nor how to access these services. Nurses working in contraceptive health services, revealed during a focus group discussion that a lack of resources (including shortages of malcondoms, contraceptive injections and oral contraceptives) hampered the quality of services that could be rendered. Of particular concern was the nonavailability of Norplant implants and female condoms. Nurses expressed a need for pecific national policy guidelines about supplying contraception to adolescents. Although most nurses knew about <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> they did not promote its use because they assumed that clients would misuse <b>emergency</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> instead of using contraceptives regularly.
