5|$|An <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> Southcote Manor in the 1960s {{uncovered}} many Roman, Romano-British {{and medieval}} artefacts such as sherds and pottery; {{a sample of}} the latter was discovered to have originated in Oxford in the 2nd century.

5|$|Cobalt {{has been}} used to color glass since the Bronze Age. The <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> the Uluburun {{shipwreck}} yielded an ingot of blue glass, cast during the 14th century BC. Blue glass items from Egypt are colored with copper, iron, or cobalt. The oldest cobalt-colored glass is from the Eighteenth dynasty in Egypt (1550–1292 BC). The source of that cobalt is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Systematic archeological <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> {{the area}} has not been conducted, yet {{numerous}} construction projects during the intensive urban development of the later {{half of the twentieth}} century led to important circumstantial discoveries, which shed light on the historic timeline of the settlement.|$|E

5|$|The <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> the workers' {{village of}} Deir el-Madinah has {{resulted}} {{in one of the}} most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years.

5|$|The major <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> {{the site}} {{in the winter of}} 2004–05 {{concentrated}} on the building and a 10m (33ft) zone surrounding it. The results indicated that {{there were a number of}} phases of occupation. The remains of the building were reburied after excavation, so nothing is now visible at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> Long House and Mug House.|$|E

5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} Pullman Square on July 16, 2004 with the <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> {{the parking lot}} for the parking structures. It opened on November 19, 2004 with Marquee Cinemas.

5|$|Construction {{of the new}} {{building}} began in February 1864 with <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> the basement. This was on the north section of Willamette’s campus in downtown Salem.

This ceremony included a time capsule and a speech by Governor A. C. Gibbs.|$|E

5|$|<b>Excavation</b> <b>of</b> {{the site}} began in 1971, {{and became the}} largest {{to be carried out}} by modern methods on any European monastic site. It {{revealed}} the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where the tiles were fired; a bell casting pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year {{at the behest of}} the city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick cistern and evidence of slave outbuildings, in addition to the foundations of the estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures. The <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of the delay in construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 during {{construction}} of the Durley Hill Cemetery, {{the remains of a}} grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, {{construction of the}} cemetery went ahead, and the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Starkey secured {{funding from}} Charles Marston and Henry Wellcome {{to start an}} {{expedition}} apart from the Petries, which Olga joined. The Wellcome-Marston expedition was {{to focus on the}} <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> the ancient city of Lachish, a stronghold mentioned in the Bible. Over the next six years, the team made some important finds, including the Lachish letters, but the work was interrupted by the murder of Starkey, while he was en route to the opening of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. The remaining team finished during the 1938/9 season, then closed the site. Olga wrote the final report.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 Phil Senter {{published}} {{a study on}} dromaeosaurid toes and showed that their range of motion was compatible with the <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> tough insect nests. Senter suggested that small dromaeosaurids such as Rahonavis and Buitreraptor were small enough to be partial insectivores, while larger genera such as Deinonychus and Neuquenraptor could have used this ability to catch vertebrate prey residing in insect nests. However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E
5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E
