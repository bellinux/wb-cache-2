5|$|On the upland farms of Wales, Welsh ponies and cobs {{would often}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> from {{ploughing}} a field to carrying a farmer to market or driving {{a family to}} services on Sunday. When coal mining became important to the economy of England, many Welsh ponies were harnessed for use in mines, above and below ground.|$|E
500|$|The OUN {{decided to}} attack Polish civilians, who {{constituted}} {{about a third}} of the population of the disputed territories. The OUN equated Ukrainian independence with ethnic homogeneity; the Polish presence had to be removed completely. By February 1943 the OUN began a deliberate campaign of murdering Polish civilians. OUN forces targeted Polish villages, prompting the formation of Polish self-defense units (e.g., the Przebraże Defence) and fights between the Home Army and the OUN. The Germans encouraged both sides against each other; Erich Koch said: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> possible so that a Pole, when meeting a Ukrainian, will be ready to kill him, and conversely, a Ukrainian will be ready to kill the Pole." [...] A German commissioner from Sarny, when local Poles complained about massacres, answered: [...] "You want Sikorski, the Ukrainians want Bandera. Fight each other." [...] In massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, beginning in the spring of 1943, between 60,000 and 100,000 Poles were killed.|$|E

[...] "I know you're innocent, but while you're in there, I can't protect you," [...] his father told him four days after his arrest in 2004. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> you can to make {{yourself}} stronger, faster, and smarter to survive." [...] He began exercising and lifting weights.|$|E

2500|$|According to Yuriy Kirichuk the Germans were {{actively}} prodding {{both sides of}} the conflict against each other. Erich Koch once said: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> possible so that a Pole meeting a Ukrainian, would be willing to kill him and conversely, a Ukrainian would be willing to kill a Pole". Kirichuk quotes a German commissioner from Sarny whose response to Polish complaints was: [...] "You want Sikorski, the Ukrainians want Bandera. Fight each other".|$|E

Earlier the Spanish Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences and said it shared the pain of families and loved ones of the 298 victims. Spain hopes an investigation can explain the circumstances of the accident as quickly as possible and we urged the parties involved to participate fully in the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Bernie Sanders opposes {{guest worker}} {{programs}} {{and is also}} skeptical about skilled immigrant (H-1B) visas, saying, [...] "Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies. These firms are responsible for shipping large numbers of American information technology jobs to India and other countries." [...] In an interview with Vox he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away {{with the concept of}} a nation-state. [...] What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> we can to create millions of jobs.|$|E
50|$|Women's {{communities}} were normally much smaller and poorer. The nuns <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> themselves, unless {{they had a}} couple of tenant-farmers to supply food, or pious who made donations. They spun and wove, kept their huts clean, milked their cows, and made their own meals, which could be meager.|$|R

2500|$|On 23 August 2011, the Polish Presidency of the European Union {{organised}} {{a conference}} {{on the occasion of}} the European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes. The EU presidency cited the Justice and Home Affairs Council conclusions of 10 June and the EU's Stockholm Programme, which emphasises that [...] "remembrance of [...] shared history is necessary to understand contemporary Europe." [...] European officials adopted the Warsaw Declaration for the European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes. The Warsaw Declaration vows that the suffering of victims of totalitarian regimes [...] "will not sink into oblivion." [...] The declaration states that [...] "crimes of totalitarian regimes in Europe should be acknowledged and condemned, regardless of their type and ideology." [...] Justice Minister Krzysztof Kwiatkowski said that the [...] "Warsaw Declaration is a unanimous agreement of all EU member states that we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> we can to prevent any totalitarian regime from reviving in all the countries making up one big European family."

Most NSE students appreciated {{the opportunity to participate}} in SSF and their prejudice against SE students was reduced. Before attending SSF, the participating NSE student assumed that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> for SE students, and some thought that discrimination was natural since they were inferior and had disabilities.|$|R
60|$|Albert Price knew no French and Philip <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything.</b> It {{seemed that}} it was an interminable process to get the poor body safely hidden away under ground: papers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be {{obtained}} in one place and signed in another; officials <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be seen. For three days Philip was occupied from morning till night. At last he and Albert Price followed the hearse to the cemetery at Montparnasse.|$|R

Dan was wild with delight when he heard that Vincent was now his master, {{and that he was}} to accompany him to the war. It had been known two days before that Vincent was going, and it seemed quite shocking to the negroes that the young master should go as a private soldier, and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> for himself--"just," [...] as they said, [...] "like de poor white trash"; for the slaves were proud to belong to an old family, and looked down with almost contempt upon the poorer class of whites, regarding their own position as infinitely superior.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} years, time was {{difficult}} for the band.

They rented out Caritas Hong Kong for a mini concert called [...] "Forever waiting concert" [...] and invited people. Not a single record company showed up, and the audience was indifferent to the band. Someone stepped in as their manager to help them raise HK$16,000, but the group was soon left with only HK$1000.|$|R

This is the reason why the boat noodle’s bowl is small, for the convenience and safety of the merchant.|$|R
