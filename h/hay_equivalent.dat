50|$|Baggage trains {{should be}} {{regarded}} with utmost care as they contain the ingredients to make a forward operating base function, including servants and children. Baggage trains should be kept away from areas of battle to avoid dispiriting soldier morale {{in the event of}} capture. Reserve horses should be kept with the baggage train at the onset of battle, their utility is not needed at the front line and will only add to the confusion in battle. The encampment area for the baggage train should be stationed in a defensible area with water and grass readily available at a distance of approximately 30 to 50 miles away from the location of the main battle and should be staffed with a force of two Banda; the encampment should forage for food and <b>hay</b> <b>equivalent</b> to four days of necessity. The defense force should select known and capable men to form a communication chain from the baggage train encampment to the front line. An intermediate encampment, closer to the front line, should be established between the battle area and the baggage train; the camp should be fortified and supplied with food for a day at the camp for each bandon. While in transit, the baggage train should be kept separate from the soldiers marching lines; when enemies are present, the baggage train should {{be in the middle of}} the caravan to avoid harassment by enemies.|$|E
5000|$|Itâ€™s a {{potential}} {{new source of}} income for the struggling agricultural industry. [...] This new furnace also has the potential to strengthen the agricultural community in Canada because farmers may soon be able to sell their hay for pellet production. Farmers currently make $30/ton of hay, however it is predicted that if demand for hay increases because it is needed for pellet production that the farmers could potentially make up to $100/ton, with the consumer being charge $200/ton of pellets. Presently, one tonne of <b>hay</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to around $700 worth of heating oil. It is predicted that a farm in Nova Scotia with 100 acres of hay could make up to $50,000 a year selling their hay for production of pellets that will be used in the furnace. An increase in demand for pellets made out of hay could also potentially increase jobs available in rural farming areas across Canada.|$|R
40|$|Winter {{nutrition}} {{requirements for}} beef cows grazing native tallgrass {{range in the}} Flint Hills were studied from 1968 through 1973. Three lb. milo was a better supplement to the basic ration of 3 lb. alfalfa hay than 1 1 / 2 lb. of soybean meal was. Younger cows performed better when 6 lb. milo was fed with the 3 lb. alfalfa hay. Feeding 3 lb. alfalfa <b>hay</b> or the <b>equivalent</b> until approximately 100 days before the breeding season and 3 lb. alfalfa hay, 6 lb. milo {{the remainder of the}} winter did not reduce performance of cows 3 years old or older. Cows that rebred lost less weight over winter and were heavier the next summer when they were bred than cows that did not rebreed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to study a method based on gas {{production}} technique to measure the biological effects of tannins on rumen fermentation. Six feeds were used as fermentation substrates in a semi-automated gas method: feed A - aroeira (Astronium urundeuva); feed B - jurema preta (Mimosa hostilis), feed C - sorghum grains (Sorghum bicolor); feed D - Tifton- 85 (Cynodon sp.); and two others prepared mixing 450 g sorghum leaves, 450 g concentrate (maize and soybean meal) and 100 g either of acacia (Acacia mearnsii) tannin extract (feed E) or quebracho (Schinopsis lorentzii) tannin extract (feed F) per kg (w:w). Three assays were carried out to standardize the bioassay for tannins. The first assay compared two binding agents (polyethylene glycol - PEG - and polyvinyl polypirrolidone - PVPP) to attenuate the tannin effects. The complex formed by PEG and tannins showed to be more stable than PVPP and tannins. Then, in the second assay, PEG was used as binding agent, and this assay was done to evaluate levels of PEG (0, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 mg/g DM) to minimize the tannin effect. All the tested levels of PEG produced a response to evaluate tannin effects but the best response was for dose of 1000 mg/g DM. Using this dose of PEG, the final assay was carried out to test three compounds (tannic acid, quebracho extract and acacia extract) to establish a curve of biological equivalent effect of tannins. For this, five levels of each compound were added to I g of a standard feed (Lucerne <b>hay).</b> The <b>equivalent</b> effect showed not to be directly related to the chemical analysis for tannins. It was shown that different sources of tannins had different activities or reactivities. The curves of biological equivalence can provide information about tannin reactivity and its use seems to be important as an additional factor for chemical analysis. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
