40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel image-guided robotbased system to assist orthopedic surgeons in performing distal locking of long bone intramedullary nails. The system {{consists of a}} bone-mounted miniature robot fitted with a drill guide that provides rigid mechanical guidance for hand-held drilling of the distal screws ’ pilot holes. The robot is automatically positioned so that the drill guide and nail distal locking axes coincide, using a single fluoroscopic X-ray image. Since the robot is rigidly attached to the intramedullary nail or bone, no leg immobilization or real-time tracking is required. We describe the system and protocol and present a method for accurate and robust drill guide and nail hole localization and registration. The in vitro system accuracy experiments for fronto-parallel viewing show a mean angular error of 1. 3 @�� � a H R A between the computed drill guide axes and the actual locking holes axes, and a mean 3. 0 mm error @�� � a I I mmA in the entry and <b>exit</b> <b>drill</b> point, which is adequate for successfully locking the nail.

40|$|In the past, several {{experimental}} and analytical {{studies have been}} conducted aimed towards predicting the critical thrust force responsible for delamination at the hole <b>exit</b> during <b>drilling.</b> Among these analytical models, few take into account the coupling between bending and stretching often observed in multi-directional (MD) laminates with an un-symmetrical stacking sequence considering the presence of an elliptical crack. In addition, in these analytical models, the tool/composite contact region is modeled without taking into account the chisel edge effect. In the present study, a unique analytical model for critical thrust force prediction has been proposed that explicitly accounts for the effect of the chisel and cutting edges. The interaction zone (composite/chisel edge and composite/principal cutting edge) has been modeled using classical lamination plate theory (CLPT) and linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) principles. In addition, a comparison between the proposed analytical model predictions and experimental results from quasi-static punch tests accompanied with different X-ray tomography observations led to choosing the accurate loading profile developed during drilling.

The conventional delamination factor (aF) is not appropriated to characterize the damage area because the shape of the delamination after drilled CFRP is not a regular representation of the damage magnitude.

Hitherto, the focus has been put either on burr removal subsequent to the actual machining operation or on avoidance of burr formation during the process.

40|$|Drilling plays a very {{influential}} role in machining since more than 40 % of material removal operations {{are associated with}} this type of action.

40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of numerous competing technologies, drilling {{is the most common}} and still highly demanded manufacturing process in production industries. Mostly, the manufacturing of a through bore-hole is attended by the formation of an entrance and an exit burr. Thereby, the dimension of the exit burr exceeds the entrance burr considerably. Due to the hangover on the <b>drill</b> <b>exit</b> surface, the quality of the workpiece is reduced significantly. For this reason, the removal of the burr is often required. But in case of micro-drilling no appropriate tools are available. In addition, the manual removal of the burr, which is often used for conventional drill sizes, is impossible for such small geometries. An efficient method for solving the burr problem in conventional machining is the reduction of the burr size to a tolerable size level by adapting cutting parameters, tool properties or workpiece properties. Numerous investigations have been presented on this field in the last years, but the reached expertise can't be transferred to micro-machining. Based on the rising influence of the grain structure in micro-machining, certain size effects occur when scaling the cutting process from the macroscopic to the micro level. As soon as the drill diameter is smaller than 1000 µm the feed per tooth and the cutting tool geometry comes into the order of magnitude of the grain structure. Thus, the characteristic of the workpiece material switches from homogeneous to anisotropic. Since there only exist investigations to a few discrete diameter ranges, the resulting influences on the burr formation are widely unknown. In this paper the size effects of the drilling burr formation are investigated in systematic scaled drilling series over a wide range of drilling diameters (Ø 0. 01 mm - 14 mm) ...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) and {{titanium}} (Ti) alloys {{have been}} widely employed in the aerospace industry due to their high strength to weight ratios. For making a military aircraft body, these materials are usually stacked together with titanium alloys serving as the airframe, while CFC is the outer skin. Drilling is often performed in one shot from the CFC outer skin through to the titanium alloy airframe {{for the purpose of}} assembling them by mechanical means using rivets, screws, nuts and bolts. Conventional drilling of these CFC/Ti stacks, however, often results in two major issues; rapid tool failure and poor hole quality. This paper considers the potential of employing Ultrasonic Assisted Drilling (UAD) on stack materials in order to improve tool life and hole quality. Experiments comparing conventional drilling and UAD on CFC/Ti 6 Al 4 V stack using reground 6. 121 mm-diameter TiAlN coated tungsten carbide twist drills are presented. Reground drills were used by way of replicating typical current practice in industry. A constant cutting speed and feed rate of 50 m/min and 0. 05 mm/rev, respectively was used in both experiments. During UAD experiments, ultrasonic amplitude and frequency was fixed at 2. 6 µm and 42. 7 kHz, respectively. A total of 100 holes were drilled in the stacks during each drilling processes (conventional drilling and UAD). Machinability was assessed in terms of thrust forces, tool wear, hole diameter, CFC delamination and titanium burr. Thrust forces were measured using a dynamometer; tool wear was examined using an optical microscope and a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM); and holes diameter were measured using a bore micrometer. Hole defects; CFC entry delamination was examined and quantified using an optical microscope, while titanium exit burr were investigated using both an optical microscope and a depth gauge. The dominant types of tool wear during drilling of CFC/Ti 6 Al 4 V stacks were caused by titanium adhesion/fusion on the cutting edges. In addition, abrasive wear caused by abrading carbon fibres against cutting edges were also observed. Poor hole quality of the stacks included inconsistent diameter of CFC and titanium holes; CFC delamination at the hole entrance and burr formation as the <b>drill</b> <b>exited</b> the titanium. The difference in thrust forces produced by conventional drilling and UAD were minor. It was observed that UAD resulted in less tool wear rate and a reduction of adhered titanium alloy on the cutting edges, more consistent hole diameters and less titanium burr compared to conventional drilling. However, larger CFC delamination was observed during UAD than conventional drilling...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} {{presented by}} IRIS {{was to develop}} a better understanding of agglomeration and transport of cuttings generated during the drilling of an oil well. There is a myriad of challenges involved in the mathematical modelling of this complex process. For this reason, two complementary approaches are combined in this report. First, we derive a one-dimensional fully-developed model based on the Phillips-type shear induced diffusive migration. We start by assuming a Newtonian nature of the suspending drilling mud, but an extension to account for a non-Newtonian rheology is proposed herein. Second, a direct numerical simulation approach is employed to predict settling rates of drilling cuts when the assumptions made in Part 1 break down and when complex geometries are taken into account. When drilling an oil well, rock cuttings are generated and must be transported to the surface for disposal. For this purpose, drilling fluid (or 'mud') is pumped down inside the <b>drill</b> pipe and <b>exits</b> at the <b>drill</b> bit. There, the drilling fluid combines with the rock cuttings whereupon both are transported through the annulus of the well back to the surface. The cuttings are then separated from the mud as required. This basic process is made complicated by a number of factors. First, the rheology of the drilling fluid is non- Newtonian. Although drilling fluid is normally oil-based or water-based, particles are added to give it a non-Newtonian (shear-thinning) rheology, so as to enhance the transport of the mixture of drilling fluid and cuttings to the surface. Secondly, an oilwell may have significant inclination ('directional wells'), meaning that the cuttings can 'settle' {{at the bottom of the}} annulus, forming a 'cuttings bed' potentially leading to clogging of the well. Finally, the drilling is a transient operation characterized by frequent start-ups and shutdowns: typically, the drilling is halted periodically to enable strands of drill pipe to be added as the well grows longer. Frequent shut-downs promote settling and therefore contribute to cuttings-bed formation. The fundamental problem addressed in this Report is to develop a physics-based understanding of the cuttings bed. From a practical aspect this is crucial, as poor control of cuttings may cause critical situations and a loss of the well. In this work, two complementary approaches are taken. In the first approach ("Theoretical Modelling", Part 1), a continuum theory is formulated on the basis that a mixture of drilling fluid and cuttings can be treated in a fluid-mechanical framework. Existing methods concerning dense suspensions can then be applied (and improved as necessary) to predict settling rates as a function of input parameters. For small cutting sizes, such an approach is justified. However, for larger cutting sizes (e. g. rock cuttings comparable to the size of the annular region of the flow domain), such a continuum theory will inevitably break down. To understand the transport processes in this limit, direct numerical simulation is proposed (Part 2). Sample simulations using the freely available OpenFoam fluid solver are presented and future work to improve and refine the computational model is discussed...|$|R
