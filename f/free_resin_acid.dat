40|$|The aims of {{the work}} this thesis is based upon were to develop {{convenient}} analytical procedures for determining <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> in biological and environmental matrices, and apply them to enhance understanding of the occurrence, exposure to and uptake by exposed individuals of <b>resin</b> <b>acids.</b> Particular {{focus has been on}} the workplace environment of the Swedish wood pellets industry. Sample extraction procedures and high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS) methodologies were developed for measuring <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> in dust, skin and urine samples. Chromatographic separation of abietic (AA) and pimaric acid was achieved by using a polar-embedded C 12 stationary phase. The HPLC/ESI-MS method avoids undesirable oxidation of AA, which was found to occur during the derivatisation step in the standard MDHS 83 / 2 gas chromatography/flame ionisation detection (GC/FID) methodology, leading to false observations of both AA and the oxidation product 7 -oxodehydroabietic acid (7 -OXO). Personal exposures to <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> in the Swedish wood pellet production industry were found to be lower, on average, than the British Occupational Exposure Limit for rosin (50 µg/m 3). The oxidised <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> 7 -OXO, was detected in both dust and skin samples indicating the presence of allergenic <b>resin</b> <b>acids.</b> A correlation between air and post-shift urinary concentrations of dehydroabietic acid (DHAA), and a trend towards an increase in urinary 7 -OXO during work shifts, were also observed. Whether the increase in 7 -OXO was due to direct uptake or metabolism of other <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> cannot be concluded from the results. An efficient HPLC/UV methodology with diode-array detection was developed for screening commercial products for rosin {{that could be used in}} laboratories lacking mass spectrometers. Very high concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> were detected in depilatory wax strips using the method.

40|$|A {{new high}} {{pressure}} liquid chromatographic method with evaporative light scattering detection {{was developed for}} the qualitative and quantitative analysis of apolar, low molecular weight constituents in wood. The wood extractives were obtained {{by means of a}} 6 h Soxhlet extraction with acetone. The extract was quantitatively analysed on an end-capped C 18 column eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile:water:acetic acid. The crude sample was directly injected following dissolution in acetonitrile:methanol:dichloromethane (60 : 8 : 40) and filtration through a 0. 45 ?m membrane filter.

40|$|The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources {{added to}} Food (ANS) {{delivers}} a scientific opinion re-evaluating {{the safety of}} candelilla wax (E 902). Candelilla wax (E 902) is authorised in the EU as a food additive as a glazing agent. It has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The JECFA and the SCF did not establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) but considered the use of candelilla wax as a glazing agent acceptable. Candelilla wax is obtained from leaves of candelilla plants Euphorbia antisyphilitica found in semi-desert regions. It is a complex mixture composed of wax hydrocarbons, wax, <b>resin</b> esters, lactones, <b>free</b> wax <b>resin</b> alcohols, and <b>free</b> wax <b>resin</b> <b>acids.</b> The Panel considered that absorption of candelilla wax {{is expected to be}} low, and that upon absorption the components would be incorporated into normal metabolic pathways. The Panel noted that there were limited data comparing the composition of the candelilla wax tested with the specification of the food additive. However the Panel considered that the materials tested were likely to be broadly similar in composition to the food additive. Overall, the Panel considered that the available data suggest that candelilla wax is not genotoxic. The Panel considered that long-term toxicity data on candelilla wax were lacking and therefore did not establish an ADI. However, the Panel noted that available toxicity studies consistently reported no findings associated with intake of the main components constituting candelilla wax. Furthermore, consideration of the exposure estimates to candelilla wax, using the Maximum Permitted Level (MPL) of carnauba wax, indicated sufficient margins of safety. This allowed the Panel to conclude that the use of candelilla wax as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1952 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the nature of the chemical constituents of incense cedar bark with the hope that such an endeavor would spur future research, development and use of a now neglected natural raw material. The bark from nine trees, which were separated into three age groups, was sampled from the bottom, middle and top sections. The age groups were 146 - 195 years, 261 - 285 years and 326 - 351 years. The nine samples were successively extracted with hexane, benzene, ethyl ether, hot water and 95 per cent ethanol to show the distribution and amounts of the extractives. The total extractive content varied between 13. 70 per cent for the bottom sample of the oldest age group and 30. 39 per cent for the top sample of the youngest age group. Similarly, the total extractive content of Port Orford cedar bark was found to range from 15. 49 per cent to 25. 69 per cent with the distribution corresponding closely to that of incense cedar. In both species, the greatest amount of extraneous material was removed with hot water and the variations between the total extractive content of the bottom and top samples were due primarily to the deviations in the amounts of this extract. The hexane extract was found to comprise 3. 53 per cent of the ovendry unextracted bark. The components of the hexane extract and the yields based on the oven-dry weight of the hexane solubles were: volatile oil, 0. 95 per cent; crystalline fatty ester, 5. 83 per cent; free acids, 46. 21 per cent; neutrals, 46. 67 per cent; and undetermined, 0. 34 per cent. Saponification of the crystalline fatty ester gave cerotic acid and an alcohol fraction equivalent to a mixture of behenyl and lignoceryl alcohols. The free acids were shown to contain 1. 93 per cent <b>resin</b> <b>acids,</b> 1. 11 per cent of a crystalline acid fraction equivalent to a mixture of behenic and lignoceric acids, and a fatty acid fraction, having a neutral equivalent of 435. 8 and a Hanus iodine number of 41. 2, which comprised 44. 28 per cent of the hexane solubles. The neutral fraction contained 25. 08 per cent combined acids, which had a neutral equivalent of 446. 6 and a Hanus iodine number of 80. 1, and 21. 59 per cent unsaponifiables from which a crystalline phytosterol was isolated in a yield of 1. 07 per cent of the hexane solubles. The yield of benzene soluble material was 2. 46 per cent of the ovendry unextracted bark. The major components of this extract were <b>resin</b> <b>acids,</b> present in both the free and combined forms. The yield of <b>free</b> <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> was 64. 4 per cent of the benzene extract; the fraction melted at 181 - 182 ° C., had a neutral equivalent of 347. 7 and was optically active. The combined <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> comprised 7. 8 per cent of the benzene solubles. They melted at 151 - 152 ° C., had a neutral equivalent of 358. 0 and were optically active. The remainder of the benzene extract was found to contain 8. 2 per cent free fatty acids, 10. 8 per cent combined fatty acids and 8. 2 per cent unsaponifiables. The tannin content of incense cedar bark ranged from 3. 5 to 7. 8 per cent, whereas that of Port Orford cedar varied between 4. 2 and 7. 0 per cent. These tannin yields are insufficient for economical commercial extraction. A crude carbohydrate material was obtained with hot water in a yield of approximately nine per cent of the oven-dry weight of unextracted bark. It contained 65. 9 per cent reducing sugars, 24. 0 per cent tannin and 10. 2 per cent insolubles. The composition of the reducing sugars based on the crude carbohydrate material was: pentosans, 13. 46 per cent; mannans, 3. 09 per cent; galactans, 21. 50 per cent; uronic anhydride, 1. 87 per cent; and glucosans, 25. 98 per cent. A composite sample of unextracted bark contained 14. 93 per cent alcohol-benzene solubles; 3. 04 per cent alcohol solubles, 7. 47 per cent hot-water solubles, 37. 06 per cent lignin, 36. 40 per cent holocellulose, 8. 51 per cent pentosans, 2. 69 per cent methoxyl, 0. 59 per cent acetyl, and 0. 97 per cent ash...|$|R

50|$|Oleoresin in pines {{is defined}} as pine gum, which is the nonaqueous {{secretion}} of <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> dissolved in a terpene hydrocarbon oil, which is produced in or exuded from the intercellular resin ducts of a living tree.

This was further investigated by spiking similar cultures with tetracycline, a protein synthesis inhibitor, at various times during the DHA disappearance curve. Cultures to which the antibiotic was added prior to the lag did not degrade DHA. Those that were spiked with the antibiotic after the lag phase (4 h) degraded DHA {{at the same rate}} as did controls with no added tetracycline.

Monoterpene and diterpene biosynthesis are coordinately induced in wounded stems as determined by monitoring the activity of monoterpene and diterpene cyclases, {{as well as two}} cytochrome P 450 -dependent diterpenoid hydroxylases involved in the formation of ([mdash]) -abietic <b>acid,</b> the principal <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> of this species. The activity of these enzymes reaches maximum levels that are 5 - to 100 -fold higher than those of nowwounded control stems 10 d after wounding and this is followed by a synchronous decline. The increase in biosynthetic activity is consequently followed by the accumulation of a viscous mass of <b>resin</b> <b>acids,</b> with the loss of the volatile monoterpenes, at the site of injury. The observed coordinate induction of monoterpene olefin and abietic acid bio-synthesis and the results of oleoresin analysis are consistent with the role of the volatile monoterpenes as a solvent for the mobilization and deposition of <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> at the wound site to seal the injury with a rosin barrier after the evaporation of the turpentine. The last step of <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis is catalyzed by an operationally soluble aldehyde dehydrogenase that is not inducible by wounding but seemingly is expressed constitutively at a high level. In vivo [14 C]acetate feeding and resin analysis indicate that this enzyme is not efficiently coupled to the earlier steps of the pathway...|$|R
40|$|Rosins {{are natural}} {{compounds}} derived from pine tree resin. They are used widely in industry in paints and varnishes, drug coatings and as flux in soldering. They compose of 90 % acidic and 10 % neutral components. Their compositions {{vary depending on}} their geographical source, and {{the part of the}} tree the rosin is sourced from. Determination of <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> using GC has been reported for the methyl esters of several <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> including pimaric-, sandaracopimaric-, isopimaric- and abietic acid. This required derivitisation of the analytes. HPLC has also been applied, however little separation has been achieved with only dehydroabietic acid being baseline resolved Therefore a more desirable approach analytically is a simple, fast and efficient separation using CE. This paper looks at the steps involved {{in the development of a}} CE method for separating and quantifying the <b>resin</b> <b>acids.</b> A mixture of nine of the most common <b>resin</b> <b>acids,</b> pimaric-, sandaracopimaric-, isopimaric-, dehydroabietic-, levopimaric-, neoabietic-, 7 -oxodehydroabietic-, palustric- and abietic acid found in rosin was separated. Due to the structural similarities of some of the analytes it was necessary to investigate CD-modified CE to improve separation. It was found that combination of a β and a γ (see figure 1) cyclodextrin in a pH 8 tris buffer provided sufficient interaction and mobility for the acids to separate based on their hydrophobicities, which had not previously been achieved. This separation method was applied to natural rosin samples in order to identify and determine the <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> concentration present in the samples...|$|R
40|$|The novel {{application}} of combination, or two stage, photochemical and microbial degradation systems for removal of <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> from natural river water and single stage photolysis for degradation of naphthenic acids in natural river water was investigated. The organic compounds {{included in this}} project comprise naphthenic acid model compounds and mixtures as well as four <b>resin</b> <b>acids.</b> Naphthenic acids are crude oil-derived and accumulate to significant concentrations (> 100 mg/L) in tailings pond water at oil sands extraction facilities. <b>Resin</b> <b>acids</b> are pulp and paper mill-derived compounds that tend to persist at low levels in receiving waters. For each compound group, analytical methods utilizing liquid chromatography negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS) were developed. The main hurdle to developing analytical methods for the naphthenic <b>acids</b> and <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> are related to their polarity, complexity, and lack of available standards for the various individual components. As well, co-extractives, such as humic and fulvic acids, tend {{to interfere with the}} detection of naphthenic acids in aquatic samples (Headley et al., 2002 a). <b>Resin</b> <b>acid</b> mixtures are not as complex as the naphthenic acids, although each group of hydrocarbon acids may include several isomeric compounds. The {{application of}} photochemical degradation prior to biodegradation was proven to be effective here for rapid degradation of the <b>resin</b> <b>acids.</b> In general, the <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> precursors were more susceptible to the photolysis than were the naphthenic acids. Through thermal maturation and increased complexity, the naphthenic acids seemingly become more resistant to degradation, as evidenced by their commercial use as anti-microbial agents and the observed resistance to photolysis noted in this research. The results of this research may be significant for the design of staged treatment for reduced microbial shock loading and increased bioavailability (defined here as the ability of microbial organisms to degrade the target contaminants) in both bioremediation systems and receiving waters. Specifically, four selected pulp and paper mill-associated <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> were exposed to several ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) spectrum radiation sources in water collected from the River Saale in Germany. Background <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations were observed in water collected in 2001 and 2002 from various locations along the well-forested River Saale and a manuscript detailing these results published. Analyses of water samples collected in the pulp and paper milling region of the river (in the state of Thuringia) indicated that <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> persist through biodegradation treatment systems and for several hundred kilometres downstream. All four <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> were degraded by facile photochemical and microbial degradation with pseudo-first-order kinetics. Half-life values were in the ranges of 18 to 200 minutes for photolysis applications, 8 to 40 hours for biodegradation applications and 3 to 25 hours for two-stage photochemical-microbial degradation processes, in which photolysis was limited to three hours. From these results, it was shown conclusively that photolysis pre-treatment is a viable and efficient method for reducing both <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations and the associated acute toxicity. The naphthenic acids investigated in this study were not effectively degraded via UV/vis radiation, including UV-A/UV-B radiation between 300 - 400 nm, near-monochromatic UV 254 -radiation, full spectrum artificial solar radiation and natural sunlight. The photochemical degradation potential of three model naphthenic acid compounds and three naphthenic acid mixtures (one extract from the Athabasca Oil Sands and two commercial mixtures) were examined in Athabasca River water. Photolysis at UV 254 was the most successful degradation source in all instances, although most naphthenic acids were not significantly degraded by any of the radiation sources. Therefore, it was determined that photolysis is not likely to contribute significantly to environmental degradation and attenuation in the aquatic ecosystem. The results observed from the various naphthenic acids photodegradation processes, coupled with their low affinity for adsorption to soils, reveal that naphthenic acids are likely to persist in the water column. However, UV/vis radiation is capable of significantly changing the composition of mixtures in the aquatic ecosystem, but not reducing overall naphthenic acid concentrations. This may not be a beneficial as there is the potential for increased toxicity toward the lower molecular weight naphthenic acids...|$|R

40|$|The {{nonvolatile}} {{fraction of}} the oleoresin of Pinus sihestris L. was found to contain substances which inhibit growth of wheat ceoleoptile and oat mesocotyl sections in standard bioassays. The inhibition is mainly confined to the fraction of <b>resin</b> <b>acids.</b> Among the seven authentic <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> tested, the effects of dehydroabietic and abietic acids were most sifgnificant. Palustric, pimaric and isopimaric acids were not effective in the wheat coleoptile section straight growth test. None of the substances, in the amounts tested, except for extremely high concentration, exerted an inhibitory effect on natural or IAA-induced elongation of pine hypocotyl sections. Neither was an inhibitory effect discovered in the microbiological test with the Aspergillus niger van Tiegh. The results obtained with pine hypocotyl sections, allow the conclusion that <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> interfering {{with the results of}} standard bioassays are probably not effective as inhibitory factors in the regulation of pine tissue growth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{content and}} {{distribution}} of stilbenes and <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and spruce (Picea abies), sampled in central Norway, have been examined. The contents of pinosylvin stilbenes in pine heartwood/living knots were 0. 2 - 2 / 2 - 8 % (w/w). No stilbenes could be detected in spruce (Picea abies). The <b>resin</b> <b>acid</b> contents of pine sapwood/heartwood and knots were 1 - 4 and 5 - 10 % (w/w), respectively. Minor amounts of <b>resin</b> <b>acids</b> (< 0. 2 /< 0. 04 %w/w) were identified in spruce wood/knots. The lignan content in knots of Norwegian spruce was 6. 5 % (w/w). Diastereomerically pure hydroxymatairesinol (HMR, 84 % of total lignans) was readily isolated from this source since only minor quantities (2. 6 % of total lignans) of the allo-HMR diastereomer was detected. Insignificant amounts of lignans {{were present in the}} sapwood. Lignans could not be detected in the sapwood or knots of Norwegian sallow (Salix caprea), birch (Betula pendula) or juniper (Juniperus communis) ...|$|R
