5000|$|Atlantis headed {{past the}} North Sea minefields, between Norway and Britain, across the Arctic Circle, between Iceland and Greenland, and headed south. By this time, Atlantis was {{pretending to be}} a Soviet vessel named Kim by flying the Soviet naval <b>ensign,</b> <b>displaying</b> a hammer and sickle on the bridge, and having Russian and English {{warnings}} on the stern, [...] "Keep clear of propellers". The Soviet Union was neutral at the time.|$|R

50|$|All {{naval vessels}} {{belonging}} to the United States fly the Ensign of the United States, which {{is identical to the}} flag of the United States (though originally was a design similar to the Grand Union Flag). All documented U.S. vessels, and all U.S. vessels in international or foreign waters, are required to <b>display</b> this <b>ensign</b> between 08:00 and sunset. Conversely, vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard <b>display</b> a unique <b>ensign</b> as a demonstration of its authority to stop, board, search, and conduct arrests and seizures aboard vessels subject to United States jurisdiction. Historically, the <b>ensign</b> <b>displayed</b> has changed as the flag of the United States has changed. Similarly, vessels of the Continental Navy flew many varied ensigns due to a vague standard set by the Continental Congress, the arrangement of stars and pattern of stripes being left to the commander's interpretations.|$|R
50|$|Although the 1921 Order in Council {{gave the}} RAF the {{authority}} to <b>display</b> the <b>Ensign</b> as they saw fit, the Admiralty maintained that the Order did not supersede the regulations of the Merchant Shipping Act.

After the incident, air force vessels continued to <b>display</b> the RAF <b>Ensign.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 3 May, Atlantis met a British cargo ship, Scientist, {{which was}} {{carrying}} ore and jute. The Germans raised their battle <b>ensign</b> and <b>displayed</b> signal pennants stating, [...] "Stop or I fire! Don't use your radio!" [...] The 75 mm gun fired a warning shot. The British immediately began transmitting their alarm signal, [...] "QQQQ...QQQQ...Unidentified merchantman has {{ordered me to}} stop", and the Germans began transmitting so as to jam the signals.|$|R

50|$|The United States Navy {{maintains}} several church pennants, {{of which}} the appropriate one is flown immediately above the ensign wherever the <b>ensign</b> is <b>displayed,</b> at the gaff when under way, or at the flagstaff when not under way, when religious services are held aboard ship by a Navy chaplain. Originally, the only authorized church pennant was for Christian chaplains, regardless of specific denomination. Later in 1975, the Secretary of Navy approved a similar Jewish worship pennant.|$|R
500|$|Throughout Puerto Rico's {{political}} history various parties have designed and displayed flags representing their ideals. Political flags in Puerto Rico are usually displayed in public during rallies, meetings, or parades in show of political strength and unity. The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party flag has a white Calatrava Cross, {{also known as}} the Cross potent on the middle of a black background. The Cross of Calatrava was first used by the Crusaders of Calatrava and later by the French revolutionists. The black background symbolized the mourning of the Puerto Rican Nation in colonial captivity. It was usually displayed by the Cadets of the Republic, {{also known as the}} Black Shirts (Camisa Negras) because of their black shirt and white trousers uniform. On occasions the Nationalists would also carry the Puerto Rican flag with the light blue triangle, which was outlawed from 1898 to 1952. The three main political parties of Puerto Rico are the New Progressive Party, which favors statehood and whose flag has a blue palm tree in the middle with a white background; the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico, flag has a red image of what is supposed to resemble a Puerto Rican j√≠baro (farmer) in the middle with a white background; and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, whose flag has a white cross symbolizing Christianity and purity, on a green background which symbolizes hope. Founded in 2003, the flag of the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party has a light brown colored [...] "coqui" [...] as its symbol with the words [...] "Por Puerto Rico" [...] (For Puerto Rico) in the middle. Another political flag is that of the Boricua Popular Army, also known as Los Macheteros an underground pro-independence group which believes and has often resorted to the use of violence. This <b>ensign</b> <b>displays</b> a green machete and a red star imposed on a black background.|$|R
5000|$|Two [...] "Star and Bars" [...] battle ensigns, {{labelled}} as having belonged to Alabama, also still exist. The {{first is a}} mounted and framed, 14-star ensign located at the Mariner's Museum in Virginia. (A small number of these unusual 14-star national flags have survived to the modern era and are held in several Civil War archives.) From the several color photo available on the Internet, this ensign appears to have an approximate hoist-to-fly aspect ratio of 1:2.5 (i.e., very rectangular). A second [...] "Stars and Bars" [...] battle <b>ensign</b> is on <b>display</b> at the Pensacola Historical Museum. Its canton contains a circle of 12 stars surrounding a centered, larger 13th star. While their provenance and specific details of these two Alabama ensigns are currently unavailable, such information {{will be added to}} this section when available.|$|R
60|$|Having, on the {{previous}} evening, arranged matters with the landing-master as {{to the business of}} the day, the signal was rung for all hands at half-past seven this morning. In the early state of the spring-tides the artificers went to the rock before breakfast, but as the tides fell later in the day, it became necessary to take this meal before leaving the ship. At eight o'clock all hands were assembled on the quarter-deck for prayers, a solemnity which was gone through in as orderly a manner as circumstances would admit. When the weather permitted, the flags of the ship were hung up as an awning or screen, forming the quarter-deck into a distinct compartment; the pendant was also hoisted at the mainmast, and a large <b>ensign</b> flag was <b>displayed</b> over the stern; and lastly, the ship's companion, or top of the staircase, was covered with the flag proper of the Lighthouse Service, on which the Bible was laid. A particular toll of the bell called all hands to the quarter-deck, when the writer read a chapter of the Bible, and, the whole ship's company being uncovered, he also read the impressive prayer composed by the Reverend Dr. Brunton, one of the ministers of Edinburgh.|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} the custom to laud the conduct and address of King Ferdinand in this most arduous and {{protracted}} war, but the sage Agapida is more disposed to give credit to the counsels and measures of the queen, who, he observes, though less ostensible in action, was in truth the very soul, the vital principle, of this great enterprise. While King Ferdinand was bustling in his camp and making a glittering display with his gallant chivalry, she, surrounded by her saintly counsellors in the episcopal palace of Jaen, was devising ways and means to keep the king and his army in existence. She had pledged herself to keep up a supply of men and money and provisions until the city should be taken. The hardships of the siege caused a fearful waste of life, but the supply of men was the least difficult part of her undertaking. So beloved was the queen by the chivalry of Spain that on her calling on them for assistance not a grandee or cavalier that yet lingered at home but either repaired in person or sent forces to the camp; the ancient and warlike families vied {{with each other in}} marshalling forth their vassals, and thus the besieged Moors beheld each day fresh troops arriving before their city, and new <b>ensigns</b> and pennons <b>displayed</b> emblazoned with arms well known to the veteran warriors.|$|R
500|$|In 1813 the United States was at {{war with}} Great Britain, and Baltimore was {{preparing}} for an eventual attack as the fleet of the British Royal Navy had complete maritime control of the Chesapeake Bay. [...] Major George Armistead, the U.S. Army commander of the Infantry and Artillery units that defended Fort McHenry in Baltimore, felt that the fort was prepared for an attack, except it lacked a flag. [...] In {{a letter to the}} head of the Maryland Militia and military commander for Baltimore, Major General Samuel Smith, he wrote, [...] "We, sir, are ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore against invading by the enemy. [...] That is to say, we are ready except that we have no suitable <b>ensign</b> to <b>display</b> over the Star Fort and it is my desire to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance." [...] A delegation consisting of Armistead, Smith, Brig. General John Stricker, and Commodore Joshua Barney, Pickersgill's brother-in-law, visited with Pickersgill, and discussed the particulars of the desired flag. [...] They commissioned Pickersgill to make two flags, [...] "one American ensign, 30 X 42 feet, first quality bunting" [...] and another flag 17 by 25 feet." [...] A task as large as the making of these flags was beyond the capability of one person to complete, and Pickersgill not only drew on members of her own household for help, but also contracted labor from the immediate neighborhood. In early summer 1813, she began the job with the assistance of her daughter, Caroline, her two nieces, Eliza Young and Margaret Young, a free African American apprentice, Grace Wisher, and likely her elderly mother, Rebecca Young. [...] An additional unnamed African American who boarded in the house is also listed as helping in some sources, as were additional local seamstresses who were hired during the summer. Often working late into the evening, until midnight at times, Pickersgill's team was able to complete the job in six weeks. [...] Pickersgill's daughter, in an 1876 letter to Georgiana Armistead Appleton, the daughter of Major Armistead (later breveted a lieutenant colonel), wrote these particulars about the flag: ...|$|R
5000|$|Royal Navy {{ships and}} {{submarines}} wear the White Ensign {{at all times}} when underway on the surface. The White Ensign may also be worn on a gaff, and may be shifted to the starboard yardarm when at sea. When alongside, the White Ensign is worn at the stern, with the Union Flag flown as a jack at the bow, during daylight hours. The White Ensign is worn at the mastheads when Royal Navy ships are dressed on special occasions such as the Queen's birthday, and may be similarly be worn by foreign warships in British waters when dressed in honour of a British holiday or when firing a salute to British authorities. The White Ensign may also be worn by the boats of commissioned ships. Yachts of the Royal Yacht Squadron and the Trinity House vessels when escorting the Sovereign are also permitted to wear the White Ensign. On land, the White Ensign is flown at all naval shore establishments (which are commissioned warships), including all Royal Marines establishments. Permission has been granted to some other buildings with naval connections to fly the White Ensign. This includes the St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, London, which is the parish church of the Admiralty. The <b>Ensign</b> is also <b>displayed</b> on the Cenotaph alongside the Union Flag (for the British Army) and the Royal Air Force Ensign. Special permission was granted to any individual or body to fly the White Ensign to mark Trafalgar Day in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|British Emperors SOS signals {{were picked}} up {{as far away as}} Germany. They were also picked up aboard the British cruiser [...] 500 nmi km to the south of Pinguin. Cornwall altered course to the north on the {{assumption}} that Pinguin would probably be heading south as it indeed was. On 8 May Pinguin spotted the silhouette of a British warship on the horizon. Pinguin immediately altered course away from it at maximum speed in a south-westerly direction. Cornwalls Supermarine Walrus aircraft searching the surrounding seas spotted the disguised Pinguin but was anxious not to attack an innocent ship. The Walrus returned four hours later and circled Pinguin. The aircrew saw {{what appeared to be a}} typical Norwegian freighter. Pinguin was flying the Norwegian <b>ensign</b> and <b>displayed</b> the name Tamerlane on both sides of her bridge. Cornwall was just 65 nmi km away from Pinguin. Pinguins crew were wearing typical merchant marine clothing. The Walrus returned again an hour and a half later requesting the ship's identity, cargo and port of destination. The silhouette outline of Tamerlane shown in Talbot-Booth's Merchant Ships matched what the Walrus's observer had seen. Tamerlane was not among the names on the list of merchant ships known to be in the area at that time. The Walrus aircrew had suspicions. Cornwall at full speed headed south-west and launched seaplanes on the way. Pinguins lookouts sighted Cornwall rapidly approaching. Pinguins crew were called to action stations. Pinguins guns remained concealed as she was still depending on her disguise as long as she could. Pinguin sent raider reports identifying herself as the Norwegian Tamerlane and claiming that she was being attacked by a German warship. Cornwalls wireless operator reported that the signals were being sent on a British Merchant Navy transmitter. Cornwall radioed to the circling Walrus to inform the 'Norwegians' that the ship bearing down on them was British and to order them to heave to. Pinguin adopted the classic defensive response of presenting her stern. Cornwall closed to within 20000 m of Pinguin and signalled to her three times by lamp ordering her to [...] "Heave to, or I fire!". A warning shot was fired from one of Cornwalls 8-inch guns high and to the left of Pinguin. The warning signals were repeated and another warning shot was fired. Cornwalls second Walrus was prepared for launching armed with two 250-pound bombs. It was ordered to drop the first bomb in front of the fleeing Pinguin and if that failed to halt her the second bomb was to be dropped on her forecastle. Cornwall closed to 12000 m of Pinguin.|$|R
