50|$|A {{stone picker}} has digging teeth, a {{conveyor}} system, a sieve or screen, and a stone bin. The digging teeth {{are at the}} leading edge of the stone picker and removes soil, which is placed on the conveyor system. If the sieve is not combined with the conveyor system, the conveyor system transports the stones and large rocks to a bin or hopper for periodic dumping. Some stone pickers use a large tractor, generally over 100 horsepower, equipped with hydraulics and power take-off driven mechanisms. PTO pump <b>driven</b> <b>equipment</b> can use 60 horsepower tractors. The tractor's hydraulics control the depth to which the stone picker digs to excavate soil material; whereas, the PTO controls the movement of the conveyor and picking system.|$|E

Control and feedback circuitry is used to adjust the final output of the inverter section which will ultimately determine the speed of the motor operating under its mechanical load. Motor speed control needs are numerous and include things like: industrial motor <b>driven</b> <b>equipment,</b> electric vehicles, rail transport systems, and power tools.(See related: variable-frequency drive [...] )Switching states are developed for positive, negative and zero voltages as per the patterns given in the switching Table 1.The generated gate pulses are given to each switch in accordance with the developed pattern and thus the output is obtained.|$|E
50|$|When {{a driver}} like an {{electric}} motor or a turbine is coupled to a pump, generator, or any other piece of equipment, {{it is essential that}} the shafts of the two pieces are aligned. Any misalignment between the two increases the stress on the shafts and will almost certainly result in excessive wear and premature breakdown of the equipment. This can be very costly. When the equipment is down, production might be down. Also bearings or mechanical seals may be damaged and need to be replaced. Flexible couplings are designed to allow a driver (electric motor, engine, turbine, hydraulic motor) to be connected to the <b>driven</b> <b>equipment.</b> Flexible couplings use an elastomeric insert to allow a slight degree of misalignment. Flexible couplings can also use shim packs. These couplings are called disc couplings. Tools used to achieve alignment may be mechanical or optical, like the Laser shaft alignment method, or they are gyroscope based. The gyroscope based systems can be operated very time efficient and can also be even used if the shafts have a large distance (e.g. on marine vessels).|$|E
50|$|Model-based voltage {{and current}} systems (MBVI systems): This is a {{technique}} that makes use of the information available from the current and voltage signalsacross all three phases simultaneously. Model-based systems are able to identify many of the samephenomena also seen by more conventional techniques, covering electrical, mechanical, and operationalareas.Model-based systems work on the lines shown in Figure 6 below and measure both current and voltagewhile the motor is in operation and then automatically creates a mathematical model of the relationshipbetween current and voltage. By applying this model to the measured voltage, a modelled current iscalculated and this is compared with the actual measured current. Deviations between the measuredcurrent and the modelled current represent imperfections in the motor and <b>driven</b> <b>equipment</b> system,which can be analysed {{using a combination of}} Park’s vector to simplify the three-phase currents intotwo orthogonal phases (D&Q), Fourier analysis to give a power spectral density plot, and algorithmicassessment of the resulting spectrum to identify specific faults or failure modes.These systems are designed for permanent installation as a condition monitoring solution rather thanas a short-term diagnostic measurement device, and their outputs can be integrated into normal plantsystems. Being permanently connected, historic trends are automatically captured.|$|E
