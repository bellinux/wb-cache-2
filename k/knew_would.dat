5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E

5|$|Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, James's {{favourite}} {{and a man}} who {{had great}} influence over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. In the end, however, the trip was an embarrassing failure. The Infanta thought Charles was little more than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the penal laws, which Charles <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Count of Olivares, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When Charles returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's first public stock offering in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> be unfavorable to the studio. As {{a result of the}} strikeand the financial state of the companyseveral animators left the studio, and Disney's relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result. The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, Dumbo (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.|$|E

25|$|For {{the idea}} to succeed, Pitt knew that he needed large scale public support in Ireland for the idea from both Protestants and Catholics, and as such Catholic Emancipation {{would need to be}} {{delivered}} along with the union. Catholic Emancipation alone he <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> be enough to secure the stability of Ireland. The Catholic middle classes and the Catholic hierarchy, led by John Thomas Troy, the Archbishop of Dublin, were willing to support the union if Catholic Emancipation did indeed follow. Only a group of Catholic barristers, most notably Daniel O'Connell, opposed the idea of union.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the pretext}} of {{negotiating}} uitlander rights, Britain sought to gain control over the gold and diamond mining industries, and demanded a franchising policy, which they <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> be unacceptable to the Boers. When the negotiations failed {{to come to an}} acceptable outcome, British foreign secretary Joseph Chamberlain issued an ultimatum to the South African Republic. Realising that war was inevitable, President Paul Kruger gave Britain a 48-hour deadline to withdraw its troops from their borders. When Britain failed to comply, the South African Republic, along with their allies, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State declared war on Britain and set about launching pre-emptive strikes into British held territory.|$|E

25|$|In 2001 Japanese {{researcher}} Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama {{surmised that}} the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for Le Petit Prince deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created {{to celebrate the}} author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> next reoccur in the year 2000. Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force).|$|E
25|$|However, {{low income}} {{residents}} still {{make up a}} large proportion of the population (28.3% in 2001). The Mustard Seed Calgary is located in the Beltline at 102 11 Ave SE. There are also many poorly maintained and dilapidated buildings with low rents. A large portion of Victoria Park, in particular, is in poor condition due to the city's decision to restrict development on lands needed for Calgary Stampede expansion Owners of this land were generally not interested in improving buildings they <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> be removed soon. As a result, a number of seemingly abandoned buildings were occupied illegally by squatters. As the city has finalized land purchases and made final decisions on land use, this has decreased dramatically.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{examples}} cited in Johnston's book is that of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first major oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in Pittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland. Why? Because rail companies would be transporting his refined oil to market. Pittsburgh had just one major railroad, meaning it could dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads that Rockefeller <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. The leverage gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to Cleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller's empire, while undermining his competitors who failed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.|$|E

25|$|Fuheng {{arrived in}} Yunnan in April, 1769 to take command of a 60,000-strong force. He studied past Ming and Mongol expeditions to form his battle plan, {{which called for}} a three-pronged {{invasion}} via Bhamo and the Irrawaddy river. The first army would attack Bhamo and Kaungton head-on, which he <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> be difficult. But two other larger armies would bypass Kaungton and march down the Irrawaddy, one on each bank of the river, to Ava. The twin invading armies {{on each side of}} the river would be accompanied by war boats manned by thousands of sailors from the Fujian Navy. To avoid a repeat of Ming Rui's mistake, he was determined to guard his supply and communication lines, and advance at a sustainable pace. He avoided an invasion route through the jungles of the Shan Hills so as to minimize the Burmese guerrilla attacks on his supply lines. He also brought in a full regiment of carpenters who would build fortresses and boats along the invasion route.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August, Chikatilo {{killed a}} 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in Aviators' Park. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, {{to the banks}} of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a {{shortcut}} to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> not be immediately fatal. Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth. Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl. Within two weeks an 11-year-old boy had been found strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, in Rostov before a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, was killed in Aviators' Park on 6 September.|$|E
25|$|Edge's {{second term}} as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} numerous battles with Hague. In 1944, Edge and Hague fought over how certain railroad tax money should be allocated (with Hague’s position ultimately prevailing), while Edge won the passage of legislation that required the use of voting machines in Hudson County to reduce the chance of electoral fraud. Edge also obtained legislation authorizing the governor to appoint jury commissioners for each county, bypassing county sheriffs, who had previously hand-picked grand jurors who they <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> refuse to indict those engaged in illegal activities protected by political bosses like Hague. The most important battle between Edge and Hague involved constitutional revision. In early 1944, Republican legislators drafted a new proposed constitution that would have, among other things, deprived Hague of {{a major source of}} patronage by restructuring the judiciary. Hague strongly opposed the revised constitution, and several weeks prior to the November 1944 election he launched a multi-pronged attack on it, charging that it would restrict the activities of labor unions, inhibit advancement opportunities for returning veterans, and subject all church owned property to taxation. Voters rejected the proposed constitution.|$|E

25|$|Groove recordings, first {{designed}} in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they <b>knew</b> <b>would</b> sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining {{the availability of the}} format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.|$|E
