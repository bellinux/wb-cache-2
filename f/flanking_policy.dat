The aim is to evaluate both regulations and their <b>flanking</b> <b>policy.</b> For the evaluation, road users, road authorities and, on a small scale, representatives of various organizations were questioned. A part of the <b>flanking</b> <b>policy</b> was aimed at road users, another part at road authorities. After introduction of the RVV 1990 and the BABW, road authorities were aware of the principle, but not of the accurate contents of regulations and provisions. Following introduction of the new RVV and BABW, police, judicial bodies and road authorities had many questions. In the course of time, these questions were answered through joint consultation between various bodies. Some of the questions suggested a need to modify the RVV 1990 and BABW. In retrospect, most organizations judged the updated RVV quite favourable. On the whole, the regulations have become clearer and the distinction between the RVV and the BABW is now better defined. But almost all organisations believe that the new RVV should be adapted...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{law is a}} {{founding}} competence of the Scottish Parliament. It is also an area of extensive EU competence as a <b>flanking</b> <b>policy</b> of the single market {{and in response to}} developments in international law. Setting a Scottish specific approach to the repatriation of environmental competence from the EU will be a key area of policy development during and after the Brexit negotiations. As such it will be a key shaper of the overall approach Scotland takes to determining its post Brexit future. This blog looks at the key issues involved, including whether there will be opportunities to extend Scottish powers with regard to those held at UK level. It also looks at ways in which Scotland can keep in line with EU environmental policy and practice, for example if it decides to pursue constitutional change to allow a closer relationship with the EU than the UK seems ready to develop...|$|E

This paper investigates by means of a scenario analysis which conditions have to be fulfilled for a successful introduction in the city of Amsterdam. First, a short introduction to Amsterdam is given, followed by an outline of the potential of and the problems inherent in the introduction of electric cars. Next, four scenarios are constructed by means of the so-called Spider-model. This model has four major policy dimensions. It is visualized by a picture which consists of four quadrants and eight axes on which important future developments are sketched on a five point scale. The four quadrants represent policy concerns about the (inter) national <b>flanking</b> <b>policies,</b> local economic developments, local spatial policies and public transport policies, respectively. Four scenarios are next constructed: 'Prosperous Amsterdam', 'Sustainable Amsterdam', 'Pauperized Amsterdam' and 'Lonely Amsterdam'. These scenarios differ largely in economic developments and in the local and (inter) national focus on sustainability issues. Finally, the transport system and the potential role of the electric car in each scenario is investigated. It is concluded that <b>flanking</b> <b>policies</b> at both the (inter) national and local level as well as a positive economic development are a sine qua non for a successful introduction and adoption of the electric car. When these conditions are fulfilled, the electric car may decisively contribute to the achievement of a more environmental friendly urban transport-system. ...|$|R
40|$|Once the Doha Round is concluded, or officially dead, {{the time}} will be ripe for a long term {{reflection}} {{on the future of}} the world trading system. The world has changed dramatically since the GATT's creation in 1947. Yet, 60 years later, the WTO has not adapted itself to these changes. Although commentators tend to focus on internal changes and reforms, most importantly are the external, real world changes that took place in the last 60 years. These changes range from historically low tariffs, an increased financial integration between countries, more diversification in world trade shares and proliferation of preferential trade agreements, to the unbundling of the production chain, the prevalence of unilateral trade liberalization, the emergence of new <b>flanking</b> <b>policies</b> and, crucially, a shift in the forces opposing free trade. These external shocks and changes are already leading to, and require, a 'new trade politics', both within countries and at the international level., Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} the different channels through which trade openness (and reforms to achieve it) can affect a country?s food security. The overall {{conclusion is that}} trade openness has a positive net impact on food security, although specific constituencies, including some poor households, could see their immediate food security threatened by the withdrawal of trade protection. The challenge for policymakers is to design <b>flanking</b> <b>policies</b> which enable countries to reap aggregate gains yet mitigate specific losses. Those policies include social protection {{and the provision of}} risk management tools, allied with investments in productivity so that average incomes rise to the extent that any a dverse shock to incomes is unlikely to jeopardise food security. Developing countries are increasingly able to deploy such targeted instruments. Lessons are also being learned with respect to the political economy of trade reform, such that changes can be introduced in a way that minimises adjustment stresses and helps build the consensus needed to lock in the benefits of trade policy reform...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} to a low carbon transport world requires a host of demand and supply policies to be developed and deployed. Pricing and taxation of vehicle ownership plays a major role, as it affects purchasing behavior, overall ownership and use of vehicles. There is a lack in robust assessments {{of the life cycle}} energy and environmental effects of a number of key car pricing and taxation instruments, including graded purchase taxes, vehicle excise duties and vehicle scrappage incentives. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring which type of vehicle taxation accelerates fuel, technology and purchasing behavioral transitions the fastest with (i) most tailpipe and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions savings, (ii) potential revenue neutrality for the Treasury and (iii) no adverse effects on car ownership and use. The UK Transport Carbon Model was developed further and used to assess long term scenarios of low carbon fiscal policies and their effects on transport demand, vehicle stock evolution, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. The modeling results suggest that policy choice, design and timing can play crucial roles in meeting multiple policy goals. Both CO 2 grading and tightening of CO 2 limits over time are crucial in achieving the {{transition to}} low carbon mobility. Of the policy scenarios investigated here the more ambitious and complex car purchase tax and feebate policies are most effective in accelerating low carbon technology uptake, reducing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and, if designed carefully, can avoid overburdening consumers with ever more taxation whilst ensuring revenue neutrality. Highly graduated road taxes (or VED) can also be successful in reducing emissions; but while they can provide handy revenue streams to governments that could be recycled in accompanying low carbon measures they are likely to face opposition by the driving population and car lobby groups. Scrappage schemes are found to save little carbon and may even increase emissions on a life cycle basis. The main policy implication of this work is that in order to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from transport governments should focus on designing incentive schemes with strong up-front price signals that reward 'low carbon' and penalize 'high carbon'. Policy instruments should also be subject to early scrutiny of the longer term impacts on government revenue and pay attention to the need for <b>flanking</b> <b>policies</b> to boost these revenues and maintain the marginal cost of driving...|$|R
40|$|Municipalities are the constructors {{of local}} climate {{policies}} and the upholders of building law. But regarding the existing housing stock, they are lacking effective legal instruments to improve the energy efficiency of this stock, which is occupied by different homeowner categories. Regarding high-ambitious climate policies to reduce cities’ CO 2 emissions, the research question of this paper is, how Dutch municipal authorities can reach different homeowner categories with policy instruments to instigate investments in and to increase the existing housing stock’s energy efficiency. This question is answered by a literature and documentary study, and by in-depth interviews. Municipal authorities try {{to fill the gap}} of legal enforcement instruments of energy efficiency measures in the existing housing stock: (1) by taking public-private district regeneration as vehicle for energy transition experiments in the existing housing stock, (2) by drawing up energy covenants with housing associations, (3) by integrating energy conservation strategies into improvement strategies for the private housing stock, in which service organizations for homeowners’ associations are established for taking care of organizational, technical and financing aspects of energy efficient maintenance or renovation, and (4) by posing structural maintenance and professional management as prerequisites to financial services. This does not mean that local actions can replace an effective, <b>flanking</b> national <b>policy</b> to improve the energy performance of the existing housing stock, but that the Dutch law must follow these actions to support them.

40|$|This paper uses {{detailed}} {{longitudinal data}} from the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS) stretching from 1998 to 2008 to analyze the relationship between working hours and family happiness in Korea. The Korean labor market is characterized by high levels of gender inequality which {{is partly due to}} long working hours, a significant gender gap in earnings, yet also to traditional gender roles maintained until today. Therefore, post-marriage labor force participation rates for men are still double as high as for women. However, significant changes took place over the period of our study. Working hours have been steadily reduced and female labor force participation slightly increased, partly due to the introduction of the 5 -day working week in 2004. Hours, job, and life satisfaction have all increased hence. Running fixed-effects ordered logit models on married couples with children, we analyze hours, job, and life satisfaction separately for women and men. Our findings indicate that past working hours reductions increased family happiness in Korea. However, there are still strong gender-specific effects how working hours affect family happiness. Controlling for household income, wives report highest satisfaction when either not-working or working 31 to 40 hours per week. Both part-time and overtime work reduce women 9 ̆ 2 s happiness. Korean husbands, in comparison, are best off when being full-time employed with weekly working hours between 31 and 50. Staying at home or being only part-time employed (1 - 30 hours) is strongly detrimental to their happiness. For both sexes, cross-partner effects are strongly significant. These findings are particularly interesting in comparison to other countries like Great Britain or Australia where similar studies were carried out (Booth and van Ours, 2008; 2009). Results confirm strong traditional gender roles in Korea until today. In order to further increase female labor force participation and family happiness, further reductions in working hours should be <b>flanked</b> by <b>policies</b> promoting equal chances at the work place, a rethinking of gender identities, and flexible job and child-care solutions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the recurrence and the recurrent limitations of liberalism {{as a general}} discourse, strategy, and regime. It then establishes a continuum of neoliberalism ranging from a project for radical system transformation from state socialism to market capitalism, through a basic regime shift within capitalism, to more limited policy adjustments intended to maintain another type of accumulation regime and its mode of regulation. These last two forms of neoliberalism are then related to a broader typology of approaches to the restructuring, rescaling, and reordering accumulation and regulation in advanced capitalist societies: neoliberalism, neocorporatism, neostatism, and neocommunitarianism. These arguments are illustrated in the final part of the paper through {{a critique of the}} World Report on the Urban Future (1999) both as an explicit attempt to promote flanking and supporting measures to sustain the neoliberal project on the urban scale and as an implicit attempt to naturalise that project on a global scale. The novelty of recent neoliberal projects lies in their discursive, strategic, and organizational reformulation of liberalism in response to three recent developments: the increasing internationalization and/or globalization of economies; the interconnected crises of the mixed economy and the Keynesian welfare national state associated with Atlantic Fordism, of the guided economy and developmental state in East Asia, and of the collapse of the Soviet bloc; and the rise of new social movements in response to the economic, political, and social changes associated with the preceding two changes. Although neoliberal projects are being pursued on many different and often tangled scales, it is in cities and city-regions that the various contradictions and tensions of “actually existing neoliberalism ” (Brenner and Theodore this volume) are expressed most saliently in everyday life. It is also on this scale that one can find major attempts to manage these contradictions and tensions in the hope of consolidating the neoliberal 1 turn through supplementary and/or <b>flanking</b> strategies and <b>policies...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{question of the}} dissertation is: Which normative principles lead the red-green government in the policy arenas of poverty and labour market politics? Centre of the analysis are the communicative discourses concerning normative and justice questions towards the public. Discursive practice is examined as politics: discursive practice is political action. The study shows that welfare state debates have been significantly determined by concepts of social justice. However, welfare reform debates and reforms {{have not yet been}} systematically analysed on ideas of justice. This work aims to contribute to that by showing that justice policies change and legitimate normative principles of institutions in policies against poverty and in labour market policies. Related to this is the question which institutionalised justice values characterize the German welfare state. The German welfare state is characterized by the concept of equivalence that connects performance with justice while securing one’s livelihood is only ruled by the principle of need. The Social Democratic Party promised welfare state reforms, the Greens as well aimed at a political change. Searching for a new vision leads to a new Green basic programme <b>flanked</b> by a <b>policy</b> of cutbacks. This leads to a dead end of missing justification that weakens mainly the social democrats. Activation as well as “Fordern und Fördern’’ are supposed to become the guiding principles. The individual has to take over more responsibility, the justice model being individualised. This means a shift from distributive to participative justice, towards social integration. The enabling state should ensure readiness for work and employability – integration into the labour market is justice, exclusion from work is more unfair than inequality. The new social democratic – as well as the Green – justice which is geared to the capability of being employed can be understood as a paradigm shift. “Hartz IV” is the political core of this normative change which does not get successfully communicated to the public. Whereas discussions on public disclosures and tightened duties to cooperate are discussed in public, normative arguments for those political aims are lacking. In the end the discursive result shows that the reforms are ruled by speechlessness since a sustainable normative argument is missing which links to societal values. The lack of direction also leads to an acid test inside the SPD. Simply proclaiming participative justice cannot integrate the old justice discourse as long as the normative grounds of these changed expectations are not being qualified. The discourse strategy is also evaluated as lead by experts which makes the lack of political concepts even more apparent...|$|R
