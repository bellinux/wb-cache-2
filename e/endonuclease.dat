5|$|In {{research}} {{involved with}} the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative, Rosetta {{has been used to}} computationally design novel homing <b>endonuclease</b> proteins, which could eradicate Anopheles gambiae or otherwise render the mosquito unable to transmit malaria. Being able to model and alter protein–DNA interactions specifically, like those of homing endonucleases, gives computational protein design methods like Rosetta an important role in gene therapy (which includes possible cancer treatments).|$|E
5|$|Type II {{systems are}} {{organised}} in operons with the antitoxin protein typically being located upstream of the toxin. The antitoxin inhibits the toxin by downregulating its expression. The proteins are typically around 100 amino acids in length, and exhibit toxicity {{in a number}} of ways: CcdB protein, for example, affects DNA gyrase by poisoning DNA topoisomerase II whereas MazF protein is a toxic endoribonuclease that cleaves cellular mRNAs at specific sequence motifs. The most common toxic activity is the protein acting as an <b>endonuclease,</b> also known as an interferase.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an <b>endonuclease</b> or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
25|$|Meganucleases {{are mainly}} {{represented}} by two main enzyme families collectively known as homing endonucleases: intron <b>endonucleases</b> and intein <b>endonucleases.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Endonucleases</b> cleave {{internal}}/non-terminal phosphodiester bonds. Restriction <b>endonucleases</b> cleave internal phosphodiester bonds {{only after}} recognising specific sequences in DNA {{which are usually}} 4-6 base pairs long, and often palindromic.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are four}} types of AP <b>endonucleases</b> that have been {{classified}} according to their mechanism and site of incision. Class I AP <b>endonucleases</b> (...) cleave 3' to AP sites by a β-lyase mechanism, leaving an unsaturated aldehyde, termed a 3'-(4-hydroxy-5-phospho-2-pentenal) residue, and a 5'-phosphate. Class II AP <b>endonucleases</b> incise DNA 5' to AP sites by a hydrolytic mechanism, leaving a 3'-hydroxyl and a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate residue. Class III and class IV AP <b>endonucleases</b> also cleave DNA at the phosphate groups 3´ and 5´to the baseless site, but they generate a 3´-phosphate and a 5´-OH.|$|R
25|$|If {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) tests on infected material are positive, subsequent restriction <b>endonuclease</b> pattern analysis of the amplified outer membrane protein A gene {{can be done to}} determine the genotype.|$|E
25|$|Some viruses are cap-snatchers. During this process, a 7mG-capped host mRNA is {{recruited}} by the viral transcriptase complex and subsequently cleaved by a virally encoded <b>endonuclease.</b> The resulting capped leader RNA is used to prime transcription on the viral genome.|$|E
25|$|One ERCC1 {{molecule}} and one XPF molecule bind together, {{forming an}} ERCC1-XPF heterodimer {{which is the}} active nuclease form of the enzyme. In the ERCC1–XPF heterodimer, ERCC1 mediates DNA– and protein–protein interactions. XPF provides the <b>endonuclease</b> active site and is involved in DNA binding and additional protein–protein interactions.|$|E
40|$|Meganucleases, or homing <b>endonucleases</b> (HEs) are sequence-specific <b>endonucleases</b> {{with large}} (> 14 bp) {{cleavage}} sites {{that can be}} used to induce efficient homologous gene targeting in cultured cells and plants. These findings have opened novel perspectives for genome engineering in a wide range of fields, including gene therapy. However, the number of identified HEs does not match the diversity of genomic sequences, and the probability of finding a homing site in a chosen gene is extremely low. Therefore, the design of artificial <b>endonucleases</b> with chosen specificities is under intense investigation. In this report, we describe the first artificial HEs whose specificity has been entirely redesigned to cleave a naturally occurring sequence. First, hundreds of novel <b>endonucleases</b> with locally altered substrate specificity were derived from I-CreI, a Chlamydomonas reinhardti protein belonging to the LAGLIDADG family of HEs. Second, distinct DNA-binding subdomains were identified within the protein. Third, we used these findings to assemble four sets of mutations into heterodimeric <b>endonucleases</b> cleaving a model target or a sequence from the human RAG 1 gene. These results demonstrate that the plasticity of LAGLIDADG <b>endonucleases</b> allows extensive engineering, and provide a general method to create novel <b>endonucleases</b> with tailored specificities...|$|R
25|$|There {{are five}} families, or classes, of homing <b>endonucleases.</b> The most {{widespread}} and best known is the LAGLIDADG family. LAGLIDADG family <b>endonucleases</b> are mostly {{found in the}} mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic unicellular organisms.|$|R
40|$|Homing <b>endonucleases</b> are rare-cutting enzymes encoded by introns and inteins. They have {{striking}} {{structural and}} functional properties that distinguish them from restriction enzymes. Nomenclature conventions analogous {{to those for}} restriction enzymes {{have been developed for}} the homing <b>endonucleases.</b> Recent progress in understanding the structure and function of the four families of homing enzymes is reviewed. Of particular interest are the first reported structures of homing <b>endonucleases</b> of the LAGLIDADG family. The exploitation of the homing enzymes in genome analysis and recombination research is also summarized. Finally, the evolution of homing <b>endonucleases</b> is considered, both at the structure-function level and in terms of their persistence in widely divergent biological systems...|$|R
25|$|Sickle-cell gene {{mutation}} probably arose spontaneously in different geographic areas, {{as suggested by}} restriction <b>endonuclease</b> analysis. These variants are known as Cameroon, Senegal, Benin, Bantu, and Saudi-Asian. Their clinical importance is because some are associated with higher HbF levels, e.g., Senegal and Saudi-Asian variants, and tend to have milder disease.|$|E
25|$|Type II systems rely on {{a single}} {{multifunctional}} protein, Cas9, for the interference step. Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like <b>endonuclease</b> domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{cleavage}} of {{the target}} mRNA molecule does not occur. In some cases, the endonucleolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone may be suppressed by mismatches of siRNA and target mRNA near the cleaving site. Other times, the Argonaute proteins of the RISC lack <b>endonuclease</b> activity even when the target mRNA and siRNA are perfectly paired. In such cases, gene expression will be silenced by miRNA induced mechanism instead.|$|E
5000|$|Homing <b>endonucleases</b> are {{generally}} more tolerant of substitutions in the recognition sequence. Minor variations in the recognition sequence usually decrease the activity of homing <b>endonucleases,</b> but often do not completely abolish it as often occurs with restriction enzymes.|$|R
5000|$|Not all {{restriction}} <b>endonucleases</b> cut symmetrically {{and leave}} blunt ends like HindII described above. Many <b>endonucleases</b> cleave the DNA backbones in positions {{that are not}} directly opposite each other, creating overhangs. For example, the nuclease EcoRI has the recognition sequence [...]|$|R
2500|$|Bacteria (and {{perhaps other}} prokaryotic organisms), utilize a unique defense mechanism, called the {{restriction}} modification system {{to protect themselves}} from pathogens, such as bacteriophages. In this system, bacteria produce enzymes, called restriction <b>endonucleases,</b> that attack and destroy specific regions of the viral DNA of invading bacteriophages. Methylation of the host's own DNA marks it as [...] "self" [...] and prevents it from being attacked by <b>endonucleases.</b> Restriction <b>endonucleases</b> and the restriction modification system exist exclusively in prokaryotes.|$|R
25|$|The ERCC1–XPF {{complex is}} a structure-specific <b>endonuclease.</b> ERCC1-XPF does not cut DNA that is {{exclusively}} single-stranded or double-stranded, but it cleaves the DNA phosphodiester backbone specifically at junctions between double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. It introduces {{a cut in}} double-stranded DNA on the 5′ side of such a junction, about two nucleotides away (Figure 2). This structure-specificity was initially demonstrated for RAD10-RAD1, the yeast orthologs of ERCC1 and XPF.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq data of Phytophthora sojae show an {{expression}} level {{similar to that}} of neighboring mitochondrial tRNAs, and four major processing sites confirm the predicted termini of mature mt-tmRNA. The tmRNA precursor molecule is likely processed by RNase P and a tRNA 3’ processing <b>endonuclease</b> (see Figure 2); the latter activity is assumed to lead to the removal of the intervening sequence. Following the addition of CCA at the 3’ discriminator nucleotide, the tmRNA can be charged by alanyl-tRNA synthetase with alanine.|$|E
25|$|The MIR155HG RNA {{transcript}} {{does not}} contain a long open reading frame (ORF), however, it does include an imperfectly base-paired stem loop that is conserved across species. This non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is now defined as a primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA). Once miR-155 pri-miRNA is transcribed, this transcript is cleaved by the nuclear microprocessor complex, of which the core components are the RNase III type <b>endonuclease</b> Drosha and the DiGeorge critical region 8 (DGCR8) protein, to produce a 65 nucleotide stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-mir-155) (see Figure 2).|$|E
40|$|Characterization {{of eight}} {{restriction}} <b>endonucleases</b> isolated from five strains of Herpetosiphon giganteus is described. HgiCI from strain Hpg 9 recognizes and cleaves the degenerate sequence: GGPyPuCC, producing 5 '-hexanucleotide protruding ends. <b>Endonucleases</b> HgiBI, HgiCII and HgiEI are isoschizomers of AvaII; HgiCIII and HgiDII are isoschizomers of SalI; and HgiDI and HgiGI are isoschizomers of AcyI. Based upon their closely related {{and in part}} overlapping recognition specificities a close evolutionary relationship is proposed for all known Hgi restriction <b>endonucleases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Digestion of DNA with {{restriction}} <b>endonucleases</b> is {{the first}} step in many gene manipulation projects. Restriction <b>endonucleases</b> (also referred to more generally as restriction enzymes) are isolated from many species of bacteria and recognize specific 4 -base (tetramer), 5 -base (pentamer), 6 -base (hexamer), or 8 -base (octomer) sites and make double-stranded cuts. In vivo, it appears that the main role of restriction <b>endonucleases</b> is to protect cells from invasion by foreign DNA’s, especially bacteriophage DNA...|$|R

25|$|In {{the single}} {{stranded}} DNA viruses — {{a group that}} includes the circoviruses, the geminiviruses, the parvoviruses and others — and also the many phages and plasmids that use the rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism, the RCR <b>endonuclease</b> creates a nick in the genome strand (single stranded viruses) {{or one of the}} DNA strands (plasmids). The 5′ end of the nicked strand is transferred to a tyrosine residue on the nuclease and the free 3′ OH group is then used by the DNA polymerase to synthesize the new strand.|$|E
25|$|Flap <b>endonuclease</b> 1 (FEN1) is {{responsible}} for processing Okazaki fragments. It works with DNA polymerase to remove the RNA primer of an Okazaki fragment and can remove the 5' ribonucleotide and 5' flaps when DNA polymerase displaces the strands during lagging strand synthesis. The removal of these flaps involves a process called nick translation and creates a nick for ligation. Thus, FEN1's function is necessary to Okazaki fragment maturation in forming a long continuous DNA strand. Likewise, during DNA base repair, the damaged nucleotide is displaced into a flap and subsequently removed by FEN1.|$|E
25|$|Following {{creation}} of RNA primers by primase on the lagging strand, DNA polymerase δ synthesizes Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase δ also carries out a 3' to 5' exonuclease role, proofreading newly synthesized DNA strands during DNA replication. When the polymerase encounters an erroneous base pair, it removes {{one of the}} nucleotides and replaces it with a correct one. A third function of DNA polymerase δ is to supplement FEN1/RAD27 5' Flap <b>Endonuclease</b> activity. This includes preventing and removing the strand displacement of 5' flaps, and creating ligatable nicks at the border of Okazaki fragments.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, homing <b>endonucleases</b> have {{a broader}} phylogenetic distribution, {{occurring}} {{in all three}} biological domains—the archaea, bacteria and eukarya. Type II restriction enzymes occur only in archaea, bacteria and certain viruses. Homing <b>endonucleases</b> are also expressed in all three compartments of the eukaryotic cell: nuclei, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Open reading frames encoding homing <b>endonucleases</b> {{have been found in}} introns, inteins, and in freestanding form between genes, whereas genes encoding Type II restriction enzyme genes have been found only in freestanding form, almost always in close association with genes encoding cognate DNA modifying enzymes. Thus, while the Type II restriction enzymes and homing <b>endonucleases</b> share the function of cleaving double-stranded DNA, they appear to have evolved independently.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 22 type II {{restriction}} <b>endonucleases</b> with 18 distinct specificities {{have been identified}} in six Helicobacter pylori strains. Among these 18 specificities are three completely new <b>endonucleases,</b> Hpy 178 III, Hpy 99 I, and Hpy 188 I, that specifically cleave DNA at TCNNGA, CGWCG, and TCNGA sites, respectively. The set of <b>endonucleases</b> identified in each strain varies, but all have four- or five-base recognition sequences. Among 16 H. pylori strains, examination of the DNA modification status at the recognition sites of 15 restriction <b>endonucleases</b> reveals that each strain has a substantially different complement of type II modification systems. We conclude that the type II restriction-modification systems in H. pylori are highly diverse between strains, a unique characteristic of H. pylori. The diverse methylation status of H. pylori chromosomal DNA may serve as a new typing system to discriminate H. pylori isolates for epidemiological and clinical purposes. This study also demonstrates that H. pylori is a rich source of type II restriction <b>endonucleases...</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} HNH <b>endonucleases</b> display {{a series of}} {{histidine}} and cysteine residues with a characteristic spacing that allows for coordination of a zinc ion in a cross-brace structure. Most HNH <b>endonucleases</b> (REases, homing <b>endonucleases</b> and non-specific <b>endonucleases)</b> contain a CXXC/CXXC zinc-binding domain {{in the vicinity of}} the HNH active site that ligates the latter to the rest of the protein. Hpy 99 I and PacI have an extra copy of the CXXC/CXXC domain near the N-terminus (Shen et al., 2010; Sokolowska et al., 2009). The N-terminal zinc binding site (consisting of C 4, C 22, H 28 and C 32) and the C-terminal zinc binding site (C 157, C 160, H 198 and C 201) of DraIII (Fig.  3 C) deviate from the CXXC/CXXC configuration. Similar to other HNH REases and homing <b>endonucleases,</b> the two zinc ions are tetrahedrally coordinated by four cysteine/histidine residues in the DraIII structure (Fig.  3 A).|$|R
25|$|Comparative {{structural}} {{studies of}} the free enzyme vs. the BglII-DNA complex showed that the enzyme opens by a dramatic scissor-like motion, accompanied by a complete rearrangement of the α-helicies at the dimer interface. These structural studies also revealed that within each monomer a set of residues lowers or raises to alternatively sequester or expose the active site residues. These dramatic differences in structure in the free vs. bound enzyme {{have yet to be}} observed in any other restriction <b>endonuclease</b> and may possibly represent a novel mechanism for capturing DNA that may extend to other proteins that encircle DNA.|$|E
25|$|Restriction endonucleases, {{also known}} as {{restriction}} enzymes are enzymes that cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA at specific nucleotides sequences that are usually four to six nucleotides long. Studies performed by Horton and colleagues {{have shown that the}} mechanism by which these enzymes cleave the DNA involves base flipping as well as bending the DNA and the expansion of the minor groove. In 2006, Horton and colleagues, x-ray crystallography evidence was presented showing that the restriction <b>endonuclease</b> HinP1I utilizes base flipping in order to recognize its target sequence. This enzyme is known to cleave the DNA at the palindromic tetranucleotide sequence G↓CGC.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{transfer}} RNA (tRNA), for example, the 5' sequence is removed by RNase P, whereas the 3' end is removed by the tRNase Z enzyme and the non-templated 3' CCA tail is added by a nucleotidyl transferase. In {{the case of}} micro RNA (miRNA), miRNAs are first transcribed as primary transcripts or pri-miRNA with a cap and poly-A tail and processed to short, 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures known as pre-miRNA in the cell nucleus by the enzymes Drosha and Pasha. After being exported, it is then processed to mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm by interaction with the <b>endonuclease</b> Dicer, which also initiates {{the formation of the}} RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), composed of the Argonaute protein.|$|E
40|$|Two intein <b>endonucleases,</b> denoted PI- Pko I and PI- Pko II, in the DNA {{polymerase}} gene of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus kodakaraensis KOD 1 {{were expressed}} in Escherichia coli and the recombinant <b>endonucleases</b> were characterized. Both <b>endonucleases</b> were thermostable and cleaved their intein-less DNA sequences leaving four base 3 '-hydroxyl overhangs. PI-Pko I exhibited 22 times higher specific activity than PI-Pko II and {{the activity of}} PI-Pko II was enhanced at higher potassium ion concentrations (1 M). Recognition sequences were also determined using synthetic oligonucleotides inserted into plasmid pUC 19. It was shown that DNA sequences of 19 and 16 bp are needed for cleavage by PI-Pko I and PI-Pko II, respectively. PI-Pko II could cleave the downstream junction region between intein-encoding and mature DNA polymerase regions and cleavage by PI-Pko II could be detected even when chromosomal DNA of P. kodakaraensis KOD 1 was used as substrate. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} these <b>endonucleases</b> are switching <b>endonucleases</b> whose function lies in the rearrangement of chromosomal DNA...|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, {{there are}} three {{categories}} of restriction <b>endonucleases</b> that relatively contribute to the cleavage of specific sequences. The types I and III are large multisubunit complexes that include both the <b>endonucleases</b> and methylase activities. Type I can cleave at random sites of about 1000 base pairs or more from the recognition sequence and it requires ATP as source of energy. Type II behaves slightly differently and was first isolated by Hamilton Smith in 1970. They are simpler versions of the <b>endonucleases</b> and require no ATP in their degradation processes. Some examples of type II restriction <b>endonucleases</b> include BamHI, EcoRI, EcoRV, and Haelll. Type III, however, cleaves the DNA at about 25 base pairs from the recognition sequence and also requires ATP in the process.|$|R

Data obtained indicate the different sensitivity of restriction <b>endonucleases</b> to DNA conformational perturbations resulted from the Z-DNA formation. Therefore, the inhibition of DNA cleavage by a particular restriction <b>endonucleases</b> cannot serve as a criterion for the estimation of the length of B—Z junctions in circular supercoiled DNA...|$|R
