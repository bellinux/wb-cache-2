5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. A major factor in {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used <b>for</b> <b>cooking,</b> cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. Hunting is also a major problem as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from the soils {{in which they}} grow in their leaves and stem tissues. Native Americans and early travelers in the American West used this plant as a salt substitute to season wild game. The entire plant is edible, but reported to be very salty and bitter unless well cooked. The juice from the leaves {{was used as a}} poultice for mild skin irritations and burns. Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used <b>for</b> <b>cooking</b> in Peru.|$|E

The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.|$|E

5|$|Stir frying: Stir frying is a Chinese cooking {{technique}} used for preparing {{food in a}} wok. It originates from the Han Dynasty, but did not fully develop until the Song Dynasty. Although there are no surviving records of Han Dynasty stir frying, archaeological evidence of woks and the tendency to slice food thinly indicate that the technique was likely used <b>for</b> <b>cooking.</b> It {{was not until the}} Ming Dynasty that stir frying was popularized as primary cooking method of Chinese cuisine. Stir frying was brought to America by early Chinese immigrants, and has been used for non-Asian cuisines.|$|E

5|$|The Muisca {{constructed}} ceramic pottery <b>for</b> <b>cooking,</b> {{the extraction}} of salt from brines, as decorative ritual pieces and for the consumption of their alcoholic beverage; chicha.

Also musical instruments such as ocarinas were made of ceramics. The ceramic pots and sculptures were painted with zoomorphic figures that were common in the Muisca territory; frogs, armadillos, snakes and lizards. Main ceramic production centres were located close to the abundance of clays, in Tocancipá, Gachancipá, Cogua, Guatavita, Guasca and Ráquira.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{hardwood}} hammocks in the Everglades {{have been}} harvested for lumber, particularly by shipbuilders seeking West Indian mahogany and black ironwood (Krugiodendron ferreum). The {{largest and most}} mature of these trees had been removed by the late 18th century. Seminoles made their villages in hammocks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they lived in groups of chickees numbering half a dozen, with one central chickee <b>for</b> <b>cooking</b> and another for eating. Dugout canoes, cookware, stills, and sewing machines may still be found in remote locations.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered <b>for</b> <b>cooking</b> purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily <b>for</b> <b>cooking</b> and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E
