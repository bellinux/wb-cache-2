40|$|The {{aluminum}} H-disk was instrumented with heaters (156 ohm on average) and 100 ohm platinum RTD's. Each heater {{supplies the}} heat of a double sided H-wedge. Since the flow splits into two flow directions at the <b>inlet</b> <b>fitting,</b> only half of the cooling channel is fully instrumented with RTD's. The other path has a single RTD to check for flow balancing. These items were installed after Greg Derylo petformed the first pressure drop tests. At the time of the test, the desired adhesive for gluing the two halves of the channel together was not available. Therefore, 5 -minute epoxy was used on the inner and outer diameters of the halves. Tape was used to set the gap between the two halves. This form of attachment does not make a strong bond between the two halves so the differential pressure between the inside and the outside of the channel was limited to a couple of psi. Therefore, the tests were not conducted in a vacuum...|$|E
40|$|An {{on-board}} {{centralized system}} for regulating {{the pressure of}} the tyres of a motor-vehicle. Tue system comprises a source of pressurized air (lOl), two toroidal pneumatic rotary joints (T) each associated to a driving wheel (W) ofthe motor-vehicle, and a circuit that sets in communication the source of pressurized air (I O l) with an <b>inlet</b> <b>fitting</b> of each pneumatic rotary joint (T). Tue output member of the constant-velocity joint (J) and the wheel spindle (7) have an internal duct (65) for passage of air, connected on one side to the respective pneumatic rotary joint (T) {{and on the other side}} to a plenum (P) of the respective driving wheel (W). Each non-driving wheel (WR) has its wheel spindle (46) traversed by an axial bare for the passage of air, connected on one side to the air-supply circuit via a pneumatic rotary joint (TR) and on the other side to a plenum (PR) of the non-driving wheel (WR), which is in turn connected to the inner chamber (C) of the tyre. Each driving wheel or non-driving wheel has its plenum (P, PR) connected to the inner chamber (C) of the tyre via two parallel lines (L 2, L 3), for deflating and inflating, respectively, the tyre interposed in which are respective one-way valves (28, 32). Tue one-way valve (28) on the deflation line is provided with a return spring (30), which guarantees a pre-set minimum value of he pressure of the inner chamber (C) of the tyre...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} valve {{for controlling}} {{the rate of}} flow of a fluid would include an electric-motor-driven ball-screw mechanism for adjusting the seating element of the valve to any position between fully closed and fully open. The motor would be of a type that can be electronically controlled to rotate to a specified angular position and to rotate at a specified rate, and the ball screw would enable accurate linear positioning of the seating element {{as a function of}} angular position of the motor. Hence, the proposed valve would enable fine electronic control of the rate of flow and the rate of change of flow. The uniqueness of this valve lies in a high degree of integration of the actuation mechanism with the flow-control components into a single, relatively compact unit. A notable feature of this integration is that {{in addition to being a}} major part of the actuation mechanism, the ball screw would also be a flow-control component: the ball screw would be hollow so as to contain part of the main flow passage, and one end of the ball screw would be the main seating valve element. The relationships among the components of the valve are best understood by reference to the figure, which presents meridional cross sections of the valve in the fully closed and fully open positions. The motor would be supported by a bracket bolted to the valve body. By means of gears or pulleys and a timing belt, motor drive would be transmitted to a sleeve that would rotate on bearings in the valve body. A ball nut inside the sleeve would be made to rotate with the sleeve by use of a key. The ball screw would pass through and engage the ball nut. A key would prevent rotation of the ball screw in the valve body while allowing the ball screw to translate axially when driven by the ball nut. The outer surface of the ball screw would be threaded only in a mid-length region: the end regions of the outer surface of the ball screw would be polished so that they could act as dynamic sealing surfaces. The inlet end (the right end as depicted in the figure) of the ball screw would be the main seating valve element: in the fully closed position, it would be pressed against the valve seat, as depicted in the upper part of the figure. A retainer would hold the valve seat in an <b>inlet</b> <b>fitting.</b> In addition, the retainer would be contoured to obtain a specified flow rate as a function of axial position of the ball screw. In the fully closed position, little force would be needed to press the ball screw against the seat because the push bore area upon which the upstream pressure would act would be small. The motor would position and hold the ball screw against the seat, providing the force necessary for sealing. To open the valve to a particular position, the motor would be commanded to rotate to a particular angular position (equivalently, a particular number of revolutions) at a particular rate of rotation within its torque limitations. Once the valve was open, fluid would flow through the <b>inlet</b> <b>fitting</b> and the chamber in the inlet housing, past the seat and its retainer, along the hollow core of the ball screw, and through the outlet housing and outlet fitting. The net force generated from fluid pressure in the open position would be small because the pressure exposed to the push bore areas at the inlet and outlet are nearly equal and the forces generated would be in opposing directions...|$|E

50|$|Essentially, {{the high}} energy {{repeated}} motion {{created by the}} rappers {{is the source of}} their wear. The consistent high intensity vibrations cause fatigue and wear on the rappers. Bolted joints are especially affected by this repetitive motion and must be replaced. Frequent failure of air in <b>inlet</b> <b>fittings</b> is another issue that arises from the motion. Repeated vibrations cause fittings to dull down and pipe threads break off, therefore, loosening the fittings.|$|R
5000|$|The wall inlets are {{connected}} to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air return ducts (if permitted by building code). In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a [...] "rough-in" [...] phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.), and just before drywall, paneling, or other surface finishes are installed. Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum <b>inlet</b> <b>fittings</b> and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the design, development and flight testing of the U. S. Army 4200 ft(sup 2) parafoil recovery system built under NASA Contract NAS 9 - 00076. The 4200 ft(sup 2) parafoil described herein was a potential candidate to fulfill the U. S. Army requirement for a 10, 000 lb useable payload precision guided recovery system. Design heritage as well as specific features, like lower surface <b>inlets,</b> confluence <b>fitting,</b> upper surface energy modulator design, deployment bag design and 60 ft diameter Ringslot drogue will be discussed. Initial flight test results, ground testing of various components to verify design margin and configuration changes will also be discussed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to {{study the effects of}} thermalhydraulics flows on the wall concentration gradient profiles in LBE loop fittings. To that end detailed models of the fittings have been constructed to study these effects. These fittings include sudden expansion, sudden contraction, t-joint and elbow. The typical flow rates chosen for these simulations are typical of design criteria chosen for the loop with Reynolds numbers expected around 200, 000 and the usual axial temperature profiles which are being characterized in the DELTA loop at LANL. STAR-CD is the simulation package used to make these predictions, which include detailed 3 -D velocity, temperature and concentration gradient profiles of the corrosion/precipitation on the inner surface of these fittings. The different predicted variables from these simulations indicate that special attention needs to be placed when designing loops with these fittings especially in the regions of sudden velocity changes and stagnation zones. These wall gradients can determine eventually the expected longevity of these fittings in an LBE flow environment. Presently though very little experimental data exists that would be suitable to corroborate the simulation results. Graphs of concentration gradient v/s distance from the <b>inlet</b> of these <b>fittings</b> were plotted. Eventually these individual fitting models will become part of an overall closed loop that will yield more realistic core concentration values and hence more realistic wall gradient values, which are dependent on these core values...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{method for}} {{the recovery of}} the pulping chemicals at kraft pulp mills is the direct causticization. In this process, a gasifier and a titanate cycle replace the conventional recovery boiler and lime cycle. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of carbon dioxide on the reaction kinetics for the solid state reaction between sodium carbonate and sodium trititanate, i. e. the direct causticization reaction occurring in the gasifier in this process. Experiments were carried out at five different temperatures (800 - 880 °C) and with five different amounts of carbon dioxide in the inlet gas (0 - 5 %) in a differential reactor made of quartz glass. Kinetic data was obtained by measuring the release of carbon dioxide during the reaction. Different kinetic models were used to describe the conversion. The Valensi-Carter model describes reactions controlled by diffusion in the solid material and the phase-boundary model describes reactions controlled by chemical kinetics for a first-order reaction. Furthermore, a model including both diffusion in the solid material and chemical kinetics, the "modified shrinking-core" model, was used. It was found that higher temperatures decrease the time to reach complete conversion. This was found for all carbon dioxide concentrations. Differences could also be seen between experiments with and without carbon dioxide, but no clear differences were seen for different amounts of carbon dioxide. The change of controlling reaction mechanism occurred at different temperatures for different amounts of carbon dioxide in the <b>inlet</b> gas. When <b>fitting</b> the models to experimental data in the whole conversion interval it was found that the reaction was controlled by diffusion for all amounts of carbon dioxide at low temperatures. Though, when the carbon dioxide concentration in the reaction atmosphere was increased, the change of reaction mechanism to chemical kinetics occurred at higher temperatures. However, when there was carbon dioxide in the reaction atmosphere none of the models could give a good visual description in the whole conversion interval even if reasonably good standard deviation between the models and the experimental data was obtained. When the phase boundary model was fitted to the experimental data in the conversion range 8 - 73 %, it could describe the data very well both visually and by the standard deviation calculations, which indicate that the reaction is controlled by chemical kinetics in the beginning of the reaction.
