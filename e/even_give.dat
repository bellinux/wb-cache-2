5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may <b>even</b> <b>give</b> up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|Inclined {{to form an}} {{alliance}} with the Habsburgs (and <b>even</b> <b>give</b> up the Polish crown to pursue his ambitions in Sweden), Sigismund conducted secret negotiations with them and married Archduchess Anna. Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his covenants, Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). Indifferent to the increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of violence against the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E
5|$|Pre-sejm (Polish: przedsejmowe) sejmiks were convened by {{the king}} who sent a writ (legacja królewska) to each sejmik, {{outlining}} the reasons the next Sejm would be held. Such sejmiks elected one to six deputies (poslowie), {{depending on the size}} and importance of the sejmik's territory, to the ordinary General Sejm (Polish: Sejm Walny) that was held every two years, and to any extraordinary General Sejm that might be called at any time in an emergency. Sometimes pre-sejm sejmiks were referred to as electoral. In some cases, a sejmik could be called for two voivodeships – in that case it could elect more than 6 deputies. Deputies were given instructions on how to vote during the sejm proper, although on occasion the instructions could be vague, or <b>even</b> <b>give</b> the deputies full freedom. These sejmiks arose in the late 15th century.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} Christians, early medieval Christians {{inherited}} a church united by major creeds, a stable Biblical canon, and a well-developed philosophical tradition. The history of medieval Christianity traces Christianity during the Middle Ages—the period {{after the fall}} of the Roman Empire until the Protestant Reformation. The institutional structure of Christianity in the west during this period is different from what it would become later in the Middle Ages. As opposed to the later church, the church of the early Middle Ages consisted primarily of the monasteries. The practice of simony has caused the ecclesiastical offices to become the property of local princes, and as such the monasteries constituted the only church institution independent of the local princes. In addition, the papacy was relatively weak, and its power was mostly confined to central Italy. Individualized religious practice was uncommon, as it typically required membership in a religious order, such as the Order of Saint Benedict. Religious orders wouldn't proliferate until the high Middle Ages. For the typical Christian at this time, religious participation was largely confined to occasionally receiving mass from wandering monks. Few would be lucky enough to receive this as often as once a month. By the end of this period, individual practice of religion was becoming more common, as monasteries started to transform into something approximating modern churches, where some monks might <b>even</b> <b>give</b> occasional sermons.|$|E

500|$|At the time, the National Hockey League was {{considered}} to be where the best hockey players played, and its best players consisted largely of Canadians. The public consensus of hockey pundits and fans in North America was that other countries, the Soviets in this case, were simply no match for Canada's best. The Soviets were not expected to <b>even</b> <b>give</b> the Canadians a challenge, and Canada was going into this series expected to win handily. According to Team Canada Coach Harry Sinden: [...] "Canada is first in the world in two things: hockey and wheat." [...] Alan Eagleson said [...] "We gotta win in eight games. Anything less than an unblemished sweep of the Russians would bring shame down on the heads of the players and the national pride." [...] The Soviets downplayed themselves, stating that they were in the series to learn.|$|E

500|$|My Gym Partner's a Monkey {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. William Barker of Web Wombat gave the King of the Jungle DVD a positive review, awarding {{it with a}} score of 70%, saying: [...] "With an original – dare I say unique? – premise, My Gym Partner's a Monkey makes for a somewhat refreshing change from super heroes and mutants, and the cut-out animation style is captivating, though far from novel. It's not the most impressive cartoon show I've ever seen, but it's quite cute and fairly amusing – even for the older primates among us." [...] Larisa Wiseman of Common Sense Media awarded the series three out of five stars, saying: [...] "It's difficult to tell what age group the show's producers were aiming at – the animation style and slapstick by themselves would seem to appeal mainly to grade-schoolers, while the jokes and life lessons are definitely aimed at the tween set. The sly humor may <b>even</b> <b>give</b> some adults the occasional laugh-out-loud moment. Overall, My Gym Partner's a Monkey is commendable for its effort to include a subtle message in each episode. Younger viewers will probably find Jake's sometimes-annoying goofiness amusing, and will definitely find the story lines entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He highlighted the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli, saying that he [...] "totally owns every scene he’s in". He thought that the situation which left La Forge in charge of the Enterprise was [...] "horribly contrived" [...] and said [...] "Picard doesn’t <b>even</b> <b>give</b> a good excuse for going down to the planet beyond the script calling for it". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten, summing up that it was a [...] "fun, enjoyable, diverting episode". Zack Handlen reviewed the episode in May 2010 for The A.V. Club. He criticised the episode, saying that there [...] "are all kinds of problems, the biggest being that the episode doesn't really have a third act, but the moral superiority of the crew is on full display, and it's frustrating." [...] He summed up the moral story played out in this episode, saying that [...] "On TOS, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy would've hashed out the appeal of an unbeatable weapon as well as its drawbacks. Here, we're all supposed to know that violence begets violence, and that's it." [...] He gave the episode a grade of C+.|$|E
500|$|Schneider {{began the}} year as the team's {{starting}} goaltender. In his first game against the Anaheim Ducks, Schneider allowed five goals on 14 shots and was pulled midway through the second period. When Luongo entered the game {{he was given a}} standing ovation from the crowd. Luongo gave up another two goals as the Canucks lost 7–3. In the post-game interview, Schneider took the blame for the loss, saying, [...] "It was unacceptable to play that way and to put my team in that situation and not <b>even</b> <b>give</b> them a chance to win." [...] He also stated he would work hard to fix the mistakes. While Luongo said of this ovation that it was [...] "a fun moment." [...] The situation quickly led to a goalie controversy. Luongo made the start the following night against the Edmonton Oilers. According to Vigneault, he had already determined the starting assignments for the opening two games, and Schneider did not factor into Luongo's start. In the game, Luongo allowed two goals after Vancouver had taken a 2–0 lead. The Canucks lost the game 3–2 in a shootout. Luongo failed to stop either of the two shooters he faced, while Vancouver did not score. After losing their first two games, Vancouver added to their forward depth recalling Jordan Schroeder from the AHL and assigning Jim Vandermeer to the Wolves. Schroeder took over the second line duties after Andrew Ebbett went pointless in the first two contests.|$|E
