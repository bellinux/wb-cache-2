3000|$|... 105 {{human blood}} <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> were {{collected}} in South Africa up to 10  years ago using Schleicher & Schuell (S & S) 903 <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> (Whatman Ltd). S & S 903 is a FDA approved medical device recommended by the International Screening Community for Neonatal Screening worldwide. This blood <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> is also widely used for the studies of personalized medicine, with its paper manipulated for strictly quality-controlled for serum uptake, absorption characteristics and lot-to-lot consistency, ensuring reproducibility of results. Each blood <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> has been well separated by a sterilized plastic bag. Five circular blood samples were located in each blood <b>paper</b> <b>card,</b> and each blood circle contained a blood volume of approximately 75  μl. Endorsement to use these human blood <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> has been permitted by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board.|$|R

30|$|Blood <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research to maintain human genomic DNA and blood pathogen DNA for genetic, pharmacogenetic and clinical testing. They provide an easier collection, transportation, and storage methods than other protocols (Dobbs et al. 2002; Mas et al. 2007; Soetens et al. 2008; Hardin et al. 2009; Ataei et al. 2011; Klassen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2013). Blood <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> can be stored at room temperature under dry conditions with a desiccant, and do not need other special storage requirements. On average, blood <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> can be stored ten years post-collection, ensuring that DNA can be accessed for future experimentation.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Survey Corpus predated modern computing. It {{was recorded}} on reel-to-reel tapes, transcribed on paper, filed in filing cabinets, and indexed on <b>paper</b> <b>cards.</b> Transcriptions were annotated with a detailed prosodic and paralinguistic annotation developed by Crystal and Quirk (1964). Sets of <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> were manually annotated for grammatical structures and filed, so, for example, all noun phrases {{could be found}} in the noun phrase filing cabinet in the Survey. Naturally, corpus searches required a visit to the Survey.|$|R

50|$|Bus fares are {{pre-paid}} {{by means}} of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> with a magnetic stripe which can be bought from post offices, automatic vending machines, and private businesses. For occasional use, a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the bus unit. The interurban lines have differential fares and some allow payment in cash only. The municipal administration is phasing out the <b>paper</b> <b>cards,</b> {{in favor of the}} plastic ones, {{during the second half of}} 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The {{redemption}} policy {{offers a}} {{medium of exchange}} between the digital card market and the physical card market, though this is one-way only {{as there is no}} way to convert <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> to digital cards. However, during Pax Australia in summer 2013 Wizards of the Coast announced that [...] "reverse redemption" [...] (the ability to turn physical, <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> to the digital cards of [...] "Magic Online") is a potential upcoming improvement to stay ahead of increased competition in the digital card game market.|$|R
30|$|Currently, several kits are commercially {{available}} for DNA isolation from blood <b>paper</b> <b>cards.</b> These kits include GenSolve (Cat.# WB 100050, BTC Private Limited) (Richard et al. 2011; Phyo et al. 2012), forensicGEM (Cat.# 95044 - 090, Zygem Corporation) (Moss et al. 2003), DNA IQ (Cat.# DC 6700, Promega) (Barbaro et al. 2004; Rohland and Hofreiter 2007), and DNAzol (DN 131, MRC Inc) (Chomczynski et al. 1997; Mackey et al. 1998; Chomczynski et al. 1998; Haak et al. 2009; Turner et al. 2011; Knowles et al. 2012). DN 131 is a commonly used reagent for blood <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> DNA isolation because its protocol is straightforward, and the supernatant with blood <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> post centrifugation {{can be directly}} used for amplification of targeted genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, {{the volume of the}} supernatant cannot exceed 10 % of the total PCR volume when DN 131 kit is utilized. In addition, DNA isolated by DN 131 includes excess proteins, which will further dampen efficiency of PCR amplification. Previously our team had used Tris–HCl (10  mM, pH 7.4) and achieved a high success rate for mouse genotyping (Sysol et al. 2013). We therefore hypothesized that DNA dissolving solutions including Tris–HCl, TE or water may be feasible for blood <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> DNA isolation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} a tangible programming environment that uses <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> as command objects. We have implemented a prototype system called “Sheets”. The users can experience a tangible environment without {{the necessity of}} specialized devices using Sheets. This system is capable of drawing and moving shapes, and creates loops and branch executions. This system includes <b>paper</b> <b>cards,</b> a webcam, and software. The <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> are printed descriptions and markers. The markers are captured by the webcam and are recognized by the software. The users can line up the command cards in a specific {{order to create a}} program, and the resulting drawing and movements of the graphic are then displayed on the screen. In addition, it is also capable of sensing real-world events such as touch inputs on these command cards, and it is possible to edit the program by writing on the <b>paper</b> <b>cards.</b> For example, the number of loop executions and the values of any variables can be altered. The program can also implement draw commands for custom sketches designed by the users. Sheets can assist in programming using functionalities like conversion to source codes and highlighting. We have performed simple evaluation experiments using this system and collected the opinions of the users...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility and effectiveness using Tris–HCl (10  mM, pH 7.4), Tris-EDTA buffer (TE, 10  mM, pH 7.6), water and DN 131 to isolate DNA from 105 human blood <b>paper</b> <b>cards.</b> In addition, we examined whether the crude DNA isolated by these solutions was sufficient to amplify caspase- 12 C 125 T SNP (rs# 497116). To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to compare the effectiveness and efficiency using these easily obtained laboratory solutions for blood <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> DNA isolation.|$|R
30|$|The egg-parasitoid was {{obtained}} from Biological Control Laboratory, established at Rice Research and Training Center, Sakha Agricultural Research Station, Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt. The parasitoid was reared on eggs of the cereal moth, Sitotroga cerealella Oliver and released at late pupal stage. The parasitized eggs of the host were glued onto <b>paper</b> <b>cards,</b> each containing about 1000 eggs. The releases were practiced just before sunset, and the <b>paper</b> <b>cards,</b> containing S. cerealella parasitized eggs, were hanged on the rice plants using strings. The rate of release was 30, 000  wasps/feddan.|$|R
50|$|An E-card {{is similar}} to a {{postcard}} or greeting card, with the primary difference being that it is created using digital media instead of paper or other traditional materials. E-cards are made available by publishers usually on various Internet sites, where they can be sent to a recipient, usually via e-mail. It is also considered more environmentally friendly compared to traditional <b>paper</b> <b>cards.</b> E-card businesses are considered environmentally friendly because their carbon footprint is generally much lower compared to <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> companies because <b>paper</b> is not used in the end product.|$|R

25|$|Story Gathering Boxes, an ongoing, {{participatory}} artwork, {{was initiated}} in 1972. Each piece {{in this series}} consists of a box with four chambers made out of poplar wood. The chambers contain wooden tablets or <b>paper</b> <b>cards.</b> The wooden tablets display imagery and themes centered on spirituality, gender and goddess-based narratives. The imagery is created out of mixed media like paint and leather. The <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> contain prompts, inviting viewers to contribute personal stories on various topics, such as gender, domestic violence, and immigration. This series democratizes access to art by allowing all viewers {{to participate in the}} creation of a collective narrative.|$|R
