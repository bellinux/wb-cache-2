50|$|There {{are three}} type of Stones (rocks) {{indicative}} of the physical characteristics from its formative process. These three categories are: igneous or volcanic rocks (basalt, granic, etc.), sedimentary or deposit rocks (limestone, sandstone, arenite, etc.), and metamorphic rocks (marble, slate, gypsum, etc.). Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling and/or solidification of magma {{and the formation of}} a dense network of crystals—below the Earth's surface as intrusive rock or on the surface as <b>effusive</b> <b>rock.</b> Sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition of the remains of other rock caused by the action of atmospheric influences. Metamorphic rocks are formed by the transformation of existing rock through the action of temperature and pressure, which cause profound physical and/or chemical changes.|$|R

Conversely the relationship between strength ratio σt / IS, 50 and porosity was found to be more or less constant. These results suggest that macroporosity affects in different ways shear and tensile modes of failure (typical of UC and B/PL tests, respectively). This is confirmed by the evidence that porosity has virtually the same influence on B and PL strengths...|$|R

They are assigned to the same regional, genetic and geochemical unit. Their emplacement age is inferred from contacts with the surrounding marble and sedimentary rocks (post-Anisian for intrusives and Ladinian for <b>effusives).</b> The magmatic <b>rocks</b> display different levels of emplacement and crystallization (intrusive, <b>effusive</b> and dyke <b>rocks).</b> They represent different stages of magmatic differentiation, from gabbro/basalt via diorite/andesite to granodiorite/dacite and granites.

40|$|ABSTRACT Soils {{formed in}} high mountainous regions in {{southern}} Brazil {{are characterized by}} great accumulation of organic matter (OM) in the surface horizons and variation {{in the degree of}} development. We hypothesized that soil properties and genesis are influenced by the interaction of parent materials and climate factors, which differ depending on the location along the altitudinal gradient. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize and classify the soil, evaluate soil distribution, and determine the interactive effects of soil-forming factors in the subtropical mountain regions in Santa Catarina state. Soil samples were collected in areas known for wine production, for a total of 38 modal profiles. Based on morphological, physical, and chemical properties, soils were evaluated for pedogenesis and classified according to the Brazilian System of Soil Classification, with equivalent classes in the World Reference Basis (WRB). The results indicated that pedogenesis was strongly influenced by the parent material, weather, and relief. In the areas where basic <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (basalt) were observed, there was formation of extensive areas of clayey soils with reddish color and higher iron oxide contents. There was a predominance of Nitossolos Vermelhos and Háplicos (Nitisols), Latossolos Vermelhos (Ferralsols), and Cambissolos Háplicos (Cambisols), highlighting the pedogenetic processes of eluviation, illuviation of clay, and latosolization in conditions of year-long, large-volume, well-distributed rainfall and stability of land forms. In areas with acid <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (rhyodacites), medial or clayey soils were observed with lower iron oxide content, invariably acidic, and with low base content. For these soils, relief promoted substantial removal of material, resulting in intense rejuvenation, with a predominance of Cambissolos Háplicos (Cambisols) and lesser occurrence of Nitossolos Brunos (Nitisols) and Neossolos Litólicos (Leptosols). Soils formed from sedimentary rocks also tended to be more acidic, but with higher sand content, and the soils identified were Cambissolos Háplicos and Húmicos (Cambisols). Cluster analysis separated the soil profiles into three groups: the first and largest was formed by profiles originating from sedimentary rocks and rhyodacites; the second, smaller group was formed by four profiles in the Água Doce region (acidic rocks); and the third was formed by profiles derived from basalt. Discriminant analysis was effective in grouping soil classes. Thus, the study highlighted the importance of geology in the formation of soils in this landscape associated with climate and relief...|$|E
40|$|The Iricoumé group {{consists}} of very well preserved pyroclastic and <b>effusive</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> {{as a part}} of an extensive volcano-plutonic event, which marked {{the central part of the}} Amazonian craton during the Orosirian. Such rocks occur in the southern part of the southwestern of Erepecuru-Trombetas Domain (NW of the Pará state), south of the Guyana Shield. Petrographic study allows distinction of two volcanic types. A dominant explosive volcanism is characterized by pyroclastic rocks (ignimbrites, rheoignimbrites, lapilli-tuff related to surge deposit, and co-ignimbrite fall tuff) while a subordinated effusive volcanism is represented by coherent lavas flows and hypabissal rocks (andesites, lamprophyres and latites). Most of the pyroclastic rocks exhibit features of deposition under high temperature suggesting formation in a caldera-related environment. Pb-Pb zircon ages of 1888 +- 2. 5 and 1889 +- 2 Ma have been obtained for the formation of trachydacitic ignimbrites and confirm that the dominant volcanism is part of the Iricoumé group. The Pb-Pb zircon age of 1992 +- 3 Ma yielded by an andesite points to the occurrence in the area of an older Orosirian magmatic episode, which has been previously recognized locally southward in the Tapajós domain. These new results constitute a further evidence of the wide extent of the Iricoum group and correlated volcanic rocks in the central part of the Amazonian craton, and reinforce the assumption that this volcanic episode and correlated magmatism may be considered as a silicic large igneous province (SLIP), as previously proposed by some authors...|$|R

Geologically, the island is composed almost entirely of volcanic rock, with minor outcrops of Tyrrhenian fossil-bearing sandy conglomerates, of eolian sandstones, ancient and recent alluvial deposits, dunal sands and sediments deposited in palustrine and marshy environments. In spite of its small size, the island boasts a wealth of geodiversity, with the occurrence {{of a variety of}} <b>effusive</b> magmatic <b>rocks</b> formed during the Oligo-Miocene volcanic cycle that affected the whole of Sardinia. During this cycle numerous units were emplaced as well as various, easily distinguishable types of volcanic rocks, namely lava (rhyolite, rhyolitic ignimbrite, comendite, retinite, diaspore, etc.) and tuff (tuff, pyroclastite, cinerite, pumiceous cinerite, red and yellow ochre), sometimes with spectacular domes (for instance at Capo Sandalo and Cala Fico) manganese bearing mineralizations, emission centres, lava flow surface structures (comendite lava at Bricco di Nasca and Montagna di Ravenna), convolute flow structures (comendite lava at Cala Fico) and spectacular columnar fracturing. Detailed field surveys and laboratory investigations conducted using aerial photographs, orthophotographs and satellite images allowed to examine and classify those landforms attributable to geomorphological processes associated with water, weathering, wind and coastal dynamics. The marine environment was geologically-geomorphologically interpreted chiefly by examining the Side Scan Sonar data, supplemented with direct observations during underwater surveys. For the pericoastal areas (between 0 and - 15 m), photograms and recently acquired satellite imagery were analysed. Side scan sonograms together with direct underwater observations were used to determine lithology of submerged rock outcrops, to reconstruct boundaries between different rock types, to detect evidence of tectonic lines, to determine the evolution of coastal and underwater relief forms, to identify the main sedimentary facies and evidence of sea level stand (palaeo shore line). Interpretive hypothesis of the side scan sonar data were validated by means of underwater surveys. Data from land and sea surveys were interpreted in CAD and GIS environments...|$|R
40|$|In {{his recent}} study the writer {{discovered}} a {{differences between the}} plagioclase twinning of the igneous rocks {{and that of the}} metamorphic rocks, and proposed a new method (plagioclase twin method) for the study of "granite problem". In the present paper are described the features of plagioclase twinning in some slightly contact-metamorphosed basic effusives (meta-basalts and meta-andesites). The groundmass plagioclases of these meta-volcanics are richer in untwinned plagioclases and poorer in A-twins comparing with those of non-metamorphosed basic effusives, the amounts of C-twins being not so different. As to the phenocrysts, however, there are no such differences in the mode of twinning between these two types of <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (Fig. 1). The explanation seems to be sought in the disappearance of twinning (albite law) in some A-twins of groundmass plagioclases due to thermal metamorphism. Thus the features of plagioclase twinning may be used as a clue to determine the thermal effect operated upon slightly contact-metamorphosed effusives rocks. On that basis the so-called basic (or dark) inclusions in some granodiorites of southern Abukuma Plateau are explained as xenoliths derived from some diabases or allied basic igneous rocks (Fig. 6) ...|$|E

40|$|Two highly {{contrasting}} {{models have}} been proposed for the palaeovolcanological setting of the massive sulphide deposits in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The long-standing view of the host rocks {{is that they are}} a pile of <b>effusive</b> and pyroclastic <b>rocks</b> but this position has now been challenged by the proposal that high-level peperitic sills predominate. Discrimination between the volcanic-pile and sill–sediment-complex models is important because they lead to very different conclusions about such key metallogenic features as the timing of mineralization, the nature of the ore-forming convective system and the source of the metals. Sedimentary geochemistry, particularly REE and Ti/Nb, shows that there is no correspondence between the chemistries of mafic igneous sheets and intercalated stratified-volcaniclastic rocks that range from andesite to rhyodacite in composition. Therefore none of the mafic sheets supplied detritus to the sedimentary environment. Sedimentary rocks of continental provenance persist throughout the host-rock sequence, especially in mineralized regions, implying confinement of the majority of primary volcanic facies in the form of high-level intrusions. Some andesitic and felsic intrusions created a minor, stratified volcaniclastic component via hydrovolcanic eruptions. The volcanic-pile model is invalidated because the expected provenance patterns for this volcanic style are not present and the sill–sediment-complex setting of the sulphide deposits is confirme...|$|R

This envelope is at least 300 m long, up to 30 m wide, and is known to a depth of 950 m, where it remains open. It exhibits two contrast-ing mineralized zones that are representative of the varying styles of mineralization in the area. The Auriferous zone consists of both ubiquitous pyrite disseminations and Au-bearing silicate-sulfide veins in strongly fractured intrusive, <b>effusive,</b> and volcaniclastic <b>rocks</b> showing propylitic and chloritic alteration assemblages.

The Polymetallic zone is hosted by a chaotic assemblage of gabbro and tuff bodies interpreted as a talus megabreccia. Several lines of evidence, including the spatial distribution pattern and nature of the alteration and mineraliza-tion assemblages, metal associations, mass-balance calculations, pyrite composition, and crosscutting relation-ships are indicative of a preregional deformation, synvolcanic origin for the hydrothermal activity.

In the vicinity of Sonho Meu Farm, there is some part of an acid to intermediate lava dome, which is 2 km long and 250 m wide. The dome has a hypabyssal core that changes laterally to an autoclastic facies rich in pumice and shards with mingling textures, and subsequently to a facies with flow structures. The core has porphyritic texture and phenocrysts of plagioclase and biotite embedded in a medium-grained matrix of the same composition. The pumice-rich facies has a texture similar to ignimbrites and reoignimbrites. In this facies, a porphyritic to glomeroporphyritic texture is observed, with evidence of pumice collapse. The magma mixture is characterized by clusters of hornblende and plagioclase, {{in the form of}} millimetric to decimetric enclaves. Geochemical data on the rocks with no evidence of mingling indicate metaluminous to peraluminous high-K calcalkaline compositions. Rare earth elements patterns show a slight enrichment in LREE over HREE. Geochemical data show an enrichment in Rb, Sr, and K 2 O and a negative Ta-Nb anomaly, which is common in calcalkaline rocks. Concentrations of trace elements are compatible with post-collisional tectonic environments. U-Pb zircon geochronology yields an age of 1. 87 Ga. Sm-Nd isotopic studies report negative €Nd values and Archean Nd model ages, indicating contamination by crustal material. This paper suggested that such dome was formed by melting of the lithospheric mantle, modified by previous subduction events, with subsequent magmatic differentiation...|$|R

Even though at present there is no accepted GGP model of the Brunhes chron, we found interesting to clarify the details of this negative test. While such an incompatibility is clear enough for the TKmodel, because of its too small dipole coefficient, the incompatibility of the QCmodel was due the 12 per cent of the data with very small intensities; remaining 88 per cent of data is fully compatible with QC model QC. The troublesome, low-palaeointensity records belong to different sites and ages so their excess presence is not an effect of particular location or time. We found no evidence that the marked discrepancy between the empirical data and theoretical calculations on the QC model {{can be explained by the}} possibility that the low-intensity values belong to known excursions of the geomagnetic field. As an alternative, we conjecture that selected low-intensity values can possibly stem from acquisition of chemical remanent magnetization instead of the thermoremanence...|$|E

The high-quality outcrops {{of the southern}} Sañicó depocentre, which was uplifted and exposed during the Andean orogeny, were studied {{in order to determine}} the lithofacies arrangements, the tectonostratigraphic framework and the main controls over the syn-rift succession. The tectonostratigraphic study made it possible to determine three sections characterized by the predominance of effusive, pyroclastic or sedimentary deposits. These sections indicate three different evolutionary stages of the volcanic rifting. The onset of this rift stage was dominated by <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> with minor ignimbrite and alluvial volcaniclastic units, which indicates the occurrence of composite volcanoes at the boundaries of the depocentre. The mid-rift stage was characterized by the development of fault-controlled, large ignimbrite deposits intebedded with volcaniclastic alluvial deposits and lava units, which suggests a volcano-tectonic depression related to asymmetrical and incremental subsidence. The end of the volcanic rifting event was marked by a decrease in the volume of the volcanic rocks and the occurrence of low-relief effusive aggradational volcanic edifices and lava fields in close relation with alluvial, deltaic and lacustrine units. The analysis of the syn-rift sequence in the Sañicó depocentre showed the complex relationships between tectonic and volcanic controls which occurred in different magnitudes and times during the rifting evolution...|$|E

Its validity in the Czech part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (Carboniferous, Mississippian to Pennsylvanian — Lower Namurian to Westphalian A) {{is the subject of}} this study. It is based on over 29, 000 analyses of the volatile matter moisture- and ash-free (Vdaf) from surface and underground boreholes drilled in 1946 – 1989. Vitrinite reflectance (Rmax) cannot be used as a measure of coalification in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin: the number of reflectance measurements is small and their distribution over the basin area is very uneven. Statistical data on Vdaf for the individual stratal units were processed. Modelling of the trends in the volatile matter moisture- and ash-free (Vdaf) depending on “stratigraphic depth” proved the general applicability of Hilt's law. The distribution of this parameter in selected boreholes and segments of the basin was also studied, and coalification gradients were calculated. Coalification in specific examples (boreholes) is, however, highly variable and shows numerous deviations from Hilt's law even within individual boreholes, which is documented on a real example. The causes of some of the deviations are relatively well known (e. g., effect of elevated pressure in tectonically deformed areas, effect of <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> or paleoweathering zones) while others can be presumed (heat flows due to Variscan and Carpathian orogenies affected by the lithology of the Carboniferous massif). The contribution of these effects in specific examples can be determined with great difficulty only...|$|E
40|$|The stratigraphic {{research}} made on M. Clapsavon has {{the purpose}} of obtaining a stratigraphic column of “Forcella Chiana” section, where was surveyed the following formations: Calcari Dolomitici del M. Tiarfin: these are massive grey limestones with facies of carbonatic platform, precisely of a reef environment. Looking at the microfacies into the thin sections, is recognizable the typical configuration of a microbial boundstone with trombolitic structure, {{to be more precise}} is a bioconstructed limestone built by encrusting microbes. Into the sections can be observed several fossils organism like dasicladacean algae, foraminifers and ostracods, all encrusted into the biogenic micrite. The formation contains also some heavily dolomitizated layers, in which the substitution from calcite to dolomite obliterated the previous structures. Calcari Rossi ad Ammoniti del Monte Clapsavon: these are thin grained red limestones, deposed in a pelagic environment, enriched in re-crystallizated radiolarian, echinoderms and bivalves fragments immersed into a micritic matrix; the rock is grain-substained and can be defined like a packstone. At the bottom of the formation there is a breccias with clasts < 3 cm belonging to the underlying formation, that are the “Calcari Dolomitici del M. Tiarfin”. The clasts are immersed into a reddish matrix belonging to “Calcari Rossi” full of bivalvs and echinoderms’ flakes. Wengen Formation: these sandstones derive from terrigen material settled into a basin, enriched of volcanogenic products especially volcanic crystals. Moreover, portions of volcanic rocks can be included into these sandstones like isolated clasts. The colour of this rock is greenish for the occurrence of volcanic elements, sometimes with dark red halos caused by weathering. Looking at the thin sections is possible to see volcanic crystals within biological elements like radiolarian and sponges’ spiculas. Into a sample there is a volcanic clast that seems an <b>effusive</b> igneous <b>rock,</b> probably a basalt. The analysis with thin sections gave us more information about depositional environments. The “Calcari del Tiarfin” formation are typical rocks of reef zone, therefore during Middle Triassic a carbonatic platform was active. The presence of a basal breccias confirms the reef zone, but is possible that this rocks have been formed into an upper slope zone. The “Calcari Rossi ad Ammoniti del Monte Clapsavon” formation was deposed during the latemost Anisian to Late Ladinian; these limestones derives from a pelagic environment, that means the platform was pulled down by extensional tectonic activity, until the drowning of the platform. The presence of Wengen Formation indicates the following passage to open basin conditions, with heavy terrigen and volcanogenic contribution. Usually the Livinallongo Formation is stratigrafically lower then Wengen Formation; in Forcella Chiana the Livinallongo Formation is absent because is replaced by “Calcari Rossi ad Ammoniti”, which is stratigrafically equivalent...|$|R

The coordinates for Troughton???s geological map were estimated using Google Earth imagery. Bibliography on leaves [69]- 72 Reconnaissance geologic mapping has generated new information on the stratigraphy, paleontology, and structure of the rocks near Asunci??n Bay and adjacent regions, Baja California, Mexico. Emphasis is placed on the Cenozoic rock formations and fossils. Rocks of the Asunci??n Bay region range from Early (?) Jurassic ultramafic rocks to well-preserved Late Pliocene to Pleistocene marine terraces. Middle Jurassic basement rock comprises {{a large portion of the}} outcrop within the study area; the headlands of Punta San Pablo, San Roque, and Asunci??n and the Sierra de Vizca??no consist of tonalite, mafic-ultramafic <b>rocks,</b> and <b>effusive</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> of basaltic and andesitic composition. Potassium/argon age determinations indicate the tonalite is Middle to Late Jurassic in age (154. 1 ?? 1 m. y.). The volcanic rocks of the basement terrane may be genetically related to the plutonic rocks and possibly were generated during subduction of the oceanic crust beneath the continental margin. The Valle Formation of Late Cretaceous age, consists of sandstones, siltstones, and conglomerates resting unconformably on an irregular basement terrane. The basal beds are generally conglomeratic dolomitic biosparrudites containing abundant fragments of shallow-water organisms. The conglomerate is dominated by rhyolite porphyry clasts possibly derived from the Alisitos island-arc of Aptian-Albian age. The Cretaceous rocks are unconformably overlain by the Tortugas Formation of Middle to Late Miocene age. The Tortugas Formation consists of volcaniclastic sandstones, bentonites and siliceous shales. The Miocene strata are richly fossiliferous and contain a diverse assemblage of mega-invertebrates, marine mammalian remains, sharks teeth, and foraminifera. The Tortugas Formation is overlain unconformably by the Almejas Formation of Middle to Late Pliocene age. Fossil bivalves are abundant in some horizons of the Almejas Formation. Based on faunal similarities, the Almejas Formation is correlated with the San Diego Formation of Alta California. A major portion of the study area is covered by thin, slightly west sloping, Late Pliocene to Pleistocene marine terraces. These ancient strand lines occur up to 4 or 5 kilometers inland and form an unbroken sequence stepping down to the present shoreline. Tertiary volcanic rocks of the study area include flood basalts, pyroclastic rock, dikes and sills. Potassium/argon determinations give an age for the flow of Mesa de Auras as 13. 12 ?? 3. 2 m. y. Mesozoic northwest trending structural features gave way to Cenozoic extensional tectonic features during mid-Tertiary time. The Tertiary sedimentary depositional basins are dilational features caused by stretching of the crust, when the East Pacific Rise encountered the continent during Neogene time...|$|R
40|$|Hard rock {{aquifers}} for {{the purpose}} of this Paper mean the non-carbonate, fractured rock aquifers in the terrain covered by crystalline basement complex, metamorphic rocks and also by extensive <b>effusive</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> like the basalts of western India (Deccan traps. Ground water development in hard rock aquifer areas has always played a secondary role compared to that in the areas having high-yielding unconsolidated or semi-consolidated sediments and carbonate rocks. This has been due to the relatively poor ground water resources in hard rocks, low specific capacity of wells, erratic variations and discontinuities in the aquifer properties, and difficulties in exploration and assessment of the resource. It should, however, be remembered that for the millions of farmers in developing countries, having their small farms in the barren landscape of fractured hard rock terrain, whatever small supply available from these poor aquifers is the only hope for upgrading their standard of living by growing irrigated crops or by protecting their rain-fed crops from the vagaries of rainfall. It is also their only source for drinking water for the family and cattle. In many developing countries, hard rock hydrogeologists have therefore, an important role to play. In the developed countries, the interest in hard rock hydrogeology, apart from drinking water supplies to small communities, is recently promoted by the prospects of using these low permeability rocks for the storage of hazardous nuclear and chemical wastes. The study of ground water flow through faults, fissures and fractures is also of interest to scientists studying the migration of contaminants. Hard rock hydrogeologists, the world over, are therefore divided into two main groups: Those interested in obtaining ground water for domestic, irrigational or industrial use by exploring fractured and permeable zones in a relatively less permeable matrix of hard rock and those interested in locating impermeable or the least permeable zones for storage of hazardous nuclear waste. Ironically, for the first group even the most permeable zones are often not good enough to yield adequate water supply, while for the second group even the least permeable zones are often not good enough for safe storage of hazardous nuclear waste over a prolonged period of a few hundred years. This Paper discusses the occurrence of ground water and the precautions for sustainable development of ground water in arid and semi-arid regions, in view of the forthcoming climatic changes. It emphasizes the need for recharge augmentation hand-in-hand with development of new wells, so that the new development does not harm the traditional practices. In India, the neglect of recharge augmentation has caused lowering of water table and drying-up of old dug-wells of 12 m to 15 m depth, which used to provide irrigational and drinking water supply for last several centuries. In Iran, many Qanats have dried up because of lowering of water table due to heavy pumping of ground water from newly developed deep tube-wells in their vicinity. The goal in many countries has, therefore, shifted from ground water development to ground water management which includes management of the quantity on Supply side and Demand side and also the management of ground water quality, especially with respect to pollution and salt water intrusion. Pollution of ground water in urban environment is becoming a cause of worry because in many developing countries there is a heavy migration of population from rural areas to urban centers and providing safe quality of drinking water to this population and managing the waste water generated in the cities and towns, is a major problem. The role of UNESCO-IUGS-IGCP Project GROWNET (Ground Water Network for Best Practices in Ground Water Development in Low Income Countries) is also described towards the end of this Paper.
