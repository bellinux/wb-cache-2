In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E

In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime.

Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E

Since 1880 British cavalrymen had been armed with only carbines and swords, although some carried a lance; it was not until 1903 that the cavalry were issued rifles, the same ones used {{by the rest of the}} army. The regular cavalry regiments were considered so poor in quality that General Sir Redvers Henry Buller, commanding the advance into Northern Natal, left his six cavalry regiments behind at Ladysmith, trusting in the irregular mounted forces to carry out patrols in their stead.|$|E

In order to avoid epiphenomenalism, one who believes that qualia are nonphysical would need to embrace something like interactionist dualism; or perhaps emergentism, the claim that there are as yet unknown causal relations between the mental and physical.

25|$|Physical process {{models of}} channel reaches are {{generally}} well understood and will calculate {{the depth and}} area of inundation for given channel conditions and a specified flow rate, such as for use in floodplain mapping and flood insurance. Conversely, given the observed inundation area of a recent flood and the channel conditions, a model can calculate the flow rate. Applied to various potential channel configurations and flow rates, a reach model can contribute to selecting an optimum design for a modified channel.

25|$|How far these snakes {{can strike}} has been controversial. Obviously this {{depends on the}} size of the animal, but other factors may also play a role, such as the species, the {{position}} of the body, and the degree of excitement. Additionally, the question of definition exists: from which point on the snake should a strike be measured: from the front, the middle, or the back of the anchor coil on the ground? Even if the length of the specimen is known, once it strikes, it is almost impossible to determine the limiting point reached by its head and the position of its body when the movement started. Therefore, it is not surprising that many conflicting statements can be found in the available literature about how far these snakes can strike. Estimates have been given that range from one-third of the body length, to half, three-quarters or even the full length of the animal. They rarely strike further than half of their body length, and almost never more than three-fourths, but that it is still not wise to trust such values <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> it is not possible to accurately judge the length of a coiled snake.|$|E
25|$|Riccardo Eugenio Drigo {{was born}} in Padua, Italy on 30 June 1846. His father Silvio Drigo was a {{barrister}} and his mother, a noble Lupati, was active in politics. None of Drigo's family was distinguished in music, but {{at the age of}} five he began taking his first piano lessons from a family friend, the Hungarian Antonio Jorich. Drigo excelled quickly, and by his early teens he attained some local celebrity as a pianist. His father eventually agreed to allow Drigo to attend the prestigious Venice Conservatory, where he studied under Antonio Buzzolla, a student of Gaetano Donizetti. Drigo scored his first compositions in his early teens, which were primarily romances and waltzes. In 1862 he was allowed to perform some of his pieces with the local amateur orchestra in Padua. Through this performance, the young Drigo began to show interest in conducting. Drigo's first major opportunity as a conductor occurred in 1868 when the Garibaldi Theatre's kapellmeister fell ill {{on the eve of the}} first performance of Costantino Dall'Argine's 1867 comic opera I Due Orsi (The Two Bears). When the concertmaster refused to conduct the performance, he recommended Drigo, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> the rehearsal pianist would know the score intimately.

40|$|The desire-satisfaction {{theory of}} welfare says {{that what is}} {{basically}} good for a subject is the satisfaction of his desires. One challenge to this view is the existence of quirky desires, such as a desire to count blades of grass. It {{is hard to see}} why anyone would desire such things, and thus hard to believe that the satisfaction of such desires could be basically good for anyone. This suggests that only some desires are basically good when satisfied, and that desire satisfactionists owe us an account of which desires these are, and why. In "Quirky Desires and Well-Being," Donald Bruckner proposes such an account: a desire is welfare-relevant (i. e., such that its satisfaction would be basically good for its subject) <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> and <b>because</b> its subject could describe its object {{in a way that makes}} it comprehensible what about the object attracts him or appeals to him. We are inclined to view quirky desires as welfare-irrelevant because we assume that their objects cannot be described in such a way. But if there were a quirky desire whose object could be so described by the subject whose desire it is, then this desire would be relevant to that subject's welfare. I will argue that while Bruckner's view delivers plausible verdicts about the cases to which it is meant to apply, its account of what makes a desire welfare-relevant is unmotivated and implausible. Desire satisfactionists can retain what is plausible about his view while endorsing a better explanation of why welfare-relevant desires have that status if they accept the following account instead: a desire is welfare-relevant <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> and <b>because</b> something about its object attracts, or appeals to, the subject who has the desire...|$|R

40|$|The adrenostatic {{effect of}} {{metyrapone}} (Metopiron®) and aminoglutethimide (Orimeten®) was assessed retrospectively in ten patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, {{four of them}} with the ectopic form. Five patients received metyrapone only, the other five both metyrapone and aminoglutethimide. Persistent lowering of the serum cortisol level was achieved in all, after an observation period of two weeks to four years. The intended therapeutic level of below 16 µg/ 100 ml was achieved in seven patients. In the course of treatment there was a rise in mean plasma ACTH concentration, but without an »escape« phenomenon.

40|$|Sino-European trade {{relations}} have been controversially discussed mainly, <b>if</b> not <b>only,</b> <b>because</b> {{of the increasing}} European Union's bilateral trade deficit with China. As from the European perspective trade with China becomes more important, the structural adjustment process of the Chinese economy from inter-ndustry to intra-industry trade is not as intensively discussed. We show how the emergence of China on the world markets has affected European comparative advantages over time. The change in bilateral trade is compared to the overall development of European comparative advantages to highlight {{the features of the}} structural change in China. We show that China is increasingly specialising in technology intensive goods. This development is absolutely in accordance with the historical perspective on country's upgrading in technology while integrating into the world economy. Technology intensive Schumpeter goods are either of a mobile or an immobile type based on the selection criterion of separating research and production process. While China predominantly focuses on the mobile type of Schumpeter goods, the European Union maintains its comparative advantages in immobile technology intensive goods, which are harder to imitate. Based on technology intensity, the second issue presented in the paper focuses on the Chinese integration into the world-wide value-added chain, which has been fragmented across borders in recent years.
