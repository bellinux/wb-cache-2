25|$|A power {{amplifier}} is an amplifier designed primarily {{to increase the}} power available to a load. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, {{as well as the}} inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20dB might have a voltage gain of 20dB and an available power gain of much more than 20dB (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47kΩ <b>input</b> <b>socket</b> for a {{power amplifier}}. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (<b>input)</b> <b>sockets</b> of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|R

40|$|We are {{presenting}} the Python framework ‚ÄúPyphant‚Äù {{for the creation}} and application of information flow models. The central idea {{of this approach is}} to encapsulate each data processing step in one unit which we call a worker. A worker receives <b>input</b> via <b>sockets</b> and provides the results of its data processing via plugs. These can be connected to other workers' sockets. The resulting directed graph is called a recipe. Classes for these objects comprise the Pyphant core. To implement the actual processing steps, Pyphant relies on third-party plug-ins which extend the basic worker class and can be distributed as Python eggs. On top of the core, Pyphant offers an information exchange layer which facilitates the interoperability of the workers, using Numpy objects. A third layer comprises textual and graphical user interfaces. The former allows for the batch processing of data and the latter allows for the interactive construction of recipes. This paper discusses the Pyphant framework and presents an example recipe for determining the length scale of aggregated polymeric phases, building an amphiphilic conetwork from an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) phase mode image...|$|R

40|$|As {{miniaturization}} {{of computer}} components is approaching {{the limits of}} physics, researchers in computer architecture are looking for less conventional means to perpetuate Moore's law. Recent trends in hardware ve been adding more cores. Consequently multicore machines are now commodity. To help programmers benefit from Moore's dividend, researchers in programming techniques, tools and languages have been exploring several venues. A dominant theme is the design and implementation of parallel algorithms. Several programming models have been proposed, but none at the moment seem to be substantially better than others. While general parallel programming is a distinctively challenging task, we believe that scientific computation algorithms display algebraic structures, thanks to the rich mathematical objects they manipulate. The present work aims at exploring {{the extent to which}} algebraic properties displayed by computer algebra algorithms may be automatically exploited to take advantage of parallelism in the OpenAxiom scientific computation platform. We designed a runtime system that exploits the ubiquitous parallelism of modern CPUs; the system is also scaled to many-system clusters. By taking advantage of the existing InputForm domain in OpenAxiom and connecting of the standard <b>input</b> channel to <b>sockets,</b> we were able to minimize potentially hazardous modifications to the OpenAxiom source while still implementing desired functionality. Additionally, we designed and implemented FFI extensions to the OpenAxiom core to take advantage of SIMD instructions, particularly SSE 2 (SIMD Streaming Extensions). The extension allowed us to nearly double the speed of common operations such as multiplying arrays of doubles. We also defined and implemented a foreign function interface for the OpenAxiom system. All of these additions were benchmarked using Berlekamp's algorithm for factorization of polynomials over integers. While much still remains to be done in parallelizing the algebra to work over many calculation nodes, mathematical annotations remain viable in unloading the burden of parallelizing code from the programmer by substituting a simpler activity...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium {{production}} {{is accompanied by}} formation of ecologically dangerous gases (HF, SO 2, CO, etc). There is offered the method of purification of waste gases from ecologically dangerous components. This method is concluded in their adsorption on nepheline mud, which is alumina production waste from nepheline ore. Nepheline mud is formed during the leaching from sintered material of sodium alluminate, whereupon it has a highly developed surface, similar to the zeolite surface. Dicalcium silicate (Ca 2 SiO 4) is the basis (85 %) of nepheline mud. Nepheline mud contains 3. 5 % of iron oxides, which, together with highly-developed surface, gives it the catalytic properties. Dicalcium silicate can react with flourhydric acid and sulphur acids with formation of fluorite and calcium sulphate. Adsorptive and catalytic abilities of nepheline mud were investigated by anode gas drawing from Söderberg electrolyzers threw the mud layer in the socket (70 mm diameter) with the rate of 8 l/min. The socket contained 300 g of dry nepheline mud. 21 testings were carried out (2 hours each). The total volume of the gas, drawn threw the socket, was 20 260 l. The composition of HF, SO 2 and СО in gases at the input and output of the socket was analyzed. The following averaged results were obtained according to the carried out testings. The content of HF in gases was reduced from 428 at the <b>input</b> of the <b>socket</b> to 4. 9 mg/m 3 at {{the output of the}} socket (98. 85 % of HF were adsorbed by mud). Content of SO 2 was reduced from 730 to 36. 3 mg/m 3 (95 % was adsorbed). As a result of the catalytic properties of nepheline mud, and the process of oxidation of carbon monoxide, its content in gases was reduced from 5960 to 46. 5 mg/m 3 (approximately by 100 times). The offered method may be used by aluminium plants for anode gas purification and for deep gas purification from harmful impurities before their atmospheric emission...|$|R
