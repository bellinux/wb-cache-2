5|$|As {{one of the}} {{earliest}} of the Church fathers whose works have survived, he {{is the subject of a}} significant amount of recent academic work, focusing on among other things, his exegesis of scripture, his Logos-theology and pneumatology, the relationship between <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> and non-Christian philosophy and his influence on Origen.|$|E
5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E
5|$|Born in Trier to {{a middle-class}} family, Marx later studied {{political}} economy and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became stateless and {{spent much of}} his life in London, England, where he continued to develop <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, of which the two most well-known are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto and the three-volume Das Kapital. His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic and political history.|$|E
5000|$|During his presidency, Eisenhower would {{frequently}} write {{personal and}} revealing letters to Hazlett even during his most busy periods. Usually {{never one to}} openly share his feelings, Eisenhower would pour <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> and concerns into these letters. The letters addressed <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> on topics as diverse as, [...] "Vietnam, the Middle East, civil rights, defense spending, {{and the problem of}} who would succeed him as president." [...] Thus, Eisenhower's letters to Hazlett serve as a window into <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> on <b>his</b> own presidency.|$|R

5|$|The main {{thrust of}} William Paley's {{argument}} in Natural Theology is that God's {{design of the}} whole creation {{can be seen in}} the general happiness, or well-being, that is evident in the physical and social order of things. This sets the book within the broad tradition of the Enlightenment's natural theology; and this explains why Paley based much of <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> on John Ray (1691), William Derham (1711) and Bernard Nieuwentyt (1750).|$|E
5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and <b>his</b> <b>thought.</b> However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{do not possess}} an {{intrinsic}} interest in freedom. Therefore, owning or using nonhuman animals is not, in itself, unjust. This aspect of <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> has generated responses by others, including the political theorist Robert Garner and the philosopher John Hadley, who argue {{that there may be}} reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do possess an interest in freedom. Cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's picture of a political animal rights, explicated in their 2011 book Zoopolis. Though Donaldson and Kymlicka have defended their account against Cochrane's criticism, they have said that they welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own. Cochrane's other research focusses variously on bioethics, punishment, just war and human rights.|$|E

5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} and personalities {{featured in the}} game directly correspond to real life venues and people—for example, blogger Brian Pigeon is mentioned {{as one of the}} Hatoful world's most influential writers, and the aforementioned Torimi Café, featured in-game as a location where the protagonist can work during summer vacation, is an actual bird-themed café located in Kobe. Likewise, some aspects of Hatofuls narrative reference real world events, media, or people: the deadly H5N1 pandemic forming the basis of the game's post-apocalyptic setting was inspired by historical outbreaks of disease, most prominently the 1918 flu pandemic; depictions of Hitchcock's Winter, the in-universe war between humans and birds, bear several similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds; and Operation Carneades—the codename given to the human countermeasure against H5N1 that instead granted intelligence to birds in the Hatoful universe—was named after Greek philosopher Carneades and one of <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> experiments, the Plank of Carneades.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final entry in the Uncharted series, , was showcased at E3 2014, during Sony's press conference. A trailer {{features}} a wounded Drake washing ashore an island. He rises, grabs his gun, and checks its ammo before walking into a jungle-like area, as the camera pans to show hanging cages with skeletons inside. The trailer also features a conversation between Drake and Sully, where Drake asks for Sully's help, having seemingly just laid out a plan. Sully warns Nate against it, but Nate responds {{that he has no}} choice, and asks if he can count on Sully one last time, who confirms that he can. A Thief's End takes place three years after the events of Drake's Deception. Drake has retired from fortune hunting, and is seemingly still married to Elena, as he still wears his ring in the trailer, but is dragged back into the profession by <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> dead older brother, Sam Drake (voiced by Troy Baker), after the latter discovers a lead to the semi-mythical anarchist colony of Libertalia and with it, the possible location of the treasure stolen by the legendary pirate captain Henry Avery.|$|E

25|$|Foucault's {{theories}} primarily {{address the}} relationship between power and knowledge, {{and how they are}} used as a form of social control through societal institutions. Though often cited as a post-structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels, preferring to present <b>his</b> <b>thought</b> as a critical history of modernity. <b>His</b> <b>thought</b> has influenced academics, especially those working in sociology, cultural studies, literary theory and critical theory.
