5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts.

25|$|Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland) Camp Comic â€“ Spike {{was born}} on 12 September (year unknown) and brought up in Edgbaston with his {{childhood}} sweetheart Brenda, {{the daughter of the}} local butcher. After leaving school he gained a good position in the Income Tax office, but resigned in 1959 and joined the entertainment staff at Maplins. It is not known how long he had known Ted, but they were already well-acquainted by the time they travelled on the train to the camp and it was suggested that it was Ted who got Spike the job. Spike shared a chalet with Ted, and there were many humorous scenes between the pair in their chalet, such as Spike being kept awake by Ted's snoring. Spike often tried to branch out into his own style of comedy, designing and making his own costumes and funny sequences. These received mixed reactions from the campers, but Ted criticised almost all of them. Spike was a very honest and law-abiding man, and was {{the only member of the}} entertainment staff who didn't run his own scheme to scam the campers for money. Although he was loyal to Ted and willing to turn a blind-eye to his schemes, he was often shocked at the lengths Ted would go to in order to make money. Spike had to make an impossible choice between his job and the woman he loved during the 1959 season, when his girlfriend, Brenda, said she would marry him only if he gave up his job and went to work for her father's business. He chose his job and ended their relationship. During the 1960 season he became involved with April, one of the new Yellowcoats. At the same time, Spike also fell in love with Gladys, but this never amounted to anything. He continued his relationship with April, and she wanted him to leave Maplins and go back to the tax office so they could <b>get</b> <b>married</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a steady income. As with Brenda, he again decided against this in favour of show business. Spike's immediate intentions after the 1960 season were left unknown, though he revealed he was going to join Ted over Christmas playing a Chinese policeman in a pantomime. It was also implied that he had resumed his affair with April.|$|E

In the final verse, she even dreams {{about how her}} life would be {{if there were a}} mistake in her birth control and she became pregnant. However, she contrasts this with her commitment to music and No Doubt. Stefani describes her relationship as unhealthy because of this disparity, comparing herself to [...] "a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight." [...] She ultimately decides that settling down is just a fantasy for her since her freedom and independence is more important for her.|$|E
500|$|While the {{marriage}} of Iravan's parents is mentioned in the first book of the Mahabharata, Adi Parva (the Book of Beginnings), both the birth and death of Iravan are mentioned later, in the sixth book, Bhishma Parva (the Book of Bhishma). In this sixth book of the epic, Arjuna, the third Pandava brother, is exiled from Indraprastha (the capital city of the Pandava kingdom) {{to go on a}} one-year pilgrimage as a penance for violating the terms of his marriage to Draupadi, the Pandava brothers' common wife. Arjuna reaches the north-east region of present-day India and falls in love with Ulupi, a widowed Naga [...] princess. The two <b>get</b> <b>married</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a son named Iravan; later, Arjuna proceeds with his pilgrimage, leaving Iravan and Ulupi behind in Nagaloka, the abode of the Nagas.

Iravan grew up in Nagaloka, protected by his mother, but was rejected by his maternal uncle because of the latter's hatred of Arjuna.

While battling Father, Edward loses his automail arm, rendering him unable to perform alchemy. Alphonse transmutes his soul in order to restore Edward's original flesh-and-blood arm.

2500|$|The sonnet {{begins with}} the speaker expressing lament to youth with [...] "O that you were yourself!" [...] More simply, the speaker deplores that youth isn't {{absolute}} and permanent, and with [...] "yourself", the speaker is referring to the figure of youth's soul. Following this, the speaker address the youth as [...] "love", further developing the speaker's theme of adoration and personal affection for youth. From there, the speaker tells this youth that [...] "you are / No longer yours, than you yourself here live", saying that the youth's identity is constantly fading away from him as he ages, {{as if he is}} unbecoming himself. With the lines [...] "Against this coming end you should prepare / And your sweet semblance to some other give", the speaker is simply saying that the youth's life is slipping away day after day, and if he doesn't <b>get</b> <b>married</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> children, he will lose his identity to his death. Continuing from this idea, the speaker says [...] "So should that beauty which you hold in lease / Find no determination; then you were / Yourself again after yourself's decease, / When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear", all meaning that whatever beauty the youth still has is only temporary (leased to him) and will be lost, unless he has children who continue the legacy and identity of his youthful beauty even after death. Continuing with [...] "Who lets so fair a house fall to decay," [...] the speaker refers to the youth as this [...] "house" [...] in reference to his fair body and his fair lineage. Adding to this, the speaker continues on with [...] "Which husbandry in honour might uphold, / Against the stormy gusts of winter's day / And barren rage of death's eternal cold?". [...] These lines suggest that by taking up marriage and becoming a husband and a father, the youth might be able to maintain his essence of youth against the devastations of time and age. This, the speaker compares to storms and winter, ending with the threat of the eternal nature of death, at which point the youth would be too late in renewing himself. In the ending couplet, the speaker mirrors his starting wail of lament in line 1 with [...] "O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know, / You had a father: let your son say so." [...] Here, the speaker is separating the youth figure he adores from those he considers foolish, or [...] "unthrifts", and connects that to the youth's inheritance, suggesting that only [...] "unthrifts" [...] would ignore their inheritance of life and youth and deny their own fathers' wish for continued lineage and legacy.|$|E

6000|$|It is time, however, to draw this {{rambling}} {{narrative to}} a close. Several days were passed by me, {{in the way}} I have attempted to describe, in almost constant, familiar, and joyous conversation with Scott; {{it was as if}} I were admitted to a social communion with Shakespeare, for it was with one of a kindred, if not equal genius. Every night I retired with my mind filled with delightful recollections of the day, and every morning I rose with the certainty of new enjoyment. The days thus spent, I shall ever look back to, as among the very happiest of my life; for I was conscious at the time of being happy. The only sad moment that I experienced at Abbotsford was that of my departure; but it was cheered with the prospect of soon returning; for I had promised, after making a tour in the Highlands, to come and pass a few more days {{on the banks of the}} Tweed, when Scott intended to invite Hogg the poet to meet me. I took a kind farewell of the family, with each of whom I had been highly pleased. If I have refrained from dwelling particularly on their several characters, and giving anecdotes of them individually, it is because I consider them shielded by the sanctity of domestic life; Scott, on the contrary, belongs to history. As he accompanied me on foot, however, to a small gate on the confines of his premises, I could not refrain from expressing the enjoyment I had experienced in his domestic circle, and passing some warm eulogiums on the young folks from whom I had just parted. I shall never forget his reply. [...] "They have kind hearts," [...] said he, [...] "and that is the main point as to human happiness. They love one another, poor things, which is every thing in domestic life. The best wish I can make you, my friend," [...] added he, laying his hand upon my shoulder, [...] "is, that when you return to your own country, you may <b>get</b> <b>married,</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a family of young bairns about you. If you are happy, there they are to share your happiness--and if you are otherwise--there they are to comfort you." ...|$|E
