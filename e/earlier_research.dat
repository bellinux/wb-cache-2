5|$|Since 1988, {{participation}} in Australia Day has increased, and in 1994 all states and territories began {{to celebrate a}} unified public holiday on the actual day for the first time. Research conducted in 2007 reported that 27.6% of Australians polled attended an organised Australia Day event and a further 25.6% celebrated with family and friends, making Australia Day the largest annual public event in the nation. This reflected {{the results of an}} <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> project where 66% of respondents anticipated that they would actively celebrate Australia Day 2005.|$|E
5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{has been}} the subject of {{research}} into possible medicinal applications. Experiments in the 1980s concluded that two glucans isolated from the species showed potent antitumour properties when used on mice artificially implanted with Sarcoma 180 tumours. This was despite the conclusion of <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> indicating that, while aqueous extracts from several other fungal species had antitumour effects, extracts from A.auricula-judae did not. Further, research on genetically diabetic mice showed that a polysaccharide extracted from A.auricula-judae had a hypoglycemic effect; mice fed with food including the polysaccharide showed reduced plasma glucose, insulin, urinary glucose and food intake.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{have studied the}} {{surviving}} Pipe rolls, using them {{as the basis for}} study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the <b>earlier</b> <b>research.</b> Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|Wheeler and {{the brigade}} arrived in Italy on 20 November, and {{proceeded}} through the Italian Riviera to reach Caporetto, {{where it had}} been sent to bolster the Italian troops against a German and Austro-Hungarian advance. As the Russian Republic removed itself from the war, the German Army refocused its efforts on the Western Front, and so in March 1918 Wheeler's brigade was ordered to leave Italy, getting a train from Castelfranco to Vieux Rouen in France. Back on the Western Front, the brigade was assigned to the 2nd Division, again part of Julian Byng's Third Army, reaching a stable area of the front in April. Here, Wheeler was engaged in artillery fire for several months, before the British went on the offensive in August. On 24 August, in between the ruined villages of Achiet and Sapignies, he led an expedition which captured two German field guns while under heavy fire from a castle mound; he was later awarded the Military Cross for this action. Wheeler continued as part of the British forces pushing westward until the German surrender in November 1918. He was not demobilised for several months, instead being stationed at Pulheim in Germany until March; during this time he wrote up his <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> on Romano-Rhenish pottery, making use of access to local museums, before returning to London in July 1919.|$|E

25|$|To break non-steckered Enigma {{machines}} (those {{without a}} plugboard), Knox (building on <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> by Hugh Foss) developed a system known as 'rodding', a linguistic {{as opposed to}} mathematical way of breaking codes.

Knox worked in 'the Cottage', {{next door to the}} Bletchley Park mansion, as head of a research section, which contributed significantly to cryptanalysis of the Enigma.|$|E

These were not encyclopedias in the contemporary sense, and can be better described as worldbooks, for they attempt to provide a relatively complete presentation of knowledge about the world.|$|E
25|$|Most of Boas's {{students}} {{shared his}} concern for careful, historical reconstruction, and his antipathy towards speculative, evolutionary models. Moreover, Boas encouraged his students, by example, to criticize themselves as much as others. For example, Boas originally defended the cephalic index (systematic variations in head form) as a method for describing hereditary traits, but came to reject his <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> after further study; he similarly came to criticize his own early work in Kwakiutl (Pacific Northwest) language and mythology.|$|E
25|$|Other {{research}} provides {{support for}} memory of text being improved by musical training.

Memory was also enhanced for pairing brands with their proper slogans if the advertising incorporated lyrics and music rather than spoken words and music in the background.|$|E

25|$|The {{contingency}} {{approach to}} leadership {{was influenced by}} two <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> programs endeavoring to pinpoint effective leadership behavior. During the 1950s, researchers at Ohio State University administered extensive questionnaires measuring a range of possible leader behaviors in various organizational contexts. Although multiple sets of leadership behaviors were originally identified based on these questionnaires, two types of behaviors proved to be especially typical of effective leaders: (1) consideration leader behaviors that include building good rapport and interpersonal relationships and showing support and concern for subordinates and (2) initiating structure leader behaviors that provided structure (e.g., role assignment, planning, scheduling) to ensure task completion and goal attainment.|$|E
25|$|In his {{retirement}} Briggs returned to research, establishing {{a laboratory for}} studying fluids under negative pressure at the National Bureau of Standards. This topic was directly related to his <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> in the water uptake of plants. In one famous experiment he measured the negative pressure (or tension) that would break a column of water held in a capillary tube by capillary action. It turned out that at room temperature the maximum attainable tension in water was 250 bar and in mercury nearly 500 bar. This was published in several papers between (1950–1953), and the 1950 paper remains a classic and is still regularly cited {{in the literature on}} metastable water.|$|E

In addition, he pointed out that the 95% or higher probability of a shot from the grassy knoll referred only to random noise (which all <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> acknowledges), while the impulse could have been something else. He identifies it as speech, ignoring that the analysis that the impulse is from a shot is based on timing of echos.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Sir Peter Medawar was {{appointed}} Mason Professor of Zoology at the university. His work involved investigating {{the phenomenon of}} tolerance and transplantation immunity. He collaborated with Rupert E. Billingham and they did research on problems of pigmentation and skin grafting in cattle. They utilized skin grafting to differentiate between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. Taking the <b>earlier</b> <b>research</b> of R. D. Owen into consideration, they concluded that actively acquired tolerance of homografts could be artificially reproduced. For this research, Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He left Birmingham in 1951 and joined the faculty at University College London, where he continued his research on transplantation immunity. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Parthian art is {{also present}} in Syria, in many cities such as Palmyra, Edessa and Dura Europos. Not all of the {{specimens}} belonged specifically to the Parthians. In the north, this art seems to have flourished in Armenia, although little remains. In the south, Bahrain clearly followed the Parthian art form, while in the east the transition to Gandhara art is gradual and therefore difficult to draw a clear line. In <b>earlier</b> <b>research,</b> which looked at the Greek art of Classical Greece as an ideal, Parthian art was often dismissed as decadent and barbaric art. Recent research, however, sees this differentiated. Parthian art had many creative and original methods and works, and was an influential form especially for Byzantine Art and Medieval art.|$|E
