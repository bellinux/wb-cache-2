25|$|A {{number of}} {{overseas}} re-makes {{have also been}} produced. A Dutch version aired for one series in 1995, entitled Wat schuift't? (What's <b>it</b> <b>worth?).</b> <b>The</b> Trotters were renamed the Aarsmans and it starred Johnny Kraaykamp jnr. as Stef (Del), Sacco Van der Made as Grandad and Kasper van Kooten as Robbie (Rodney), and was shown on RTL 4. A Portuguese re-make, O Fura-Vidas, a local expression for someone who lives outside the law, ran for three series from 1999 to 2001. It was a literal translation of the British version, with all episodes based on the originals. It centred on the Fintas family, who live in Sapadores, a neighbourhood in Lisbon, and starred Miguel Guilherme as Quim (Del), Canto e Castro as Grandad, and Ivo Canelas as Joca (Rodney). In this Portuguese version the Reliant's equivalent was a 1988 Suzuki Super Carry. A Slovenian re-make, called Brat bratu (Brother to Brother), was broadcast from 2008 to 2009. All episodes {{were based on the}} original British storylines, and it was made in co-operation with John Sullivan. It featured brothers Brane (Brane Šturbej) and Bine (Jure Drevenšek), who moved from Maribor to Ljubljana. The series also stars Peter Ternovšek as Grandad. It was directed by Branko Đurić. The series was cancelled after thirteen episodes due to poor ratings.|$|E

500|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth {{received}} generally favorable reviews, but {{was also}} often criticized for being buggy and inaccessible for many players because of its high difficulty. GameSpy ranked it as the tenth best game of E3 2004 while GameSpot nominated it for their [...] "Most Surprisingly Good Game of 2005" [...] award, with a comment that [...] "after a development cycle that was nearing infinity, it's {{hard to imagine a}} world where this H.P. Lovecraft-based horror game turned out all right. Luckily for us, we don't have to imagine it." [...] According to IGN, the game [...] "succeeds brilliantly in some areas," [...] making [...] "great use of the source material" [...] and forcing players [...] "to accept some realistic responsibility for their character" [...] due to the sanity system and HUD-less display, but can make the players [...] "cringe at the difficult nature of the game." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot opined [...] "a thick, unsettling atmosphere fills this ambitious first-person action-adventure, which makes up for some frustrating moments and dated graphics with plenty of chills, variety, and originality." [...] Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith called it [...] "one of the greatest book to game translations ever" [...] and a game [...] "that is full of twists, turns and incredibly wonderful scary surprises. It's got a great atmosphere which is sustained by dark and grainy graphics, chilling sound effects and an incredibly improbable storyline that is treated properly as to suspend reality from creeping in and ruining your experience." [...] GameSpy's Allen Rausch wrote [...] "this disturbing slice of Lovecraft's America is well worth the time to visit," [...] as [...] "despite the occasional missteps, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a more than fitting tribute to its literary inspiration." [...] Similarly, Kyle Williams of Gaming Target called it [...] "a labor of love" [...] that [...] "defies convention in favor of creating a videogame experience that is a worthy heir to the Lovecraft name." [...] Team Xbox's Matthew Fisher wrote that, despite some of the game's various shortcomings regarding the graphics and some of the detective aspects, [...] "this is an immersive experience that is a new and unique title for the Xbox, which is more than a welcome change. Was <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> wait? Absolutely." [...] Despite the mostly positive reviews, the game was a commercial failure.|$|E

Although Creelman devotes the vast majority of his writing to admiring Díaz as an individual, aside from the regime, Creelman is sure to also point out the perceived flaws of the Porfiriato: the restricted press, the feudal-like hacienda system, the infrastructural needs outside of major cities (and in major cities), the brutal administration of justice for trivial or political causes, the general neglect for rural Mexico, and the forced migration of Indian populations outside of their native lands. On his treatment towards the Indians, Díaz states that “they are accustomed to look to those in authority for leadership instead of thinking for themselves. That is a tendency they inherited from the Spaniards, who taught them to refrain from meddling in public affairs and rely on the Government for guidance.” ...|$|E

[...] Chuck Campbell of Scripps News was very positive, writing that the self-titled project [...] "sounds like the work of an old pro. On 'Delta,' Goodrem packs the honest and uplifting qualities of her mentor, Olivia Newton-John, plus the stylized bombast of Celine Dion, the sense of adventure of Madonna, the introspection of Alanis Morissette and the vocal stunts of Mariah Carey. Brandy McDonnell of NewsOK was mixed, writing that Goodrem [...] "boasts a lovely clear voice, but the uneven and slickly produced album, clearly designed to appeal to mainstream radio, doesn't do much to separate her from the Natasha Bedingfields and Colbie Caillats already crooning over the airways," [...] but went on to praise the [...] "'pop jewels' among all the sludge and rocks to make <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> effort to sift through it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} in communicating with Fertig and his command, because of the makeshift radio Almendres had built, a submarine, loaded with military and medical supplies, was eventually sent to Mindanao, arriving on 5 March 1943. It also carried two Americans who had known Fertig in the Philippines. One was Charles Smith, who on 4 December 1942, had escaped with two other Americans and two Filipinos by sailing a small boat to Australia, perhaps, at that time, the longest open-boat voyage since Captain Bligh's. Smith was now a captain in U.S. Army Intelligence. The other was Charles Parsons, formerly a businessman but now serving as a lieutenant commander in U.S. Navy Intelligence. In addition to his other pre-war business interests in Manila, Parsons had represented Panama as its resident counsel. When the Japanese occupied Manila, Parsons was careful to speak only Spanish and convinced the Japanese he was a citizen of Panama. As a result, the Japanese eventually sent Parsons and his family on a long journey [...] "back to Panama," [...] but when the Swedish ship carrying them docked in New York, and before he could report to U.S. intelligence, FBI agents came aboard the ship and quietly asked Parsons {{who he was and}} quickly hustled him and his family ashore. However, another source states that Parsons reported to U.S. intelligence in the Canal Zone after the ship docked in Panama. [...] It was simply a matter of diplomatic honor that no one in either the German, Italian or other legations, who knew Parsons' true citizenship status, exposed his masquerade to the Japanese. Their role, as Smith and Parsons immediately explained to Fertig, was to verify that he was actually leading a resistance movement and, if so, was <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> risk of men and supplies to support him.|$|E
