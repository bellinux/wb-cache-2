The 1949 edition included a quote from Mark Twain: [...] "Travel is fatal to prejudice", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotton Seiler puts it, [...] "here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter." [...] Green commented in 1940 that the Green Book had given black Americans [...] "something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro." [...] Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: [...] "Where will you spend the night?" [...] As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs. The listings focused on four main categories– hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving {{the name and address}} of each business.

50|$|Four very {{accomplished}} {{artists were}} employed to tackle this extensive project. The lion's share of work was done by Jan Moninckx: 273 sheets bear his signature. Maria Moninckx, his daughter, produced 101 paintings.

The heraldic arms of Huydecoper and Commelin, painted by Jan Moninckx, were used to decorate volume 1 of the Atlas. In 1749 there {{was an attempt to}} expand the collection. This 9th volume consisted of a mere five aquarels, one by Dorothea Storm-Kreps and four by Jan Matthias Cock.

40|$|Nowadays, using Email as a {{media of}} {{communication}} {{is a common}} phenomenon. For example, in PT Maspion, most of the import administration activities such as contacting the suppliers have been using Email as the instrument. This phenomenon interest the writer to investigate the -mail styles along with the functions from the East Asian suppliers of PT. Maspion (the Japanese, the Koreans, the Chinese, and the Taiwanese. After collecting categorizing, and analyzing the data, the writer found that the Japanese’ styles are consultative in the directive function, casual in the referential functions and intimate in the expressive function. The Koreans’ and the Chinese styles are consultative in the referential, phatic or directive functions, and casual in the expressive and or directive functions. The Taiwanese only use the casual style {{in all kinds of}} language functions. It is found out that no frozen and formal styles are used in their mails. This might indicate that the East Asians prefer using informal language in e-mails to formal one, such as consultative, casual and intimate styles. Those styles use incomplete sentences, non-standard vocabularies and shortened forms of grammar, the characteristics that do not belong to formal language. It is also found that many mistakes on grammars are made by the East Asian Principals, as shown <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> <b>typing.</b> This is a sufficient finding to conclude that their styles are not formal. Finally, the writer expects that other researcher would try to examine the language styles used by other parts of regions such as Europe, Australia, America and Middle east with various topics, including import administration. The writer also would like to offer her assistance to provide the permitted data from the company where she works to every body interested in this kind of research...|$|R
5000|$|The Age {{masthead}} (nameplate) {{has received}} a number of updates since 1854. The most recent update to the design was made in 2002. The current masthead features a stylised version of the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom and [...] "The Age" [...] <b>in</b> Electra <b>Bold</b> <b>type.</b> The crest features the French words Dieu et mon droit ("God and my right"). According to The Age's art director, Bill Farr: [...] "No one knows why they picked the royal crest. But I guess we were a colony at the time, and {{to be seen to}} be linked with the Empire would be a positive thing." [...] The original 1854 masthead included the Colony of Victoria crest. In 1856, that crest was removed and in 1861, the royal coat of arms was introduced. This was changed again in 1967, with the shield and decoration altered and the lion crowned. <b>In</b> 1971, a <b>bold</b> typeface was introduced and the crest shield rounded and less ornate. In 1997, the masthead was stacked and contained in a blue box (with the logo in white). In 2002, in conjunction with an overall revamp of the paper, the masthead was redesigned in its present form.|$|R
