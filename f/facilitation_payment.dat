40|$|This S. J. D. {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} role of law in challenging and curbing public corruption in Nigeria {{through the use of}} anti corruption agencies and laws. A comparative approach is used that draws upon development from other jurisdictions to illuminate issues in the Nigerian context. More broadly, this S. J. D. dissertation examined and analyzed the major anti corruption agencies and laws in Nigeria (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission, Code of Conduct Bureau) and their approach towards corruption and democratic process. I also examined the role Freedom of Information Law plays in curbing corruption and promoting transparency, twelve years after the Freedom of Information Bill was first presented to the Nigerian National Assembly, it was finally passed into law May, 2011. The main text of this dissertation is comprised of an introductory chapter that defines corruption and related concepts. The next chapter sets the tone of Nigeria as a nation leading into the Nigerian legal system and their jurisdiction in hearing corruption cases. Chapter five introduces the anti corruption agencies in Nigeria, past and present. Chapter six deals with United States of America’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), its effects on Nigeria and the controversy caused by the exception of FCPA Act called <b>facilitation</b> <b>payment.</b> The last chapter analyzes the present anti corruption agencies and their laws, proffering recommendations and also the Freedom of Information law in Nigeria while drawing developments from India’s Right to Information Act and South Africa’s Promotion of Access to Information Act. ...|$|E
40|$|This compendium, {{compiled}} by UNODC and PricewaterhouseCoopers, looks at what {{companies in the}} Fortune 500 Global Index (2008) are doing to fight corruption. It highlights a range of measures, and different approaches. While there is no one-size-fits-all, businesses should not go below international standards contained in the United Nations Convention against Corruption. For example, a <b>facilitation</b> <b>payment</b> is simply another term for a bribe, yet some companies allow them up to certain threshold or under certain circumstances - or even consider them tax deductible. Some companies provide whistleblowers full anonymity, others promise that such employees will not be exposed to retaliation. Greater harmonization is needed, in line with international standards, to protect businesses and their employees against corruption. Having collected existing practices, {{the next step is}} to highlight good practices and have them widely applied. That means that leaders and managers must set the tone from the top by enforcing a zero-tolerance policy, and checks and balances must be put in place to strengthen integrity and minimize wrong-doing. The Third session of the Conference of the States Parties to the UN anti-corruption Convention, to be held in Doha in November 2009, is a golden opportunity to strengthen corporate responsibility in line with the world 2 ̆ 7 s only universal anti-corruption instrument. The private sector has a lot to lose from corruption, and has considerable leverage to stop it. Based on the experience collected in this report, companies should be in a better position to do their part to say "NO" to corruption...|$|E

40|$|Since 1995, the anti-corruption {{movement}} has had success {{in developing a}} global legal framework to combat transnational bribery and corruption. A distinguishing feature of the current anti-corruption movement is its emphasis on the economic cost of corruption and {{the involvement of the}} international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and regional development banks, in the efforts to combat corruption. As part of their efforts to combat corruption, international financial institutions have made effective anti-corruption reforms a prerequisite for future allocation of funds. The current anti-corruption {{movement has}} also been successful in enlisting the participation of sectors of international and domestic civil society, as well as the business community, through integrity pacts and codes of conduct. Notwithstanding its relative success, the current anti-corruption movement faces serious hurdles as incidences of transnational corruption keep rising. On a philosophical level, the economic repackaging of the problem of corruption has made the anti-corruption effort more acceptable by excluding any explicit moral judgments that may lead to charges of moral or legal imperialism; however, the re-packaging is proving to be inadequate given the irrefutable moral and ethical dimension of corruption. Increasingly, scholars of international business ethics, as well as anti-corruption advocates, are emphasizing a “virtues’’ approach to combating corruption. The failure of the anti-corruption movement may also contribute to the de-legitimization of the “science” of economics. On a more practical level is the difficulty of distinguishing among different categories of illicit payments, such as a <b>facilitation</b> <b>payment</b> that can be legal; a bribe, which is illegal, and maintaining a favorable climate payment, which may be legal or illegal. Finally, the current anti-corruption movement must address the legacy of colonialism and its impact on how developing countries view anti-corruption efforts. For centuries, corruption has been associated with the East and anti-corruption with the West. Making free markets, rule of law, and democratic reforms a part of the anti-corruption campaign may lead to the perpetuation of the rule of geographical morality and the imposition of Western values. To some, this approach opens the anti-corruption movement to charges of neo-colonialism...|$|E

Published by Oxford University Press] and the definite version is available at : [URL] The Journal's website is at: [URL] article published on behalf of The International Society for Quality in Health Care. First published online: 11 July 2008 Objective This study assesses the links between service quality and patient satisfaction in the context of health services delivered to children in a developing country. With the growing importance of patients' voice in the healthcare environment, it is important to assess the factors that are best able to explain patient satisfaction to influence the art and science of patient care and health service delivery. Design A field survey was conducted using a household survey to assess the quality of services provided to children who had been to a hospital in the past 12 months. Participants Caregivers who had accompanied an afflicted child to a hospital in Dhaka City. Main outcome measures Patient satisfaction was the main outcome/dependent variable as reflected in surrogate measures obtained from the children's accompanying caregivers. Results A regression model was tested. The independent variables were nurse composite, doctor composite, tangibles, health inputs and <b>facilitation</b> <b>payments.</b> The model explained 67. 4 % of the variation in the dependent variable (R 2). The behavior of nurses had the greatest impact on satisfaction (P < 0. 001) as reflected in the standardized betas, followed by the behavior of doctors (P < 0. 001). <b>Facilitation</b> <b>payments</b> had a negative effect on satisfaction (P < 0. 01). Conclusions Bringing about attitude change among doctors, nurses and support staff is vital for improving children's satisfaction with hospital care. Installing proper recruitment procedures, training, supervision, and reward systems are most likely to facilitate this change. But similar changes are also needed elsewhere: in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, other facilitating ministries, as well as the development partners to achieve enduring and positive effects.

40|$|Abstract. Over {{the past}} decade, {{a new global}} regime of anti-corruption has taken shape. Pushed by NGOs such as Transparency International, and with coalitions of {{international}} organizations, Western governments, and private business circles, {{we now have a}} framework of conventions and regulations that impel governments and international firms to act with integrity and to prevent corruption in business and international development. New anti-bribery laws reward whistleblowers and penalize firms whose employees are caught bribing foreign governments or paying <b>facilitation</b> <b>payments.</b> Yet conventions must be enforced. Statements of good intention are not enough. Governments and firms must show the world that they are actually implementing these new regulations and conventions and establishing anti-corruption programs. We have entered the Age of Compliance. What does compliance look like? How do organizations, firms and countries ‘perform’ compliance? How do they make compliance ‘real’. How do we know that the transparency of compliance practice is not simply a vacuum? Based on fieldwork with various actors in the anti-corruption industry, including Transparency International, this paper describes the elements of the emerging compliance regime...|$|R

40|$|The impropriety {{principle}} {{is a central}} legal standard that should {{be determined by the}} courts in light of the prevailing ethical and moral perceptions in the society. To decide whether an advantage is undue, the preparatory work mentions some factors that {{should be part of the}} assessment: the economic value of the advantage, the giver and receiver’s positions and their relationship, whether there is a public official involved, the purpose of the advantage, whether there has been transparency, whether internal guidelines or business practices have been breached, and finally the fundamental value behind the clause. The deed would also have to be clearly blameworthy 1. It seems as though the element that is emphasized by the court is whether the active briber intends to influence the passive briber. If an advantage is meant to influence the receiver it would naturally be perceived as an undue advantage. This is illustrated in the verdict where a man tried to bribe two police officers with 500 kroner, and was convicted of corruption 2. The same is illustrated in the Ruter verdict 3, where the operations manager was acquitted among other because he could prove that the dinners were not treated to influence him. A similar argument is found in the Unibuss case 4, where a defendant received “undue advantages”, but was not a decision-maker and consequently could not reciprocate. Since the changes in the Penal Code in 2003 corruption in the private and the public sector has been punishable by the same clause, § 276 a (continued as § 387 in the 2005 Penal Code), but there is still a practical difference to the two. As illustrated in verdicts such as the Ruter verdict, Unibuss and the Ullevål case 5 situations involving public means or people representing public companies are subject to stricter moral standards and regulations. This means that not only public officials directly, but also people with similar positions of power and people managing public means, can be subject to the same standards as public officials. Trading in influence and corruption are two quite similar offenses, yet the maximum penalty for trading in influence is 3 years imprisonment, while gross corruption can be penalized by 10 years imprisonment. The difference between the two is therefore important to notice. The offence is described similarly in the legislation; however trading in influence involves a third party that might not even know that he is involved. Sordid corruption is when you bribe someone to influence them, while when guilty of trading in influence, you bribe someone to influence an external third party. In the Yara verdict the court stated that a situation cannot necessarily be characterized as trading in influence when the advantage is not paid directly to the decision maker. Corruption also includes indirect advantages, cf. the wording “for himself or others” in the Penal Code § 276 a (§ 387 in 2005 code) 6. The real difference between trading in influence and sordid corruption is not in the assessment of the impropriety principle, but rather which group of people it applies to. The Taxation Act forbids deduction for both representation and bribes, and therefore there is no clear distinction between the two 7. We find that the lack of a clear boundary might not be problematic according to the Taxation Act, however it constitutes a problem when businesses are trying to avoid the “grey area” according to the Penal Code. Customer relationship management can be crucial for many businesses, and better guidelines on the matter may prevent many of the minor cases of corruption. This view is supported by NHO 8. <b>Facilitation</b> <b>payments</b> have not been mentioned much in the preparatory work to the Penal Code, and according to the OECD convention the members are only obliged to incriminate <b>facilitation</b> <b>payments</b> by or towards foreign public officials. In the preparatory work the Department has stated that <b>facilitation</b> <b>payments</b> are to be considered as corruption as long as the advantage given in “undue”. That is, the legal standard in § 387 applies. When deciding whether the advantage is undue, one should also consider whether the situation can be categorized as black mail. In that case legal action should be made with caution 9. Based on our findings, we have made a practical guide on where the line is drawn relating to different scenarios in chapter 12 in this paper. It is important to note that this is just an indication based on preparatory work, jurisprudence and other legal theory, and that it is only the court that can decide whether an advantage is undue or not...|$|R
50|$|The {{ethical issues}} {{associated}} with honesty are widespread and vary greatly in business, from the misuse of company time or resources to lying with malicious intent, engaging in bribery, or creating conflicts of interest within an organization. Honesty encompasses wholly the truthful speech and actions of an individual. Some cultures and belief systems even consider honesty to be an essential pillar of life, such as Confucianism and Buddhism (referred to as sacca, part of the Four Noble Truths). Many employees lie {{in order to reach}} goals, avoid assignments or negative issues; however, sacrificing honesty in order to gain status or reap rewards poses potential problems for the overall ethical culture organization, and jeopardizes organizational goals in the long run. Using company time or resources for personal use is also commonly viewed as unethical because it boils down to stealing from the company. The misue of resources costs companies billions of dollars each year, averaging about 4.25 hours per week of stolen time alone, and employees' abuse of Internet services is another main concern. Bribery, on the other hand, is not only considered unethical is business practices, but it is also illegal. In accordance with this, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was established in 1977 to deter international businesses from giving or receiving unwarranted payments and gifts that were intended to influence the decisions of executives and political officials. Although, small <b>payments</b> known as <b>facilitation</b> <b>payments</b> will not be considered unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act if they are used towards regular public governance activities, such as permits or licenses.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, typical {{measures}} of corruption have been broad, composite indices {{which are often}} meant to measure overall corruption level in a country. In this thesis I study how different types of corruption can have different effects on development, measured by GDP growth, GDP per capita growth and GDP per capita. Thereby, I {{wanted to see if}} some types of corruption could be concluded as more damaging than others. I have discussed and empirically tested the consequences of corruption in public procurement, at political levels, and bureaucratic corruption in terms of <b>facilitation</b> <b>payments.</b> The literature review points to that corruption can lead to higher transaction costs, uncertainty in the economy, and inefficient economic outcomes. The level of corruption and the quality of institutions are closely linked, and the quality of institutions is important to development in several aspects. In general, the effects of corruption which are especially damaging to development are the misallocation of resources and lower quality of the goods and services. From the empirical investigation, all types of corruption included had a negative effect on GDP per capita growth. The perception-based estimates of bureaucratic corruption tend to have the strongest negative effect on different {{measures of}} GDP, while procurement corruption tends to have the weakest effect of the three. However, given that the measures of bureaucratic and political corruption are indices, while the measure of procurement corruption only corresponds to one single question, there is reason to suspect that the two former measures of corruption captures a broader dimension of corruption than the latter. An interesting result is that procurement corruption seems to be less correlated with the measure of the quality of institutions than the two other measures of corruption. This finding suggests that the existence of procurement corruption is less affected by the quality of institutions, and therefore, that this type of corruption also is likely to be found in well-developed countries...|$|R
