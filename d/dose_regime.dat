The high MDMA <b>dose</b> <b>regime</b> and the amphetamine treatment both produced acute hyperactivity and hyperthermia. Twelve weeks later, all rats were tested in the drug-free state on a battery of anxiety tests (elevated plus maze, emergence and social interaction tests). A further 2 weeks later they were tested on a novel object recognition memory task. Rats previously given the neurotoxic dose of MDMA showed greater anxiety-like behaviour on all three anxiety tests relative to both controls and D-amphetamine-treated rats. Rats given the moderate MDMA <b>dose</b> <b>regime</b> also showed increased anxiety-like behaviour on all three tests, although {{to a lesser extent}} than rats in the high dose group. In the object recognition task, rats given the high MDMA <b>dose</b> <b>regime</b> showed impaired memory relative to all other groups when tested at a 15 -min delay but not at a 60 -min delay. Rats previously exposed to amphetamine did not differ from saline controls in the anxiety or memory tests. These data suggest that moderate to heavy MDMA exposure over 48 h may lead to increased anxiety and memory impairment 3 months later, possibly through a neurotoxic effect on brain serotonin systems.

40|$|Purpose: Cystic {{fibrosis}} patients often develop chronic infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). PA forms biofilms {{which will}} lead to reduced antibiotic (AB) susceptibility. Instead of using planktonic bacteria as a model to test susceptibility, we developed and tested a more representative in vitro model using PA biofilms. Methods: PA biofilms were grown in 96 -well plates and quantified with crystal violet staining followed by VIS- absorption. Different parameters were evaluated {{to come to a}} reproducible method to form and quantify PA biofilms. With the optimised model susceptibility to Tobramycin sul- fate (TS) and various ABs and AB-combinations was determined. In a 3 days <b>dose</b> <b>regime</b> experiment TS (1. 5; 3; 6 /ig/ml) was used 3 times daily against 4 PA strains (1 ATCC and 3 laboratory strains).

40|$|Abstract Background Costs of {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF) are high, which {{is partly due to}} the use of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is usually administered in a standard dose. However, due to differences in ovarian reserve between women, ovarian response also differs with potential negative consequences on pregnancy rates. A Markov decision-analytic model showed that FSH dose individualisation according to ovarian reserve is likely to be cost-effective in women who are eligible for IVF. However, this has never been confirmed in a large randomised controlled trial (RCT).

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the structural and compositional changes in NiFe/Au bilayers induced by a focused ion beam (FIB) is presented. NiFe/Au bilayers with different thickness were irradiated with a focused 30 keV Ga+ ion beam, and the evaluation of the individual layers and interfaces were investigated systematically as a function of a broad range of irradiation fluence using grazing incidence x ray reflectivity (GIXRR) and angular dependent x ray fluorescence (ADXRF) techniques carried out at synchrotron radiation sources. Experimental data were collected from 1. 3 mm[*]×[*] 4. 5 mm structures, and irradiation of such a broad areas with a 100 -nm-wide focused ion beam is a challenging task. Two irradiation regimes were identified: For Ga+ fluences[*]<[*] 15. 6 [*]×[*] 1014 ion/cm 2 (low <b>dose</b> <b>regime),</b> the main influence of the focused ion beam is on the interface and, beyond this dose (high <b>dose</b> <b>regime),</b> sputtering effects and ion implantation becomes significant, eventually causing amorphization of the bilayer system. The broadening of the NiFe/Au interface occurs even at the lowest dose, and above a critical fluence (Φ[*]=[*] 1. 56 [*]×[*] 1014 ion/cm 2) can be represented by an interfacial-intermixed layer (NixFeyAu(1 -x-y); x[*]=[*] 0. 5 - 0. 6, y[*]=[*] 0. 1 - 0. 15) formed between the NiFe and Au layers. The thickness of this layer increases with irradiation fluence in the low <b>dose</b> <b>regime.</b> A linear relationship is found between the squared intermixing length and irradiation fluence, indicating that FIB-induced mixing is diffusion controlled. The ballistic model fails to describe FIB-induced intermixing, indicating that thermodynamical factors, which might be originated from FIB specific features, should be taken into account. Despite the complexity of the chemical and structural formation, good agreement between the experiment and theory highlights the functionality of the combined GIXRR and ADXRF techniques for studying intermixing in high resolution...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{ambulatory}} {{peritoneal dialysis}} (CAPD) peritonitis causes substantial morbidity and consumes scarce healthcare resources. The costs oftreating peritonitis {{extend beyond the}} cost of antibiotics alone. Outpatient care is less costly for patients not requiring admission on clinical grounds. Complex multicomponent regimes consume more patient, medical, nursing, and pharmacy time. Repeated injections into dialysate bags are generally undesirable. An optimal outpatient regime should maximize patient convenience, confidence, and compliance by incorporating the least possible number of drugs and doses that do not compromise therapeutic efficacy. Current therapeutic practice (1 - 3) favors an initial combination regime ofintraperitoneal (IP) antibiotics with activity against both gram-positive and gramnegative pathogens. The combination of vancomycin and ceftazidime produces good cure rates (4, 5). Vancomycin has been successfully used (primarily for gram-positive infections) in an intermittent IP <b>dose</b> <b>regime.</b> The pharmacokinetics of a single IP bolus have been studied in noninfected (6, 7) and infected (8, 9) CAPD patients.

40|$|Clopidogrel is a {{recently}} introduced platelet ADP receptor antagonist, {{belonging to the}} thienopyridine derivatives, like its analogue ticlopidine. Its potential advantage is to be safer than ticlopidine. At 75 mg/od clopidogrel significantly inhibits platelet aggregation in ambulatory patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease and it prevents the recurrence of ischemic events more efficiently than aspirin. Its adequate dose in more acute situations remained to be determined. Therefore, sixty two patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned in four groups treated, within 24 h after coronary artery bypass graft, by clopidogrel 50 mg/od, 75 mg/od or 100 mg/od or by ticlopidine 250 mg/bid which was considered as the reference. The tolerance of clopidogrel was fairly good during the whole period of the study. Bleeding time and ex-vivo platelet aggregation induced by ADP 2 microM and 5 microM were performed at day - 1, + 9 and + 28 after surgery. Like ticlopidine, the three dose levels of clopidogrel significantly inhibited ex-vivo platelet activity and prolonged the bleeding time at day 28. However, unlike ticlopidine, the inhibitory effects of clopidogrel were not significant at day 9, especially with 75 mg/od, a dose which was found to significantly protect patients in a chronic situation.

40|$|A {{pharmacokinetic}} (PK) model {{describes the}} absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a pharmaceutical, thus providing, once properly validated, quantitative {{predictions of the}} consequences of various dosing regimens. Pharmacological activity might be linked to properties of a time course for a particular compartment (such as half-life or area-under-curve, AUC), or directly modelled by coupling the PK model with a pharmacodynamic (PD) model of the physiological effect of the agent. Due to the high replication and mutation rates of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which ultimately results in strains resistant to any single agent, a multiple-agent strategy has to be adopted. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) uses two or more agents that target different components of the HIV replication cycle, but these agents typically produce adverse side effects in patients. A number of authors have applied techniques from nonlinear control to this problem, but in general the explicit link between the drug dose and the physiological effect, via the PK, is neglected so that the controls derived are continuous in time. In [1] the control problem is addressed via feedback linearization applied to a PD model of HIV dynamics. A single-compartment PK model is then used to estimate a <b>dosing</b> <b>regime</b> that gives rise to the required continuous control law. In [2] a fixed-point approach was taken to determine the doses required to obtain a particular AUC or target profile.
