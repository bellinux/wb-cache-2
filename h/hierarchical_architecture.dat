40|$|Abstract—The <b>hierarchical</b> <b>architecture</b> {{has been}} proven ef-fective for solving the {{scalability}} problems in large-scale ad hoc networks. The stability of the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>architecture</b> is {{a key factor in}} determining the network performance. Although many solutions have been proposed to construct stable clusters, the max-imum stability achievable in mobile environments is still unknown. In this paper, we define three metrics for measuring network stability: 1) the cluster lifetime; 2) the intercluster link lifetime; and 3) the end-to-end path lifetime. We model and analyze the maximum of these lifetimes under the constraint of random node mobility. Analytical results provide the fundamental understand-ing of the bounds on network stability. Inspired by this under-standing, we propose a clustering algorithm and a hierarchical routing protocol that work together to achieve the maximum net-work stability. The analytical results are verified by simulations. Index Terms—Clustering, <b>hierarchical</b> <b>architecture,</b> mobility, network topology, wireless ad hoc networks. I...|$|E
