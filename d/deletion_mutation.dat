5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. <b>deletion</b> <b>mutation</b> biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E

40|$|Laser-capture microdissection was {{coupled with}} PCR {{to define the}} {{mitochondrial}} genotype of aged muscle fibers exhibiting mitochondrial enzymatic abnormalities. These electron transport system (ETS) abnormalities accumulate with age, are localized segmentally along muscle fibers, are associated with fiber atrophy and may contribute to age-related fiber loss. DNA extracted from single, 10 µm thick, ETS abnormal muscle fibers, as well as sections from normal fibers, served as templates for PCR-based deletion analysis. Large mitochondrial (mt) DNA <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> (4. 4 – 9. 7 kb) were detected in all 29  ETS abnormal fibers analyzed. Deleted mtDNA genomes were detected only in the regions of the fibers with ETS abnormalities; adjacent phenotypically normal portions of the same fiber contained wild-type mtDNA. In addition, identical mtDNA <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> were found within different sections of the same abnormal region. These findings demonstrate that large <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> are associated with ETS abnormalities in aged rat muscle and that, within a fiber, <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> are clonal. The displacement of wild-type mtDNAs with mutant mtDNAs results in concomitant mitochondrial enzymatic abnormalities, fiber atrophy and fiber breakage...|$|R
25|$|The {{role of the}} N-terminus is {{revealed}} by using a <b>deletion</b> <b>mutation</b> of the N-terminal plug; the protein {{was still able to}} be inserted into the membrane, but acts as a non-selective pore for larger molecules, exhibited by increased permeability of the cell to maltotetraose, maltopentaose, ferrichrome, as well as several antibiotics including albomycin, vancomycin and bacitracin. However, this has to be treated with caution, as the conformation of the barrel may change {{in the absence of the}} N-terminal plug.|$|E
25|$|The other protein, TAS1R3, {{is present}} and {{identical}} {{to that of other}} animals, and the relevant taste buds are still present but inactive. Such a genetic marker found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a mutation in an early ancestor; as a <b>deletion</b> <b>mutation</b> it could not revert, and thus would be inherited by all descendants, as the evolutionary tree branched out. Some scientists now believe this is the root of the cat family's extremely specialized evolutionary niche as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favor of a high-protein carnivorous diet, which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.|$|E
25|$|Serious local errors {{can arise}} in {{homology}} models where an insertion or <b>deletion</b> <b>mutation</b> or {{a gap in}} a solved structure result in a region of target sequence {{for which there is}} no corresponding template. This problem can be minimized by the use of multiple templates, but the method is complicated by the templates' differing local structures around the gap and by the likelihood that a missing region in one experimental structure is also missing in other structures of the same protein family. Missing regions are most common in loops where high local flexibility increases the difficulty of resolving the region by structure-determination methods. Although some guidance is provided even with a single template by the positioning of the ends of the missing region, the longer the gap, the more difficult it is to model. Loops of up to about 9 residues can be modeled with moderate accuracy in some cases if the local alignment is correct. Larger regions are often modeled individually using ab initio structure prediction techniques, although this approach has met with only isolated success.|$|E
40|$|Background: Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} {{is the most}} common neuromuscular disease of childhood caused by <b>deletion</b> or point <b>mutations</b> in the dystrophin gene. Though the importance of <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> in the dystrophin gene causing DMD have been reported worldwide, no data available from rural population of Maharashtra. Objectives: This study specifically aimed at the investigation of <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> in the DMD gene from the patients from South-Western Maharashtra. Material & Methods: Fifty patients with clinically diagnosed DMD were analyzed to screen for intragenic deletions in 21 exons within the DMD gene using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results: Amongst the 50 unrelated DMD patients from South-Western Maharashrra we found DMD gene deletions in 47 cases which represent 94...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhile the {{deletion}} of an {{amino acid}} {{is a common}} mutation observed in nature, it is generally thought to be disruptive to protein structure. Using a directed evolution approach, {{we find that the}} enzyme TEM- 1 β-lactamase was broadly tolerant to the <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> sampled. Circa 73 % of the variants analysed retained activity towards ampicillin, with <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> observed in helices and strands as well as regions important for structure and function. Several deletion variants had enhanced activity towards ceftazidime compared to the wild-type TEM- 1 demonstrating that removal of an amino acid can have a beneficial outcome...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{mismatch}} repair {{is thought to}} act through two subpathways involving the recognition of base-base and insertion/deletion mispairs by the Msh 2 -Msh 6 heterodimer and the recognition of insertion/deletion mispairs by the Msh 2 -Msh 3 heterodimer. Here, through genetic and biochemical approaches, we describe a previously unidentified role of the Msh 2 -Msh 3 heterodimer in the recognition of base-base mispairs and the suppression of homology-mediated duplication and <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations.</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae msh 3 mutants did not show {{an increase in the}} rate of base substitution mutations by the CAN 1 forward mutation assay compared to the rate for the wild type but did show an altered spectrum of base substitution mutations, including an increased accumulation of base pair changes from GC to CG and from AT to TA; msh 3 mutants also accumulated homology-mediated duplication and <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations.</b> The mutation spectrum of mlh 3 mutants paralleled that of msh 3 mutants, suggesting that the Mlh 1 -Mlh 3 heterodimer may also {{play a role in the}} repair of base-base mispairs and in the suppression of homology-mediated duplication and <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations.</b> Mispair binding analysis with purified Msh 2 -Msh 3 and DNA substrates derived from CAN 1 sequences found to be mutated in vivo demonstrated that Msh 2 -Msh 3 exhibited robust binding to specific base-base mispairs that was consistent with functional mispair binding...|$|R

[...] A hemizygous <b>deletion</b> or <b>mutation</b> of the STS gene in a male results in {{complete absence of}} enzyme activity, while a female carrier of a <b>mutation</b> or <b>deletion</b> is heterozygous and still has a normal copy of the STS gene.

40|$|Insertion {{mutations}} previously constructed {{within the}} proximal {{region of the}} yeast invertase signal sequence did not interfere with secretion or glycosylation of the enzyme. We now describe <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> within the same signal sequence. Large deletions truncating the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide prevented both secretion and glycosylation of the enzyme and increased the intracellular concentration of nonglycosylated invertase. This increase was coupled {{with the appearance of}} a new invertase polypeptide, 2 kilodaltons larger than cytoplasmic invertase. The new polypeptide was consistent in size with uncleaved (signal peptide intact) pre-secretory invertase previously identified by using in vitro translation (apparent molecular mass, 62 kilodaltons). The data on enzyme activity indicate that invertase whose secretion is aborted by large <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> augments the normal pool of cytoplasmic invertase found in sucrose-fermenting yeast cells...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} and {{significant}} demand for reliable, simple and sensitive methods for repeated scanning of a given gene or gene fragment for detection and characterization of mutations. Solid-phase sequencing by single base primer extension of nested GBATM primers on miniaturized DNA arrays {{can be used to}} effectively scan targeted sequences for missense, insertion and <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations.</b> This paper describes the use of N-GBA arrays designed to scan the sequence of a 33 base region of exon 8 of the p 53 gene (codons 272 - 282) encompassing a hot spot for mutations associated with the development of cancer. Synthetic DNA templates containing various missense, insertion and <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations,</b> as well as DNA prepared from pancreatic and biliary tumor cells, were genotyped using the exon 8 arrays...|$|R

It has additionally been found to be decreased in 58% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemai (AML).|$|E
40|$|The heterotrimeric RecBCD enzyme of Escherichia coli is {{required}} for the major pathway of double-strand DNA break repair and genetic exchange. Assembled as a heterotrimer, the enzyme has potent nuclease and helicase activity. Analysis of recC nonsense and <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations</b> revealed that the C terminus of RecC {{is required}} for assembly of the RecD subunit into RecBCD holoenzyme but not for recombination proficiency; the phenotype of these mutations mimics that of recD <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations.</b> Partial proteolysis of purified RecC polypeptide yielded a C-terminal fragment that corresponds to the RecD-interaction domain. RecD is essential for nuclease activity, regulation by the recombination hotspot Chi, and high affinity for DNA ends. The RecC-RecD interface thus appears critical for the regulation of RecBCD enzyme via the assembly and, we propose, disassembly or conformational change of the RecD subunit...|$|R
50|$|These methods involve {{altering}} gene length via insertion and <b>deletion</b> <b>mutations.</b> An {{example is}} the Tandem Repeat Inserstion (TRINS) method.

50|$|In addition, both securin and separase are well-conserved {{proteins}} (Figure 1). Note that separase cannot function without initially {{forming the}} securin-separase complex.
