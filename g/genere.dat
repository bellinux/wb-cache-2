5|$|The Kačić's {{family can}} be traced to the Pacta conventa, an {{agreement}} dating from 1102 (or later), according to which the Kačićs were one of the twelve Croatian noble tribes (genus) who accepted the Hungarian king Coloman as the new king of Croatia. They were represented by comes Juraj Kačić (Comittem Gurram de <b>genere</b> Chaçittorum). According to the Supetar Cartulary, they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in a case where the prior king died without leaving heirs.|$|E
5|$|The {{family name}} most likely {{derives from the}} Slavic kača (snake), the closest word to the name Kačić. Based on etymology, {{it is likely that}} the Hungarian Kačićs (Kacsics) are {{originally}} of Slavic rather than Hungarian origin. Latin sources also refer to the name as de <b>genere</b> Chacittorum, generatione Cacich, genus Chacittorum, nobiles de Cacich, Caçici, Cacicii, Cacicli, Caciki, Cazethi, Cazichi, Cazziki, Chacichi and Kazzeti. The Kačić name is distinct from the similar-sounding name of another noble family, Kašić (Chasich), and its derivations (Kasig, Kasige).|$|E

25|$|This <b>genere,</b> the {{offspring}} of the contradanza, was also danced in lines or squares. It was also a brisk form of music and dance in double or triple time. A repeated 8-bar paseo was followed by two 16-bar sections called the primera and segunda. One famous composer of danzas was Ignacio Cervantes, whose forty-one danzas cubanas were a landmark in musical nationalism. This type of dance was eventually replaced by the danzón, which was, like the habanera, much slower and more sedate.|$|E
25|$|Ghenadie's short rule {{witnessed}} few national events. It is however {{remembered as}} the time when Romania's royal family, a Hohenzollern branch, had its first born-Orthodox members: Ghenadie personally baptized Carol and Elisabeth, the children of heir-apparent Ferdinand. Once ordained Metropolitan, Ghenadie did not interrupt his activities as a scholar, and, in 1894, published Evangheliile. Studiu istorico-literar și Autenticitatea Evangheliilor în <b>genere</b> ("The Gospels. A Historical-Literary Study and On the Overall Authenticity of the Gospels"). He was still preoccupied with church art and architecture, and, in 1894, arranged {{for the restoration of}} Bucharest's Darvari Skete.|$|E
25|$|Except for {{the fact}} that he was not {{considered}} Roman, Odoacer's ethnic origins are not completely known. Both the Anonymus Valesianus and John of Antioch state his father's name was Edeko. However, it is unclear whether this Edeko is identical to one—or both—men of the same name who lived at this time: one was an ambassador of Attila to the court in Constantinople, and escorted Priscus and other Imperial dignitaries back to Attila's camp; the other, according to Jordanes, is mentioned with Hunulfus as chieftains of the Scirii, who were soundly defeated by the Ostrogoths at the river Bolia in Pannonia sometime in the late 460s. Since Sebastian Tillemont in the 17th century, all three have been considered to be the same person. In his Getica, Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the Turcilingi (Turc-ilingi or Torcilingorum rex). However, in his Romana, the same author defines him as a member of the Rugii (Odoacer <b>genere</b> Rogus). The Consularia Italica calls him king of the Heruli, while Theophanes appears to be guessing when he calls him a Goth.|$|E

500|$|Regardless of the {{inconsistent}} chapter headings across manuscripts, {{the work}} {{is made up of}} three distinct sections. The first of these deals with the concepts of procreation and generation, largely according to the doctrines of Aristotle and Galen.

500|$|While Monteverdi {{had looked}} {{backwards}} {{in the sixth}} book, he moved forward in the seventh book from the traditional concept of the madrigal, and from monody, in favour of chamber duets.

Of the duets which are the main features of the volume, Chew highlights [...] "Ohimé, dov'è il mio ben, dov'è il mio core", a romanesca in which two high voices express dissonances above a repetitive bass pattern. The book also contains large-scale ensemble works, and the ballet Tirsi e Clori. This was the height of Monteverdi's [...] "Marino period"; six of the pieces in the book are settings of the poet's verses. As Carter puts it, Monteverdi [...] "embraced Marino's madrigalian kisses and love-bites with... the enthusiasm typical of the period". Some commentators have opined that the composer should have had better poetic taste.|$|E

2500|$|Although in {{the first}} 30 years of the {{existence}} of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuits who were conversos (Catholic-convert Jews), an anti-converso faction led to the Decree de <b>genere</b> (1593) which proclaimed that either Jewish or Muslim ancestry, no matter how distant, was an insurmountable impediment for admission to the Society of Jesus.

2500|$|Agatha's origin is {{alluded to}} in {{numerous}} surviving medieval sources, but {{the information they}} provide is sometimes imprecise, often contradictory, and occasionally demonstrably false. The earliest surviving source, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, along with John of Worcester's Chronicon ex chronicis and its associated genealogical tables (sometimes named separately as Regalis prosapia Anglorum), Symeon of Durham (thaes ceseres maga) and Ailred of Rievaulx describe Agatha as a kinswoman of [...] "Emperor Henry", the latter explicitly making her daughter of his brother (filia germani imperatoris Henrici). Later sources of dubious credibility such as the Chronicle of Melrose Abbey call her daughter of Henry, while Matthew of Paris calls her the emperor's sister (soror Henrici imperatoris Romani). Geoffrey Gaimar in Lestoire des Engles states that she was daughter of the Hungarian king and queen (Li reis sa fille), although he places the marriage {{at a time when}} Edward is thought still to have been in Kiev, while Orderic Vitalis in Historiae Ecclesiasticae is more specific, naming her father as king Solomon (filiam Salomonis Regis Hunorum), even though he was actually a contemporary of Agatha's children. William of Malmesbury in De Gestis Regis Anglorum states that Agatha's sister was a Queen of Hungary (reginae sororem) and is echoed in this by Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, while, less precisely, Ailred says of Margaret that she was derived from English and Hungarian royal blood (de semine regio Anglorum et Hungariorum extitit oriunda). Finally, Roger of Howden and the anonymous Leges Edwardi Confessoris indicate that while Edward was a guest of Kievan [...] "king Malesclodus" [...] he married a woman of noble birth (nobili progenio), Leges adding that the mother of St Margaret was of Rus royal blood (ex <b>genere</b> et sanguine regum Rugorum).|$|E
