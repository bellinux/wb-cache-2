5|$|In 1978, Feynman sought medical {{treatment}} for abdominal pains and {{was diagnosed with}} liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer. Surgeons removed a tumor {{the size of a}} football that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February3, 1988. A ruptured <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine, he died on February15, 1988.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many aspects}} of Hubbard's life story are disputed, there is general {{agreement}} about its basic outline. Born in Tilden, Nebraska, {{he spent much of}} his childhood in Helena, Montana. He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father, an officer in the United States Navy, was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam. He attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C. {{at the start of the}} 1930s, before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories. He served briefly in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was an officer in the United States Navy during World War II, briefly commanding two ships, the USS YP-422 and USS PC-815. He was removed both times when his superiors found him incapable of command. The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cimetidine}} on the healing and recurrence of <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> and gastric ulcers were compared. The {{extent of the}} acid secreting areas was examined by the endoscopic Congo red methylene blue test. Using the extent of acid secreting areas gastric ulcers were classified into ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas. <b>Duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> were all associated with extensive acid secreting areas. The gastric acid outputs in the basal state and after maximal stimulation with gastrin were highest in <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers,</b> and lowest in gastric ulcers without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine treatment significantly promoted the healing of <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> and gastric ulcers with extensive acid secreting areas when compared with placebo, but not of the gastric ulcers without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine also significantly diminished the recurrence of <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers,</b> but not gastric ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas. These findings indicate that in Japan cimetidine promotes the healing of <b>duodenal</b> and gastric <b>ulcers</b> associated with high gastric acid production and prevents recurrence of <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers,</b> but {{has little or no}} influence on the healing and recurrence of gastric ulcers associated with low acid secretion...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{proportion}} of <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> {{not associated with}} Helicobacter pylori infection {{or the use of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is increasing. Aim: To identify the clinical and endoscopic characteristics of non-H. pylori, non-NSAID <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Methods: Clinical and endoscopic data and H. pylori status were prospectively collected from consecutive patients who underwent upper endoscopy from 1997 to 1999. Patients with <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> were identified, and those with non-H. pylori, non-NSAID <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> were analysed further. Results: A total of 11 717 upper endoscopies were performed in 8344 patients. Of these, 1153 (14 %) had <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Of 599 patients with active ulcers and known H. pylori status. 104 (17 %) had ulcers not associated with H. pylori or the use of NSAIDs, 393 (66 %) had ulcers associated with H. pylori alone, 51 (8. 5 %) had ulcers {{associated with the use of}} NSAIDs alone and 51 (8. 5 %) had ulcers associated with both. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of concomitant diseases (odds ratio = 15. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 8. 64 - 25. 9; P < 0. 001) and the absence of epigastric pain/discomfort (odds ratio = 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 29 - 0. 91 : P = 0. 022) were independent predictors for non-H. pylori, non-NSAID <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Conclusions: Non-H. pylori, non-NSAID <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> exhibit certain distinct clinical and endoscopic characteristics. The presence of concomitant diseases is an important predictive factor. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> prostrated him for some weeks. He {{returned}} to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E
5|$|He {{was again}} struck by {{depression}} in 1948 when Sir Alfred Thompson Denning and Sir John Singleton were both {{appointed to the}} Court of Appeal ahead of him, despite having been appointed to the High Court after him. On 30 July 1949, Birkett went to the Lord Chancellor and discussed the possibility of his appointment to the Court of Appeal, but left dissatisfied. On 14 November, a <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> perforated, from which he spent six months recovering. In an attempt to appease him, the Lord Chancellor offered Birkett a peerage without salary on 8 May 1950, but he refused as he lacked the means to survive without paid employment. While speaking {{at a conference in}} Washington, D.C. on 31 August 1950, he received a telegram from the Lord Chancellor offering him appointment to the Court of Appeal; he immediately wired back his acceptance. He was sworn in on 2 October, and heard his first case the following day.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E

40|$|Giant <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> are {{extensive}} ulcers, {{more than}} 2. 5 cm in diameter, that involve {{a large portion}} of the duodenal bulb. These atypical <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> create serious problems to the patient and the physician, are frequently complicated by bleeding and penetration, and have a high mortality rate. Most of the reported cases were classified as a severe variant of the common peptic ulcer disease, others were associated with the Zollinger Ellison syndrome. We report here four patients with giant <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> but with a different and definitive aetiology: hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion for liver metastase or primary hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|R
50|$|The {{duodenal}} bulb is {{the place}} where <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> occur. <b>Duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> are more common than gastric ulcers and, unlike gastric ulcers, are caused by increased gastric acid secretion. <b>Duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> are commonly located anteriorly, and rarely posteriorly. Anterior ulcers can be complicated by perforation, while the posterior ones bleed. The reason for that is explained by their location. The peritoneal or abdominal cavity is located anterior to the duodenum. Therefore, if the ulcer grows deep enough, it will perforate; whereas if a posterior ulcer grows deep enough, it will perforate the gastroduodenal artery and bleed.|$|R

25|$|There is a {{protective}} effect of alcohol consumption against active infection with H. pylori In contrast, alcohol intake (comparing those who drink > 30g of alcohol per day to non-drinkers) is {{not associated with}} higher risk of <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Excessive alcohol consumption seen in alcoholics is a known risk factor for pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Antiproliferative {{actions on}} bone marrow and GI tissue: Due to the drug's {{preference}} for rapidly proliferating tissues, bone marrow depression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, or even rarely agranulocytosis) may occur. Aplastic anemia {{has also been}} seen. Bone marrow toxicity can be irreversible and may cause death, particularly in immunocompromised patients. GI toxicity may be severe or rarely fatal and consists of anorexia, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer,</b> GI hemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|After his resignation, Mannerheim bought Kirkniemi Manor in Lohja, {{intending}} {{to spend his}} retirement there. In June 1946, he underwent an operation for a perforated peptic ulcer, and in October of that year {{he was diagnosed with}} a <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> In early 1947, it was recommended that he should travel to the Valmont Sanatorium in Montreux, Switzerland, to recuperate and write his memoirs. Valmont was to be Mannerheim's main residence for the remainder of his life, although he regularly returned to Finland, and also visited Sweden, France and Italy.|$|E

40|$|This open study tested whether {{eradication}} of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) heals <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> {{as well as}} decreasing recurrence. H pylori was detected in patients with endoscopic <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> by histology, CLO-test, culture, and 13 C-urea breath test (13 C-UBT). Tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (120 mg) and amoxycillin (500 mg) each four times daily, were given for seven days, with 400 mg metronidazole {{five times a day}} on days 5 - 7. The 13 C-UBT was repeated immediately after treatment and endoscopy repeated within 21 days. After treatment unhealed ulcers were reinspected one month later and healed ulcers followed up by 13 C-UBT alone for 12 months. Of 45 patients, 44 were available for follow up. Mean pretreatment excess delta 13 CO 2 excretion was 25. 6 per mil, which fell to 2. 4 per mil immediately after finishing treatment, indicating clearance of H pylori in every patient. At the second endoscopy (median interval 20 days from start of treatment) 33 of 44 (75 %) <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> had healed. Ten of the remaining 11 <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> were smaller and those 10 healed {{in the next two weeks}} with no further treatment. Two patients' ulcers that initially healed with clearance of H pylori recurred three weeks later (both had metronidazole resistant H pylori). H pylori was eradicated in 28 of 44 (64 %) patients (13 C-UBT negative for median follow up 10. 2 months). Overall 41 of 43 (93 %, 95 % confidence intervals 81 %- 99 %) <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> were healed at one month. This study suggests that one week of anti-H pylori triple treatment is effective in healing <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Nizatidine is used {{to treat}} <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers,</b> gastric ulcers, and {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (GERD/GORD), and to prevent stress ulcers.|$|R
25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{symptoms}} {{in relation to the}} meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum. <b>Duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> pain would manifest mostly 2–3hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{looked at}} the proposition that Stevens was unfit for command {{on the evening of}} the incident due to illness (a <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer),</b> drunkenness or a combination of the two, and that the description of the collision in Spicer's report and the conclusions drawn from it were inconsistent with events. Stevens' ulcer had previously hospitalised him, and he had concealed its recurrence from the RAN. There was evidence that Stevens had been served a triple brandy earlier in the night, and a post-mortem conducted on Stevens' body showed a blood alcohol level of 0.025%, though the significance of this figure was challenged by expert witnesses. The hearings lasted 85 days, and the Burbury Report was released publicly on 25 February 1968. It found that Stevens was medically unfit for command, although not impaired by alcohol {{at the time of the}} collision. Consequently, some of the findings of the first commission— those based on the assumption that Voyager was under appropriate command—required reevaluation. Robertson and the other officers of Melbourne were absolved of blame for the incident.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple of}} weeks before Mötley Crüe was set to tour the New Tattoo album, Castillo became ill while {{performing}} with his mariachi side project Azul at the Cat Club in Hollywood. Immediately after the show Castillo took a cab to nearby Cedars Sinai Hospital where he collapsed as he was being admitted. The doctors discovered a <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> that had ruptured his stomach and performed emergency surgery that saved Castillo’s life. While taking time off from Mötley Crüe to recover from his surgery, he discovered a small lump on his jaw and a month later, after it had grown to roughly the size of a golf ball, he sought treatment and was diagnosed with Squamous cell Carcinoma, a common form of cancer that is not usually fatal if it is discovered early but can spread rapidly if left untreated. The cancer went into remission in mid-2001, and he was rumored to be rejoining Osbourne's solo band for that summer Ozzfest tour (along with Geezer Butler on bass), though these rumors were later revealed to be untrue.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> has dropped significantly {{during the last}} 30 years, while the {{incidence of}} gastric ulcers has shown a small increase, mainly caused by {{the widespread use of}} NSAIDs. The drop in incidence for <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> {{is considered to be a}} cohort-phenomenon independent of the progress in the treatment of the disease. The cohort-phenomenon is probably explained by improved standards of living which has lowered the incidence of H. pylori infections.|$|R
50|$|Both the {{esophagus}} and duodenum {{are also at}} risk for ulceration. Esophageal ulceration is partially prevented by {{the tone of the}} cardia sphincter to prevent reflux, as well as by saliva, which both washes {{the esophagus}} and contains mucins that can help protect its surface. The duodenum is protected by its motility which removes HCl, glands in its surface that produce mucins, and products from the pancreas, including bicarbonate, to help neutralize the acidity. Most <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> occur in foals, and there appears to be an association between <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> and enteritis in these animals. <b>Duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> may result in inflammation of the duodenum so profound it blocks gastric emptying, which can cause severe gastric ulcers and occasionally esophageal ulcers. Often this must be treated with a gastrojejunostomy, which is a risky procedure.|$|R

25|$|On 21 January 1942, Jim Crawford {{enlisted in}} the Australian Army Medical Corps. Crawford wanted to enlist earlier {{but he had not}} been {{medically}} fit. When Crawford grew tired of peeling spuds he was discharged in September and worked as a stoker in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, serving aboard mine-sweepers guarding the B.H.P steel works at Whyalla. While working as a stoker, Crawford founded a Worker's study group. Crawford also spoke at War Loan Rallies. At one rally he spoke on a platform with future Australian Prime Minister, Harold Holt, who shouted Crawford to a double whisky after his speech. Jim was charged with mutiny for organising to stop work of naval stokers until they were paid trade union rates. They stood firm and gained the Union rates they were after, however, Crawford was transferred to New Guinea to the Naval Depot HMS Ladava. In 1944, he experienced the bombing by the Japanese in New Guinea. He also served aboard an Icelandic fishing trawler converted to minesweeper HMS Beryl. While working on the minesweeper Crawford had to shovel coal into the furnace. This coal shovelling had caused permanent damage to Crawford's lungs and he developed emphysema. In January, 1945, he was discharged from the navy with a pension as he was suffering from a <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Once discharged from the navy, he arrived back in Melbourne and wrote for large newspapers, such as the Sporting Globe and the Melbourne Guardian. He worked for the Melbourne Guardian for ten years, writing mostly about political issues.|$|E
500|$|This {{account was}} {{challenged}} {{by a series}} of writers and journalists from the mid-1970s onwards. Writing in 1974, Evans noted that the Veterans Administration had confirmed that (even at that late stage in his life) Hubbard [...] "receives $160 a month in compensation for disabilities incurred during the Second World War. However the conditions listed as being '40% disabling' are: <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer,</b> bursitis (right shoulder), arthritis, and blepharoconjunctivitis." [...] Evans noted: [...] "a Navy Department spokesman has stated that 'an examination of Mr Hubbard's record does not reveal any evidence of injuries suffered while {{in the service of the}} United States Navy'." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{medical records}} state {{that he was}} hospitalized with an acute <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> rather than a war injury. He told his doctors that he was {{suffering}} from lameness caused by a hip infection and he told Look magazine in December 1950 that he had suffered from [...] "ulcers, conjunctivitis, deteriorating eyesight, bursitis and something wrong with my feet". He was still complaining in 1951 of eye problems and stomach pains, which had given him [...] "continuous trouble" [...] for eight years, especially when [...] "under nervous stress". This came well after Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide [...] "a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems".|$|E
40|$|Giant <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> (GDUs) are {{a subset}} of <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> that have {{historically}} resulted in greater morbidity than usual <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers.</b> Until recently, few cases had been successfully treated with medical therapy. However, {{the widespread use of}} endoscopy, the introduction of H- 2 receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors, and the improvement in surgical techniques all have revolutionized the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of this condition. Nevertheless, GDUs are still associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality and complications. Thus, surgical evaluation of a patient with a GDU should remain an integral part of patient care. These giant variants, while usually benign, can frequently harbor malignancy. A careful review of the literature highlights the important differences when comparing GDUs to classical peptic ulcers and why they must be thought of differently than their more common counterpart...|$|R

40|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} endoscopy {{was performed}} in 106 of 204 Chinese patients with intact abdominal aortic aneurysms, nine-seven for screening and nine for gastrointenstinal bleeding or pain. Peptic disease was discovered in 38 patients: 12 <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers,</b> 12 gastric <b>ulcers,</b> four <b>duodenal</b> and gastric <b>ulcers,</b> three duodenitis, three gastritis and four previously operated for ulcers. The eight patients who bled before aneurysmectomy all had gastric ulcers; four required emergency operation and two died. Only two patients bled from <b>duodenal</b> <b>ulcers,</b> both after aneurysmectomy and one died. Excluding gastritis and duodenitis, peptic ulcer was found in 26. 4 % of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Half of these ulcers were gastric ulcers and 50 % of them bled before aneurysmectomy. <b>Duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> tend to remain asymptomatic before operation and two of 12 (16. 7 %) bled postoperatively. The risk of bleeding for ulcers associated with aneurysms was 10 of 28 (35. 7 %) ulcers.
