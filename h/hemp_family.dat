5000|$|Celtis sinensis (English: Chinese hackberry; Chinese: [...] ) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the <b>hemp</b> <b>family,</b> Cannabaceae, that is native to slopes in East Asia.|$|E
50|$|Previously {{included}} {{either in}} the elm family, Ulmaceae, or with Celtis in the Celtidaceae, genetic analysis has shown the Celtidaceae are best placed in the <b>hemp</b> <b>family,</b> Cannabaceae.|$|E

50|$|He {{was the son}} of {{a wealthy}} Scottish cotton broker, Alexander Robb Cox, and Margaret Lockhart Greenshields. His father Alexander was a {{director}} and partner in the firm of Cox, McEuon which dealt in jute, flax and <b>hemp.</b> The <b>family</b> bought the Hafod Elwy Estate in North Wales in 1864 for a holiday home and the estate remained in the possession of the family until 1987.|$|R
50|$|Celtis conferta subsp. amblyphylla, {{commonly}} known as cotton wood or cotton-wood, is a flowering plant in the <b>hemp</b> and hackberry <b>family.</b> The subspecific epithet comes from the Greek ambly ("blunt") and phyllos ("leaf"), {{with reference to the}} blunt or rounded apices of the leaves.|$|R
50|$|Previously {{included}} {{either in}} the elm family (Ulmaceae) or a separate family, Celtidaceae, the APG III system places Celtis in an expanded <b>hemp</b> <b>family</b> (Cannabaceae). The generic name originated in Latin and was applied by Pliny the Elder (23-79) to the unrelated Ziziphus lotus.|$|E
50|$|The genus Cannabis was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} Nettle (Urticaceae) or Mulberry (Moraceae) family, and later, along with the Humulus genus (hops), in a separate family, the <b>Hemp</b> <b>family</b> (Cannabaceae sensu stricto). Recent phylogenetic studies based on cpDNA restriction site analysis and gene sequencing strongly suggest that the Cannabaceae sensu stricto arose from within the former Celtidaceae family, and that the two families should be merged to form a single monophyletic family, the Cannabaceae sensu lato.|$|E
50|$|Trema orientalis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} tree in the <b>hemp</b> <b>family,</b> Cannabaceae. It is known by many common names, including charcoal-tree, Indian charcoal-tree, pigeon wood, Oriental trema, and in Hawaii, where it has become naturalized, gunpowder tree, or nalita. It has a near universal distribution in tropical and warm temperate parts of the Old World, with a range extending from South Africa, through the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and southern China to Southeast Asia and Australia.|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{have been}} {{sporadic}} reports of hypersensitivity reactions to plants of the Cannabinaceae <b>family</b> (<b>hemp</b> and hops), {{but it has}} remained unclear whether these reactions are immunologic or nonimmunologic in nature. Objective: We examined the IgE-binding and histamine-releasing properties of hashish and marijuana extracts by CAP-FEIA and a basophil histamine release test. Methods: Two workers at a forensic laboratory suffered from nasal congestion, rbinitis, sneezing and asthmatic symptoms upon occupational contact with hashish or marijuana, which they had handled frequently for 25 and 16 years, respectively. Neither patient {{had a history of}} atopic disease. Serum was analyzed for specific IgE antibodies to hashish or marijuana extract by research prototype ImmunoCAP, and histamine release from basophils upon exposure to hashish or marijuana extracts was assessed. Results were matched to those of 4 nonatopic and 10 atopic control subjects with no known history of recreational or occupational exposure to marijuana or hashish. Results: Patient 1 had specific IgE to both hashish and marijuana (CAP class 2), and patient 2 to marijuana only (CAP class 2). Controls proved negative for specific IgE except for 2 atopic individuals with CAP class 1 to marijuana and 1 other atopic individual with CAP class 1 to hashish. Stimulation of basophils with hashish or marijuana extracts elicited histamine release from basophils of both patients and 4 atopic control subjects. Conclusions: Our results suggest an IgE-related pathomechanism for hypersensitivity reactions to marijuana or hashish. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R

It is a climbing perennial vine {{belonging to the}} <b>hemp</b> <b>family.</b> Peo-ple who lived in ancient times ate young shoots as a veg-etable, and the dried flowers were used for their slight narcotic effect and sedative action {{in the treatment of}} mania, toothache, earache, and neuralgia. 1, 2) In the present, hops is used as a sedative and mild hypnotic, and is also used for brewing, foaming, and adding bitterness, aroma and flavor to beer. 2) In Japan, hops is used as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for depression of the central nervous system or activa-tion of gastric function. However, there are actually few reports about the effect of hops on gastric function, and it is not experimentally clear what mechanisms are involved in gastric function activation by hops. Pylorus ligation has been extensively used as a method of evaluating gastric function, since the operative procedure is simple and the evaluation of many parameters can be done in a relatively short time. 3 — 5) In the present study, we examined the effect of hops on gastric function and attempted to clarify its mechanisms using a rat pylorus-ligated model...|$|E
40|$|The hop, Humulus lupulus, is a {{cultivated}} flowering plant, {{green in}} color that has many economically important roles. The hop {{belongs to the}} <b>hemp</b> <b>family,</b> Cannabinaceae. There are many features that are distinctive about this plant. A hops plant has yellow lupulin glands between the petals, which is used for preservative and flavoring characteristics in beer. The bitterness of the hop is used to balance {{the sweetness of the}} malt, and the essential oils add a flavor and aroma which cannot be achieved by using any other plant. The hop plant is a perennial spiraling vine, which will grow in almost any climate given enough water and sunlight. It can climb either string or poles and can reach height of 40 feet. The flowers are usually dried before use. Farmers have developed a systemic approach to the cultivation of hops. There are also a number of chemical compounds present in this plant that give rise to its economic value. (1) The hop plant has several structurally distinctive properties. The root is stout and perennial. The stem that arise from it every year is of a twining nature, reaching a great length, flexible and very tough, angular and prickly, with a tenacious fiber. This fiber has been explored in the manufacturing of a white, durable cloth. The cloth is not of wide use because the fibers are so difficult to separate. Normally, the stems require to be steeped in water a whole winter before they can be utilized. Paper has also bee...|$|E
40|$|Humulus lupulus (hops) is a {{climbing}} perennial vine that vigorously grows 20 - 35 feet each year. Humulus lupulus is {{a member}} of the <b>hemp</b> <b>family</b> which has grown wild since ancient times in Europe, Asia and North America. The female flowers mature in late Summer and are used to add bitterness, flavor and aroma to beer. In ancient times the young shoots were eaten as a vegetable and the dried flowers were used for their slight narcotic effect and sedative action in the treatment of mania, toothache, earache and neuralgia. One modern herbal medicine practitioners continue to use hops as a sedative and mild hypnotic as well as for its endocrine, free radical scavenging and antitumor properties. The aim of this study was to investigation of the sedation, pre-anesthetic and anti-anxiety effects of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) extract compared with diazepam in rats. In the present study 30 wistar male rats weighting 300 ± 10 g and about 3 months old were used for laboratory experiments. In order to evaluate the sedation and pre-anesthetic effects of hop extract compared with diazepam, 50 mg kg - 1 of extract in 1 st group, 100 mg kg - 1 in 2 nd group, 1. 2 mg kg - 1 in 3 rd group, 2 mg kg - 1 in Group 4 th, 2 mg kg - 1 amount of dimethyl sulfoxide was injected intra peritoneal in 5 th group and 6 th group did not receive any drug. Data showed that hop extract has better sedation, pre-anesthetic and anti-anxiety effects than diazepam. Researchers suggest that still need more studies on this plant component in order to understand the more sedative and anxiolytic effects of this plant...|$|E
