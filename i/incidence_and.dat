5|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI varies by age, gender, region and other factors.

5|$|Two main {{measures}} {{are used in}} epidemiological studies: <b>incidence</b> <b>and</b> prevalence.

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to gain an accurate picture of <b>incidence</b> <b>and</b> prevalence of self-harm. This is due in a part {{to a lack of}} sufficient numbers of dedicated research centres to provide a continuous monitoring system. However, even with sufficient resources, statistical estimates are crude since most incidences of self-harm are undisclosed to the medical profession as acts of self-harm are frequently carried out in secret, and wounds may be superficial and easily treated by the individual. Recorded figures can be based on three sources: psychiatric samples, hospital admissions and general population surveys.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the <b>incidence</b> <b>and</b> gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E

5|$|The Liffey River—then called Pennyroyal Creek—was first bridged at Carrick in 1828 with {{a simple}} log structure. This was {{replaced}} in the 1830s with a more substantial bridge, though still wooden. As of 1834 the areas' roads were poor and vehicles frequently became bogged {{on the road to}} Westbury. A bridge over the South Esk, at what is now Hadspen, was built in 1843. It replaced a frequently impassable ford and more reliably connected Carrick to Launceston. Liffey bridge was repaired and raised in the mid-1860s, keeping the original foundations. In May 1875 water sufficiently eroded these foundations to lead to the bridge's collapse, when one of the two supporting piles (logs) gave way. All of the Liffey bridges, and the connecting parts of the road, were subject to inundation when the river flooded; the 1929 Tasmanian Floods carried the bridge away. In the 1950s the road was reconstructed and the bridge again replaced. To reduce the <b>incidence</b> <b>and</b> impact of flooding both were raised substantially leaving the mill's ground floor far below the road level.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} intensity {{value recorded}} by terrestrial laser scanners {{is influenced by}} multiple variables, among which <b>incidence</b> angle <b>and</b> distance play a crucial and dominant role. Further studies on <b>incidence</b> angle <b>and</b> distance effects are required to improve the accuracy of currently available methods and to implement these methods in practical applications. In this study, the effects of <b>incidence</b> angle <b>and</b> distance on intensity data of the Faro Focus 3 D 120 terrestrial laser scanner are investigated. A new method is proposed to eliminate the <b>incidence</b> angle <b>and</b> distance effects. The proposed method {{is based on the}} linear interpolation of the intensity values of reference targets previously scanned at various <b>incidence</b> angles <b>and</b> distances. Compared with existing methods, a significant advantage of the proposed method is that estimating the specific function forms of incidence angle versus intensity and distance versus intensity is no longer necessary; these are canceled out when the scanned and reference targets are measured at the same <b>incidence</b> angle <b>and</b> distance. Results imply that the proposed method has high accuracy and simplicity in eliminating <b>incidence</b> angle <b>and</b> distance effects and can significantly reduce the intensity variations caused by these effects on homogeneous surfaces.

5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower <b>incidence</b> <b>and</b> longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E

40|$|The deadly {{infectious}} Ebola incidences scare {{not only}} to the residents of western Africa but also to the travelers and medical professionals who treat the patients, as they became victims. Since 27 July until 13 August 2014 alone, about 2, 127 Ebola cases occurred in just four Western African countries: Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and more than 50 % of them died. The mortality is extremely higher. No known medication exists. Though the virus is not airborne spreading, a contact with the patientâ€™s fluids, tissues, or bodies is known to transmit Ebola virus. There had been three categories: Suspected, probable, or confirmed in the collection of Ebola <b>incidences</b> <b>and</b> deaths. Their data are quite informative if they are properly processed and it is exactly the aim of this article. For this purpose, the stochastic nature of the data is probed rationally. The Ebola <b>incidences</b> <b>and</b> deaths in each category exhibit a separate Poisson chance environment and yet, they are connected. Therefore, suitable Poisson models are developed for each category and are then woven together to analyse the entire pertinent data on Ebola <b>incidences</b> <b>and</b> deaths in those four countries. Pictures are worth the thousand words to comprehend non-trivial findings. Hence, innovatively the data analytic concepts for three-dimensional sphere for each country is developed and applied. By superimposing the four spheres (one for each country), this article points out the relative performance of the four countries with respect to the Ebola <b>incidences</b> <b>and</b> deaths together in each category. One country does better than others in one category but poorly in other two categories.
