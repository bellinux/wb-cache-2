500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E
2500|$|Little else {{is known}} about Kierkegaard's {{attitude}} to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing. [...] "Schopenhauer interests me very much, as does his fate in Germany. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him I am sure he would shudder or laugh if I were to show him [...]" [...] (Journals, 1854) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{asked him}} [...] {{when he had}} his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always {{interested}} in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted {{to make him feel}} good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I {{was the only one who}} did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|E

60|$|NICHOLLS (almost brusquely). <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{you from}} the hall. You're silly to take chances just now.|$|R
5000|$|The {{companies}} always remained {{small and}} personally run. B.B. King {{has said that}} he always felt the brothers were accessible: [...] "The company was never bigger than the artist. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just wish I had a {{telegraph}} or a telephone, so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Jill. Wouldn't it {{be fun to}} pipe {{across and}} get an answer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{should like}} to know whether you {{consider}} yourselves American or English," [...] she broke out. [...] "If once I knew <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you accordingly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{tired of}} it," [...] I said. [...] "I {{want to come}} to grips with all these Rawdons. I think perhaps if I was hungry and savage <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> hungry men--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is dreadful!" [...] said Corny. [...] "She {{ought to}} give up this pepper-pod {{business}} right away. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her, I'd make her understand. But I must go get somebody for an interpreter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A great comfort;--only I wish it {{had been}} sooner. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you about things which I never did <b>talk</b> of <b>to</b> any one. I wonder why I {{should have been a}} duke, and another man a servant." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{after that}} memory {{she seems to}} be {{flickering}} about always in the election, an inextinguishable flame; now she flew by on her bicycle, now she dashed into committee rooms, now she appeared on doorsteps in animated conversation with dubious voters; I took every chance <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her--I had never met anything like her before in the world, and she interested me immensely--and before the polling day she and I had become, in the frankest simplicity, fast friends....|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could help}} you," [...] said Clara. [...] "But I really {{know very little}} about such things. However, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my father, who knows a very great deal of the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since I {{left him}} I have walked all round by Bowick Lodge. I had {{something}} to think of before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you,--something to decide upon, indeed, before I could return to the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{knew you}} didn't love me! I felt it. D'you think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you {{for five minutes}} without seeing the {{constraint}} in your manner? They told me I was foolish and fanciful, but I knew better." ...|$|E
60|$|Bessie. I think, {{if you let}} me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> him {{round in}} a week, maybe.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not used}} to making conversation," [...] he said. [...] "Is there {{anything}} in the world which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about likely <b>to</b> interest you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. De la Borne," [...] she said, [...] "I can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your brother, {{because you}} are an older and a wiser man. You may not have seen much of the world, but you are at any rate not a young idiot like Cecil. Will you listen to me, please?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doesn't it {{seem too}} bad!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "If {{we could only}} get hold of Julian Orden to-night, if the Bishop and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him for five minutes, we could have this message for which we have been waiting so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To begin with, I'm {{going to}} hide these tracks. After all, I don't see much light. I suppose I ought {{to tell my}} mother and put Mrs. Cartwright wise; but I won't. Spying on a girl and telling is mean. All the same, I'm surely bothered. In a sense, my mother's {{accountable}} for her guests and the girl's nice. I'd like it if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} guess them," [...] he said gravely; [...] "I can only suppose that she is ashamed of her father and declines to meet any one {{connected}} with him. It is very wrong and very narrow of her. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her for ten minutes and tell her how the poor old chap used to dream about her and kiss her picture, I can't think but she'd be sorry." ...|$|E
50|$|In the {{political}} circles, Makwetu is remembered for his discipline. He was widely respected across {{the political}} divide because of his discipline. He was one man <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> politics <b>to</b> without {{the fear of being}} insulted...He came after us in jail (Robben Island) and we were all stunned by his conduct. He always preached unity, which was contrary to what the other PAC guys wanted.” ANC stalwart Ahmed Kathrada said about Makwetu.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} are back again, Ruth," [...] Miss Carne, {{who had been}} down several times to see her, said. [...] "I {{told you not to}} hurry yourself, and I would have done without you for another month, but you know I am really very glad to have you back again. Mary managed my hair very well, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her as I do to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will be {{surprised}} to see how near I am to you. Paris became impossible--and I have come here to be within reach of your advice. I would so love to see you again. Since you left Paris I don't think I have met anyone <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> <b>Is</b> all well with you and with your boy? No one knows, I think, that I am here at present.|$|R
6000|$|Soon I {{could see}} Mary Phillips on deck, speaking-trumpet in hand; and seizing my trumpet, I hailed when as I {{thought we were}} near enough. I eagerly inquired after Bertha, and the high voice of Mary Phillips came across the water, telling me that Miss Nugent was not feeling at all well. This {{uncertain}} state of affairs was making her feel very nervous. [...] "Can she come on deck?" [...] I cried. [...] "Can she use a speaking-trumpet? If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her, I might encourage her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Really I {{do think}} a kiss of poor Honor's would do me good! I {{have a great}} mind {{to go to her}} when I come back from Kensington. If I have taken a {{situation}} she cannot suppose that I want anything from her. It would be very comfortable; I should hear of Owen! I will go! Even if she be not in town, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Jones, and sit {{a quarter of an hour}} in the cedar room! It would be like meeting Owen; it would be rest and home!' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you for a}} year of all {{the pretty}} kindnesses that she would do for me; how, when she found me of early mornings among my books, her {{presence}} [...] "would cast a light upon the day;" [...] how she used to smooth and fold my little surplice, and embroider me caps and gowns for high feast-days; how she used to bring flowers for the altar, and who could deck it so well as she? But sentiment does not come glibly from under a grizzled moustache, so I will drop it, if you please.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{you have}} not," [...] said she, quite hastily. [...] "You were right, too right,--has {{it not been}} proved within the last five minutes? My poor sister! What {{can be done to}} mend Mr. Vavasour's temper? <b>I</b> wish you <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, Mr. Headley." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{just threw}} myself {{heart and soul}} into the {{preparations}} for that dinner. I had three turkeys and two sucking pigs, and mince pies and pumpkin pies and apple pies, and doughnuts and fruit cake and cranberry sauce and brown bread, and ever {{so many other things}} to fill up the chinks. The night before Thanksgiving everything was ready, and I was so tired <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Jimmy Nelson when he dropped in.|$|R
60|$|No one was present. Even Phil Jones was away; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{hear him}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the cook in the galley. I had the place all to myself, {{and now was}} {{the chance to do}} the work I wished to accomplish.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use, Snippey dear," [...] {{he said on}} {{the fourth}} night of his stay at the farm, after the family had retired, [...] "I can't stay an' not tell Aunt Hannah, an' it's certain we won't be allowed to stop more'n a minute after she knows the truth. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her in the dark, when I couldn't see her face, it wouldn't seem quite so bad; but we go to bed so early there's no chance for that. We must have it out mighty soon, for I can't hang 'round here many hours longer without tellin' all about ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{your eyes}} that I was {{thinking}} of, for I'm sure I've never wished to forget anything till {{you came up}} to me that night and looked me through and through. I know I'm not much account; but I know how to stand by a man. I stood by father ever since I could understand. He wasn't a bad chap. Now that I can't be of any use to him, I would just as soon forget all that and make a fresh start. But these aren't things that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about. What could I ever talk to you about?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{accordingly}} took up {{the book}} of poetry which lay upon the sofa. It was Milton's Paradise Lost. Nothing {{could have been more}} fortunate; it afforded a fine scope for my favorite vein of grandiloquence. I went largely into a discussion of its merits, or rather an enthusiastic eulogy of them. My observations were addressed to Mrs. Somerville, for I found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her with more ease than to her daughter. She appeared alive to the beauties of the poet and disposed to meet me in the discussion; but it was not my object to hear her talk; it was to talk myself. I anticipated all she had to say, overpowered her with the copiousness of my ideas, and supported and illustrated them by long citations from the author.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the thing}} I doubt," [...] I said, and {{abruptly}} <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> no more <b>to</b> her of Nettie. I {{got up and walked}} away from her, and came back after a while, to speak of other things, with a bunch of daffodils for her in my hand.|$|R
6000|$|Torrance closed one hand. [...] "Grant of Fremont {{was my best}} friend, {{and when}} he died I 'most brought the lad up as a son. When he got hold of his foolish notions it hurt me considerably, and I did what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> him out of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{say what}} <b>I</b> mean. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> more freely <b>to</b> you than to any one else, but I won't talk about that even to you. As regards Miss Boncassen, I think that any man might marry her, without discredit. I won't have it said that she can be {{inferior}} to me,--or to anybody." ...|$|R
