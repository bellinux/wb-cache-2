5|$|As {{the rivalry}} <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> in recent years, the teams have battled more often for playoff position. The Mets won the {{division}} in 2006, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011. The Phillies' 2007 championship was won {{on the last}} day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining. The Phillies broke the Curse of Billy Penn to win the 2008 World Series, while the Mets' last title came in the 1986 World Series.|$|E
5|$|Transport in Cameroon {{is often}} difficult. Except for the several {{relatively}} good toll roads which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained {{and subject to}} inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred. Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers. Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders, and since 2005, the problem <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> in the east as the Central African Republic has further destabilised.|$|E

5|$|Toronto FC's biggest rival, Montreal Impact, joined MLS in 2012. In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} this, they emerged as fierce rivals during the Canadian Championship. The {{proximity}} of the two cities and the fact that Toronto and Montreal are long-standing rivals in NHL ice hockey contributes to these meetings being combative. Since both teams have joined MLS, the rivalry <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> and the matches have become a Canadian soccer classic, which has also been named the 401 Derby, named after Ontario Highway 401 linking the two cities. On March 16, 2013, Toronto FC fans set an MLS record for travelling support with 3,200 away fans in Montreal to watch TFC lose 2â€“1, eclipsing their own record of 2,400 at Columbus Crew in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Juventus have {{significant}} rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino and matches {{between the two}} side are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, {{the capital of the}} neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other {{at the top of the}} league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A. They also have rivalries with Milan, Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.|$|E

50|$|Later on November 23, {{microwave}} imagery showed that an eye had developed within a well defined low level circulation center. Early the next day, the JTWC reported that Nida <b>had</b> <b>intensified</b> into a category 1 typhoon {{as the eye}} became well defined with deep convection wrapping around most of the eye. However, despite the JTWC reporting 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 160 km/h, (100 mph), the JMA only reported 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 110 km/h, (70 mph) which made Nida a Severe Tropical Storm. Early on November 25 the JMA reported that Nida <b>had</b> <b>intensified</b> into a typhoon before reporting later that day that the typhoon <b>had</b> rapidly <b>intensified</b> under favourable conditions and reached its peak 10-minute wind speeds of 195 km/h (120 mph), with a peak pressure of 905 hPa. During {{the next day the}} JTWC also reported that Typhoon Nida <b>had</b> rapidly <b>intensified</b> over the previous 18 hours into a category five super typhoon with winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), as it maintained a well defined symmetrical structure. The JTWC then reported that Nida <b>had</b> <b>intensified</b> a little bit more and reached its peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 290 km/h (185 mph).|$|R
5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements <b>has</b> <b>intensified.</b> From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly {{began to focus}} more on the relationships between the coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.|$|E

25|$|There {{have existed}} {{movements}} to petition the Government for {{an extension of}} the M5 south, to the city of Plymouth, which currently relies on the A38 road.

25|$|The 1970s saw the {{construction}} of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183 m), 47-storey Natwest Tower, the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including 30 St. Mary Axe ("the Gherkin"'), Leadenhall Building ("the Cheesegrater"), 20 Fenchurch Street ("the Walkie-Talkie"), the Broadgate Tower and the Heron Tower, the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, 22 Bishopsgate, is under construction.|$|E
25|$|The {{enforced}} Russification of Russia's remaining indigenous minorities <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> {{particularly during}} the Soviet era and continues unabated in the 21st century, especially in connection to urbanization and the dropping population replacement rates (particularly low among the more western Uralic peoples). As a result, several of Russia's indigenous languages and cultures are currently considered endangered. E.g. between the 1989 and 2002 censuses, the assimilation numbers of the Mordvins have totalled over 100,000, a major loss for a people totalling less than one million in number.|$|E

The Eleanor Schonell Bridge (originally named, and still generally known as, The Green Bridge) between the University of Queensland and Dutton Park is for use by buses, pedestrians and cyclists. There are currently multiple tunnel and bridge projects underway as part of the TransApex plan.|$|E
25|$|Montreal Impact's biggest rival is Toronto FC because Canada's {{two largest}} cities have rivalries {{in and out}} of sport.

Since both teams have joined the MLS, the rivalry <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> and the matches have become a Canadian soccer classic which has been also named the 401 Derby.|$|E

Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> partisanship in the last few decades but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.|$|E
25|$|The Brumbies have {{traditionally}} had a fierce rivalry with the NSW Waratahs. The original Brumbies team was formed of rejects from the Waratahsâ€“ ironically however the Brumbies {{have had more}} success over {{the duration of the}} Super 12/14. Brumbies v. Waratahs games are notoriously difficult for the away team to winâ€“ indeed the away team has only won on two occasions, including the Brumbies 51â€“10 humiliation of NSW in the 2002 semi finals. Brumbies/Waratahs games routinely attract sell out attendances. Since 2012 the interstate rivalry with the Queensland Reds <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> as the two teams have been in close competition for the automatic conference semi-final qualification spot.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} no open splits within the older {{generation}} of Fatah politicians since the 1980s, though there is occasional friction between members of the top leadership. One founding member, Faruq al-Qaddumi (Abu Lutf), continues to openly oppose the post-Oslo arrangements and <b>has</b> <b>intensified</b> his campaign for a more hardline position from exile in Tunis. Since Arafat's death, he is formally head of Fatah's political bureau and chairman, but his actual political following within Fatah appears limited. He has at times openly challenged the legitimacy of Abbas and harshly criticized both him and Mohammed Dahlan, but despite threats to splinter the movement, he remains in his position, and his challenges have so far been fruitless. Another influential veteran, Hani al-Hassan, has also openly criticized the present leadership.|$|E
