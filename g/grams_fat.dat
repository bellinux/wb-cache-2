Methods. All of the patients studied had suffered from the disease for periods of more than one year and had either been hospitalized or treated as ambulatory patients.

40|$|After {{reviewing}} {{our current}} {{knowledge of the}} metabolic response to major abdominal surgery, we present two new studies {{in which we have}} followed the changes in body composition, physiologic function, and psychological function for up to 1 year after major surgery. In the first study, 46 patients had changes in body composition, physiologic function, and psychological function measured perioperatively and again at intervals up to 1 year. There was an average loss of weight of 3000 grams Imaximum at 2 weeks/, and the tissue composition of this weight loss was composed of 1400 <b>grams</b> <b>fat.</b> 600 grams protein, and 1000 grams water. Normal body composition had returned to normal in most patients by 6 months. In the second study of 84 patients, deficits of skeletal muscle function and fatigue were found to be greatest at postoperative day 7. Most patients were back to preoperative levels of muscle function and fatigue 30 days after surgery, and nearly all had normal values 90 days after surgery.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{are some}} of the most {{dangerous}} environmental toxins. They were used in plasticizers, varnishes, transformers, or as hydraulic liquid. Their production and use has since been banned. Because of their longevity they still occur in the environment and are to be found in particular in fat-containing food of animal origin like milk, meat, eggs and fish. The European Commission is currently in the process of drawing up maximum level provisions for most PCBs, i. e. the so-called non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndl-PCBs). It envisages using as their representative the sum of six selected ndl-PCBs (Σ 6 PCBs) that frequently occur in food. BfR welcomes the fact that in the new proposal the maximum levels have been reduced for most foods and that fish liver and food for babies and infants has been included in the new proposal. One exception to this positive assessment is, however, the new maximum level for chicken eggs of 75 nanogram (ng) Σ 6 PCBs per <b>gram</b> <b>fat</b> which, in contrast to the first proposal of 50 ng Σ 6 PCBs per <b>gram</b> <b>fat,</b> has been set at an incomprehensibly high level. The maximum level for eggs should be oriented towards the maximum level for poultry meat where 30 ng Σ 6 PCBs per <b>gram</b> <b>fat</b> was established as the maximum level and this is more than 50 % lower, as the PCB contaminations in the fat portion of eggs and poultry meat are roughly the same. * In the opinion of BfR the proposed maximum levels for Σ 6 PCBs in food should, however, be lowered further. *After the preparation of this Opinion, this concern of BfR was presented to the European Commission (DG SANCO) with the consequence that the proposal for the maximum level for chicken eggs was reduced to 50 ng/g fat for Σ 6 PCB...|$|R
