60|$|Being {{somewhat}} fatigued, MacRummle betook {{himself to}} a sequestered ledge among the cliffs, and sat down under a shrub to rest. It chanced to be a well concealed spot. He remained quietly there for a considerable time, discussing with himself the relative advantages of fishing and shooting. It is probable that his sudden disappearance and his prolonged absence induced the eagle to imagine that he had gone away, for that watchful bird, after several circlings on outstretched and apparently motionless wings, made a magnificent swoop downwards, and again resumed its <b>floating</b> <b>action</b> in the lower strata of its atmospheric world. There it devoted its exclusive attention to the young man, whose position was clearly exposed to its view.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>Action</b> is a {{band from}} Black Mountain, North Carolina. The touring version of <b>Floating</b> <b>Action</b> is Seth Kauffman (lead vocals, guitar), Michael Libramento (bass), (also Mark Capon (bass)), Josh Carpenter (drums), Evan Martin (keys), and Brian Landrum (guitar). The studio version of <b>Floating</b> <b>Action</b> is solely Seth Kauffman, who writes, records, and {{produces}} all <b>Floating</b> <b>Action</b> material himself. [...] Kauffman's unique songwriting, musicianship, and production style are praised by such notable acts as; Dr.Dog, My Morning Jacket, Dan Auerbach, Band Of Horses.|$|E

50|$|Tess Brunet (born September 12, 1978) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, drummer, and producer, who has {{recorded}} and performed under the band names Au Ras Au Ras, Animal Electric, Generationals, and deadboy & the Elephantmen. Brunet began {{working in the}} lo-fi genre of underground rock, recording on portable cassette tape machines while living in New York City. Brunet has worked with various artists including Daniel Johnston, Lady Bo of Bo Diddley, <b>Floating</b> <b>Action</b> and Twin Tigers, to name a few. Brunet released her first solo albums under Animal Electric in 2008 and Au Ras Au Ras in 2011 and 2012. Tess has since dropped both monikers and currently performs and records under her given name as well as Tess Brunet & The Black Orchids. Henry Rollins champions Brunet and plays her catalog on his weekly show on KCRW. Brunet has also played The Henry Rollins Show on IFC. She has toured extensively in various bands since 2003 as a drummer and started touring in 2013 as a solo artist. Brunet {{is currently working on}} her third solo record, but {{it will be the first}} record to come out under her given name. In addition to her musical efforts, Tess owns Lagniappe Records, an independent record shop and DIY record label in Lafayette, LA.|$|E
50|$|Full contact bedding of {{the action}} with the barrel floated is a very common method for long range rifles with a heavy barrel. A {{free-floating}} barrel will generally produce the greatest accuracy. However, a pressure pad under the barrel just forward {{of the action}} can sometimes improve accuracy by acting on barrel harmonics and reducing stress on the action from {{the weight of the}} barrel. Pillar bedding can be used to <b>float</b> the <b>action</b> as well as the barrel, but the process is more difficult.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} each level, {{there are}} {{non-lethal}} bonus stages which award points to the player for shooting, crashing or avoiding <b>floating</b> letters (the <b>action</b> required depends on the actual letter) at great speed. The background in these stages is rainbow, and the [...] "radar" [...] does not show your ship.|$|R
50|$|A 34-rank organ in the Swiss {{village of}} Ursy is {{equipped}} with hi-tech features from Syncordia, including what some erroneously claim is the first non-mechanical action that directly controls {{the opening of a}} pipe organ's pallets in direct proportion to key movement—ostensibly combining the virtues of electric action with the intimate control of tracker action. However, Vincent Willis' 1884 patent <b>Floating</b> Lever pneumatic <b>action</b> also had this capability.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Submarine {{pipeline}} {{often be}} constructed in submarine oil, submarine gas, offshore deepwater discharge {{and the water}} intake and outlet of coastal power plant etc. Wave, tide and other hydrodynamic factors induce deformation and destabilization of seabed. It {{is an important issue}} which involved in design of submarine pipelines. Integrated density of large diameter pipes were often less than the natural silt density, buried by the original silt could lead to pipeline <b>floating.</b> Under the <b>action</b> of wave the overburden, seabed would be liquefaction, pipeline floating may be occurred, then lead to accident. By studying the evolution law and the scope of the backfill density, and the liquefied law of sandy soil, the risk of pipeline floating in the specific project was analyzed...|$|R
40|$|A {{new wave}} energy device {{features}} a submerged ballasted air bag connected {{at the top}} to a rigid <b>float.</b> Under wave <b>action,</b> the bag expands and contracts, creating a reciprocating air flow through a turbine between the bag and another volume housed within the float. Laboratory measurements are generally in good agreement with numerical predictions. Both show that the trajectory of possible combinations of pressure and elevation at which the device is in static equilibrium takes {{the shape of an}} S. This means that statically the device can have three different draughts, and correspondingly three different bag shapes, for the same pressure. The behaviour in waves depends on where the mean pressure-elevation condition is on the static trajectory. The captured power is highest for a mean condition on the middle section.

40|$|Movement {{of snow in}} {{the snow}} storm has been {{measured}} in-the air layer up to 6 m with snow collectors attached to a mast and collecting boxes placed on the snow surface {{in the northern part}} _ of Honshu, and a vertical distribution of blowing snow was chiefly obtained and results were discussed in conjunction with a vertical distribution of wind velocity. As the density of blowing snow was far less than that of the air even in the air layer dose to the surface of snow, snow part. ides were assumed to be <b>floating</b> by the <b>action</b> of turbulence of the wind. An analytical expression of a vertical distribution of concentration of blowing snow was obtained and it agreed nearly with measured values. The values of falling velocities of snow particle were calculated and results were discussed. 1...|$|R
2500|$|From [...] below Lower Harvard Bridge to Newburgh and South Shore Railroad Bridge, {{the channel}} becomes wider and deeper {{and the level}} is {{controlled}} by Lake Erie. Downstream of the railroad bridge to the harbor, the depth is held constant by dredging, and the width is maintained by piling along both banks. The surface is covered with the brown oily film observed upstream {{as far as the}} Southerly Plant effluent. In addition, large quantities of black heavy oil floating in slicks, sometimes several inches thick, are observed frequently. Debris and trash are commonly caught up in these slicks forming an unsightly <b>floating</b> mess. Anaerobic <b>action</b> is common as the dissolved oxygen is seldom above a fraction of a part per million.
