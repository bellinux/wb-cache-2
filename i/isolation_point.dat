40|$|A {{barrier to}} {{creating}} the platform-independent services envisioned by middleware-based development infrastructures {{is the level}} of performance robustness of the distributed applications created with them, in lieu of unpredictable variations in application behavior or in the resources available for satisfying user requests. Our goal is to improve the behavior locality of distributed applications and to prevent performance (mis-) behaviors from spilling across certain boundaries, since such spillage weakens behavior diagnoses and/or weakens or disables the effects of locally applied control or management methods. Toward these ends, we develop a novel software abstraction, termed {em isolation points} (I-points), which can be used to isolate application components or subsystems from each other. The main contributions of this work are <b>Isolation</b> <b>Points,</b> which are software abstractions for monitoring and understanding dynamic runtime behaviors to better isolation application components hence creating more robust distributed applications. Two concrete artifacts using I-points also developed in this thesis are: I(solation) -RMI and I(solatoin) -Queue. I-RMI demonstrates the utility of <b>isolation</b> <b>points</b> in J 2 EE's RMI-IIOP domain. I(solation) -Queue applies <b>isolation</b> <b>points</b> to message passing systems. Ph. D.

40|$|Purpose We {{sought to}} examine the {{contribution}} of visual cues in audiovisual identification of consonants and vowels—in terms of <b>isolation</b> <b>points</b> (the shortest time required for correct identification of a speech stimulus), accuracy, and cognitive demands—in listeners with hearing impairment using hearing aids. Method The study comprised 199 participants with hearing impairment (mean age = 61. 1 years) with bilateral, symmetrical, mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss. Gated Swedish consonants and vowels were presented aurally and audiovisually to participants. Linear amplification was adjusted for each participant to assure audibility. The reading span {{test was used to}} measure participants' working memory capacity. Results Audiovisual presentation resulted in shortened <b>isolation</b> <b>points</b> and improved accuracy for consonants and vowels relative to auditory-only presentation. This benefit was more evident for consonants than vowels. In addition, correlations and subsequent analyses revealed that listeners with higher scores on the reading span test identified both consonants and vowels earlier in auditory-only presentation, but only vowels (not consonants) in audiovisual presentation. Conclusion Consonants and vowels differed in terms of the benefits afforded from their associative visual cues, as indicated by the degree of audiovisual benefit and reduction in cognitive demands linked to the identification of consonants and vowels presented audiovisually.

40|$|We present LIPS (Lexical <b>Isolation</b> <b>Point</b> Software), a {{tool for}} {{accurate}} lexical <b>isolation</b> <b>point</b> (IP) prediction in recordings of speech. The IP is the point in time in which a word is correctly recognised given the acoustic evidence available to the hearer. The ability to accurately determine lexical IPs is of importance {{to work in the}} field of cognitive processing, since it enables the evaluation of competing models of word recognition. IPs are also of importance in the field of neurolinguistics, where the analyses of high-temporal-resolution neuroimaging data require a precise time alignment of the observed brain activity with the linguistic input. LIPS provides an attractive alternative to costly multi-participant perception experiments by automatically computing IPs for arbitrary words. On a test set of words, the LIPS system predicts IPs with a mean difference from the actual IP of within 1 ms. The difference from the predicted and actual IP approximate to a normal distribution {{with a standard deviation of}} around 80 ms (depending on the model used). 1...|$|E

The results showed that noise impeded the identification of consonants and words (i. e., delayed IPs and lowered accuracy), but not the identification of final words in sentences. In comparison with the previous study by Moradi et al., it can be concluded that the provision of visual cues expedited IPs and increased the accuracy of speech stimuli identification in both silence and noise.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} measure the initial portion of signal {{required}} for the correct identification of auditory speech stimuli (or <b>isolation</b> <b>points,</b> IPs) in silence and noise, and to investigate the relationships between auditory and cognitive functions in silence and noise. Twenty-one university students were presented with auditory stimuli in a gating paradigm for the identification of consonants, words, and final words in highly predictable and low predictable sentences. The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), the reading span test, and the Paced Auditory Serial Attention Test were also administered to measure speech-in-noise ability, working memory and attentional capacities of the participants, respectively. The results showed that noise delayed the identification of consonants, words, and final words in highly predictable and low predictable sentences. HINT performance correlated with working memory and attentional capacities. In the noise condition, there were correlations between HINT performance, cognitive task performance, and the IPs of consonants and words. In the silent condition, there were no correlations between auditory and cognitive tasks. In conclusion, a combination of hearing-in-noise ability, working memory capacity, and attention capacity is needed for the early identification of consonants and words in noise...|$|R

They identified three events in this task which were the familiarity emergence point (FEP), the <b>isolation</b> <b>point</b> (IP), and the recognition point (RP). The FEP occurred earlier in musicians than nonmusicians, but the IP occurred earlier in nonmusicians. Finally, the RP occurred slightly earlier in musicians. We simulated the qualitative results of the MGP task using a connectionist simulation of the cognitive processes underlying the emergence of these three events. We call this a melody cohort network (MCN). Separate neural networks modeled musicians and nonmusicians where the musician network represented a larger corpus of stored melodies. The MCN consisted of a core network which modeled the IP and meta-level networks which used the core network as input to model the FEP and RP. Our MCN captures the qualitative results of the MGP task and shows how stored memory size may affect the melody recognition process.

40|$|Abstract—Software as a Service (SaaS) {{providers}} {{can serve}} {{hundreds of thousands}} of customers using sharable resources to reduce costs. Multi-tenancy architecture allows SaaS providers to run a single application and a database instance, which support multiple tenants with various business needs and priorities. Until now, the database management systems (DBMSs) have not had the notion of multi-tenancy, and they have not been equipped to handle customization or scalability requirements, that are typical in multi-tenant applications. The multi-tenant database performance should adapt to tenants workloads and fit their special requirements. In this paper, we propose a new multi-tenant database schema design approach, that adapts to multi-tenant application requirements, in addition to tenants needs of data security, isolation, queries performance and response time speed. Our proposed methodology provides a trade-off between the performance and the storage space. This proposal caters for the diversity in tenants via defining multi-level quality of service for the different types of tenants, depending on tenant rate and system rate. The proposal presents a new technique to distribute data in a multi-tenant database horizontally to a set of allotment tables using an <b>isolation</b> <b>point,</b> and vertically to a set of extension tables using a merger point. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of our method using a real-world case study, showing that the proposed solution can achieve high scalability and increase performance for tenants who need speedy performance and economize storage space for tenants who do not have demanding quality of service...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} context on sign-recognition {{processes}} in American Sign Language (ASL) was studied {{by means of}} the gating paradigm (Grosjean, 1980). Individual signs were pre-sented in two different conditions: a context condition in which signs were preceded by a context, and a no-context condition in which they were excised from the signing stream. A strong context effect was found: signs were isolated sooner in context, perfect confidence in the response was reached earlier, and the candidates proposed before the <b>isolation</b> <b>point</b> reflected a narrowing-in process that was both semantic and phonological. Future research in sign recognition and models of lexical access are discussed in light of these findings. Very {{little is known about the}} process of lexical access in American Sign Language (ASL). To our knowledge, only a single study has touched on this topic (Grosjean, Teuber, and Lane, 1978), and this study was actually designed to examine another question, the subjective onset of signs. However, the results obtained by Grosjean et al. have been re-analyzed and interpreted in terms of sign recognition (Grosjean, 1981), and they will serve as a base for the present study. Grosjean et al. (1978) presented individual signs to subjects {{by means of the}} gating procedure. This consists in showing a sign a number of times and increasing its presentation time (as measured from the sign onset) at each successive pass. The subject’s task is to guess the sign after each pass and to rate his or her confidence in the guess. (For more information on the gating paradigm, see Grosjean (1980, 1981); for earlier versions of the paradigm see Pollack and Pickett (1963), and Ohman (1966)). Results showed that on the average only half of the sign was needed to isolate it, that is, to guess it correctly and without subsequently changing the guess. In addition, Grosjean (1981) found that five sign attributes affected the isolation times of a sign. They were the frequency of usage of the sign, the frequency of occurrence in signs of the sign’s location type, the number of repetitions in the movement of the sign, the complexity of the sig...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Virtualization is {{frequently}} used to isolate untrusted processes and control {{their access to}} sensitive resources. How-ever, isolation usually carries a price in terms of less resource sharing and reduced inter-process communication. In an open architecture such as Android, this price {{and its impact on}} performance, usability, and transparency must be carefully con-sidered. Although previous efforts in developing general-purpose isolation solutions have shown that some of these negative side-effects can be mitigated, doing so involves overcoming significant design challenges by incorporating numerous additional platform complexities not directly related to improved security. Thus, the general purpose solutions become inefficient and burdensome if the end-user has only specific security goals. In this paper, we present PINPOINT, a resource isolation strategy that forgoes general-purpose solutions in favor of a “building block ” approach that addresses specific end-user secu-rity goals. PINPOINT embodies the concept of Linux Namespace lightweight isolation, but does so in the Android Framework by guiding the security designer towards <b>isolation</b> <b>points</b> that are contextually close to the resource(s) that need to be isolated. This strategy allows the rest of the Framework to function fully as intended, transparently. We demonstrate our strategy with a case study on Android System Services, and show four applications of PINPOINTed system services functioning with unmodified market apps. Our evaluation results show that practical security and privacy advantages can be gained using our approach, without inducing the problematic side-effects that other general-purpose designs must address.

The relationships between working memory capacity, the IPs, and speech accuracy were also measured. Twenty-four EHA users (with mild to moderate hearing impairment) and 24 ENH individuals participated in the present study. Despite the use of their regular hearing aids, the EHA users had delayed IPs and were less accurate in identifying consonants and words compared with the ENH individuals.

Finally, there were no significant between-group differences in terms of IPs or accuracy for final word identification in highly predictable sentences.

Both participant groups achieved ceiling levels in terms of accuracy in the audiovisual identification of gated speech stimuli; however, the EHA group needed longer IPs for the audiovisual identification of consonants and words. The benefit of adding visual cues to auditory speech stimuli was more evident in the EHA group, as audiovisual presentation significantly shortened the IPs for consonants, words, and final words in less predictable sentences; in the ENH group, audiovisual presentation only shortened the IPs for consonants and words. In conclusion, although the audiovisual benefit was greater for EHA group, this group had inferior performance compared with the ENH group in terms of IPs when supportive semantic context was lacking. Consequently, EHA users needed the initial part of the audiovisual speech signal to be longer than did their counterparts with normal hearing to reach the same level of accuracy {{in the absence of a}} semantic context.
