40|$|This study {{investigated}} the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards’ (NBPTS) assessment process in order to identify, quantify, and substantiate learning outcomes from the participants. One hundred and twenty candidates for the Adolescent and Young Adult Science (AYA Science) Certificate were studied {{over a two-year period}} using the recurrent <b>institutional</b> <b>cycle</b> research design. This quasi-experimental methodology allowed for the collection of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data insuring a good measure of internal validity regarding observed changes between individual and across group means. Transcripts of structured interviews with each teacher were scored by multiple assessors according to the 13 standards of NBPTS’ framework for accomplished science teaching. These scores provided the quantitative evidence of teacher learning in this study. Significant pre-intervention to post-intervention changes to these individual and group means are reported as learning outcomes from the assessment process. Findings suggest that the intervention had significant impact upon candidates’ understanding of knowledge associated with science teaching with an overall effect size of 0. 47. Standards associated with greatest gains include Scientific Inquiry and Assessment. The results support the claim that the certification process is an effective standards based professional learning opportunity comparable to other human improvement interventions from related domains. Drawing on qualitative data, we also explore three possible implications of teacher learning outcomes from certification upon classroom practice identified as Dynamic, Technical, and Deferred. These patterns suggest that more than one kind of learning may be taking place in relation to board certification. The discussion then considers the importance of this study for policy making and science teaching communities...|$|E
30|$|This essay {{focuses on}} the {{strategic}} and <b>institutional</b> <b>cycles</b> of problem setting and solving. These cycles are the least well developed, but unless people continually work on these particular problems to frame project and process development, innovators in complex eco-systems cannot take advantage of emergence. And so they cannot innovate very well at all. “Strategic and institutional” managers include the managers of the many businesses in the innovation system along with those in many other agencies, public and private, who work on pulling resources together to enhance, commercialize, make better use of, and rethink opportunities. I also rely on examples from bio-pharmaceuticals to illustrate points, but hope that those interested in other complex innovation eco-systems can think about applying these ideas to their domains as well.|$|R

30|$|Three {{research}} thrusts {{will enable}} the development and integration of the strategic and <b>institutional</b> <b>cycles</b> of problem setting and solving. One thrust is to examine how to strategize across multiple players. Technology and innovation management researchers have developed considerable insight into systems of innovation (e.g., clusters, industry platforms, network innovators), and can start to apply these ideas to complex innovation. It seems likely that complex innovation eco-systems {{need to focus on}} concrete problems so that participants can tinker with possibilities and alternatives. Ansell (2011) explains that in pragmatism, which relates to abductive reasoning, meaning depends on hands-on experiments that confront concrete problems. He argues that problems disrupt existing assumptions, call for fresh discovery, and pin disputes about principles down to particulars. Research can explore how concrete problem solving works in complex eco-systems, and what other kinds of relational elements are needed to keep participants engaged for the long term.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how {{an interdisciplinary}} analysis may contribute {{insight into how}} literary and policy discourses construct the life experiences {{of people who have}} mental disabilities that impair their ability to communicate their own life stories. Chapter One explains why a more comprehensive understanding of the cultural construction of mental disability may be achieved by exploring interdisciplinary relationships between social work, disability studies and literary theory. Subsequent chapters examine theoretical assumptions and frameworks associated with these contributing disciplines in greater detail, across systematic and interpretive analytic approaches. In addition, key concepts and questions relevant to constructing a vocabulary that facilitates collaboration between the contributing disciplines are considered. This literature review informs a methodology for undertaking an interpretive discourse analysis of pertinent policy and novels that depict disability within the context of Ontario's 'Institutional Cycle'. Specifically, the research attempts to answer the following questions: What is the relationship between the representation of mental disability in literary narratives and public policy discourses about mental disability; and, how may an interdisciplinary analysis of literary and policy discourses inform policy planning and the provision of services for people with mental disabilities in Ontario? Chapters 6 - 8 analyze the literary and policy data across Establishment, Reform and Dismantlement phases of the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Cycle</b> to arrive at a set of findings and recommendations that explain relationships between policy and novels across the phases of the Cycle. Finally, key themes for consideration in policy planning for people with mental disabilities are identified as priorities for action in an emerging 'post-institutional' era, in Ontario.

40|$|This study {{examines}} institutional change in forest management in Tlalmanalco, Mexico, {{over the period}} 1877 [...] 1999 based on qualitative methods. The level of analysis is the domain of forest management, a level of analysis intermediary between macro/national policy and micro/local organizations and groups. I examine the domain composed of local organizations stakeholders in forest management in Tlalmanalco. The dual research methods include (1) a contextualist approach revealing long institutional cycles {{over the long run}} (1877 [...] 1996) while (2) grounded theory procedures reveal micro-processus of institutional change in the transition period 1996 [...] 1999. At the macro level, I have identified three institutional cycles of forest management: (1) the entrepreneur elite cycle (1877 [...] 1910); (2) the community-based management (1910 [...] 1940); and (3) the centralized industrial cycle (1940 [...] 1991). Each <b>institutional</b> <b>cycle</b> represents a management template which includes: (1) a management philosophy, (2) a dominant organizational template, (3) a configuration of interorganizational relations, (4) included groups, (5) excluded groups and (6) blind spots. At the micro-institutional level, the detailed study of the change process (1996 [...] 1999) in forest management reveals that two forms of interorganizational collaborations co-exist in the current domain. First, transformational collaboration is a form of open participation coordinated around charismatic leadership, and based on shared values. It aims to build a collective vision for the future of forest management. Second, transactional collaboration is a form of participation restricted to specific tasks, coordinated by the exchange of material and expertise resources. The contributions of this ideographic study highlight two themes neglected so far by previous research on institutional change. First, this study shows the links between policies formulated at the macro/national level and their implications at the micro/local level. Second, it explores the process of institutional change between two long term institutional cycles...|$|E

The assumed comparability in this 2 ̆ 2 recurrent <b>institutional</b> <b>cycle</b> design 2 ̆ 2 was increased by establishing that the succeeding classes did not differ substantially in age or IQ. Stanford Achievement Test (1982) reading scores were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD procedures. At each grade level, data were analyzed, first, for the total population of at-risk students and, second, by controlling for the teacher variable. ^ Significant differences (MANOVA, p =. 0001) were demonstrated for the 1986 - 87 first grade samples. Significant differences (ANOVA, p =. 0001) were also demonstrated for all reading subtests of the 1986 - 87 first grade samples. A significant difference (MANOVA, p =. 038) was shown for the teacher controlled portion of the second grade study. Sub-test differences were as follows: word study skills, p =. 08; word reading, p =. 014; reading comprehension, p =. 042; and total reading, p =. 006. No significant differences were identified for the second grade sample in the full study or for the third grade sample in the full study and the teacher-controlled study. ^ Total reading achievement test scores of Project Read students in both studies were compared to those reported in the literature on tutoring using effect size. Effect size of the 1986 - 87 Project Read first grade students in both the full (2. 37) and teacher-controlled (1. 55) studies fell well within the expected range. Effect sizes of the 1985 - 86 Project Reading first grade students and 1986 - 87 second and third grade Project Read students failed to fall within the range reported for tutoring instruction. ...|$|E

40|$|The 2003 International Handbook of Curriculum Research, {{edited by}} William Pinar, represents, as he says, “the first move in {{postulating}} {{the architecture of}} a worldwide field of curriculum studies” (Pinar, 2003, p. 1). In this new academic world, curricularists have two new tasks: the first task is to begin an international dialogue, a “complicated conversation that is the internationalisation of curriculum studies {{and the formation of}} a worldwide field” (Ibid., p. IX); the second task is to create a movement “toward the internationalization of curriculum studies” because, as he recognises, writing notes {{on the state of the}} field, “internationalization” is one of those specialisations in which the curriculum studies field is organised (Pinar, 2007, p. XXV). If internationalisation does not mean globalisation, we’ll be careful to analyze its signification, namely when globalisation is a movement towards uniformatisation and standardisation of decisions’ criteria concerned with knowledge and learning outcomes, having as a guideline the purpose to create more similarities than differences among schools. In a time of meaningful change, globalisation means increasing homogenisation and leads us to this question: “Are curriculum and instruction in fact becoming more similar around the world? ” (Anderson-Levitt, 2008, p. 349). The answer must be multiple, and any perspective will include the study of the national as category-in-change. The cross-national study of curriculum is a first step to understanding the global changes and to recognizing how the national is intersected by international parameters. In this text, we take as a starting point the mapping of Portuguese perspectives, focusing on four main aspects, contributing to the intellectual history of the curriculum field in Portugal, and thus to its disciplinarity through the establishment of a nationally distinctive curriculum studies field (Pinar, 2007). The first of these aspects regards the genesis of the curriculum field in Portugal. We intend to analyze the conditions of its emergence, related to a school-based curricular tradition and its consolidation through an academic curricular tradition. Secondly, we will refer to the development of curriculum research, approached from the perspective of three cycles: the political, academic, and <b>institutional</b> <b>cycles.</b> Thirdly, we will direct our attention towards the process of Europeanisation that has been taking place in recent years. Because Portugal is a semi-peripheral country, the European agenda has a strong and incisive impact in educational policies. Lastly, we will focus on the didactisation 1 that has been a focal point for the return of the curriculum field to neo-Tylerian approaches, stressing the resignification and commodification of school knowledge. As we foresee, the discussion on the curriculum field will be increasingly influenced by “standards,” we believe the study of the genesis and consolidation of an international curriculum field may contribute not only to analyses focused on specific settings, but also for the construction of an international field built upon the diversity and the recognition of realities, that, in many ways, are intersected...|$|R

However, the observed life cycle {{may be explained by}} the inclusion of concepts from old and new institutional economics and from functional economics. Three distinct periods may be identified. During the "blood" period of forced development and autocratic rule, the information system and the system of property rights were roughly compatible with the economic structure. Then, in the "sweat" period, an attempt to overtake the capitalistic societies failed. Finally, in the "tears" period, economic decline could only be disguised by unsustainable inflows of foreign capital.

The researcher explores the relationships between value chains, intellectual property rights, institutional innovation, and technology transfer in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. The researcher employs a case study methodology that builds on three theoretical frameworks: institutional development in Africa, management theory for institutions adapting in uncertainty, and institutional innovation for development. Data were collected from key informants representing stakeholders along the wheat value chain in Tanzania. These {{data were analyzed using}} a value chain approach to understand decisions of value chain actors (both public and private sector) in in relation to one another. The analysis provides clarity to stakeholders to understand how recent legislation on plant variety protection will impact agricultural development and smallholder farmers in the wheat value chain. It provides a framework for showing how premium for improved wheat varieties can be distributed to actors along the value chain and benefit the entire chain without disadvantage to smallholder farmers. The framework contains both qualitative and quantitative indicators that allow for longitudinal monitoring of the value chain to understand the effects of intellectual property on smallholder communities. It delineates the network effects of institutional innovation and the <b>institutional</b> innovation <b>cycle</b> and how these impact development in Tanzania...|$|R

As charity toward foundlings became a political priority, the patrons and supporters of foundling hospitals turned to visual culture to help them make their charitable work understandable to a wide audience. Focusing on four institutions in central Italy that possess significant surviving visual and archival material, Visual Cultures of Foundling Care in Renaissance Italy examines the discursive processes through which foundling care was identified, conceptualized, and promoted.

40|$|Based on a 4 -year ethnographic {{study of}} conference interpreters {{working for the}} EU institutions’ {{interpreting}} services, the book describes conference interpreting as a practice, that is, the ‘lived work’ (Clancey 2006) of professionals. This approach builds {{on the idea that}} conference interpreters do not perform their job in isolation, but in a team with colleagues and in a wider social and organizational framework which shapes the conditions under which they work and the professional requirements put upon them. Its attention to the social and institutional embedding of conference interpreting also reflects recent developments in Translation Studies. These have resulted in an increased focus on interpreters as social agents and a new openness to interdisciplinary research (Pöchhacker 2009). The study was motivated by the gap that interpreter trainers and institutional recruiters observe between, on the one hand, the level of competence acquired by graduates who are successful in EU accreditation tests and, on the other hand, that which is needed to perform adequately in EU interpreting assignments. Drawing on documentary evidence, interview data and field notes resulting from observant participation of interpreters working for the interpreting services of the European Commission (DG SCIC) and the European Parliament (DG INTE), the book first describes how EU interpreters are employed by the interpreting DGs of the European Commission and the European Parliament in a highly institutionalized and complex environment. It demonstrates that, although they are divided into various subgroups along organizational (DG SCIC vs. DG INTE), administrative (ACIs/freelancers vs. officials) and linguistic (based on A-language) lines, the specific characteristics of their work context define them as a community of practice (Wenger 1998) with a joint professional mission. Both gate-keeping (accreditation tests and staff competitions) and quality standards are shown to be mainly managed by members of the community itself. Subsequently, a series of major distinctive features of EU interpreting work and their implications for the knowledge and skills required of practitioners are discussed. First, {{as a result of the}} EU’s policy of multilingualism, large language regimes are common in EU meetings. As these involve extensive recourse to retour and relay interpreting, insight in the implications of the information provided on the team sheet and proficiency in the interaction with the simultaneous interpreting equipment are indispensable for interpreters. Second, meeting types and subject fields vary across space (i. e. the working places and buildings of the various institutions served by the EU interpreting services) and time (i. e. according to <b>institutional</b> <b>cycles).</b> Under these conditions, it is essential not only to acquire familiarity with the material context, but also to develop the ability to recognize the links between the spatio-temporal situation and the characteristics of interpreting assignments. Third, within meetings, several meeting activities can be distinguished, each of them associated with specific types of interaction and discourse. For EU interpreters it is essential to be able to understand the implications of the meeting agenda, i. e. to link agenda items to various meeting activities in order to gauge the characteristics of the interpreting assignment. Fourth, both interpreting services have developed an array of dedicated ICT tools for advance consultation of meeting documents, terminology research, etc., which EU interpreters need to master. By examining the ways the EU interpreting DGs define categories of interpreter employees as ‘beginners’ and ‘newcomers’ and how the DGs regulate such employees’ eligibility for specific support measures, the study reveals how formal and informal arrangements contribute to creating or restricting individuals’ opportunities for situated learning. Drawing on interview and observational data reflecting differences in the skills and knowledge of beginning and experienced interpreters, it argues that interpreting competence is situated (i. e. bounded to a specific working context) and includes not only cognitive, but also embodied and social components. An examination of the opportunities for learning offered by participation in the practice shows that, for EU interpreters, situated learning is a necessary complement to formal conference interpreting training in that it allows them to become familiar with the shared repertoire of knowledge and skills required to cope with their task. Finally, the study demonstrates how the multidimensional concept of competence which emerges from a practice view contributes to a better understanding of the problems beginning interpreters face. A multimodal analysis of the way on-mic work is distributed among boothmates in a sample of EU meetings shows how Dutch booth interpreters draw on a complex of cognitive, social and embodied skills in order to apply shared professional and moral values in the course of an assignment. ...|$|R
