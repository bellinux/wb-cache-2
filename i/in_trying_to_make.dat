5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
25|$|After a 10-year hiatus, Coppola {{returned}} to directing with Youth Without Youth in 2007, {{based on the}} novella {{of the same name}} by Romanian author Mircea Eliade. The film was poorly reviewed, currently holding a 30% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was made for about $19 million and was given a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office. As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films {{in order to avoid the}} marketing input that goes into most films that results <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> films appeal to too wide an audience.|$|E
25|$|With the scored tied 3–3 in {{the second}} quarter, the Bears {{executed}} a halfback option play at the Redskins' 19-yard line, with running back Walter Payton throwing a 19-yard touchdown to Pat Dunsmore. Then on the second play in the third period, Bears wide receiver Willie Gault caught a short pass from quarterback Steve Fuller, evaded Redskins defensive back Darrell Green who was too aggressive <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an interception, and turned upfield for a 75-yard touchdown. Redskins running back John Riggins capped off a 74-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run then cut the lead, 16–10. But a roughing the passer penalty call against Ken Coffey set up Dennis McKinnon's 16-yard reception to cap a Chicago 77-yard scoring drive to push their lead back to 13 at 23–10.|$|E

500|$|In 1918 Admiral Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya became {{rear admiral}} of the fleet, and he {{determined}} {{to use the}} fleet to attack the Otranto Barrage. On 8 June 1918 he took Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen south with a small supporting flotilla; {{on the evening of}} 9 June, Szent István and Tegetthoff followed. <b>In</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> maximum speed in order to catch up, Szent Istváns turbines started to overheat and speed had to be reduced to [...] When an attempt was made to raise more steam in order to increase to [...] Szent István produced an excess of smoke, attracting the attention of a pair of patrolling Italian torpedo boats at 3.20a.m. on 10 June. MAS-21 attacked Tegetthoff, but one of her torpedoes failed to leave the launch tube and the other failed to explode. MAS-15 however hit Szent István with two torpedoes at 3:31a.m. Tegetthoff returned to the scene to take Szent István in tow. An attempt to beach the ship on nearby Molat Island (northwest of Zara) was considered, but the ship was taking on too much water. At 6:12am, with the pumps unequal to the task, Szent István capsized, taking 89 of her crew with her. The last half-hour of the sinking was filmed in stages from Tegetthoff . (It was one of only two battleship sinkings on the high seas to ever be filmed, the other being that of the British battleship [...] in World War II.) Fearing further attacks by torpedo boats or destroyers from the Italian navy, his element of surprise now compromised, Admiral Horthy called off the attack and the fleet returned to base {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

I gave him kind of nine or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn't read any more about Asperger's because I think there is no typical person who has Asperger's syndrome, and they're as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society.

2500|$|Thus, {{by showing}} the terms [...] "gender" [...] and [...] "sex" [...] as {{socially}} and culturally constructed, Butler offers {{a critique of}} both terms, even {{as they have been}} used by feminists. Butler argued that feminism made a mistake <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> [...] "women" [...] a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler said this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations because it allows for two distinct categories: men and women. [...] Butler believes that feminists should not try to define [...] "women" [...] and she also believes that feminists should [...] "focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement." [...] Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be [...] "flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors". The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as a performance, not an essence, is one of the foundations of Queer theory.|$|E
2500|$|Dallas is {{devoid of}} any major street grid as a whole, though {{a number of major}} {{attempts}} intersect at awkward angles and in confusing interchanges around the city. [...] The main street grid in the center city runs 45° to the typical N/S/E/W grid, creating confusion for many out-of-town visitors. [...] This street grid prevails primarily in east Dallas, though it also permeates Oak Lawn, portions of downtown, and the Cedars. [...] Another much smaller street grid lies downtown between Pacific and Young streets [...] it is about 15° off the typical N/S/E/W grid, and is on average 5-8 streets across N/S and about [...] wide E/W. [...] There is also a fairly extensive N/S/E/W grid around the original city of Oak Cliff. [...] The rest of Dallas, developed {{from the middle of the}} 20th century on, is typically on a N/S/E/W grid, especially with major thoroughfares. [...] <b>In</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the city traversable, city planners have over time created wide boulevards that jump between the rights-of-way of multiple minor streets, trying to force a wide road wherever they can discover space for it. [...] This forces the destruction of the minor streets' original paths, a name-change for the boulevard or minor streets, and roads (e.g. , , [...] ) that exist in two or more places. [...] Major thoroughfares in Oak Cliff typically do not cross the Trinity River, and when they do, they frequently do not continue with the same name on the north or eastern sides, which creates a degree of confusion. [...] Also, many times a street will change names each time it crosses a municipal border. Conversely, many streets keep their names through sharp turns across the city.|$|E
