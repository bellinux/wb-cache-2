5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The <b>extra</b> <b>toe</b> on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E

Furthermore, this population also showed differences in growth and reproduction. Multiple genes have been implicated in causing extra digits in several other species. Using comparative genomics as a guide many of these genes were expected to map on pig chromosome 18. Pig chromosome 18 is the smallest pig autosome on which there has been limited research. Candidate genes on pig chromosome 18 were mapped to ensure their location using Iowa State University’s Berkshire by Yorkshire resource population.

50|$|This is an {{autosomal}} mutation {{that gives}} embryos webbing between the inner two front toes on each foot, {{in addition to}} the usual characteristics of diplopodia. Almost all of the embryos survive to the end of incubation, but they are unable to clear the fluid from their lungs or absorb the blood from their extraembryonic vessels. These problems always prevent them from hatching. Almost all diplopodia-5 embryos have only one or two <b>extra</b> <b>toes</b> on each foot, so this mutation causes the least extreme foot malformation.|$|R

40|$|Reductions in {{the number}} of digits have {{occurred}} frequently during tetrapod evolution. Further reductions {{in the number}} of limb bones have also occurred, including the complete elimination of limbs in, for example, snakes and caecilians. Strikingly, an evolutionary reversal of limb reduction has never occurred 1, 2. This is puzzling when one considers that mutations for POLYDACTYLY (see Glossary) are particularly common. In humans, for example, the most common anomaly at birth is the presence of an <b>extra</b> <b>toe</b> or finger 3, 4 (0. 1 – 0. 2 %). The extra digit can be rudimentary, or fully formed and functional.

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the [...] "hamburger-feet" [...] {{polydactyly}} gene {{is associated with}} the gene for radial hypoplasia (RH). The 1995 European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals considers RH an impairing condition. In a scandal in the late 1990s, an experimental breeder in Texas tried to perpetuate this deformity as the [...] "Twisty Cat" [...] breed. Mild RH can cause the post-axial form of polydactyly - enlarged paws, <b>extra</b> three-jointed <b>toes</b> on the outer, little-toe side of the paws, and no thumb. X-rays can determine the structure of the <b>extra</b> <b>toes</b> and whether the cat has the gene for RH. Cats with the gene for RH should never be bred. Cats with severe RH have unusually short front legs. They move like a ferret and they tend to sit like a squirrel or kangaroo and are colloquially known as squittens. In some RH cats, the forelegs are twisted with the long bones either severely shortened or absent. All polydactyl cats are banned from German cat shows, possibly because of confusion with the impairing form of polydactyly associated with RH.|$|R
5000|$|Polydactyly is a {{spontaneous}} complex phenotypic variation, developed in one generation. In the concrete preaxial {{form of the}} Hemingway mutant the variation is induced by a single point mutation in a noncoding cis-regulatory element for Shh. In an extensive phenotypic variation like this, one or more complete digits at each single limb are developed including nerves, blood vessels, muscles and ligaments. The physiology of the digits can be perfect. This complex phenotypic result cannot {{be explained by the}} mutation alone. The mutation can only induce the variation. In the consequence of the mutation thousands of events, each different from the wildtype, occur on different organisation layers, i.e. expression changes of other genes, cell-cell signal exchange, cell differentiation, cell and tissue growth. The summarized small random changes on all layers build the raw material and the process steps for the generation of the plastic variation. The mentioned form of polydactyly of the Hemingway mutant shows a biased variation. In a recent empirical study first the number of <b>extra</b> <b>toes</b> of 375 mutant Maine Coon cats were variable (polyphenism) and second, the number of <b>extra</b> <b>toes</b> followed a discontinuous statistical distribution. They were not equally distributed as one might expect of an identical single point mutation. The example demonstrates, that the variation is not explained completely by the mutation alone. [...] The Maine Coon (wildtype: 18 toes) in some cases exhibits polydactyly with 18 toes, were the first toe at the forehand is elongated forming a three phalangeal thumb. More often 20 toes appear, and in diminishing order we see 22, 24 or 26 toes per individual. Also odd numbers of toes are seen.|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more <b>extra</b> <b>toes</b> on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|R

5000|$|Chickens {{normally}} have an anisodactyl toe arrangement, with one short toe pointing backwards and three long toes pointing forwards. In diplopodia, the feet usually lack the normal hind toe and instead develop {{two to four}} <b>extra</b> <b>toes</b> at various positions between the hock joint and the front toes. The toes are almost always connected to extra tarso-metatarsal bones, though sometimes the toes do not contain any bone. Embryos with diplopodia have been found with numbers of digits on one wing ranging from one to seven, while normal embryos have three digits per wing. Diplopod limb buds first differ visibly from normal limb buds by their abnormally thick and long apical ectodermal ridges. Diplopodia usually delays the embryonic growth of cartilage, bone, and tendon by two days, particularly in the limbs. Other characteristics frequently seen in diplopodia mutants are shortened wings and legs, short upper beak, and smaller embryo size. [...] Many embryos reach the final embryonic stage but then are unable to hatch, though, diplopod embryos can occasionally hatch and mature.|$|R

500|$|Like {{almost all}} members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and {{retractable}} claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth [...] "finger". This special feature of the front paws, {{on the inside of the}} wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly (<b>extra</b> <b>toes</b> and claws). These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North America.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the story, Benjamin Wellman, who lives with his mother and his grandfather, brings back a puppy and asks to keep it as a pet. His domineering grandfather refuses to let the puppy stay because his own seven-toed cat, Seventoes is afraid of dogs. After Grandfathers’ refusal, Benjamin takes the puppy to Sammy, who had previously mentioned {{that he would like to}} keep the dog if Benjamin’s grandfather wouldn’t let him. Benjamin then started back for home, angry that he wasn’t allowed to keep the dog. When he arrived home, he saw Seventoes sitting on the ledge of the well. In his anger, he shoved Seventoes into the well. Benjamin watched Seventoes disappear under the water and was shocked when he realizes what he had done. Remorseful, he runs into the house and confesses to his grandfather and his mother that he had killed Seventoes. Grandfather sent mother to fish the cat out of the well, but before she could do it, Seventoes walked into the house, unhurt, because his <b>extra</b> <b>toes</b> had enabled him to climb up the well. Benjamin sobbed with relief and expresses his remorse. That night, he fed Seventoes and vowed that he would behave well in the future.|$|R
40|$|The major locus for {{dominant}} preaxial polydactyly {{in humans}} has been mapped to 7 q 36.

The Lmbr 1 gene is entirely within the small critical intervals recently defined {{for both the}} mouse and human mutations and is misexpressed at the exact time that the mouse Hx phenotype becomes apparent during limb development. This result suggests that Lmbr 1 may underlie preaxial polydactyly in both mice and humans. We have used deletion chromosomes {{to demonstrate that the}} dominant mouse and human limb defects arise from gain-of-function mutations and not from haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, we created a loss-of-function mutation in the mouse Lmbr 1 gene that causes digit number reduction (oligodactyly) on its own and in trans to a deletion chromosome. The loss of digits that we observed in mice with reduced Lmbr 1 activity is in contrast to the gain of digits observed in Hx mice and human polydactyly patients. Our results suggest that the Lmbr 1 gene is required for limb formation and that reciprocal changes in levels of Lmbr 1 activity can lead to either increases or decreases in the number of digits in the vertebrate limb...|$|R
