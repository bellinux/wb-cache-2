25|$|Participants in {{the trial}} were {{recruited}} when they sought medical care at general medical or psychiatric clinics. No advertising was used to recruit subjects {{in order to maximize}} the <b>generalizability</b> <b>of</b> the study results. Participants were required to have a minimum score of 14 point on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) in order to be enrolled {{in the trial}}. Generally accepted cutoffs are 7–17 points for mild depression, 18–24 points for moderate depression, and ≥ 24 for severe depression. The average participant baseline HAM-D17 score was 22. The pre-specified primary endpoint of this trial was remission as determined by the HAM-D score, with all patients with missing scores rated as non-responders. In the aftermath of the trial, the investigators have presented the results mainly using the secondary endpoint of remission according to the QIDS-SR16 Score, which tend to be somewhat higher.|$|E

This paper reports the results <b>of</b> a <b>generalizability</b> theory study <b>of</b> cognitive demand and rigor ratings of assessment items and college-readiness standards {{in the context of}} an alignment study of college admissions tests to a set of college readiness standards. Results indicate a higher level <b>of</b> <b>generalizability</b> for Math item and standard ratings than for English item and standard ratings, as well as a higher level <b>of</b> <b>generalizability</b> for cognitive demand ratings than for rigor ratings. Results also suggest that the standard of 5 - 6 raters in alignment studies may be insufficient for obtaining desired reliability. These findings may be used to carefully plan more robust alignment studies in the future so that higher levels of reliability across raters will be attained...|$|R
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} synthetic lethality as an efficacious anti-cancer strategy is continually improving. Recently, {{the applicability of}} synthetic lethality to targeted cancer therapy has heightened due to the recent work of scientists including Ronald A. DePinho and colleagues, in what is termed 'collateral lethality'. Muller et al. found that passenger genes, with chromosomal proximity to tumor suppressor genes, are collaterally deleted in some cancers. Thus, the identification of collaterally deleted redundant genes carrying out an essential cellular function may be the untapped reservoir for then pursing a synthetic lethality approach. Collateral lethality therefore holds great potential in identification of novel and selective therapeutic targets in oncology. In 2012, Muller et al. identified that homozygous deletion of redundant-essential glycolytic ENO1 gene in human glioblastoma (GBM) is the consequence of proximity to 1p36 tumor suppressor locus deletions and may hold potential for a synthetic lethality approach to GBM inhibition. ENO1 {{is one of three}} homologous genes (ENO2, ENO3) that encodes the mammalian alpha-enolase enzyme. ENO2, which encodes enolase 2, is mostly expressed in neural tissues, leading to the postulation that in ENO1-deleted GBM, ENO2 may be the ideal target as the redundant homologue of ENO1. Muller found that both genetic and pharmacological ENO2 inhibition in GBM cells with homozygous ENO1 deletion elicits a synthetic lethality outcome by selective killing of GBM cells). In 2016, Muller and colleagues discovered antibiotic SF2312 as a highly potent nanomolar-range enolase inhibitor which preferentially inhibits glioma cell proliferation and glycolytic flux in ENO1-deleted cells. SF2312 was shown to be more efficacious than pan-enolase inhibitor PhAH and have more specificity for ENO2 inhibition over ENO1. Subsequent work by the same team showed that the same approach could be applied to pancreatic cancer, whereby homozygously deleted SMAD4 results in the collateral deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2), an oxidative decarboxylase essential for redox homeostasis. Dey et al. show that ME2 genomic deletion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells results in high endogenous reactive oxygen species, consistent with KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer, and essentially primes ME2-null cells for synthetic lethality by depletion of redundant NAD(P)+-dependent isoform ME3. The effects of ME3 depletion were found to be mediated by inhibition of de novo nucleotide synthesis resulting from AMPK activation and mitochondrial ROS-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, Oike et al. demonstrated the <b>generalizability</b> <b>of</b> the concept by targeting redundant essential-genes in process other than metabolism, namely the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 subunits in the chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{reasoning}} is situation-dependent and case-specific; therefore, assessments incorporating different patient presentations are warranted. The present study aimed {{to determine the}} reliability of a multi-station case-based viva assessment of clinical reasoning in an Australian pre-registration osteopathy program using generalizability theory. Students (from years 4 and 5) and examiners were recruited from the osteopathy program at Southern Cross University, Lismore, Australia. The study took place on a single day in the student teaching clinic. Examiners were trained before the examination. Students were allocated to 1 of 3 rounds consisting of 5 10 -minute stations in an objective structured clinical examination-style. Generalizability {{analysis was used to}} explore the reliability of the examination. Fifteen students and 5 faculty members participated in the study. The examination produced a <b>generalizability</b> coefficient <b>of</b> 0. 53, with 18 stations required to achieve a <b>generalizability</b> coefficient <b>of</b> 0. 80.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: When health varies over time, the {{standard}} quality-adjusted life year model operates under {{the assumptions of}} time utility independence within each health state and additive independence between health states. These assumptions can be relaxed by an integral assessment of disease severity over time. The authors present the annual profile method (APM), which values health profiles on a 1 -year base, and test the APM for feasibility, consistency, and test-retest reliability. METHODS: A population panel, general practitioners, medical advisers, and a panel of the Dutch Consumers Association valued vignettes for 46 disease stages using the visual analog scale (VAS) and time tradeoff (TTO) methods. Vignettes contained disease-specific information, a generic description (EQ- 6 D 5 L), {{a description of the}} disease course over time, and a visual representation of the disease. Feasibility was tested by missing and inconsistent responses. Consistency between and within panels was tested with a <b>generalizability</b> study, analysis <b>of</b> variance, and standard correlation coefficients. Test-retest reliability was tested with a generalizability study and intra-class correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Missing and inconsistent responses were < 2. 6 %. The valuations were consistent across panels, with <b>generalizability</b> coefficients <b>of</b> 0. 78 (VAS) and 0. 64 (TTO). Within the main population panel, internal consistency was satisfactory and the influence of background characteristics negligible. Test-retest reliability was high, with <b>generalizability</b> coefficients <b>of</b> 0. 90 (VAS) and 0. 72 (TTO). CONCLUSION: Feasibility and reliability of the APM for realistic health profiles are good to excellent. The APM is a promising step {{to bridge the gap between}} the quality-adjusted life year methodology and clinical realit...|$|R

On the one hand,the framework affirms the bounds within which statistical,sampling-based generalizability is legitimate. On the other hand,the framework indicates ways in which researchers in information systems and other fields may properly lay claim to generalizability,and thereby broader relevance,even when their inquiry falls outside the bounds of sampling-based research...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how aggregated data which allow for generalizable insights can be generated from single-case based qualitative investigations. Thereby, two central challenges of qualitative social research are outlined: First, researchers must ensure that the single-case data can be aggregated and condensed so that new collective structures can be detected. Second, they must apply methods and practices to allow for the generalization of the results beyond the specific study. In the following, we demonstrate how and under what conditions these challenges can be addressed in research practice. To this end, the research process of the construction of an empirically based typology is described. A qualitative study, conducted {{within the framework of the}} Luxembourg Youth Report, is used to illustrate this process. Specifically, strategies are presented which increase the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>generalizability</b> or transferability <b>of</b> the results, while also highlighting their limitations...|$|R
