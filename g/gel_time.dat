40|$|PhD thesis in Petroleum engineeringAlkaline sodium {{silicate}} (Na-silicate) is addressed {{to be applied}} for in-depth water conformance control in sandstone reservoirs containing high permeability layers. The main factors affecting the <b>gel</b> <b>time,</b> strength and shrinkage in the alkaline silicate systems are the Na-silicate content, the pH, the presence of divalent ions and temperature. Divalent ions, e. g., Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, reduced the <b>gel</b> <b>time</b> and increased the gel strength and shrinkage. They also caused metal silicate precipitation at high concentrations. No precipitation formed with low-salinity water (25 -times diluted seawater), {{which makes it a}} possible option for preflushing reservoir in field application. Temperature accelerated the <b>gel</b> <b>time</b> but the gel strength was shown to be reduced as temperature increased from 20 to 50 °C. Further increase in the temperature to 80 °C showed a slight increase of the gel strength. This may be attributed to increase of silicate solubility at high temperature. High shear rates, even for a short interval before gelation (which resembles the wellbore case), accelerated gel time; hence must be considered in field applications. A simple graphical method was suggested to estimate the combined effects of different factors on the <b>gel</b> <b>time</b> and strength. Dynamic adsorption of silicate in sand-packs was considerably lower than the estimated mono-layer adsorption.

30|$|As {{pointed out}} by [2], the {{desirable}} properties of a good grouting material are controllable <b>gel</b> <b>time,</b> low initial viscosity and durability. The durability of grouted silica depends on both mechanical and chemical interactions. The design methodology used for grouting {{is also an important}} factor.

This means that in order to have proper execution of a demanding grouting (such as a post grouting where the hydraulic gradient can be large) the design needs to incorporate the temperature. To achieve efficient grouting the grouted silica sol volume must be optimized by taking account of the applied pressure and <b>gel</b> <b>time.</b> The longer the <b>gel</b> <b>time,</b> and the higher the pressure, the longer is the penetration length and hence the grouted volume is increased.|$|E

The Saltstone Variability Study should include the variable of ''mix temperature'' in the experimental design. Examples are presented in this report that clearly demonstrate a pronounced dependence of the fresh grout properties on ''mix temperature''. One example, using mixes made with the Deliquification, Dissolution and Adjustment (DDA) simulant, shows that the properties of <b>gel</b> <b>time</b> and bleed water are highly mix temperature dependent. The <b>gel</b> <b>time</b> increased from 15 minutes at 10 C to 90 minutes at 35 C with most of the change occurring between 20 and 30 C.

The volume percent bleed water for these mixes increased from {approx} 1 % at 10 C to 13 % at 35 C.

40|$|Urea-formaldehyde resin (UFR), one of {{chemical}} grouts {{in which the}} major ingredients are urea-formaldehyde and resin, is widely used in Chinese coal mines grouting. The gel characteristics of urea-formaldehyde resin (UFR) chemical grout under static conditions have been studied by many researchers. However, there is little research carried out on the gel characteristics under shear flow conditions. In fact, chemical grout like UFR keeps in shear flow conditions before gelling in the grouting process. In order to investigate the gel characteristics of UFR in shear flow conditions, an apparatus which consists of a magnetic stirrer and a viscometer was established. Magnetic stirrer was used to shear UFR at different velocity. Then the changes of UFR viscosity could be recorded by viscometer. As a result, the gel characteristics were summarized under different shear rates, and a formula of gelling is derived. The {{results show that the}} grouting flow rate influences the <b>gelling</b> <b>time.</b> Faster flow rates will cause longer <b>gelling</b> <b>time,</b> which means that the time for the grout to gel during the flowing process under shear flow conditions is longer than that under static conditions...|$|R
40|$|Dispersions of {{a totally}} {{dispersible}} AlOOH powder have been studied. The {{effect of the}} initial composition has been studied to outline the reactions that determine the final rheological behaviour of the dispersions. The final viscosity and viscoelastic properties of the dispersions {{are determined by the}} sol–gel phenomena occurring during the ageing treatment. Gel formation is favoured by low water and high acid contents, while it is disfavoured by prolonged stirring. <b>Gelling</b> <b>time</b> from 48 h to 4 months has been observed depending on the initial composition...|$|R
