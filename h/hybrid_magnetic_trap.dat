Specifically, we present studies of the coherence of the ensemble in the hybrid trap and during the evolution in the waveguide by means of an autocorrelation interferometer scheme. By monitoring the expansion of the ensemble in the waveguide we observe a mean field dominated acceleration on a much longer time scale than in the free 3 D expansion. Both the autocorrelation interference and the pure expansion measurements are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the ensemble dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{atomtronics}} aims to develop a new paradigm for the use of ultracold atomic systems in a manner that mimics the functionality of electronic circuits and devices. Given the ubiquity of the electronic transistor and its application to a vast array of signal processing tasks, the development of its atomtronic counterpart is of significant interest. This dissertation presents the experimental studies of two atomtronic circuit elements: a battery and transistor. Experiments are conducted in an atom-chip-based apparatus utilizing <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> and optical <b>trapping</b> techniques that enable one to 2 ̆ 2 pattern 2 ̆ 2 atomtronic circuit elements. An atomtronic battery is realized in a double-well trapping potential in which a finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate is prepared in a non-equilibrium state to generate thermodynamic gradients that drive atom current flow. Powered by the atomtronic battery, a triple-well atomtronic transistor is demonstrated, and quasi-steady-state behavior of the device is characterized. Results are found to be in agreement with a semiclassical model of the transistor that is also used to study the active properties of the device, including current gain. Based on these results, future directions regarding signal processing operations are proposed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{construction}} of a novel apparatus for experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices: the Fermi gas microscope. Improving upon similar designs for bosonic atoms, our Fermi gas microscope has the novel feature of being able to achieve single-site resolved imaging of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice; specifically, we use fermionic potassium- 40, sympathetically cooled by bosonic sodium- 23. In this thesis, several milestones on the way to achieving single-site resolution are described and documented. First, we have tested and mounted in place the imaging optics necessary for achieving single-site resolution. We set up separate 3 D magnetooptical traps for capturing and cooling both ²³Na and ⁴⁰K. These species are then trapped simultaneously in a plugged quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> and evaporated to degeneracy; we obtain a sodium Bose-Einstein condensate with about a million atoms and a degenerate potassium cloud cooled to colder than 1 [mu]K. Using magnetic transport over a distance of 1 cm, we move the cold cloud of atoms into place under the high-resolution imaging system and capture it in a <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> and optical-dipole <b>trap.</b> Further evaporation in this hybrid trap performed by lowering the optical trap depth, and the cooled atoms are immersed in an optical lattice, the setup and calibration of which is also described here. Finally, we cool the atoms with optical molasses beams while in the lattice, with the imaging optics collecting the fluoresence light for high-resolution imaging. With molasses cooling set up, single-site fluoresence imaging of bosons and fermions in the same experimental apparatus is within reach. by Vinay Venkatesh Ramasesh. Thesis: M.

40|$|We present {{studies on}} the {{modifications}} in temperature, number density and phase-space density when a laser cooled atom cloud from the optical molasses is trapped in a quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> Theoretically it is shown that for a given temperature {{and size of the}} cloud from the molasses, the phase-space density in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> first increases with magnetic field gradient and then decreases with it, after attaining a maximum value at an optimum value of magnetic field gradient. The experimentally measured variation in phase-space density in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> with the <b>magnetic</b> field gradient has shown the similar trend. However, the experimentally measured values of number density and phase-space density are much lower than their theoretically predicted values. This is attributed to the higher experimentally observed temperature in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> than the theoretically predicted temperature. Nevertheless, these studies can be useful to set a higher phase-space density in the trap by setting the optimum value of field gradient of the quadrupole <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Quantum effects at {{motion of}} ultracold {{neutrons}} in a <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> are actively studied now. In particular, ”magnetic tube” traps [1] {{are used for}} investigation of such effects. According to [1], the periodic set of <b>magnetic</b> <b>traps</b> can be developed. Traps {{in the form of}} ”magnetic tube ” are used for focusing of atomic beams and described in details in [2] {{on the basis of the}} classic motion equations for a particle, possessing the magnetic moment, in a magnetic field. But quantum effects, which appear at neutron motion in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap,</b> can not be described by classic motion equations. The typical radius of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap,</b> which is being designed, is ρ ∼ 10 − 4 cm [1]. Thus, due to large wavelength (λ ∼ 10 − 5 ÷ 10 − 6 cm), motion of the ultracold neutron in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap</b> in the direction, transversal to the axis of the magnetic tube, appears quantized. 1 Quantum effects were studied for neutron motion in a gravitational trap [3]. Neutron motion in such a trap is one-dimensional. But in contrast to [3], transversal motion of neutrons in the ”magnetic tube ” trap with respect to it axes is two-dimensional. As noted below, neutron motion in such a trap is determined by spinindependent effective potential energy, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength square. Thus, let us consider motion of the ultracold neutrons in the tubeshaped <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> The Schrödinger equation, which describes the ultracold neutron in such a trap, is as follows...|$|R
40|$|In this article, hybrid {{factor is}} {{proposed}} for <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> bearing.

Some influencing factors of hybrid factor in <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> bearing, such as the size of the permanent magnet, length of air gap, and area of the stator poles, are analyzed in this article. It can be concluded that larger hybrid factor can be caused by the smaller power loss according to the definition of hybrid factor mentioned above.
