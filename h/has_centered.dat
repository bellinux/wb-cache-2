5|$|Suburban {{development}} {{and the rise of}} long-distance commuting in the 1950s led Marysville to transition toward a service-based economy. One of the largest employers of Marysville residents is the Boeing Company and their Everett assembly plant. While farms still operate in the area around the city, since 1980 the lumber industry has all but ceased and is no longer {{a major factor in the}} local economy. Since the late 1980s, the economy of Marysville <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> around retail areas, including the downtown Marysville Towne Center Mall (opened in 1987) and the Naval Support Complex (opened in 1995). The Tulalip Tribes built a new casino and new shopping center in the early 2000s to the west of Marysville, contributing to a fall in sales tax revenue. In the latter half of the decade, Marysville opened two large retail centers of its own in the annexed Lakewood neighborhood and at 116th Street NE, bringing additional jobs and sales tax revenue to the city.|$|E
5|$|In the French sources, one {{important}} discussion <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> {{on the question}} of whether the Natchez planned a simultaneous attack on the French with the other major tribes of the region. French colonial governor Étienne Périer, in a report to superiors in France written one week after the revolt, claimed that many of the Indian nations in the lower Mississippi Valley had plotted with the Natchez to attack the French on the same day and that even the Choctaw, who had been close allies of the French, were part of the plot. Périer then cancelled a meeting with the Choctaw planned for the first two days of December in New Orleans, contending that it was to be the occasion for an attack. Périer in this way defended his actions as governor by insinuating that the results of the massacre could have been worse if not for his prompt action. However, historians Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have pointed out that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in a 1730 unpublished narrative that Périer's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack. Another document in French, of anonymous authorship, asserted that the Natchez revolt was a British plan to destroy a new French tobacco business in Louisiana.|$|E

25|$|Debate <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> {{round the}} {{question}} of whether the component genes in a super-gene could have started off on separate chromosomes, with subsequent reorganization, or if it is necessary for them to start on the same chromosome. Originally, it was held that chromosome rearrangement would play an important role. This explanation was accepted by E. B. Ford and incorporated into his accounts of ecological genetics.|$|E

25|$|As of November 2008, {{excitement}} <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> {{around the}} Haynesville Shale, with many {{new jobs in}} the natural gas industry expected to be created {{over the next few}} years. Residents in the region are enjoying large bonuses for signing mineral rights leases up to $25,000 per acre. However, the recent economic downturn has resulted in a lower market price for natural gas and slower-than-expected drilling activity. The city itself stands to profit by leasing the mineral rights on public lands in the near future as neighboring municipalities have already done.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} factors that causes {{complications}} is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the {{blood vessels in the}} back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, dry eye and potential increase in myopia. That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> on improving oxygen transmission through the lens.|$|E
25|$|The city’s and municipality’s {{recent history}} <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> on {{violence}} related {{to drugs and}} the environment. Drug-related violence of {{the past several decades}} has taken its toll as tourism is down, fewer come to shop in the city and many residents stay indoors for fear of a stray bullet. The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years. The violence {{is not limited to the}} city of Petatlán; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades. A number of these have been partly or fully abandoned as drug-related violence grows. The violence is among local drug lords over turf.|$|E

25|$|In {{his work}} Nuijasota, sen syyt ja tapaukset (1857–1859) (English: Club War, its reasons and causes), {{historian}} and fennoman Yrjö Koskinen (né Forsman) saw the peasants as fighting {{for freedom and}} justice. Fredrika Runeberg's Sigrid Liljeholm (1862), {{one of the first}} historical novels in Finland, depicts women's fates during the war. Albert Edelfelt's painting Poltettu kylä (1879) depicts a woman, a child, and an old man hiding behind a rock as a village burns in the background. The poet Kaarlo Kramsu praised the insurgents and lamented their defeat in patriotic poems such as Ilkka, Hannu Krankka, and Santavuoren tappelu, published in Runoelmia (1887). After the Finnish Civil War, the debate <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> on an interpretation that emphasizes Duke Charles's role in inciting the revolt, as found in Pentti Renvall's Kuninkaanmiehiä ja kapinoitsijoita Vaasa-kauden Suomessa (1949); and an explanation that stresses the roots of the rebellion in social injustice and class conflict, as argued by Heikki Ylikangas in Nuijasota (1977). A historical reenactment of the Cudgel War is conducted yearly in the Kavalahti scout camp. Jaakko Ilkka took the 75th place in the Great Finns TV show. A commemorative silver coin was also minted to mark the occasion.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{criticism}} of the IBDP <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> on the vague claim that it is anti-American, according to parents anonymously quoted in The New York Times, who objected to the program's funding from UNESCO in its early years.

In 2012, the school board in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, voted to eliminate all IB programmes in the district because of low participation and high costs.|$|E

Morales' discourse of [...] "the people" [...] against the socio-economic elites has brought a spotlight on the deep social polarization in Bolivia. His most vociferous critics have been from Bolivia's conservative movement, although he has also received criticism from the country's far left, who believe his reformist policies have been insufficiently radical or socialist.|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{controversy}} over Speer's knowledge of the Holocaust <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> on his presence at the Posen Conference on October 6, 1943, at which Himmler gave a speech detailing the ongoing Holocaust to Nazi leaders. Himmler said, [...] "The grave decision {{had to be taken}} to cause this people to vanish from the earth... In the lands we occupy, the Jewish question will be dealt with {{by the end of the}} year." [...] Speer is mentioned several times in the speech, and Himmler seems to address him directly. In Inside the Third Reich, Speer mentions his own address to the officials (which took place earlier in the day) but does not mention Himmler's speech.|$|E
500|$|Geoffrey Keynes {{placed them}} in 1-6-2-3-4-5 order, so that The Night of Peace {{followed}} The Descent of Peace, because of their similar subjects. Butlin, and nearly all subsequent scholars, have rejected this, as much commentary <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> upon Blake's use of similar images to frame the sequence. Butlin instead rearranges the [...] "original" [...] sequence as 1-2-4-5-3-6, moving The Flight of Moloch to second to last, so that it matches the order of corresponding verses in Milton's poem. Dunbar also follows Butlin's order. Behrendt adopts a 1-2-5-3-4-6 order, seeing a thematic progression from the destruction of classical aesthetics, to the old testament cruelty of Moloch (who resembles Blake's Urizen), to Satan himself. This order is followed by Werner in her Blake's Vision of the Poetry of Milton.|$|E
500|$|While {{some critics}} have tended to view the film as {{perfectly}} straightforward, and even criticize its overarching themes as [...] "the stuff of torpid platitudes," [...] online discussion has been much more positive. Heated debate <b>has</b> <b>centered</b> on the ambiguity of the ending, with many critics like Devin Faraci making {{the case that the}} film is self-referential and tongue-in-cheek, both a film about film-making and a dream about dreams. Other critics read Inception as Christian allegory and focus on the film's use of religious and water symbolism. Yet other critics, such as Kristin Thompson, see less value in the ambiguous ending of the film and more in its structure and novel method of storytelling, highlighting Inception as a new form of narrative that revels in [...] "continuous exposition".|$|E
