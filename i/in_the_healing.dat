For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Healing</b> the Centurion's servant, the Gospels of Matthew and Luke narrate how Jesus healed the servant of a Roman Centurion in Capernaum at a distance.

The Gospel of Mark adds that this angered the Pharisees so much that they started to contemplate killing Jesus.|$|E

They were excited to meet people from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial {{excitement}} quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence.

Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} insulin-like {{growth factor}} I (IGF- 1) levels {{in response to}} hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for diabetic foot ulcers and to determine whether IGF- 1 is a predictive indicator of wound healing in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Design and Methods. We treated 48 consecutive patients with diabetic foot ulcers with HBOT. Alterations of IGF- 1 levels in patients whose wound healed with HBOT were compared with those in patients who did not benefit from HBOT. Results. There {{was no significant difference}} in initial IGF- 1 levels between the two groups (P= 0. 399). The mean IGF- 1 level increased with HBOT (P< 0. 05). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>healed</b> group, <b>the</b> mean IGF- 1 increase and the final values were significantly higher (P< 0. 05). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> nonhealed group, the mean IGF- 1 increase was minus and the final values were not significantly different (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> increase <b>in</b> IGF- 1 level with HBOT was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healed</b> group (P< 0. 001). Conclusions. IGF- 1 increased significantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healed</b> group. We believe that HBOT is effective <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, with an elevation of IGF- 1. This alteration seems to be a predictive factor for wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers treated with HBOT...|$|R
40|$|A {{protective}} coating {{is used to}} protect surface of a material from various deterioration factors. When cracks form and propagate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coating, water, chloride ion, and carbon dioxide would penetrate through the cracks. This results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deterioration of the material, leading to reduction in its serviceability. If the {{protective coating}} has selfhealing ability, it would effectively protect the materials from <b>the</b> deterioration. <b>In</b> this work a capsule-type self-healing protective coating has been developed using vegetable oils as healing agent. Healing-agent-loaded microcapsules are embedded in a coating matrix to obtain a self-healing protective coating. Upon damage-induced cracking, the microcapsules are ruptured by the propagating crack fronts, resulting <b>in</b> release of <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> agent into <b>the</b> crack by capillary action. A healing reaction occurs by atmospheric oxygen, generating a viscoelastic substance. The self-healing coating was evaluated as protective coating for steel, and it was demonstrated that our system has good self-healing capability. In conventional capsule-type self-healing systems, healing reactions generally produce hard solids, so the systems {{are considered to be}} vulnerable to regeneration of cracks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healed</b> region. Furthermore, <b>the</b> regenerated cracks can not be healed because healing agent is consumed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>healing</b> process. It should be noted that our new system can effectively prevent the coating from regeneration of cracks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healed</b> region...|$|R

25|$|Beginnings of naturism in Slovenia {{started in}} the year 1852, when a 29 year old Swiss {{physician}} Arnold Rikli visited Bled for the first time. In the following years he started to promote healthy way of living, because he considered water, air and light {{to be the source}} for his healing therapy. He continued to build spa centers which included light therapy and hydrotherapy treatment. His first visitors were most likely pilgrims from Slovenia and Friuli-Venezia Giulia region who visited the church on Bled island. When the word has spreaded across Europe, other visitors started visiting Bled known for Rikli's healing therapy. A method used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> therapy process included sunbathing and visitors were often seen walking nude in public.

25|$|The oldest {{operation}} for which evidence exists is trepanation (also known as trepanning, trephination, trephining or burr hole from Greek τρύπανον and τρυπανισμός), {{in which a}} hole is drilled or scraped into the skull for exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. In the case of head wounds, surgical intervention was implemented for investigating and diagnosing {{the nature of the}} wound and the extent of the impact while bone splinters were removed preferably by scraping followed by post operation procedures and treatments for avoiding infection and aiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> process. Evidence has been found in prehistoric human remains from Proto-Neolithic and Neolithic times, in cave paintings, and the procedure continued in use well into recorded history (being described by ancient Greek writers such as Hippocrates). Out of 120 prehistoric skulls found at one burial site in France dated to 6500 BCE, 40 had trepanation holes. Folke Henschen, a Swedish doctor and historian, asserts that Soviet excavations of the banks of the Dnieper River in the 1970s show the existence of trepanation in Mesolithic times dated to approximately 12000 BCE. The remains suggest a belief that trepanning could cure epileptic seizures, migraines, and certain mental disorders.|$|E

25|$|None of the group-13 {{elements}} {{has a major}} biological role {{in complex}} animals, but some are at least associated with a living being. As in other groups, the lighter elements usually have more biological roles than the heavier. The heaviest ones are toxic, as are the other elements in the same periods. Boron is essential in most plants, whose cells use it for such purposes as strengthening cell walls. It is found in humans, certainly as a trace element, but there is ongoing debate over its significance in human nutrition. Boron's chemistry does allow it to form complexes with such important molecules as carbohydrates, so it is plausible {{that it could be}} of greater use in the human body than previously thought. Boron has also been shown to be able to replace iron in some of its functions, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> of wounds. Aluminium has no known biological role in plants or animals. Gallium is not essential for the human body, but its relation to iron(III) allows it to become bound to proteins that transport and store iron. Gallium can also stimulate metabolism. Indium and its heavier homologues have no biological role, although indium salts in small doses, like gallium, can stimulate metabolism.|$|E

500|$|In ancient Greece {{the blind}} were {{depicted}} as having received gifts from the gods, and blind singers {{were held in}} high regard. [...] In mediaeval Europe, the blind were depicted as the subjects of miracles, such as Bartimaeus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> the blind near Jericho in Mark 10:46–52. [...] Following the Reformation, painted depictions of saints and miracles fell out of favour in Protestant areas. [...] In Catholic thought, charitable works of mercy, such as giving alms to the blind and poor, were good works which, together with faith, helped the salvation of the doer. However, the Protestant doctrine of sola fide rejected the efficacy of works in achieving salvation, prescribing that it depended on faith alone (and the complication of God's predestined will for each individual). [...] The status of charity {{for the poor and}} infirm diminished, and beggars saw their circumstances deteriorate. [...] In popular literature of the time, the blind were depicted as rogues or targets of pranks. [...] The parable of the blind leading the blind also appears as one of the illustrated proverbs in Bruegel's Netherlandish Proverbs (1559).|$|E
