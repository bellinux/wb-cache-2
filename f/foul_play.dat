5000|$|The {{subject matter}} of the play, Christian {{conversion}} and martyrdom, is almost guaranteed to provoke passionate and extreme reactions. A few have classed the play among Massinger's best works; yet Charles Kingsley called it [...] "one of the <b>foulest</b> <b>plays</b> known," [...] one that [...] "contains the most supra-lunar rosepink of piety, devotion and purity" [...] coupled with [...] "the stupidest abominations of any extant play." [...] Modern critics have focused a more tempered attention on the play's religious and spiritual themes.|$|R
5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by some {{accounts}} because he was too unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof of <b>foul</b> <b>play,</b> some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E

New Haven police investigated the death, but were unable to find evidence of <b>foul</b> <b>play.</b> In November 1983, the office of the Connecticut state medical examiner issued a report stating that Slee's death may have been related to stress. The police investigation into the matter was closed the same month.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{suspicion}} of <b>foul</b> <b>play,</b> the death was ruled an accident; {{a case of}} starvation and exposure as Barker was unable to escape the closet. Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, the mayor ordered closet doors to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case also led to the first calls about the Boy in the Box.|$|E

50|$|Pencil {{fighting}} typically involves {{two players}} attempting to break one-another's pencils. Players take turns {{in which one}} player holds their pencil horizontally with both hands while the other player flicks their pencil at it in attempts to break it. The first player to break the other's pencil is the winner. <b>Foul</b> <b>plays</b> have been suggested, such as intentionally hitting a player on the fingers, dropping the pencil, and missing the pencil when striking. When a foul has occurred, the offender {{may be required to}} allow a free extra strike against their pencil.|$|R

On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest <b>foul</b> <b>play.</b> Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste {{was built}} in Spencer's Island, Nova Scotia, and {{launched}} under British registration as Amazon, in 1861. She transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name, and thereafter sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the salvage hearings in Gibraltar, following her recovery, the court's officers considered various possibilities of <b>foul</b> <b>play,</b> including mutiny by Mary Celestes crew, piracy by the Dei Gratia crew or others, and conspiracy to carry out insurance or salvage fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award.|$|E
5000|$|When a [...] "double foul" [...] occurs, {{when both}} teams commit a <b>foul</b> during a <b>play,</b> {{regardless}} of severity, the fouls are usually offset and the down is replayed. However, the two fouls must be {{committed in the}} same time frame. For instance, two fouls during the active play can offset, but a <b>foul</b> during the <b>play</b> and a personal foul after the whistle may not. Two personal <b>fouls</b> after the <b>play</b> can offset, although this is not often called. In the NFL, a major (15 yard) penalty by one team may not offset a minor (5 yard) penalty by the other team.|$|R
50|$|However, if {{players on}} both teams are called for fouls before {{possession}} {{and the ball}} has remained between the restraining lines, a reface is held after any penalties have been assessed. If the ball has crossed a restraining line when the second <b>foul</b> stops <b>play,</b> it is awarded through alternate possession.|$|R

5|$|Other {{theories}} of <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> have suggested {{an attack by}} Riffian pirates, who were active {{off the coast of}} Morocco in the 1870s. Charles Edey Fay, in his 1942 account, observes that pirates would have looted the ship, yet the personal possessions of captain and crew, some of significant value, were left undisturbed. In 1925, the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs, in a fit of a religious mania, had slaughtered all on board and then killed himself. In a later edition of his book Lockhart, who had by then spoken to Briggs's descendants, apologized and withdrew this theory.|$|E
5|$|Reform was {{demanded by}} such voices as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who decried the {{brutality}} and <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> of the game, and called {{a meeting of}} school presidents to discuss the issue. As a result, before the next season began, new rules {{were put in place}} to discourage such play. The forward pass was also introduced to open up the game and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations. Despite the planned changes, a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year, including Columbia, NYU, and Northwestern.|$|E

40|$|Special Session on Selected Regional Water Issues in AsiaMembrane fouling {{refers to}} the {{deposition}} of foulants on a membrane surface or inside the membrane pores, which leads to increased hydraulic resistance of the membrane. Among {{the various types of}} membrane <b>fouling,</b> colloidal <b>fouling</b> <b>plays</b> an important role. Excessive deposition of colloids can cause severe loss of membrane permeability and solute rejection. Membrane colloidal fouling is largely governed by the interplay of hydrodynamic forces and colloidal interaction. This presentation will systematically discuss the role of membrane permeate flux, colloidal interaction, and water chemistry on the fouling of reverse osmosis, nanafiltration, and ultrafiltration membranes. A simple theoretical framework is established to understand the seemingly contradictory experimental results, and its implications for optimal membrane operation will be discussed. The effect of inter-species interaction between different foulant species on membrane flux behaviour will also be discussed for feed waters containing mixtures of foulants...|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} of whether this incident was a mere coincidence or a conspiracy has been discussed in numerous newspapers, blogs, and other internet sites. However, President CalderÃ³n has tried to quell any suggestions of sabotage, saying Blake Mora's helicopter [...] "was always under guard" [...] in the hangar of Mexico's equivalent of the Secret Service {{and that it had}} recently undergone maintenance. Before Blake Mora, Juan Camilo MouriÃ±o, who was also head of the Interior, was killed in an airplane accident on November 4, 2008 with the presidential security adviser Jose Luis Vasconcelos and six other officials. And in September 21, 2005, RamÃ³n MartÃ­n Huerta, the former Public Security Secretary, also died in a helicopter accident with JosÃ© Antonio Bernal, who worked for the Human Rights Commission, TomÃ¡s Valencia, head chief of the Federal Police in Mexico, and six other officials.

5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting <b>foul</b> <b>play,</b> Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary fouls are routine {{because of}} the {{constant}} motion inherent in the sport and are not viewed as bad sportsmanship. The penalty imposes a cost on violating the rules but does not disparage the player committing the foul. A player intending never to commit a <b>foul</b> might <b>play</b> so cautiously as to be ineffective. More serious fouls are regarded as bad sportsmanship, and the penalties {{are designed to be}} disciplinary.|$|R
50|$|Fouls don't always affect game control, {{therefore}} referees {{need to find}} {{a balance}} for the right opportunities for risks to be let go for the game flow to continue. Risks <b>fouls</b> <b>play</b> in sports depend on the sort of action by the guilty player upon an opposing victim. Appropriate risks, that are borderline fouls, all falls down to the location on field, whether it was really intentional, the type of 'challenge' posed upon players and whether it will impact on game control and the game outcome. Referees try to eliminate unnecessary stoppages, considering the players prior behaviour and whether they have a bad reputation or continual intent to foul. Minor fouls that are often overlooked by referees as they are not jeopardising a players safety, having no intent to be reckless, careless or show excessive force. They are also overlooked when opposing players do not feel threatened of have any anticipation of the foul happening again and not purposely trying to stop play and slow down the game flow.|$|R

5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers {{were made by}} Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{propensity}} of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned {{the theory that}} Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander {{was the victim of}} a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, {{as the head of the}} alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.|$|E
5|$|The rules {{had been}} in use since the {{establishment}} of the club. Although a selection of rules from public schools were seen there, the 1858 rules show little evidence of their influence. Many of the original members were from the local Collegiate School, which favoured the kicking style of the game, rather than handling the ball. The kicking game was also prevalent in the local villages of Penistone and Thurlstone. The rules were the first to penalise <b>foul</b> <b>play</b> with a free kick, introduce the throw-in and eliminate the offside rule. They also had the unique feature of preventing a goal being scored directly from a free kick or throw-in.|$|E
50|$|This rule let Don Otten set the NBA {{record for}} {{personal}} fouls in a regular-season game. He had eight <b>fouls</b> while <b>playing</b> for the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (now the Atlanta Hawks) against the Sheboygan Red Skins on November 24, 1949. The rule was again invoked {{in a game}} between the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers on February 5, 2014. With the Lakers down to 5 players due to injuries, when Robert Sacre fouled out, he remained in the game.|$|R
50|$|Fouling {{also known}} as mis-setting is when an illegal hand is made and as a result, the hand is forfeited. The back hand must be {{stronger}} {{than or equal to}} the middle and the front, the middle must be stronger or equal to the front, otherwise, the hand is not legal and is considered fouled. In this case the player who fouled loses six points (one point per line plus three point scoop bonus) per non-fouling player and each non-fouling player gains six points. Players who fouled can lose additional units if players with legal hands achieved royalties. Opponents with legal hands gains six points plus any royalties in their hands, but not the royalties in fouled hands. When a hand is fouled the fouling players loses all royalties in their hands as well. If more than one player foul, then the players who foul tie other players who foul and no points are gained or lost between players with fouled hands. Unlike standard Chinese poker, players do not receive all thirteen cards at once. Therefore, <b>fouling</b> <b>plays</b> a large factor, and strategies are devised to avoid it.|$|R
40|$|Marine <b>fouling</b> <b>plays</b> {{a crucial}} role in the {{degradation}} of underwater archaeological sites. Limitation of fouling activity and its damages are one of the most critical issues for archaeologists and conservators. The common cleaning procedure, consisting in the manual removal of fouling, requires a continuous maintenance, while a proper inhibition of biological colonisation would provide a long-time protection against biofouling. On the other hand, the most used antifouling paints, especially for ship hulls, show considerable toxicity level. Since submerged archaeological sites are often included in environmental protected areas, more eco-friendly products must be used. We have explored the possibility to use titanium dioxide and Ag-doped titanium dioxide as antifouling agents. For this purpose, they have been synthetized by sol-gel method, and then XRD, XPS, and reflectance spectroscopy measurements have been carried out to gain structural information. The powders have been dispersed in a polymer and then applied to marble surface to evaluate the chromatic alteration induced by the treatments. By means of biological tests, it was possible to assess their behaviour as biofouling agents. Results show a decreasing of biofouling activity on treated stony surfaces...|$|R
