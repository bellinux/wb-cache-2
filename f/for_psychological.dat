There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect <b>for</b> <b>psychological</b> theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either <b>for</b> <b>psychological</b> or objective reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval cannon, the pot-de-fer, had bulbous, vase-like shape, and {{was used}} more <b>for</b> <b>psychological</b> effect than for causing physical damage. The later culverin was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, {{and was used}} as an anti-personnel weapon. During the 15th century, cannon advanced significantly, so that bombards were effective siege engines. Towards the end of the period, the cannon gradually replaced siege enginesamong other forms of aging weaponryon the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} force led by Castillo Armas {{attempted to make}} forays towards the towns of Zacapa and Puerto Barrios; however, these were beaten back by the Guatemalan army. The propaganda broadcast by the CIA had far more effect; it succeeded in leading a Guatemalan pilot to defect, which led to Árbenz grounding the entire air force, fearing its defection. The CIA also used its planes, flown by American pilots, to bomb Guatemalan towns <b>for</b> <b>psychological</b> effect. When the old planes used by the invasion force {{were found to be}} inadequate, the CIA persuaded Eisenhower to authorize the use of two additional planes. Guatemala made an appeal to the United Nations, but the US vetoed an investigation into the incident by the Security Council, stating that it was an internal matter in Guatemala. On 25 June, a CIA plane bombed Guatemala City, destroying the government's main oil reserves. Frightened by this, Árbenz ordered the army to distribute weapons to local peasants and workers. The army refused to do this, instead demanding that Árbenz either resign or come to terms with Castillo Armas.|$|E
5|$|Paul, {{a member}} of his old unit, {{contacts}} him and reveals he is suffering similar terrifying experiences but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Jacob is dragged away from the wreckage by a bespectacled man. Commiserating after the funeral, the members of Jacob's old platoon confess that they have all been experiencing similarly horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, the men hire a lawyer to investigate but he backs out of the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged <b>for</b> <b>psychological</b> reasons. Jacob’s comrades soon apprehensively back down – Jacob angrily suspects they have been threatened into doing so. Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who warn him against further investigation. He jumps from the moving car and is injured. He is taken to a hospital where he is restrained on a stretcher and wheeled down corridors full of grotesquely deformed patients before doctors, wielding barbaric metal instruments, inform him he is dead.|$|E
