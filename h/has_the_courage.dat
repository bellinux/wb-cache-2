500|$|According to Beyoncé, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] concern a woman's fear of the downsides of love. The protagonist sings about heartache, and the {{possibility}} of a breakup due to the decline of her relationship with an unfaithful lover. She wishes that she did not have to experience this emotional hurt. While her lover is out cheating on her, at home the woman wonders if she <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to continue the relationship, [...] "now that her rock {{has turned out to be}} made of mud", as interpreted by Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music.|$|E
500|$|On {{the review}} {{aggregator}} site Metacritic, The Eraser has {{a score of}} 76/100, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Reviewing The Eraser for the NME, Louis Patterson praised Yorke's vocals and wrote: [...] "Some will mourn its lack of viscera; its coldness; its reluctance to rock. But it’s yet another revealing glimpse into Yorke's cryptic inner-world, and one that <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> not to hide its political message in code." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said: [...] "These aren't Radiohead songs, or demos for Radiohead songs. They're something different, something we haven't heard before ... it's intensely beautiful, yet it explores the kind of emotional turmoil that makes the angst of [...] OK Computer or The Bends sound like kid stuff." [...] PopMatters wrote: [...] "The Eraser isn’t a masterpiece, but it’s much more than solo-project divergence. Yorke has stayed focused and created a tight album that draws on its predecessors without being held to or afraid of them." ...|$|E

500|$|In her {{review of}} the fifth series, Deborah Ross of the Daily Mail wrote of her sheer {{pleasure}} in watching the show without her children, calling it [...] "still unfailingly brilliant and funny and silly, without ever losing its sense of purpose... There just isn't anything else on TV that can match it for ideas, writing and performance." [...] Sarah Dempster of The Guardian agreed, adding that [...] "Four years into its ingenious 'making history look less crap' operation... HH remains true to its aim, with meticulously harvested historical data + roaringly well-observed pop culture pastiches = seemingly infinite heritage lolz." [...] Writing in The Independent, Grace Dent commended the cast in particular, saying that the show [...] "has the distinct feel {{of a group of}} bright, young, erudite, writery-actory sparks having a tremendously good time." [...] Venning of The Stage reiterated his praise of the show, adding that [...] "it also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to tackle potentially controversial events head on", specifically citing the song featuring the Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks as retelling her story in a [...] "clever, concise and accessible way without trivialising it." [...] In 2016, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times praised the series as [...] "deeply silly", [...] "frequently hilarious", and,"very consistent".|$|E
500|$|During his journey, {{while waiting}} for a Mississippi steamboat, Uncle Tom first meets little Eva, who with her father is also taking the boat south. Tom is at once {{attracted}} to the beautiful little girl, and she in turn talks to the kindly old darkey. While looking at the boats, the little one accidentally falls into the swiftly flowing river and escapes drowning only through the bravery of Uncle Tom. He of all the crowd <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to jump in and rescue the little girl. Eva's father to reward Tom for his bravery, buys him from Legree, and once more Tom {{knows what it is}} to be treated kindly. He lives happily as little Eva's special bodyguard until the little one is seized with a sudden sickness and dies. She had become greatly attached to Uncle Tom, and the last act of her life was to present him with a little locket containing her picture. Once more Uncle Tom is sold and again falls into the hands of Simon Legree. He is taken to Legree's plantation in Mississippi, where he is overworked and ill-treated to the point of death. Just before he dies he presses to his lips the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding out her arms to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, to say nothing of Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{selected}} as [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] in the Sunday Age, where Michael Gordon wrote: [...] "This is not the whole story, {{but it is a}} well-researched and superbly presented summary of the story so far – a kind of companion to the John Lennon book, 'Imagine' – including the temper tantrums. Fans may, however, disagree with the closing assessment that Morrison may be running out of themes and ideas to express." [...] Publishers Weekly was critical of the book's tone, commenting: [...] "Turner is more adulatory than probing." [...] The review noted: [...] "A complete discography makes this book a necessity for fans of the Irish Rover." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Thomas C. Palmer Jr. called the book [...] "a coffee-table biography that fills an extensive void, both for those hungry for gossip and for those who have wondered at the source of the creativity in this prolific producer of often stunningly original – if difficult to categorize – music". Palmer commented on the book's value: [...] "The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison's music has featured, subtly or otherwise (but never as blatantly as Dylan in his [...] "Saved" [...] period): religion and spirituality." [...] Robert Sandall reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Steve Turner has performed his task as a biographer diligently enough in Too Late To Stop Now, but the really interesting story here is told by the photographs." [...] Sandall commented: [...] "Thirty years of constant rowing with anybody who has ever tried to get close to him, and a fitful and irritable hankering after religion (any religion) have left him looking bloated, sad and, as Turner <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> and decency to point out, not as great a musician now as his current reputation would suggest. It's all there in the pictures." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ma Chao retreated further west {{after his}} defeat at Tong Pass. Cao Cao pursued him to Anding (安定; around present-day Pingliang, Gansu) but {{gave up on}} the pursuit and headed east after {{receiving}} news about unrest in northern China. Yang Fu warned Cao Cao, [...] "Ma Chao <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> of Han Xin and Ying Bu, {{and he has the}} support of the Qiang and Rong peoples. If we retreat now and don't station defences here, we'll forfeit all the territories in this area." [...] After Cao Cao left, as Yang Fu predicted, Ma Chao led the various tribes in the region to attack the commanderies and counties in Guanzhong, while the people responded to his call and joined him in the revolt. Ma Chao killed Wei Kang, the Inspector (刺史) of Liang Province, and seized control of Liang Province's capital Jicheng (兾城; in present-day Gangu County, Gansu) and forced Wei Kang's subordinates to submit to him. He then appointed himself General Who Attacks the West (征西將軍) and Governor (牧) of Bing Province, and took charge of military affairs in Liang Province.|$|E
2500|$|Karo {{initially}} {{intended to}} rely on his own judgment relating to differences of opinion between the various authorities, especially where he could support his own view based on the Talmud. But he abandoned this idea because, as he wrote: [...] "Who <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to rear his head aloft among mountains, the heights of God?" [...] and also because he may have thought, though he does not mention his conclusion, that he could gain no following if he set up his authority against that of the ancient scholars. Hence Karo adopted the Halakhot of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi (the Rif), Maimonides, and Asher ben Jehiel (the Rosh) as his standards, accepting as authoritative the opinion {{of two of the}} three, except in cases where most of the ancient authorities were against them or in cases where there was already an accepted custom contrary to his ruling. The net result of these last exceptions is that in a number of cases Karo rules in favour of the Catalan school of Nahmanides and ben Adret, thus indirectly reflecting Ashkenazi opinions, even against the consensus of Alfasi and Maimonides. Karo very often decides disputed cases without necessarily considering the age and importance of the authority in question, expressing simply his own views. He follows Maimonides' example, as seen in Mishneh Torah (the Yad Hachazakah), rather than that of Jacob ben Asher, who seldom decides between ancient authorities.|$|E
2500|$|With 2002's Scrisori din Washington, Tismăneanu {{constructs}} {{a retrospective}} {{overview of the}} 20th century, which he sees as dominated by the supremacy of communism and fascism. Structured around reviewed Deutsche Welle broadcasts, it also includes short texts on diverse subjects, such as essays about Marxist resistance to established communism, {{an analysis of the}} Western far right, conclusions about the Kosovo War, a debate around the political ideas of interwar novelist Panait Istrati, and praises of the Romanian intellectuals Virgil Ierunca and Dan Pavel. Mircea Iorgulescu criticizes the work for not discussing other relevant phenomena (such as the successes of feminism, decolonization and the environmental movement), and argues that many of the pieces seem American-centered, unfocused or outdated. Iorgulescu also objects to the book's verdict on Istrati's political choices after his split with communism, claiming that Tismăneanu is wrong in assuming that Istrati eventually moved to the far right. He nevertheless argues: [...] " [...] provides an impressive image of the extraordinary American effort to research, analyze and interpret communism and post-communism." [...] Iorgulescu, who views Tismăneanu as a Romanian equivalent to Michnik, adds: [...] "The circumstance of his living in the United States [...] protects him, for {{it is not hard to}} imagine how one would have viewed and behaved toward a Romanian from Romania who <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to speak, for instance, about the existence of an anti-Bolshevik Bolshevism.

State officials said [...] "they were going ahead with the $25 million road because the money would otherwise have {{to be returned to}} the federal government." [...] The cancellation of the bridge did not lead Palin to return any of the remaining $197 million in the earmark to the Federal Government. Palin's Ketchikan campaign coordinator Mike Elerding, says, [...] "She said 'thanks but no thanks,' but they kept the money." [...] According to Palin’s communications director Bill McAlister, the bridge [...] "isn't necessarily dead"; it may still be built with [...] "a less costly design". Palin changed her mind on the bridge, he said, when [...] "she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving, and that impression bothered her and she wants to change it. [...] I think that Sarah Palin is someone who <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to re-evaluate situations as they developed." [...] Palin said through her spokesperson that the road would open territory for development. A McCain-Palin spokesperson said that [...] "because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office, the governor was left no viable alternative." [...] The Alaska Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration state that the contract could have been cancelled at minimal cost and that the federal money could have been returned to Congress for other uses, if the road had been cancelled when Palin took office in December 2006, but the bridge to the island was not cancelled until September 2007.|$|E
