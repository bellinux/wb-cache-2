500|$|In {{agriculture}} and animal husbandry, the Green Revolution's use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding [...] "high-yielding varieties". The replacement of locally <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds,</b> compounded with unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding (genetic mixing), {{has reduced the}} gene pools of various wild and <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> resulting {{in the loss of}} genetic diversity. Since the <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> are often well-adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens, this can be a significant genetic erosion of the gene pool for future breeding. Therefore, commercial plant geneticists strive to breed [...] "widely adapted" [...] cultivars to counteract this tendency.|$|R

40|$|Major {{evaluation}} studies involving cattle <b>breeds</b> <b>indigenous</b> {{to eastern}} and southern Africa and their crosses are summarised. Comparative productivity of the Boran, Mashona, Tuli, Barotse, Angoni and Africander relative to the Brahman in designated high- and low-performance environments free of the tsetse fly were derived. In general, the <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> are highly productive, largely due to high reproductive rates. The most productive breeds in the high- and low-performance environments were the Tuli and Mashona, respectively. The Africander was the least productive breed in both environments. Breed-environment interactions were apparent. Crossing between <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> and Bos taurus or Brahman did not improve maternal performance above the most productive <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds.</b> However, {{the growth rate of}} progeny increased. Thus crossbreeding programmes using the superior <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> as dams and exotic Bos taurus or Bos indicus as terminal sire breeds are recommended where controlled mating is feasible. The development of a composite breed is currently being evaluated in Botswana. There is a need to evaluate crosses between the most productive Sanga breeds, e. g. Tuli and Mashona, and Bos indicus breeds, e. g. Brahman and Boran, especially in stressful environments where better adaptation is advantageous. Furthermore, it is suggested that future evaluations should include not only production traits but also adaptive traits such as parasite resistance and heat tolerance, and ideally should incorporate several nutritional levels, so that results can be extrapolated more readily to other environments...|$|R

40|$|Some of {{the genetic}} and {{environmental}} factors influencing performance traits of indigenous beef calves and their crosses in Nigeria are examined. The Bunaji and Sokoto Gudali, and Charolais x Bunaji crossbreds were evaluated for calf weights at 3, 6 and 12 months of age. Environmental and genetic effects on breed group, year of birth, season of birth, sex and age of calf were evaluated for each trait by least-square procedures. The Charolais crossbred were significantly heavier than the <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> at all ages. Year of birth significantly influenced calf weights from birth to yearling, except at 3 months of age. Season of birth had significant effect on all other weights, except at birth. Male calves out performed female calves throughout. The superiority of the crossbred over the <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> suggests that the Charolais {{could be used in}} crossbreeding program with the <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> to improve beef potential of the latter.

40|$|Access to {{genotyping}} assays {{enables the}} identification of informative markers that discriminate between cattle breeds. Identification of these markers can assist in breed assignment, improvement and conservation. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify breed informative markers to discriminate between three South African <b>indigenous</b> cattle <b>breeds.</b> Data from BovineSNP 50 and GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP- 80 K) assays were generated for Afrikaner, Drakensberger and Nguni, and were analysed for their genetic differentiation. Hereford and Angus were included as outgroups. Breeds were differentiated using principal component analysis (PCA). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the breeds were determined when minor allele frequency (MAF) was ≥ 0. 05. Breed-specific SNPs were identified using Reynolds Fst and extended Lewontin and Krakauer's (FLK) statistics. These SNPs were validated using three African breeds, namely N’Dama, Kuri and Zebu from Madagascar. PCA discriminated among the breeds. A larger number of polymorphic SNPs was detected in Drakensberger (73 %) than in Afrikaner (56 %) and Nguni (65 %). No substantial numbers of informative SNPs (Fst ≥ 0. 6) were identified among <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds.</b> Eleven SNPs were validated as discriminating the <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> from other African breeds. This is because the SNPs on BovineSNP 50 and GGP- 80 K assays were ascertained as being common in European taurine breeds. Lower MAF and SNP informativeness observed in this study limits the application of these assays in breed assignment, and could have other implications for genome-wide studies in South African <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds.</b> Sequencing should therefore be considered to discover new SNPs that are common among <b>indigenous</b> South African <b>breeds</b> and also SNPs that discriminate among these <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds.</b> The Red Meat Research and Development of South Africa (RMRDSA) and the National Research Foundation (NRF).

Participation could be improved with greater understanding of the many functions of chickens to smallholders. The objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate chicken traits including market and non-market values, and (2) to assess factors that influence the conservation of <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds.</b> Choice modelling, a multi-attribute preference elicitation technique, was applied across 300 households in two districts in Benin. The results revealed that many of the preferred traits are expressed in indigenous chickens, whose conservation should be supported through village chicken breeding programmes and that preferences differed greatly between farmers in the two districts. However, from an economic point of view, the aim of conserving culturally significant and disease resistant <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> is contrary to the objective of increasing chicken productivity. A preference for white plumage, most common among exotic breeds, could further hinder conservation of <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds,</b> which are mostly brown or black. The lack of knowledge about chicken characterization and flock management were identified as further severe constraints to village conservation programmes...|$|R

Breeds include the Ghana Shorthorn (GSH), N’Dama, Sokoto Gudali, Sanga (<b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds),</b> Holstein–Friesian (exotic) and crosses between the <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds</b> and exotics, including Jersey, Red Poll and Santa Gertrudis. A {{brief history of}} the dairy industry in Ghana is provided. Traits reviewed for the breeds, maintained in the coastal savannah zone and humid forest zone, include milk production, reproduction, calf growth, carcass parameters and adaptive traits. Even though exotic dairy breeds initially had higher milk production in Ghana than the <b>indigenous</b> <b>breeds,</b> none of the exotic breed programmes could be sustained. Both additive and heterotic effects were important in improving lactation traits in the GSH. Crossbreeding improved reproductive traits. Total heritability figures for birth and weaning weights indicated that selection would be effective in improving the two traits. Carcass parameters showed that crossing Red Poll or Santa Gertrudis with N’Dama improved weight at slaughter and warm carcass weight. Heat tolerance trials and mortality data indicated that while the Sokoto Gudali was the most adapted to heat stress, crossbred animals were better adapted than Holstein–Friesians in the hot humid coastal savannah zone.
