40|$|Specific {{activity}} of phosphofructokinase is 7 - 8 -fold higher in exponentially growing human fibroblasts than in quiescent cells, {{but the difference}} is considerably less pronounced for two other glycolytic enzymes, <b>glucose</b> phosphate <b>isomerase</b> and pyruvate kinase. The ratio of the F-type to L-type phosphofructokinase subunits {{is essentially the same}} in growing and resting cells, 4 : 1. F-type-phosphofructokinase-related antigen concentration is decreased in resting cells as compared with proliferating fibroblasts, but relatively less than the enzyme activity; the ratio of the enzyme activity to the antigen concentration (immunological specific activity) is therefore lower in resting than in growing fibroblasts. Synthesis of phosphofructokinase, {{as a percentage of the}} total protein synthesis, is about 30 -fold greater during the proliferative phase than in quiescent cells, but this difference is only 3 - 4 -fold for <b>glucose</b> phosphate <b>isomerase</b> and pyruvate kinase. Modulation of the synthesis of phosphofructokinase therefore seems to be responsible for the changes of its specific activity in function of cell proliferation. The appearance of some inactive cross-reacting material in quiescent cells is probably due to post-translational alteration of the pre-synthesized molecules. Compared with other glycolytic enzymes, such as <b>glucose</b> phosphate <b>isomerase</b> and pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase seems to be the (or one of the) preferential target of glycolytic induction in proliferating cells...|$|R

50|$|The {{isomerization}} of xylose to xylulose {{has its own}} commercial applications {{as interest}} in biofuels has increased. This reaction is often seen naturally in bacteria that feed on decaying plant matter. Its most common industrial use is {{in the production of}} ethanol, achieved by the fermentation of xylulose. The use of hemicellulose as source material is very common. Hemicellulose contains xylan, which itself is composed of xylose in β(1,4) linkages. The use of <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerase</b> very efficiently converts xylose to xylulose, which can then be acted upon by fermenting yeast. Overall, extensive research in genetic engineering has been invested into optimizing <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerase</b> and facilitating its recovery from industrial applications for re-use.|$|E
40|$|A {{summary of}} a survey of three genera of mycoplasmatales (Mycoplasma, Acholeplasma, and Ureaplasma) for isozyme {{expression}} is presented. Isozyme analysis of mycoplasmas has been employed {{in at least three}} distinct areas: (1) as genetic markers for identification, individualization, and taxonomic classification; (2) as markers for cell culture contamination; and (3) as a qualitative measure of the operative metabolic pathways in the diverse species. We have found five ubiquitous enzymes: purine nucleoside phosphorylase, adenylate kinase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, dipeptidase, and esterase.

50|$|The {{conversion}} of glucose to fructose {{is a key}} component of high-fructose corn syrup production. Isomerization is more specific than older chemical methods of fructose production, resulting in a higher yield of fructose and no side products. The fructose produced from this isomerization reaction is purer with no residual flavors from contaminants. High-fructose corn syrup is preferred by many confectionery and soda manufacturers because of the high sweetening power of fructose (twice that of sucrose), its relatively low cost and its inability to crystallize. Fructose is also used as a sweetener for use by diabetics. Major issues of the use of <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerase</b> involve its inactivation at higher temperatures and the requirement for a high pH (between 7.0 and 9.0) in the reaction environment. Moderately high temperatures, above 70 °C, increase the yield of fructose by at least half in the isomerization step. The enzyme requires a divalent cation such as Co2+ and Mg2+ for peak activity, an additional cost to manufacturers. <b>Glucose</b> <b>isomerase</b> also has a much higher affinity for xylose than for glucose, necessitating a carefully controlled environment.|$|E

50|$|Genetic, {{blood protein}} and archaeological studies, {{as well as}} direct {{observation}} in the field, offer {{a glimpse into the}} origin of the contemporary Azawakh breed. It originated from the pariah dogs of sub-Saharan Africa - also called bush dogs or basenji—and is also closely related to the Sloughi of the Maghreb. Despite morphological similarities, mitochondrial DNA evidence shows that it is only very distantly related to other sight hounds. Azawakh have a rare <b>glucose</b> <b>isomerase</b> allele (GPIB) that occurs only in foxes, jackals, Italian wolves, Sloughi dogs {{and a handful of other}} quite unrelated rare dogs found mostly in Japan. The presence of the GPIB suggests an ancient differentiation of the Azawakh from other dog populations near the base of the dog family tree divergence from wolves or perhaps a uniquely African cross-breeding with local African canids such as jackals. Petroglyph rock art dating from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago during the Green Sahara (also known as the Holocene and Neolithic Subpluvial) shows cursorial dogs in conjunction with hunters. Archaeologists have found dog bones buried in Holocene settlements in the Sahara. At the close of the Holocene Wet Phase in the 4th millennium BCE, the Sahara returned to desert and created a formidable physical barrier to travel. Together, this evidence suggests that the Azawakh population has a unique genetic heritage that has been largely isolated from other dog populations for millennia.|$|E
