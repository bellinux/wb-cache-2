40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{basic information}} about new processes for cores for cylinder heads production with alkali silicate based inorganic binders. Inorganic binders {{are coming back}} to the foreground due to their ecologically friendly nature and new technologies for cores production and new binder systems were developed. Basically these binder systems are modified alkali silicates and therefore they carry some well-known unfavourable properties with their usage. To compensate these disadvantages, the binder systems are working with additives which are most often in powder form and are added in the moulding material. This paper deals with <b>decoring</b> behaviour of different moulding sands as well as the influence of chosen additives on knock-out properties in laboratory terms. For this purpose, specific methods of specimen production are described. Developed methods are then used to compare <b>decoring</b> behaviour of chosen sands and binder systems...|$|E
40|$|Sand cores {{are used}} to produce {{internal}} cavities of metallic cast parts with complex shapes like automotive cylinder heads. Foundry cores are granular materials made of sand grains aggregated with binder bridges. In the cold box coring process, the binder is a polyurethane resin. It is noteworthy that during the casting of the liquid metal, the polymer binder is seriously damaged. This kind of materials has been poorly investigated so far. This study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour and fracture of cores subjected to various loads and thermal ageing. Particularly, the focus is on the <b>decoring</b> step, which consists in removing the sand by hammering and vibration of the metallic part after casting. This major project, generated from the collaboration of the aluminum casting company Montupet, and two laboratories Centre des Matériaux (CdM) and MATEIS, includes both experimental and numerical activities in order to model the <b>decoring</b> step of cylinder heads based on empiric data. Here, the experimental part of the work is presented...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{the study}} is to assess the outcome in terms of safety, {{complication}} and feasibility of non-descent vaginal hysterectomy for benign gynaecological disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study to assess feasibility, safety and significant complications in non-descent vaginal hysterectomy was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of DM-WIMS from January 2016 to December 2016. Non-descent vaginal hysterectomy was done for selected cases with benign pathology in the absence of prolapse. Vaginal hysterectomy was done by consultants to obtain comparable data. Hysterectomy was accomplished in usual manner using debulking methods like bisection, myomectomy and <b>decoring</b> techniques. RESULTS A total of 40 cases were selected for non-descent vaginal hysterectomy. Among them, 39 cases (97. 5...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} interactions {{on the interface}} core - melt by casting of cylinder heads from Al alloys in semi-permanent moulds and solves a specific problem with sticky sand after <b>decoring</b> of a diesel cylinder head casting. It describes in detail the process of core production using the Cold-Box method and process of casting using the progressive technology Rotacast. It theoretically analyses the reaction on the interface core-melt and presents a classification of surface defects by Al castings produced by gravity casting into semi-permanent moulds. It also states the results of technological tests of binders, core mixtures and cores (Cogas analysis). By solution of a problem with sticky sand in intake and exhaust ports of diesel cylinder head casting is used methodology for problem solving DMAIC. All experimental tests are solved in laboratory and production conditions of an international company dealing with casting of cylinder heads from Al alloys in semi-permanent moulds...|$|E
