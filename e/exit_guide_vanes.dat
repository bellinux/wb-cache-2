50|$|In 1942 MV {{started work}} on thrust augmentation. The {{resulting}} Metropolitan-Vickers F.3 {{was the first}} British turbofan engine to be designed, built and tested. Indeed, {{it could be said}} that the F.3 was also the very first 3-shaft jet engine to be built, although the configuration was completely {{different from that of the}} much later Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan series, since the fan was located at the rear of the engine, not unlike that of the General Electric CJ805-23. Using a stock F.2/2, MV added a separate module to the rear of the engine (directly behind the HP turbine) which comprised contra-rotating LP turbines attached to two contra-rotating fans. Apart from the first stage nozzle guide vanes, the LP turbine was completely statorless, with four consecutive rotor stages. Rotors 1 and 3 drove the front fan clockwise (viewed from front), whereas the rear fan was driven anticlockwise by rotors 2 and 4. Although the front fan had inlet guide vanes, there were no vanes between the contra-rotating fan rotors or, downstream, any <b>exit</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The core and bypass streams exhausted through separate coaxial propelling nozzles.|$|E

40|$|In this study, a 3 -D, unsteady, Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes CFD code {{coupled to}} an {{acoustic}} calculation {{is used to}} predict {{the contribution of the}} <b>exit</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> to broadband fan noise. The configuration investigated is that corresponding to the NASA Source Diagnostic Test (SDT) 22 -in fan rig.

One configuration from the SDT matrix is considered here: the fan speed correlating to approach, and outlet guide vane count designed for cut-off of the blade passage frequency. Thus, in the chosen configuration, there are 22 rotor blades and 54 stator blades. The stators are located 2. 5 tip chords downstream of the rotor trailing edge.

40|$|The Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL), an {{altitude}} test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center, {{has been used}} to test a highly instrumented turbine engine at simulated altitude operating conditions. This is a continuation of the PSL testing that successfully duplicated the icing events that were experienced in a previous engine (serial LF 01) during flight through ice crystal clouds, which was the first turbofan engine tested in PSL. This second model of the ALF 502 R- 5 A serial number LF 11 is a highly instrumented version of the previous engine. The PSL facility provides a continuous cloud of ice crystals with controlled characteristics of size and concentration, which are ingested by the engine during operation at simulated altitudes. Several of the previous operating points tested in the LF 01 engine were duplicated to confirm repeatability in LF 11. The instrumentation included video cameras to visually illustrate the accretion of ice in the low pressure compressor (LPC) <b>exit</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> region in order to confirm the ice accretion, which was suspected during the testing of the LF 01. Traditional instrumentation included static pressure taps in the low pressure compressor inner and outer flow path walls, as well as total pressure and temperature rakes in the low pressure compressor region.

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} to apply a {{computational}} tool for the flow analysis of the engine that has been tested with ice crystal ingestion in the Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) of NASA Glenn Research Center. A data point was selected for analysis during which the engine experienced a full roll back event due to the ice accretion on the blades and flow path of the low pressure compressor. The computational tool consists of the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) engine system thermodynamic cycle code, and an Euler-based compressor flow analysis code, that has an ice particle melt estimation code with the capability of determining the rate of sublimation, melting, and evaporation through the compressor blade rows. Decreasing the performance characteristics of the low pressure compressor (LPC) within the NPSS cycle analysis resulted in matching the overall engine performance parameters measured during testing at data points in short time intervals through the progression of the roll back event. Detailed analysis of the fan-core and LPC with the compressor flow analysis code simulated the effects of ice accretion by increasing the aerodynamic blockage and pressure losses through the low pressure compressor until achieving a match with the NPSS cycle analysis results, at each scan. With the additional blockages and losses in the LPC, the compressor flow analysis code results were able to numerically reproduce the performance that was determined by the NPSS cycle analysis, which was in agreement with the PSL engine test data. The compressor flow analysis indicated that the blockage due to ice accretion in the LPC <b>exit</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> stators caused the <b>exit</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (EGV) to be nearly choked, significantly reducing the air flow rate into the core. This caused the LPC to eventually be in stall due to increasing levels of diffusion in the rotors and high incidence angles in the inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (IGV) and EGV stators. The flow analysis indicating compressor stall is substantiated by the video images of the IGV taken during the PSL test, which showed water on the surface of the IGV flowing upstream out of the engine, indicating flow reversal, which is characteristic of a stalled compressor...|$|R

The goal of the current effort is to examine the fundamental process of higher order mode propagation through an acoustically treated, curved duct.

The aft vane calculations were conducted in “clean” and “vaned” configurations which correspond to experimental models whose data were used for validation purposes. Comparisons between the full engine and detailed single channel calculations show a weak dependence on the turbulence model used for the mean flow predictions as well as strong turbulence-shock interactions.

If there are many blades, the fundamental angular mode number is large, and the Tyler and Sofrin result for thin annuli becomes more relevant. Shrouding of subsonic tip speed propellers is a very effective means of controlling rotor alone noise...|$|R
40|$|The MC 1 Engine {{turbopump}} {{supplied the}} propellants {{to the main}} injector. The turbopump consisted of four parts; lox pump, interpropellant seal package (IPS), RP pump and turbine. The thermal analysis was divided into two 2 D finite element models; Housing or stationary parts and rotor or rotating parts. Both models were analyzed at the same boundary conditions using SINDA. The housing model consisted of, lox pump housing, ips housing, RP housing, turbine inlet housing, turbine housing, <b>exit</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane,</b> heat shield and both bearing outer races. The rotor model consisted of the lox impeller; lox end bearing and id race, RP impeller, and RP bearing and id race, shaft and turbine disk. The objectives of the analysis were to: (1) verified the original design and recommend modifications to it, (2) submitted a thermal environment to support the structural analysis, (3) support the component and engine test program. and (4) to support the X 34 vehicle program...|$|R
