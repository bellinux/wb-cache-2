Methods A 5 -year prospective cohort design was used. Women aged 40 - 80 years, living independently in the community, were recruited via the electoral role. The effects were investigated, first, of age, <b>activity</b> <b>level,</b> history of falls, number of comorbidities and medications, body mass index and stability at baseline on change in <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and, second, change in these demographics on <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> over the study period.

Change in <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> was not influenced by change in demographics over the study period.

Methods. Sixty-eight girls aged 12 - 14 years participated in the study. Skinfold thickness was measured and the Körperkoordinationstest für Kinder test was administered. Participants completed a self-reporting questionnaire on physical activity. Bivariate and partial correlations were used to analyze the interrelationships among the selected variables. Results. There were no significant (p > 0. 05) correlations between any motor coordination scores and physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> with and without controlling for body fat percentage. All motor coordination scores were significantly (p < 0. 05) associated with body fat with and without controlling for physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Conclusions. The relationships between motor coordination scores and physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> as well as between motor coordination scores and body fat percentage, were not influenced by body fat and physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively.

The results revealed that only the stressor of English language difficulty, one of acculturative stress, negatively influenced physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Social support was positively associated with physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Finally, in the role of social support between acculturative stress and physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> the support of Korean friends and American friends positively affected vigorous physical <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> These results suggest that social support for international students is likely to be one of most important factors for their physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Since the convenient sample of Korean international students may not be representative of international students in the United States, further study needs representative samples in order to establish the generality of international students studying in the United States.

This dissertation looked at MHPAC <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> of the 50 states (and Washington, DC) and developed an <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> index to measure council activity from 2008 - 2011. Two main questions were posed. First, do planning council differ in their <b>level</b> of <b>activity?</b> If so, what explains this variation? Second, do differences in <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> of MHPAC’s explain variations in mental health outcomes? Additionally, four National Outcome Measures (NOMs) were analyzed {{to see if a}} relationship existed between these outcome measures and council <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Three levels of analyses were conducted that included a Logit regression, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and a linear regression analysis. The Logit regression showed that differences in <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> do exist. Unfortunately, the results indicated that only one variable (state ideology) was significant; thus while states do differ in their level of activity; none of the hypotheses could conclude why <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> differ. The ANOVA indicated that higher <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with higher homeless rates. A poisson regression indicated that the model was significant and that higher <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with lower numbers of evidenced based practices being implemented.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is {{generally}} associated with low {{physical activity in}} patients with various chronic medical conditions. However, such an association has not been reported among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate whether daily <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> is associated with fatigue in patients with RA, and whether pain, disability, coping, and/or cognition are associated with the <b>level</b> of daily <b>activity.</b> METHODS: Patients with RA who visited our outpatient clinic were recruited consecutively. Fatigue severity was measured using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS 20). Physical activity was measured for 14 consecutive days using an ankle-worn actometer. The daily <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> of each patient was calculated, and each patient was classified as having a low or high <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> with respect to the group average. Data were analyzed by linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were included in the analysis; 25 % had a low <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and 75 % had a high <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> A regression analysis revealed that higher <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with reduced fatigue (P = 0. 008). The mean +/- SD CIS fatigue score was 30. 9 +/- 12. 3 among the patients with a high <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> and 35. 7 +/- 12. 8 among the patients with a low <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> (P = 0. 03). Pain, disability, coping, and cognition were not associated significantly with daily <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> CONCLUSION: Among patients with RA, a higher level of daily physical activity was associated with reduced levels of fatigue.
