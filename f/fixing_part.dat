40|$|Abstract — The Hanger Reflex is a {{phenomenon}} in which the head rotates involuntary when it is fastened with the wire hanger. This phenomenon is also found on the wrist. The Hanger Reflex is expected to produce smaller and more accurate haptic guide, because the device is fasten by end-effectors itself to user and {{does not require the}} <b>fixing</b> <b>part.</b> However, conventional device using the Hanger Reflex can only control the direction of the rotation, and fine control of the virtual force was not realized. To establish high efficient haptic device using hanger reflex, the control of the strength of the virtual force is required. In this paper, we used vibrators attached to Hanger Reflex device and describe the effect of the vibrator on the Hanger Reflex phenomenon on the wrist. The result of the experiment showed that the user feel enhanced virtual force when the vibration is presented under the Hanger Reflex. I...|$|E
40|$|Software reuse is a {{key issue}} in any long term {{software}} engineering endeavor, such as the ongoing development of robotics systems. Existing approaches to software reuse involve <b>fixing</b> <b>part</b> of the software landscape as a constant foundation to build upon. Some approaches fix the software architecture, i. e., how data flows through the system, and then allow the user to swap components in and out. Other approaches define a suite of stable components and interfaces which can be mixed, matched, and extended. All of these approaches assume {{that the key to}} software reuse is pervasive and long lasting standards. Unfortunately, in a young domain such as mobile robotics both software components and software architectures are items of research, and thus are in constant flux. This dissertation proposes the replacement of global, system-wide, permanent standards with local, transient standards in the form of reconfigurable interfaces. These interfaces are not simply libraries of system ca [...] ...|$|E

40|$|By {{making use}} of the {{background}} field method, we derive a novel reformulation of the Yang-Mills theory which was proposed recently by the author to derive quark confinement in QCD. This reformulation identifies the Yang-Mills theory with a deformation of a topological quantum field theory. The relevant background is given by the topologically non-trivial field configuration, especially, the topological soliton which can be identified with the magnetic monopole current in four dimensions. We argue that the gauge fixing term becomes dynamical and that the gluon mass generation takes place by a spontaneous breakdown of the hidden supersymmetry caused by the dimensional reduction.

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} graph {{matching}} {{in general is}} NP-complete and many approximate pairwise matching techniques have been proposed. For a general setting in real applications, it typically requires to find the consistent matchings across a batch of graphs. Sequentially performing pairwise matching is prone to error propagation along the pairwise matching sequence, and the sequences generated in different pairwise matching orders can lead to contradictory solutions. Motivated by devising a robust and consistent multiple-graph matching model, we propose a unified alternating optimization framework for multi-graph matching. In addition, we define and use two metrics related to graph-wise and pairwise consistencies. The former is used to find an appropriate reference graph which induces a set of basis variables and launches the iteration procedure. The latter defines {{the order in which}} the considered graphs in the iterations are manipulated. We show two embodiments under the proposed framework that can cope with the non-factorized and factorized affinity matrix, respectively. Our multi-graph matching model has two major characters: i) the affinity information across multiple graphs are explored in each iteration by <b>fixing</b> <b>part</b> of the matching variables via a consistency-driven mechanism; ii) the framework is flexible to incorporate various existing pairwise graph matching solvers in an “out-of-box ” fashion, and also can proceed with the output of other multi-graph matching methods. The experimental results on both synthetic data and real images empirically show that the proposed framework performs competitively with the state-of-the-art. I...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{surgical}} guides in implant treatment increases {{the accuracy of}} the dental implant positioning compared with manual methods. Regardless of how they are made, deviations of implants from their intended position are established in all kinds {{of surgical}} guides. This article considers the use of plastic material and new scanning technique for the production of CAD/CAM surgical guides that aim to overcome the deficiencies of the currently applied technologies in the production of surgical guides. Materials and methods: The study shows the techniques used to overcome degraded by metal artifacts CBCT images in implant treatment of patients with partial edentulism, and located medially to the defect metal-ceramic crowns. When planning implant treatment, a triple scan method has been implied. At the beginning, CBCT scan of the patient with a silicone impression material is made in the zone of interest. Secondly, CBCT scan only of the silicon impression is made, and thirdly - intraoral scanning of the patient with an intraoral scanner. Virtual analogues have been created of images from the three scans and have been repositioned one over another; as thereby an intraoral image have been accurately positioned over the CBCT image of the patient. Virtual planning of the implant positioning has been performed, and a model of surgical guide has been made for their placement. The guide has been printed with an SLA 3 D printer technology of photopolymer with dualistic characteristics-rigid in the working part and plastic in the <b>fixing</b> <b>part.</b> Through it, implants have been placed to the treatment planning. Postoperative CBCT has been done on the patient to measure the implant deviation to their position in the treatment planning. Results: Axes angular deviation of the planned and placed implants has not been established. Average linear displacement of 240 μ (+/- 40 μ) has been found. Conclusions: Using the triple scan method is possible to overcome the poor image quality of the metal (metal-ceramic) structures artifacts in CBTC scan of patients for implant treatment. Using semi-plastic material for printing of the surgical guide allows its good fixation intraoperative and the accurate guidance of the implant drill that provides the implant placement with clinically negligible deviation from their intended position...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three {{papers that}} propose, discuss, and illustrate models to make improved inferences about research questions regarding student achievement in education. Addressing {{the types of}} questions common in educational research today requires three different "extensions" to traditional educational assessment: (1) explanatory, trying to explain (or "diagnose") results regarding students or test items using features {{of the students and}} items themselves; (2) longitudinal, modeling change using responses from multiple assessments over time; and (3) multilevel, accounting for higher-level groupings such as classrooms or schools. The papers in this dissertation lie at the intersection of these three areas. Each paper develops a specific statistical or psychometric method with application to educational research. The first paper proposes and assesses a method for (secondary) data analysis when the outcome variable in a multilevel model is latent and therefore measured with error. The goal is a method that is convenient and readily understandable for applied research. The best current approach for this type of analysis is plausible values methodology, which relies on having a latent regression model for the construction of the plausible values that matches the intended secondary analysis. In current practice, plausible values are constructed with a single-level regression as the conditioning model, which leads to biased estimates of the variance components when the secondary analysis uses a multilevel model. The method proposed in this paper uses weighted likelihood estimates (WLEs) of the latent variable, which do not rely on the specification of a conditioning model, as the dependent variable for the multilevel model. It explicitly accounts for measurement error in the WLEs by <b>fixing</b> <b>part</b> of the level- 1 residual variance equal to the estimated variance of the WLEs. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared to the plausible values method using simulation studies and an empirical example. The second paper proposes extensions to existing item response models for the purpose of evaluating educational interventions. The proposed models incorporate information about the design of the intervention in order to obtain more nuanced information regarding the efficacy of an intervention from the assessment data. The models combine longitudinal growth on the person side, which provides information about overall efficacy, with group- and time-varying item feature effects, which provide information about factors that may contribute to differences in growth over time. The proposed models are applied to empirical data from a new lesson sequence for elementary school mathematics. Particular attention is paid to issues of interpretation, item feature design and quality, and measurement invariance. The third paper proposes a longitudinal item response model for differential growth based on initial status. The model was designed to answer research questions regarding for whom an instructional sequence or educational program is more (or less) effective and whether the instruction or program is expected to narrow or widen an existing achievement gap. The proposed model encompasses different conceptions of initial status; these conceptions can be examined simultaneously to uncover whether growth is predicted by factors common across the assessments or by factors specific to the assessment at the initial time. The identification and estimation of the proposed model and equivalent models are discussed; parameter recovery is assessed via simulation. The use and interpretation is illustrated with empirical data...|$|E
