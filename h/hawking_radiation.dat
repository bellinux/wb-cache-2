5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E
5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation.</b> The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} recently to derive <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiations</b> from black holes based on considerations of gravitational and gauge anomalies at the horizon [1][2].

In particular case of zero momentum, greybody factor tends {{to zero in}} low frequency limit as frequency squared goes to zero for non-vanishing coupling. We also elaborate {{the significance of the}} results by giving formulae of differential energy rate and general absorption cross section.

40|$|We study massless {{and massive}} <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiations</b> on a {{two-dimensional}} AdS spacetime. For the massless case, the quantum stress-energy tensor of a massless scalar {{field on the}} AdS background is calculated, and the expected null radiation is obtained. However, for the massive case, the scattering analysis is performed in order to calculate the absorption and reflection coefficients which are related to statistical Hawking temperature. On the contrary to the massless case, we obtain a nonvanishing massive radiation. Comment: 13 pages, revtex, to appear in Phys. Lett. ...|$|R
5|$|Ordinary {{quantum field}} theories, which {{form the basis}} of modern {{elementary}} particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time. As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{fluctuations}} of {{the horizon}} area, a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the Hawking spectrum that would be observable were X-rays from <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to merge the {{microscopic}} with the macroscopic worlds, we present a brief study about a force which depends on the Planck force and on the coupling constant that in turn depends {{on the size of}} a particle in a particular direction (space dimension). We then apply this force to black body radiations from which we deduce <b>Hawking</b> <b>Radiations,</b> Stefan radiation law and the level at which the profound theories of physics are consistent. In conclusion, it true that the world exists in both macro and microscopic situations, in away that, the higher the value of the space dimension the smaller the size of the particles we are studying and the smaller the value of the space dimension the larger the size of the particle.

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{models of}} black hole evaporation {{lead to the}} black hole information paradox. The information content {{of a black hole}} appears to be lost when it dissipates, as under these models the <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> is random (it has no relation to the original information). A number of solutions to this problem have been proposed, including suggestions that <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> is perturbed to contain the missing information, that the Hawking evaporation leaves some form of remnant particle containing the missing information, and that information is allowed to be lost under these conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> is {{required}} by the Unruh effect and the equivalence principle applied to black hole horizons. Close to the event horizon of a black hole, a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in. An accelerating observer sees a thermal bath of particles that pop out of the local acceleration horizon, turn around, and free-fall back in. The condition of local thermal equilibrium implies that the consistent extension of this local thermal bath has a finite temperature at infinity, which implies {{that some of these}} particles emitted by the horizon are not reabsorbed and become outgoing <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1973, Hawking {{moved into}} the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics. His {{work in this area}} was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that {{according}} to the uncertainty principle, rotating black holes emit particles. To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller, and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy. His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation,</b> which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate. Initially, <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> was controversial. However, by the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974, {{a few weeks after the}} announcement of <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation.</b> At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.|$|E
40|$|Using {{standard}} statistical method, {{we discover}} {{the existence of}} correlations among <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiations</b> (of tunneled particles) from a black hole. The information carried by such correlations is quantified by mutual information between sequential emissions. Through a careful counting of the entropy taken out by the emitted particles, we show that the black hole radiation as tunneling is an entropy conservation process. While information is leaked out through the radiation, the total entropy is conserved. Thus, we conclude the black hole evaporation process is unitary. Comment: Any comment are welcome!

40|$|A semi-classical {{reasoning}} {{leads to}} the non-commutativity {{of space and time}} coordinates near the horizon of static non-extreme black hole, and renders the classical horizon spreading to Quantum Horizon. In terms of the background metric of the black hole with the Quantum Horizon, a quantum field theory in curved space without ultraviolet divergency near the horizon is formulated. In this formulism, the black hole thermodynamics is reproduced correctly without both ambiguity and additional hypothesis in the deriving the hole’s <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiations</b> and entropies, and a new interesting prediction on the number of radiative field modes N is provided. Specifically, the main results are follows: 1, <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiations</b> rightly emerge as an effect of quantum tunneling through the quantum horizon, and hence the ambiguities due to going across the singularity on the classical horizon were got rid of; 2, ’t Hooft’s brick wall thickness hypothesis and the boundary condition imposed for the field considered in his brick wall model were got rid of also, and related physics has been interpreted; 3, The present theory is parameter free. So, the theory has power to predict the multiplicity N of radiative field modes according to the requirement of normalization of Hawking-Bekenstein entropy. It has been found that N ≃ 162, which is just in good agreement with one in the Minimal Super-symmetric Standard Model. The studies in this paper represent an attempt to reveal some physics near the horizon at Planck scale. This paper serves a brief review on the author’s works on this subject. ...|$|R

We find an ambiguity in Parikh and Wilczek's tunneling method, and give a reasonable description. We use this general spectrum to discuss the information recovery based on the Refs. [11 - 13]. For the tunneling spectrum we obtained, there exit correlations between sequential <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiations,</b> information {{can be carried out}} by such correlations, and the entropy is conserved during the radiation process.

25|$|Speculative {{theories}} of quantum gravity that combine general relativity with quantum mechanics {{have their own}} associated paradoxes that are generally accepted to be artifacts {{of the lack of}} a consistent physical model that unites the two formulations. One such paradox is the black hole information paradox which points out that information associated with a particle that falls into a black hole is not conserved when the theoretical <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> causes the black hole to evaporate. In 2004, Stephen Hawking claimed to have a working resolution to this problem, but the details have yet to be published and the speculative nature of <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> means that it isn't clear whether this paradox is relevant to physical reality.|$|E
25|$|The Rindler spacetime has a horizon, and locally any non-extremal {{black hole}} horizon is Rindler.

25|$|A {{theoretical}} {{idea for}} enabling interstellar travel is by propelling a starship {{by creating an}} artificial black hole and using a parabolic reflector to reflect its <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation.</b> Although beyond current technological capabilities, a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods. Getting the black hole {{to act as a}} power source and engine also requires a way to convert the <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiation</b> into energy and thrust. One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a parabolic reflector attached to the ship, creating forward thrust. A slightly easier, but less efficient method would involve simply absorbing all the gamma radiation heading towards the fore of the ship to push it onwards, and let the rest shoot out the back.|$|E

Explicit computation of n-partite information shows that it is positive (negative) for even (odd) $n$, which happens {{to agree with the}} holographic computation. The fact that entanglement in the mutual information grows with time mimics the second law of thermodynamics.

40|$|The (1, 0) +(0, 1) {{representation}} of the group SL(2, C) provides a six-component spinor equivalent to the electromagnetic field tensor. By means of the (1, 0) +(0, 1) description, one can treat the photon field in curved spacetime via spin connection and the tetrad formalism, which is of great advantage to study the gravitational spin-orbit coupling of photons. Once the gravitational spin-orbit coupling is taken into account, the traditional radius of the circular photon orbit in the Schwarzschild geometry should be replaced with two different radiuses corresponding to the photons with the helicities of + 1 and - 1, respectively. Owing to the splitting of energy levels induced by the spin-orbit coupling, photons (from <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiations,</b> say) escaping from a Schwarzschild black hole are partially polarized, provided that their initial velocities possess nonzero tangential components.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the features of}} the non-corrected thermal (non-thermal) spectrum and the quantum corrected thermal (non-thermal) spectrum. We find that: (i) using the quantum corrected non-thermal spectra, the black hole radiation as tunneling is an entropy conservation process, and thus black hole evaporation process is unitary; (ii) there are no obvious differences between all spectra except for near the Planck mass scale by comparing their average emission energies, average numbers of emissions and average emission energy fluctuations; (iii) the energy covariances of <b>Hawking</b> <b>radiations</b> for all the thermal spectra are exactly zero, while they are nontrivial for all the non-thermal spectra. Especially, there are distinctly different maximums of energy covariances for the temperature-corrected and energy-corrected non-thermal spectra.
