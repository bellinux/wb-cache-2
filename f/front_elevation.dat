5|$|The stables {{were built}} in 1820, during {{the early part of}} the Admiral's {{ownership}} of the estate, based on a design by John Smith; the buildings are sited to the rear of the mansion house. Built in a horseshoe-shape, neo-classical design, the two-storey building was constructed in pinned rubble with granite dressings; grey granite was used for the parapet and quoins. The main buildings were originally harled. A corrugated asbestos hipped roof was at some point substituted for the original slate roof. It features a columned rotunda above a timber clock tower, which has a finial and domed copper roof. The pedimented centrepiece of the symmetrical <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> is a segmental arch and has three panels set back between columns. Each side is bordered by wings of three bays with single-bay pavilions.|$|E
5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E
25|$|The main church {{building}} is a two-story, three-bay frame building on a slightly exposed stone basement. It is sided in clapboard with an asphalt-shingled gabled roof topped by a four-story blunt steeple on the western (<b>front)</b> <b>elevation.</b> The northeast corner is pierced by a brick chimney.|$|E

25|$|To {{the south}} of the main drive is the smaller Lampson mausoleum. It is built of panels of New Hampshire granite locked {{together}} by their own weight. Scottish variegated granite columns are on the north (<b>front)</b> <b>elevation.</b> Between them are marble doors opening into a chamber with a marble mosaic floor.|$|E
25|$|These {{buildings}} together {{create a}} long rectangular exhibition pavilion extending between Gregory and St Paul's Terraces, with the <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> to Alexandria Street. It is a single-storey structure comprising adjoined buildings from different periods and constructed from different materials. All {{the buildings are}} connected internally, allowing free passage through {{the length of the}} structure.|$|E
25|$|A {{building}} called Baj Pomorski {{has recently}} been completely reconstructed. It {{is now one of}} the most modern cultural facilities in the city, with its <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> in the shape of a gigantic chest of drawers. It is located at the south-east edge of the Old Town. Toruń has two cinemas including a Cinema City, which has over 2,000 seats.|$|E

25|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the 1988 {{structure}} is a later steel-framed structure with a multi-gabled, corrugated iron roof. There is one long, rectangular gable roof along the length of the structure, at the rear, with four gable roofs at the front, at right-angles to the main roof. These four interconnected structures are staggered in length creating a tiered effect along the <b>front</b> <b>elevation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The largest Ottoman {{architectural}} {{monument in}} Benghazi is the late 19th-century Ottoman palace in El-Berka; built during {{the rule of}} Rashid Pasha II. The <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> was completed in 1895, whilst the side sections were added later during Italian rule. The white and green structure houses 360 rooms; and is on a tract of land where Gamal Abdel Nasser Street meets al-Saqzali Street; south of the 28 March football stadium.|$|E
25|$|Number 4. Black House. One of {{the most}} famous {{buildings}} of the square and one {{of the most}} beautiful examples of renaissance architecture in Lviv. It was built at the end of the 16th century for Italian tax-collector Tomas Alberti. The <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> of the house is created from sandstone, which darkened through the years, making it architecturally significant. Since 1926 it has been part of the Historic City Museum.|$|E
50|$|The side {{elevations}} {{are similar}} to the <b>front</b> <b>elevations,</b> with central entrances of columns and piers with Doric order capitals and bases. However, they sit flush with the line of the building and do not project forward as the main entrance portico does.|$|R
50|$|Red-brick Roman arched colonnades {{are applied}} along the facade and {{corridor}} {{on the ground}} floor of the South Wing and coupled columns form loggias on the first and second floors. Roman arched colonnades are also found on the <b>front</b> <b>elevations</b> of the East and North Wings.|$|R
5000|$|Samuel Lipscomb Seckham (1827-1900) {{developed}} {{the houses in}} the main crescent in 1853-54, with Bath stone <b>front</b> <b>elevations,</b> and the west-facing crescent with an elevated pavement known as [...] "The Terrace" [...] in 1854-55. The Park Town Estate Company was formed in September 1857 through Seckham's efforts.|$|R
25|$|A simple cornice {{marks the}} {{roofline}} around the entire building, with modillions {{in the end}} gables. On the front side, the central bay projects to form {{the base of the}} steeple. All three bays on the <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> have a red paneled double wooden door surrounded by fluted pilasters with a projecting cornice on top. Above each one on the second story is a window topped with semicircular fanlight. At the attic is a decorative circular light. This is echoed by a round-arched louvered vent {{on each side of the}} steeple.|$|E
25|$|This is a large, rectangular, {{single-storey}} brick pavilion with sub-floor and a saw-tooth roof, located to {{the north}} of the Machinery Hill stands, with the rear wall erected along O'Connell Terrace. The <b>front</b> <b>elevation,</b> which faces south, has a centrally-positioned entrance with steel roller door on the upper level, accessed via a double stair. To either side of the front entrance are banks of hopper windows on both levels. The side and rear walls have less fenestration and there is a large rear entrance (another steel roller door) to O'Connell Terrace.|$|E
25|$|As the {{original}} house became crowded Mrs. Hubbard concocted her own plans and layout {{for an additional}} section {{to be added to}} the house. Her plan, according to the writings of her daughter Mary, was for a two-story addition at the <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> of the building, much as the building appears today. She envisioned a central front hall with a stairway flanked by walnut balustrades and an open parlor with folding doors opening into the living room. Mrs. Hubbard's vision for the second floor included two new children's bedrooms and a spare bedroom.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} {{buildings}} on the cemetery grounds. The most prominent is the mausoleum of Orator Francis Woodward, the Le Roy resident who built a personal fortune from buying the patent for Jell-O. It is a small stone Classical Revival structure {{in the middle of}} a circle with large planted myrtles at the end of the short drive from the main entrance, serving as its focal point. The east (<b>front)</b> <b>elevation</b> has four Doric columns in front of bronze doors, and a similar colonnade on the west (rear) with a stained glass window. Its interior is paneled in marble. Interred there are Woodward, his wife Cora and their six children.|$|E
25|$|Simpson's successor, as {{architect}} to the Leith School Board, was {{his former}} apprentice George Craig (1852–1928). In 1888, Craig, a Freemason, designed the Trafalgar Masonic Hall on St Anthony Lane, just off Henderson Street. According {{to a report}} in The Scotsman, a time capsule was buried in the building during the ceremony that took place for the laying of the Foundation Stone. This sandstone building, which is still in use as a Masonic Lodge, has been C Listed since 1995 and has many masonic symbols and decorative motifs carved into the stonework on the <b>front</b> <b>elevation.</b> The basement still contains fragments from St. Anthony's Priory (which gives its name to the side street).|$|E
25|$|Todmorden has a Greek Revival {{town hall}} (built 1866–1875) which dominates {{the centre of}} the town. The {{building}} straddles the Walsden Water, a tributary of the River Calder, and was situated in both Lancashire and Yorkshire until the administrative county boundary was moved on 1 January 1888. Designed by John Gibson of Westminster, this imposing building has a northern end which is semi-circular. One interesting external feature of the town hall is the pediment to the <b>front</b> <b>elevation,</b> which reflects the fact that it straddled the boundary as it depicts the main industries of the two counties. The fine carved stonework has two central female figures on a pedestal. The left-hand sculpture represents Lancashire (cotton spinning and weaving industries), and the right-hand one Yorkshire (wool manufacturing, engineering and agriculture).|$|E

25|$|The {{house is}} {{designed}} in a rectangular plan and {{is supported by}} a stone foundation. The exterior is clad in wooden clapboard. The building has a high-pitched, hip roof which features polygonal dormers, a brick chimney and overhanging eaves (a feature that would later become common to Wright's Prairie style). On the northeast and southeast corners of the building are polygonal towers with conical roofs. The tower windows, arranged in horizontal bands (another common Prairie element), are a mix of casement windows and fixed windows. The current front porch replaced a non-original porch with iron railings. The non-original porch is seen in illustrations in the architectural guide map published by the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust. The <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> also has a dormer with a pair of casement windows.|$|E
25|$|Construction on the Hubbard House's two-story <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> began around 1872 at {{the urging}} of Mrs. Hubbard who felt the family had outgrown the small cottage that {{occupied}} the site from 1857 until 1872. Despite her desires and Silas Hubbard's prominent position as the only doctor in Hudson, the family had little money with which to pursue the addition to their home. Hubbard was known not to push his clients for payment. In response, Elbert and his mother pored over Silas' records searching for any one they thought might be able to make payment through labor or construction materials. Elbert, already a considerable salesman by 1872, then rode about McLean County to obtain cash, materials and promises of labor from his father's clientele. Soon the new section of the house was completed.|$|E
25|$|The Stockmen's Bar and Grill is a brick {{structure}} with a saw-tooth roof in three bays which run {{at right angles}} to the street. The facade has been painted and the roof is concealed at the front by a very plain stepped brick parapet. In the centre of the <b>front</b> <b>elevation</b> is a large roller door flanked by two similar smaller doors on the left hand side and a standard sized door and a pair of triple projecting windows on the right hand side. These are supported on small brackets and are shaded by sun hoods. A timber veranda has been added {{to the rear of the}} building on the upper section and has a wheelchair access ramp. The veranda roof is supported on timber posts and has a timber handrail and dowel balustrade. The wall to the rear of the veranda is clad with weatherboards.|$|E
50|$|From 1868 Ludwig II {{commissioned}} {{a project for}} a new Versailles Palace in Linderhof Valley. From December 1868 till September 1873, Dollmann presented seventeen different floor plans and numerous <b>front</b> <b>elevations</b> {{as well as many}} drawings of the bedroom. In 1873 the project was transferred to the Herreninsel in Chiemsee. As Herrenchiemsee Palace it remains uncompleted.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>front</b> <b>elevations</b> were criticized. Lassurance {{followed}} {{the rules of}} the central avant-corps, placing generally Ionic columns to the ground floor and attic pillars to the first floor. But some judged the height of this as too low, and caused confusion between the placement of the central window and the pediment sculpture.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} had 196 {{houses with}} three sizes of house, 25 {{of the largest}} Type 1 houses in two terraces, 140 of the intermediate Type 2 houses in nine terraces and 31 of the smallest Type 3 houses in two terraces. The <b>front</b> <b>elevations,</b> apart from a small difference in width, were identical for each type, and permitted a unified architectural scheme.|$|R
