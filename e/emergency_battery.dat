5000|$|The PC-12 {{incorporates}} numerous safety measures. The PT6A-67 engine has {{a reputation}} for considerable reliability, a factor that has reportedly been decisive to some prospective operators. To counteract stall and spin conditions, dual angle-of-attack sensors near the wingtips force the stick forwards in advance of a potential stall. For greater redundancy, the PC-12 NG has a complete split-bus dual electrical system as akin to modern jet aircraft, in addition to two separate batteries and a third <b>emergency</b> <b>battery.</b> The type is certified for flight into known ice conditions; as per standard fit, pneumatic de-icing systems are installed in the wings and empennage, while electrical de-icing measures are integrated into the windshield and exhaust heat is used for engine inlet de-icing.

50|$|In 1885 the Endicott Board {{recommended}} a large-scale fortification plan that eventually included Fort Stark. However, {{construction on the}} new fort did not begin until 1901. In 1898, shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish-American War, <b>emergency</b> <b>batteries</b> were constructed to quickly arm key points, as most of the Endicott batteries were still years from completion and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US East Coast. At Jerry's Point this consisted of two 8-inch (203 mm) M1888 guns mounted on converted carriages built for Rodman guns in the 1870s emplacements. These guns were removed in 1900 to arm new Endicott batteries elsewhere and {{to make room for the}} new batteries at Fort Stark.|$|R

5000|$|At {{some point}} between 1895 and 1907, Shornemead Fort was disarmed. Subsidence {{had made it}} {{structurally}} unsafe for its emplaced guns to be fired, {{and it was in}} any case strategically redundant by that point. It was used for a time by the Thames Militia Division (Submarine Miners), Royal Engineers, as a training facility linked with the nearby submarine mining depot. It was temporarily re-armed in 1913 with two 12-pdr. QF guns in emplacements outside the fort and again in 1941 when it was designated as an <b>emergency</b> <b>battery.</b> Two 5.5-inch naval guns were installed in the same emplacements as the 1913 guns, 250 m east of the fort, with concrete gun houses protecting them. An embarkation hard was constructed on the riverside below the fort to support the D-Day operation. Aerial photographs from the time show the battery, fort, associated concrete pillboxes and searchlights surrounded by dense tangles of barbed wire. The fort was reduced to care and maintenance status in November 1943, while the battery was deactivated in 1945 and demolished around 1976.|$|E

The club runs a weekly net, on both the VHF voice FM repeater at 7PM every Monday evening and on the 10 meter band on Thursday evenings at 7:30PM (28.410 Mhz, USB) and has a fully operational radio room / ham shack in the Indiana Memorial Union's west tower (the [...] "student activities tower"), with two HF rigs. Antennas include an HF beam (TH6 thunderbird by hygain) and various wire antennas, and are located {{on top of the}} tower where the shack is located. As of June 2017, due to roof repairs on IMU, the main VHF voice FM repeater is housed at the IMU stadium press box tower, utilizing a Yaesu System Fusion D1X repeater at 25 watts output, WaCom BpBr pass and reject cavity duplexers, and a Sinclair DB224 repeater antenna providing 6DB omni pattern.

50|$|World War I brought further {{changes to}} Fort Andrews' armament. In February 1917 Battery Rice's two 5-inch guns were {{transferred}} to Fort Story at Cape Henry, Virginia for an <b>emergency</b> <b>battery.</b> The 5-inch gun was withdrawn from Coast Artillery service shortly after the war, and these guns were never replaced. In August 1917, Battery McCook's two 6-inch guns were ordered dismounted for potential service on field carriages on the Western Front. It appears these guns never left the fort, and they were remounted in 1920. As part of a forcewide re-alignment, almost half of Fort Andrews' mortars were removed in early 1918. It was determined that attempting to simultaneously reload four mortars per pit was inefficient, and that a similar rate of fire could be obtained with only two mortars per pit. Also, many 12-inch mortars were needed as railway artillery for potential service on the Western Front. None of these mortars were shipped to France before the Armistice, but many were retained as railway mortars through World War II. The result at Fort Andrews was that Battery Cushing was reduced to four mortars and Battery Whitman was reduced to six mortars. For some reason, Pit A of Battery Whitman retained its four M1908 mortars. By the 1920s, Fort Andrews consisted of some 30 structures (see map at left), ranging from large brick barracks buildings that housed over 100 soldiers each to elegant officers' quarters and a 50-bed hospital. The fort even had a radio transmitting station, one of the Army's earliest.|$|E

Such emergencies may be loss of mains electric power or, far less likely, the complete failure of the main lamp banks. The four lamps {{in each of the}} two main banks are connected in series, which gives each unit the same intensity; however, if one lamp fails, all four in that bank go out.

40|$|Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on EBR-II Shutdown Heat Removal Tests (SHRT) was {{established}} by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The aim of the project is to support and to improve validation of simulation tools and projects for Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors (SFR). The Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) plant was a uranium metal-alloy-fuelled liquid-metal-cooled fast reactor designed and operated by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) for the U. S. Department of Energy at the Argonne-West site. In the frame of this project, benchmark analysis {{of one of the}} EBR-II shutdown heat removal tests, protected loss-of-flow transient (SHRT- 17), has been performed at the Gruppo di Ricerca Nucleare San Piero a Grado (GRNSPG) in Pisa, Italy. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present modelling of EBR-II reactor design using RELAP- 3 D, and to present results of the transient analysis of SHRT- 17. Complete nodalization of the reactor was made from the beginning. Model is divided in primary side that contains core, pumps, reactor pool and, for this kind of reactor specific, Z pipe, and intermediate side that contains Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX). After achievement of acceptable steady-state results, transient analysis was performed. Starting from full power and flow, both the primary loop and intermediate loop coolant pumps were simultaneously tripped and the reactor was scrammed to simulate a protected loss-of-flow accident. In addition, the primary system auxiliary coolant pump that normally had an <b>emergency</b> <b>battery</b> power supply was turned off. Despite early rise of the temperature in the reactor, the natural circulation characteristics managed to keep it at acceptable leveles and cooled the reactor down safely at decay heat power levels. Thermal-hydraulics characteristics and plant behaviour was focused on prediction of natural convection cooling by evaluating the reactor core flow and temperatures and their comparison with experimental data that were provided by ANL. The plan is to improve the model in future with replacing current models of core and pool with 3 D models, and, eventually, coupling with neutronic codes for more accurate results...|$|E
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} assist {{systems with}} portable drive units are increasingly {{used in the}} clinical setting. However, such systems usually are not suitable for right ventricular support, and therefore, {{in the case of}} biventricular heart failure, they must be combined with other support devices that require additional drive consoles. As a result, most of the benefits of the wearable drive units (early mobilization and outpatient care) are lost. This present study was performed to evaluate biventricular support with implanted assist devices and a portable DC/battery-powered driver (Thoratec TLC-II). Electronic control by nonvolatile RAM accessible via RS 232 interface, internal backup <b>emergency</b> <b>battery,</b> and optional manual activation are additional features of this 6 kg biventricular drive unit. In 3 bovine experiments (body weight 70 +/- 5 kg) partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established, and two ventricular assist devices were implanted into a preperitoneal pocket on each side after connection to the right atrium and the pulmonary artery and to the left atrium and aorta, respectively. After weaning the patient from CPB, activated coagulation time (ACT) was kept at greater than 180 s, and biventricular support with the portable driver was activated. After 10 min, mean device flow stabilized at 3. 5 +/- 0 L/min and remained at that level throughout the ensuing 6 h (3. 5 +/- 0. 3 L/min; NS). The heart rate moved from 130 +/- 13 beats per minute (bpm) at the end of CPB to 116 +/- 13 bpm after 10 min of assist (p < 0. 05). Right atrial pressure moved from 11 +/- 2 mm Hg at the end of CPB to 13 +/- 3 mm Hg after 10 min of assist (not significant [NS]). Mean pulmonary artery pressure was 18 +/- mm Hg at the end of CPB and 17 +/- 5 mm Hg after 10 min of assist (NS). Left atrial pressure was 10 +/- 1 mm Hg at the end of CPB and 13 +/- 3 mm Hg after 10 min of assist (NS). Mean aortic pressure was 73 +/- 11 mm Hg at the end of CPB and 77 +/- 3 mm Hg after 10 min of assist (NS). Mixed venous oxygen saturation increased from 49 +/- 9 % at the end of CPB to 58 +/- 10 % after 10 min of assist (p < 0. 05). The portable drive unit that was tested provides adequate power to maintain significant biventricular support with implanted right and left assist devices. The configuration of batteries tested driving two ventricles provides independence for 60 min...|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{the heavy}} {{batteries}} were built first, {{followed by the}} 3-inch and then the 6-inch batteries. However, the Spanish-American War broke out in early 1898. Most of the Endicott batteries were still years from completion, and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. A number of batteries of medium-caliber rapid-fire guns were hastily built, along with batteries of Civil War-era smoothbore Rodman guns. Fort Terry received a single 4.72-inch (120 mm)/45 caliber Armstrong gun, purchased from the United Kingdom. Unusually, in Long Island Sound a new fort was built {{in response to the}} situation. This was Fort Tyler on Gardiners Point Island, south of Plum Island. This fort initially had emplacements for two modern 8-inch M1888 guns (203 mm) on modified 1870s Rodman carriages.
