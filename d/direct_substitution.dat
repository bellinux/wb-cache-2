40|$|A {{combination}} of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) studies has demonstrated that attempted substitutions of Al, V and Nb into the framework of LiTi 2 (PO 4) 3 yield several impurity phases in addition to <b>direct</b> <b>substitutions</b> of Al into Ti and V, Nb into P sites. <b>Direct</b> <b>substitutions</b> were confirmed by changes in the unit cell dimensions {{as indicated by the}} peak shifts observed in the X-ray diffractographs and by analyses of the 27 Al and 31 P magic angle spinning (MAS) spectra. A major impurity phase was identified as AlPO 4 (found in at least two polymorphs) and the amount present increases with increasing Al additions. The formation of AlPO 4 appeared to be enhanced by further V but suppressed by Nb substitution. These results suggest that the presence of AlPO 4, together with the non-stoichiometric modified LTP, may be the cause for the observed densification of this material upon sintering and the increased ionic conductivity. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Human {{histocompatibility}} leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DM is {{a facilitator}} of antigen presentation via {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class II molecules. In the absence of HLA-DM, MHC class II molecules do not present natural peptides, but tend to remain associated with class II- associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP). Recently, DM was shown to catalyze the release of CLIP from HLA-DR. We have investigated which peptides bound to HLA-DR are vulnerable to release upon encountering DM. By <b>directed</b> <b>substitution</b> of allele-specific anchor residues between CLIP and DR 3 -cognate peptides {{and the application of}} recombinant DM we show that DM catalyzes the release of those peptides bound to HLA-DR 3 that do not have appropriate anchor residues and, hence, no optimal ligand binding motif. Thus, HLA-DM acts as a peptide editor, facilitating selection of peptides that stably bind to class II molecules for eventual presentation to the immune system from the pool of available peptides...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Current {{applications}} in porphyrin chemistry {{require the use}} of unsymmetrically substituted porphyrins. Many current industrial interests in optics and biomedicine require systems with either push-pull (electron donating and withdrawing groups) or amphiphilic systems (hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups). In this context we present the class of 5, 10 -A 2 B 2 -type porphyrins where two different substituents are positioned in diagonally opposite meso positions. Thus, the intramolecular dipole moment in these tetrapyrroles is positioned along a ??? vector passing through two pyrrole rings. This is opposite to the situation of the frequently used 5, 15 -A 2 BC porphyrins where the dipole moment is oriented along a meso-meso axis. We have elaborated syntheses of the 5, 10 -A 2 B 2 porphyrins using transition metal catalyzed transformations of 5, 10 -A 2 porphyrins or <b>direct</b> <b>substitutions</b> reactions thereof which give the target molecules in 22 - 77 % overall yield. The compounds exhibit interesting structural, spectroscopic and optical features and can serve as building blocks for new porphyrin arrays and applications...|$|R
40|$|Efficient C–H {{functionalization}} requires selectivity {{for specific}} C–H bonds. Progress {{has been made}} for <b>directed</b> aromatic <b>substitution</b> reactions to achieve ortho and meta selectivity, but a general strategy for para -selective C–H functionalization has remained elusive. Herein we introduce a previously unappreciated concept that enables nearly complete para selectivity. We propose that radicals with high electron affinity elicit arene-to-radical charge transfer in the transition state of radical addition, which is the factor primarily responsible for high positional selectivity. We demonstrate with a simple theoretical tool that the selectivity is predictable and show {{the utility of the}} concept through a direct synthesis of aryl piperazines. Our results contradict the notion, widely held by organic chemists, that radical aromatic substitution reactions are inherently unselective. The concept of radical <b>substitution</b> <b>directed</b> by charge transfer could {{serve as the basis for}} the development of new, highly selective C–H functionalization reaction...|$|R
