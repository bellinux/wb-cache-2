40|$|Reducing the Duration of Structural Durability Tests Used for the Experimental Validation of <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Systems.</b> <b>Exhaust</b> <b>systems</b> fulfil {{a number}} of {{functions}} such as the filtering of exhaust gases and noise reduction, while maintaining the best possible engine performance. During service {{they are exposed to}} complex thermal and mechanical loading, which is simulated at BMW on a thermo-mechanical test rig (THEMA) with the aim of reducing costs and development time. Unabbreviated testing would take several months to complete. Therefore a shortened test with consideration of the service and thermo mechanical loading of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> and the movement of the engine is created with the equivalent damaging cycles. Using this method, the test duration is reduced to a few weeks and therefore enables a faster identification of any system weak points. In this article the time optimised testing method is explained and the potential for optimisation illustrated. On the basis of practical examples, the applicability of the above described method during the development process is shown...|$|R

In view of these problems will cause noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) performance of the vehicle. A method called averaged driving DOF displacement (ADDOFD) is used to determine and optimize the exhaust hanger locations in this paper. Based on a sample vehicle, the Hyper Mesh and MSC.

Then static analysis and dynamic analysis of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> are done, and finally hanger locations of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> are selected. When the reasonable hanger positions have been decided, the vibration level of the body and the internal noise would have been decreased. This method can effectively select better NVH performance hanger locations in the earlier vehicle development process and can be extended to other types of vehicle, thus is instructive for saving both the time and the cost of operation...|$|R

2500|$|Type B1 and B2 {{cabinets}} have {{a minimum}} inflow velocity of 100ft/min, and these cabinets must be hard-ducted to an <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> rather than <b>exhausted</b> through a thimble connection.

In contrast to the type A1 and A2 cabinets, Type B BSCs use single pass airflow (air that does not mix and recirculate) in order to also control hazardous chemical vapors. Type B1 cabinets split the airflow so that the air behind the smoke-split is directed to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system,</b> while air between the operator and the smoke-split mixes with inflow air and is recirculated as downflow. Since exhaust air is drawn from the rear grille, the CDC advises that work with hazardous chemistry be conducted {{in the rear of}} the cabinet. This is complicated, since the smoke split (demarking the [...] "rear of the cabinet") is an invisible line that extends the width of the cabinet (approximately 10-14 inches from the front grille) and drifts as the internal HEPA filters load with particulate.|$|R

5000|$|Although L-head inline 4 and 6-cylinder engines were {{frequently}} used for automobiles, tractors, etc., {{the best known}} L-head automotive engine is the early 20th century Ford V-8, which has both sets of valves (intake and exhaust) located {{on the inside of}} the [...] "Vee," [...] and which are all operated by a single camshaft located above the crankshaft. The exhaust follows a lengthy path to leave the engine. This virtually guarantees that the engine will need an unusually large coolant radiator to avoid overheating under sustained heavy use. A flathead design in a V engine, with the air intake/fuel system and all of the exhaust and intake valves inside of the [...] "V" [...] requires that the exhaust gas be passed between the cylinders to outside of the V to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Exhaust</b> heat is thus passed to the coolant (as it exits the engine between the cylinders). In the Ford V-8 flathead design, manufactured from 1932 through 1952, the center exhaust port on the outside of the block exhausts the gasses from two cylinders, exacerbating the high heat problem. This [...] "very hot in the middle" [...] problem makes this particular engine prone to heat-related stress and cracks in the cylinder block. In line engine exhaust gas exits the block more directly and does not cross between the cylinders and is a more temperature-stable design. Whenever exhaust ports and valves are in the cylinder head, exhausting heat has far less time to heat the coolant, and such engines are more durable under high load conditions and a similar sized engine will require less coolant radiator capacity than a flathead V-8.|$|R
