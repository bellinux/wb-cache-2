5|$|In 1875, Edward Windsor Richards {{became the}} General Manager of the Middlesbrough Ironworks. Richards {{was in charge}} of the design and {{construction}} of the new plant at Eston, the Cleveland Steel Works. It had three coke fired haematite blast furnaces. Richards' work helped to improve the Bessemer process for making steel, in the case when the ore is rich in phosphorus, and an alkaline rock (<b>dolomite,</b> <b>limestone</b> or magnesite) is used. This variant is called the Gilchrist-Thomas process, after its inventor Sidney Gilchrist Thomas who persuaded Richards to adopt it.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{resources}} include peat deposits, {{small quantities}} {{of oil and}} natural gas, granite, <b>dolomite</b> (<b>limestone),</b> marl, chalk, sand, gravel, and clay. About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory, and {{about a fifth of}} Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions) was affected by radiation fallout. The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of caesium binders and rapeseed cultivation, which are meant to decrease soil levels of caesium-137.|$|E

This unit was laid down in a shallow sea and later became a discontinuous mix of <b>dolomite,</b> <b>limestone,</b> sandstones, and shales. The layers of this unit are relatively undeformed for their age even though periodic upwarp exposed them to erosion, creating [...] uncomformities [...] Fossilized brachiopods, bryozoans, corals, and trilobites {{are found in the}} carbonate rock layers with the best examples found outside the park in the Alaska Basin.
