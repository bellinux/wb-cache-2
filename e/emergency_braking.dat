50|$|On February 17, 2010, Neistat {{uploaded}} a video about when, {{and when}} not, {{to use the}} <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> cord on train cars in the New York City Subway. Neistat criticised {{the way that the}} MTA did not make it clear when the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> cord should be pulled. According to the video, one should only use the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> system when the motion of the train poses an imminent threat to life or limb.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{versions of}} Innovia Metro {{were based on}} a linear induction motor (LIM) using vehicle-mounted windings and a track-mounted stator consisting of a thin aluminum plate mounted flat between the tracks. The small size and flat shape of the motor, and its lack of a transmission connected to the bogies, allows the ART to be much closer to the ground than a traditional subway car. The motor is used for all control with the exception of <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> using conventional shoes in the bogies.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight was}} {{chartered}} by Aker Kværner from Stavanger Airport, Sola via Sørstokken to transport its employees from there and Stord to Molde Airport, Årø. An investigation {{was carried out}} by the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN). It was not able to find the underlying cause of the spoiler malfunction. However, it found that when the captain selected the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> the anti-lock braking system was disabled. This caused hydroplaning {{to the point where the}} water under the tyres turned to steam, subsequently reducing brake performance. The damage was aggravated through a minimal run-off zone at each end of the runway.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, Veolia Transport showcased a {{prototype}} {{for the new}} model of trams. It plans to renovate the whole fleet {{at a cost of}} HKD75Million. The trams would keep their original exterior design, but the outer structure would be aluminium rather than teak as it is more durable. The benches on the lower deck would be replaced with single seats as well as a more modern look. Digital broadcasts would be placed inside trams to inform passengers of the next station, and LED lighting will be installed. AC motors and a new eddy current <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> system would be installed.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> do {{not stop}} very well, as the {{stopping}} force provided by the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> {{is less than half}} the force of normal braking and takes much longer to stop a vehicle. For vehicles with manual transmissions, the mechanical <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> is routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use on the accelerator and clutch pedals. Even an unskilled motorist can get started without rolling backwards. It is inadvisable to use rear wheel <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> when the standard brakes are available, unless {{there is a problem with}} the front wheels such as a tire blowout or slippery conditions risking a loss of control. Using the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> while driving changes the traction balance between the front and rear of the vehicle, if over applied may lock the back wheels and skid the car into a handbrake turn. Handbrake turns are often used in street racing to initiate rear wheel drift. In conditions near freezing where it is both wet and icy, the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> mechanics may freeze and be impossible to release until thawed. If only using the [...] "park" [...] function on a transmission to hold the car parked, there is no freezing problem.|$|R

25|$|Additionally, Proton has {{announced}} their partnership with LG Electronics {{in the development}} of autonomous safety technology. In September 2014, Proton previewed an Iriz prototype with LG's Advanced Drive Assistance System (ADAS). With the LG ADAS implementation, new autonomous safety features like Autonomous <b>Emergency</b> <b>Braking</b> (AEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Cross Traffic Assist (CTA), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) and High Beam Assist (HBA) can be incorporated into Proton's future offerings. The inclusion of autonomous safety features has become a necessary prerequisite for a full 5-Star Euro NCAP and ANCAP rating.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea behind}} such emergency-braking {{indicator}} systems is to catch following drivers' attention with special urgency. However, there remains considerable {{debate over whether}} the system offers a measurable increase in safety performance. To date, studies of vehicles in service have not shown significant improvement. The systems used by BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes differ not only in operational mode (growing vs. intensifying vs. flashing, respectively), but also in such parameters as deceleration threshold of activation. Data are being collected and analyzed {{in an effort to}} determine how such a system might be implemented to maximise a safety benefit, if such a benefit can be realised with visual <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> displays. An experimental study at the University of Toronto has tested stop lights which gradually and continuously grow in illuminated area with increasing braking.|$|E
25|$|The {{controller}} was a joint {{design by}} Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Hägglund, designated CMBK4. It {{was equipped with}} four cylinders. Those controlling the speed and braking were connected {{to each other and}} the controlled by the motorman by a wheel. The cylinders controlling the direction and disconnection of the motors were controlled by a lever. They were connected such that the main cylinder and the speed/braking cylinders had to be set to zero to disconnect the motors or change direction. The speed/braking controller had 24 levels. The reason for introducing a wheel was to allow the driver to man it with either hand and give it a more ergonomic location, as the motormen's job was to a greater degree to manoeuver the tram in traffic rather than a more technical control of the vehicle. The trams were unidirectional, but to allow them to back there were controls {{at the back of the}} vehicles, hidden within a hatch. It had three buttions, controlling speed, braking and <b>emergency</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> applies {{considerably}} more braking force {{than the standard}} full-service brake. The engine driver or motorman will only use the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> as a last resort, since it may cause damage; even with modern wheel slide protection, a train may develop wheel-flats, and the rails themselves can suffer profile damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake system}} {{consists}} of electro-pneumatic systems and regenerative brakes, providing multiple uses including high integrity <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes,</b> service brakes, security brakes and parking brakes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{red line}} in the figure shows the [...] "monitoring speed", which is the speed which, if exceeded, the train will {{automatically}} apply the emergency brakes. When running at constant speed this is [...] above the permitted speed for transited <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> (until speed is reduced) or [...] above the permitted speed for continuous <b>emergency</b> <b>braking.</b> When approaching a stopping point, the monitoring speed follows a braking curve similar to the permitted speed, but with a higher deceleration, that will bring it to zero at the stopping point. When approaching a speed restriction, the monitoring speed braking curve intersects the speed restriction point at [...] above the constant speed.|$|E
2500|$|The incline grade changed {{three times}} from a steep 62% grade {{at the base}} to a gentler 48% grade at the top, but the cars were {{designed}} to comfortably adjust to the differences in grade. The incline was also equipped with a safety cable which ran through an <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> mechanism under each car and provided an emergency stopping of the cars within [...] should {{a failure of the}} main cable occur.|$|E

2500|$|At 2:38AM Eastern Standard Time on January 6, 2005, NS {{freight train}} 192 (lead engine SD60 #6653) {{approached}} Graniteville at approximately 48 miles per hour. Train 192 entered <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> when the engineer saw the improperly aligned switch, {{but there was}} not sufficient distance for Train 192 to stop. [...] At 2:39AM, Train 192 was diverted by the improperly lined switch onto the siding and collided with P22. The collision derailed both lead engines, 16 of 192's 42 freight cars, and one of P22's freight cars.|$|E
2500|$|The ATC {{system was}} plagued by {{numerous}} glitches when first implemented, initially causing significantly more harm than good. Common occurrences included sending trains down the wrong tracks, and, more often, inappropriately applying <b>emergency</b> <b>braking.</b> Eventually {{the result was a}} spectacular service crisis, widely referred to as the [...] "Muni meltdown", in the summer of 1998. During this period, two reporters for the San Francisco Chronicle—one riding in the Muni Metro tunnel and one on foot on the surface—held a race through downtown, with the walking reporter emerging the winner.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designer}} of the system was James Fulton, a Dunedin-born engineer. Fulton was responsible for both selecting the route and deciding the method of operation, a hybrid between a cable car and a funicular. Like a cable car, the line had a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, but it also had a funicular-style balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley {{at the top of}} the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. There was a Fell type centre rail, used for <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> only. The line was double track, of [...] gauge.|$|E
