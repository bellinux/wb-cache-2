25|$|The Global Initiative {{is based}} on a simple principle: human {{trafficking}} is a crime of such magnitude and atrocity that it cannot be dealt with successfully by any government alone. This global problem requires a global, multi-stakeholder strategy that builds on national efforts throughout the world. To pave the way for this strategy, stakeholders must coordinate efforts already underway, increase knowledge and awareness, provide technical assistance, promote effective rights-based responses, build capacity of state and non-state stakeholders, foster partnerships for joint action, and above all, ensure that everybody takes responsibility for this fight. By encouraging and facilitating cooperation and coordination, UN.GIFT aims to create synergies among the anti-trafficking activities of UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders to develop the most efficient and cost-effective tools and <b>good</b> <b>practices.</b>|$|E

MethodsA systematic review of English language articles was undertaken to identify articles presenting guidance for <b>good</b> <b>practice</b> in DAM in the evaluation of health care. The inclusion criteria were articles providing guidance or criteria against which to assess <b>good</b> <b>practice</b> in DAM and studies providing criteria or elements for <b>good</b> <b>practice</b> in some areas of DAM. The review covered the period January 1990 to March 2014 and included the following electronic bibliographic databases: Cochrane Library, Cochrane Methodology Register and Health Technology Assessment, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, MEDLINE, and PubMed (Embase).
