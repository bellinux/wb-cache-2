25|$|The Bureau’s {{creation}} became controversial on Capitol Hill. In December 1920, a U.S. House appropriations subcommittee questioned Van Winkle and District Commissioner Charles W. Kutz. Subcommittee members Rep. George Tinkham (a Republican from Massachusetts) (and Rep. Thomas U. Sisson, a Democrat from Mississippi) objected that Congress had {{not specifically}} appropriated {{funds for a}} bureau of policewomen. Colonel Kutz responded that Congress had specifically appropriated funds for police officers, and “there {{is nothing in the}} law that requires that policemen shall be of the male sex.” During the hearing, Tinkham, an opponent of women’s suffrage, asked Van Winkle dozens of questions. When asked why she was doing this work, she replied, “because I have nothing else to do; it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> in life.” Ultimately, the Subcommittee did not withhold the Bureau’s appropriation.|$|E

5000|$|Petrov {{has said}} he does not know that he should regard himself as a hero for what he did that day. In an {{interview}} for the film The Man Who Saved the World, Petrov says, [...] "All that happened didn't matter to me — it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b> I <b>was</b> simply doing <b>my</b> <b>job,</b> and I <b>was</b> the right person at the right time, that's all. My late wife for 10 years knew nothing about it. 'So what did you do?' she asked me. 'Nothing. I did nothing.'" ...|$|R

Some reviewers have noted that Tracy's movie The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas is a parody to the movies [...] (2000), Norbit (2007), and the comedic fictional character Madea. Later, Tracy says [...] "As an actor, it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to tell the truth, hold the mirror to humanity, and sell Proactiv", this is a reference to Proactiv Solution, an over-the-counter topical treatment for mild to moderate forms of acne {{and the fact that}} the product has many celebrity spokespeople.

2500|$|Las Vegas Metro Deputy Chief Tom Roberts defused the {{situation}} by announcing that Bundy's cattle would be returned within 30 minutes. The BLM {{announced that it would}} suspend the mass roundup, citing safety reasons. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie mediated the agreement between the Bundy family and the BLM, saying, [...] "hen a group of protesters threaten civil unrest or violence in this county -- it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to step in and ensure the safety of citizens."

When I saw Lita come out in baggy pants and sneakers, wrestling the boys, I thought she was the coolest thing ever. I related to her." ...|$|R

He {{told me that}} if Poblet was {{anywhere}} near me it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to get him over the line first. I buggered off up a hill, then my manager came up and told me 'Remember what I told you.' Poblet won, I was third, that <b>is</b> <b>my</b> biggest regret. If I had won I would have been made for life.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked how}} he has {{balanced}} being a rock star and tequila mogul, Hagar responded: [...] "I always had other people doing everything. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> palate and my concept. I would go in taste and say, 'Leave this in the barrel a little bit longer.' That <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b> I could do that right before I went on stage. That’s a perfect time to do it, {{as a matter of}} fact!" ...|$|R

My journey to London to release Amanda will be just the end of my adolescence and the beginning of my real life.

6000|$|... "Sir," [...] he said, [...] "you and I have {{discussed}} this matter indirectly more than once. You {{are not yet}} of my opinion but you will be. The halfpenny Press has sickened us so with the subject of spies {{that the man who}} groans about espionage to-day is avoided like a pestilence. Yet it is my impression that there is in London, undetected and unsuspected, a marvellous system of German espionage, a company of men who have sold themselves to the enemy, whose names we should have considered above reproach. It <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to sift this matter to the bottom. I can only do so if you will give me supreme power over the censorship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I explain?" [...] he {{said with}} a half amused, half puzzled air. [...] "The feeling's not vanity. I have a {{conviction}} that this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>job,</b> and now that I begin to see my way, I have to put it through. I'm not swaggering about my abilities--there are smarter men in many ways at Allenwood; my strong point is this: I can see how things are going, and feel the drift of forces I didn't set in motion and can't control. All I do is to fall into line and let them carry me forward, instead of standing against the stream. The world demands a higher standard of economical efficiency; in using the best tools and the latest methods I'm obeying the call." ...|$|E

500|$|All of {{a sudden}} it was kicking off, big time. Everyone started piling in, right in front of me... The only people not {{involved}} were [...] John Lukic, Tony Adams, David O'Leary and me...

I felt it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other." ...|$|R
500|$|... "It was {{the first}} film that I had done with Ang that was all in English, and it's Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant — these great, great actors.

It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to look at {{something}} that Emma Thompson had done and say, 'Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead.'
