Chiang dissolved the provisional government of Shanghai, labor unions and all other organizations under Communist control, and he reorganized a network of unions with allegiance to the Kuomintang, under the control of Du Yuesheng. Over 1000 communists were arrested, some 300 were executed and more than 5,000 went missing. Western news reports later nicknamed General Bai [...] "The Hewer of Communist Heads".|$|R

The "WorkWeb System" is an expanded workflow {{system that is}} able to manage and <b>control</b> <b>office</b> resources. The "BPT agent" in the system autonomously manages each workflow process instance, trying to acquire the necessary resources to complete it in time. The WorkWeb System also provides visual interfaces to manage and <b>control</b> <b>office</b> goals and several workflow re-planning algorithms to handle exceptional cases. This paper illustrates how the resource management and workflow dynamic scheduling are performed, and discusses issues involved with this system...|$|R
