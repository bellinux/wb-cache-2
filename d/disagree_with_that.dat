25|$|Stephen Hawking and {{co-author}} Leonard Mlodinow state {{in their book}} The Grand Design that {{it is reasonable to}} ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim {{that it is possible to}} answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings. Christian mathematicians and scientists, most notably Leonhard Euler, Bernard d'Espagnat and John Lennox, <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> kind of skeptical argument.|$|E
25|$|A {{widespread}} {{popular belief}} holds that sudden expulsion of Jews from Judea/Syria Palaestina {{led to the}} Diaspora, but historians <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> view. Instead, {{they argue that the}} growth of diaspora Jewish communities was a gradual process that occurred over the centuries, starting with the Assyrian destruction of Israel, the Babylonian destruction of Judah, the Roman destruction of Judea, and the subsequent rule of Christians and Muslims. After the revolt, the Jewish religious and cultural center shifted to the Babylonian Jewish community and its scholars. For the generations that followed, the destruction of the Second Temple event came to represent a fundamental insight about the Jews who had become a dispossessed and persecuted people for much of their history.|$|E
500|$|Mauboy's weight {{has been}} the subject of media interest, ever since her rise to fame on Australian Idol when judge Kyle Sandilands {{publicly}} told her to [...] "lose the jelly belly". Mauboy told Women's Health magazine that she was proud of her curvy figure, saying [...] "having curves is one of my favourite things". In 2014, she received media attention for her weight loss transformation from a size 12 to 8. Mauboy has an alter ego named J Malley, who she described as her [...] "fearless side" [...] and [...] "sort of like Beyoncé's Sasha Fierce". Mauboy is often referred to as Australia's answer to Beyoncé. However, she does not agree with the comparisons, saying [...] "I totally <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> one. I've...watched her documentary [...] and was just blown away by how magnificent she really is and it's so inspiring for me. I just think she's fantastic and I'm completely nowhere near where she is, but I aspire to that." ...|$|E

2500|$|From Latin Ītalia, {{itself from}} Greek , from the ethnic name , plural , {{originally}} referring {{to an early}} population {{in the southern part}} of Calabria. That ethnic name probably directly relates to a word [...] (italós, [...] "bull"), quoted in an ancient Greek gloss by Hesychius (from his collection of 51,000 unusual, obscure and foreign words). This [...] "Greek" [...] word is assumed to be a cognate of Latin [...] ("calf"), although the different length of the i is a problem. The Latin [...] is presumably derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *wet- meaning [...] "year" [...] (hence, a [...] "yearling": a [...] "one-year-old calf"), although the change of e to i is unexplained. The [...] "Greek" [...] word, however, is glossed as [...] "bull", not [...] "calf". Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Víteliú, a cognate of Greek [...] and Latin [...] Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle. Some <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> etymology. Compare Italus.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2010, the vetting process used {{to approve}} history text books came into {{question}} over a fourth grade book entitled Our Virginia: Our Past and Present by Joy Masoff. Masoff {{is not a}} trained historian, but had previously published Oh Yikes! History's Grossest Moments. [...] Her text, which had {{been approved by the}} State Department of Education, claims that thousands of slaves fought for the South during the Civil War. [...] Most historians <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> view. [...] Although Virginia is one of 20 states that have a state-level process for approving text books, the book had been reviewed by a committee that did not include any trained historians. [...] Virginia's curriculum requires that the African-Americans' role in the Civil War be covered, including their work on plantations and on the sidelines of battles. So Masoff conducted internet research on the topic and found three references derived from the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who believe that slavery was not the main cause of the American Civil War. [...] The Department of Education has said it will contact school divisions and advise against teaching the passage. On October 21, the publisher of Our Virginia: Our Past and Present, which Masoff owns, announced that it will distribute sticker labels {{that can be used to}} cover the disputed paragraph.|$|E

5000|$|Ibison has {{considered}} a [...] "cosmological solution" [...] of PV, {{analogous to the}} Friedmann dust solution with flat orthogonal hyperslices in general relativity, and argues that this model is inconsistent with various observational and theoretical constraints. He also finds a rate of inspiral <b>disagreeing</b> <b>with</b> observation. The latter result <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of Watt and Misner, whose Lorentzian manifold differs from PV {{in the case of}} cosmology.|$|R
5000|$|The Obama campaign, Factcheck.org, and Politifact <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> characterization, {{noting that}} the {{sentence}} immediately preceding the [...] "you didn't build it" [...] line referred to roads and bridges and the speech concluded with Obama applauding {{the hard work of}} individuals in the creation of their own businesses. Politifact rated Romney's attack as false.|$|R
2500|$|Drake Hogestyn {{was fired}} in 2007 {{as a way to}} shrink down the budget. Later, in an attempt to {{stabilize}} ratings, he was brought back in 2008. As a result, it provided many storyline opportunities for the couple. However, with a vastly shrinking budget things didn't pan out as planned. Days of Our Lives was renewed in 2008, but the budget was slashed severely by 40%. To make do with the new restrictions, executive producer Ken Corday was forced to fire his two highest paid actors, Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn. Critics slammed the show for their firings, with TV Guide's Nelson Branco saying in an interview, [...] "The show became uglier after Hall and Hogestyn left the airwaves. Many claim {{it was the beginning of}} the end for our industry. You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who would <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> statement." [...] Matt Mitovich said their exit was, [...] "Truly the end of an era, as daytime television says goodbye to 'Days of Our Lives' John Black and Dr. Marlena Evans on Friday, Jan. 23. Drake Hogestyn and Deidre Hall, aka John and [...] "Doc," [...] have nearly 12,000 Days appearances between them over the past 32 years. As such, they will leave behind many memories for fans of NBC's long-running (and now only) sudser. The iconic couple will create another magical moment when they say goodbye to Salem and loved ones following this week's hospital bedside wedding ceremony." ...|$|E
