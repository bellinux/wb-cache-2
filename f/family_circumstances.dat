40|$|The {{available}} {{information on the}} contribution of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> to adolescent dietary behaviours is inconsistent. Indicators of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> may impact adolescent behaviours by influencing their daily home environment. This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between indicators of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> and (i) breakfast skipping and (ii) consumption of snack food, fast food, fruits and vegetables among adolescents. Dietary behaviour was assessed using a web-based survey completed by 1884 adolescents from years 7 and 9 of secondary schools in Victoria, Australia, at baseline and 2 years later. Five indicators of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> (parental marital status, maternal education, maternal employment status, number of brothers and number of sisters) were assessed with a questionnaire completed by parents at baseline only. Logistic regression {{was used to examine}} cross-sectional associations between indicators of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> and dietary behaviours. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associations between indicators of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> and 2 -year change in dietary behaviours. Individual indicators of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> were differentially associated with adolescent dietary behaviours. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations differed for adolescent boys and girls highlighting the importance of assessing specific dietary behaviours and food types individually by gender. This study highlights the complexity of the relationships between <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> and adolescent dietary behaviours. Future research needs to assess the efficacy of strategies promoting maternal nutritional knowledge on the dietary behaviours of adolescents. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{contribution}} of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> to {{physical activity and}} television viewing has not been widely investigated in pre-adolescents, and available information is inconsistent. This study examines whether television viewing and objectively measured physical activity vary by different indicators of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance.</b> Methods Data from the 2001 Children's Leisure Activity Study and the 2002 / 3 Health, Eating and Play Study, involving Australian children in Grades Prep (mean age 6 y) and 5 – 6 (mean age 11 y), were combined. Children wore accelerometers for six consecutive 24 hour periods. Average min/day in low-intensity activity (1. 0 – 1. 9 METs) and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity (≥ 3 METs) were calculated. Parents reported children's television viewing and <b>family</b> <b>circumstance.</b> Linear regression analyses were conducted separately for young girls, young boys, older girls and older boys. Results Complete data were available for 2458 children. Parental education and, to a lesser extent, employment level were inversely associated with television viewing. Children in single-parent families, those whose fathers were not in paid employment, and those without siblings tended {{to spend more time}} in low-intensity activity than their peers. Children with siblings spent more time in moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity; associations were stronger for girls. Maternal education was positively associated with moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity for younger children. Maternal employment was positively associated with moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity for older children. Multivariable models did not demonstrate a cumulative explanatory effect. Conclusion Individual measures of <b>family</b> <b>circumstance</b> were differentially associated with television, low-intensity activity and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity and associations were often not consistent across age-by-gender groups.

2500|$|Since 31 August 2009, {{legislation}} granting lesbians equal birth {{rights in}} England and Wales came into effect, meaning both {{can now be}} named on a child's birth certificate, amending the Registration of Births and Deaths Regulations 1987.

Stonewall Head of Policy and Research Ruth Hunt said the new law makes life easier for lesbian families and stated [...] "Now lesbian couples in the UK who make a considered decision to start a loving family will finally be afforded equal access to services they help fund as taxpayers". Home Office minister, Lord Brett was full of praise in his comments: This positive change means that, for the first time, female couples who have a child using fertility treatment {{have the same rights}} as their heterosexual counterparts to be shown as parents in the birth registration. It is vital that we afford equality wherever we can in society, especially as <b>family</b> <b>circumstances</b> continue to change. This is an important step forward in that process.

2500|$|But he {{was also}} sure that Oldbuck's {{greatest}} resemblance was to his own author, and this view has been widely accepted by modern critics. [...] Scott's pursuit of antiquities {{was every bit as}} enthusiastic as Oldbuck's, and he could easily have said with the laird of Monkbarns “My great-great-great-grandfather – it's a shame to the English language that we have not a less clumsy way of expressing a relationship of which we have occasion to think and speak so frequently.” [...] A particular obsession of Scott's was the tracking down of Border ballads, which he edited in The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and likewise Oldbuck was “a diligent collector of these scraps of ancient poetry”. [...] In later years Scott repeatedly compared himself to Oldbuck when discussing his antiquarian pursuits in his letters. [...] The two men were equally capable of being taken in by fraudulent impositions on their credulity, as when Scott accepted the fake ballad “Barthram’s Dirge” and a manufactured Latin legend about a spectre knight from his friend Robert Surtees. [...] They were also equally prone to buying land purely for its historical associations, Scott being in the process of completing his acquisition of the entire wide-ranging site of the battle of Melrose while he was writing The Antiquary. [...] Oldbuck’s preference for publishing his scholarly papers and the proposed notes for Lovel's Caledoniad anonymously or pseudonymously recall the fact that The Antiquary, like all the earlier Waverley novels, first appeared without Scott's name. [...] Both men were careful in their daily expenditure, yet generous to others. [...] Scott gave to his creation many of his own <b>family</b> <b>circumstances,</b> legal training, and experiences in love, with the young Oldbuck's rejection by Eveline Neville echoing quite closely Scott’s own by Williamina Belsches, even to the retreat into antiquarianism as a distraction from his sorrows. [...] John Sutherland has suggested that the name of Oldbuck's house, Monkbarns, is analogous to that of Scott’s new home Abbotsford. [...] Scott and his brainchild took opposite sides in politics – [...] Oldbuck being a Whig, Scott a Tory – and many critics have been surprised at the defence of the French Revolution Scott allows Oldbuck to voice, but it has been claimed that Oldbuck's views on this question are identical with those expressed by Scott in his Life of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Revolution being for both of them a historical necessity. [...] A. N. Wilson believed that if Scott had continued to quietly cultivate his friendships and {{the life of the mind}} like Oldbuck, rather than indulging a folie de grandeur like Wardour's, he would have died a happier man.|$|E
