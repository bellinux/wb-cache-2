However, {{there have been many}} alterations, including the removal of the chimney in 1921, the addition of the water tank and, in 1925, the construction of the <b>extraction</b> <b>tower</b> and gantry which carried grain from barges in the Victoria Dock until the 1970s and which still conveys flour to the Victoria Warehouse. The concrete wheat silos were constructed in 1964 and stand where once there were stables for Priday, Metford's heavy horses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resulting}} [...] "UNH" [...] (uranium nitrate hexahydrate) material {{pumped out}} of the vats was then processed through extraction to purify the solution. The UNH solution was passed through a multistage liquid-liquid counter current tower with tributyl phosphate and kerosene to extract the uranyl nitrate. The impurities exit the tower as the raffinate stream for further processing. The extract solution was passed through another counter current <b>extraction</b> <b>tower</b> to re-extract the uranyl nitrate from the kerosene into deionized water. The kerosene was then processed through a wash to be recycled back through the extraction process. The resulting UNH solution was now ready for further concentrating and thermal denitration.|$|E
40|$|Enrichment and {{recovery}} of valuable components in industrial waste waters by traditional liquid-liquid solvent extraction is not economic due to extremely low concentrations of those targets. Large-phase-ratio extraction exhibits potential advantages for recovery of small quantities of target components from {{large volume of}} aqueous solutions. A novel bubbling <b>extraction</b> <b>tower</b> is proposed toward performing solvent extraction at large aqueous-to-oil phase ratios in this work. Organic extractants were covered onto surface of gas bubbles to form a layer of organic liquid membrane and the dispersed organic phase in tower could be small enough. The target components are extracted from aqueous feed solution {{onto the surface of}} the bubbles, and the enrichment ratios could be extremely high. We develop a feasible methodology to calculate tower height and operation phase ratios of the bubbling <b>extraction</b> <b>tower,</b> which is essential for future industrial scale-up. Experimental results in pilot test are highly consistent with calculations. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineer...|$|E

40|$|Steel towers from a {{decommissioned}} {{heavy water}} plant {{were to be}} demolished. Ground motions due to the proposed felling were estimated {{in order to assess}} the structural integrity of neighboring buildings and piping systems. The <b>extraction</b> <b>towers</b> were 125 feet (38. 1 m) high in two sizes: 6. 5 and 11 feet (1. 98 and 3. 35 m) inside diameters weighing 215 X 10 {sup 3 } and 470 X 10 {sup 3 } lb (956 X 10 {sup 3 } and 2. 1 X 10 {sup 6 } N). The total potential energy of the tower collapse was about 15 X 10 {sup 6 } and 32 X 10 {sup 6 } ft-lb (20. 3 X 10 {sup 6 } and 43. 4 X 10 {sup 6 } Nm) for the small and large towers, respectively. The ground motion predictions were based on a credible theoretical relationship with constants estimated from data available for a different location at the site for dynamic compaction with an energy input an order of magnitude less than that for the towers. Due to the uncertainty of prediction of ground motions a coefficient of variation of 2. 0 was used in the structural assessment. Ground motion from the collapse of the <b>extraction</b> <b>towers</b> were monitored by several 3 - and 6 -components seismographs. Recorded measurements indicated that the ground motion was less than the predicted values. Peak radial motions were approximately equal to the vertical ones. Video tapes of the demolition suggested significant internal energy losses. The measurements suggested that the tower potential energy conversion to dynamic impact energy was about 25 percent. 7 figs...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} demonstrations of intermolecular forces is the tension at the surface of liquid n-alkanes. The prediction of surface tension is important in the design of distillation <b>towers,</b> <b>extraction</b> units and <b>tower</b> internals such as bubble caps and trays, since it has a considerable influence on the transfer of mass and energy across interfaces. Surface tension data are needed wherever foaming emulsification, droplet formation or wetting are involved. They are also required in a number of equations for two-phase flow calculations and for determining the flow regime. Petroleum engineers are especially interested in the surface tension in the extraction of crude oil to add surfactants to modify the interfacial properties between crude oil and the geological reservoir to improve production and increase oil yields. In this work, a simple computer program using Arrhenius-type asymptotic exponential function, Vandermoned matrix and Matlab technical computing language, is developed for the estimation of surface tension of paraffin hydrocarbons as a function of molecular weight and temperature. The surface tension is calculated for temperatures in the range of 250 to 440 K and paraffin hydrocarbons molecular weights between 30 and 250. The proposed numerical technique is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly if more data become available in the future. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviation being less than 2 %...|$|R

40|$|Extraction and {{recovery}} of gold(I) with extremely low concentration in cyanide wastewater were conducted {{as an example}} aimed to develop a feasible method based upon the experimental kinetic data for calculating the required mass transfer height of a new bubbling organic liquid membrane <b>extraction</b> <b>tower.</b> The kinetic extraction equation based on curve lain fitting the experimental c(t) similar to t data from single column extraction could be established to describe the quantitative relationship of the concentration change of gold(I) in flowing-out aqueous solution from the tower with the reaction time in the tower, so that the required tower height involved in the axial gas mixing effect could be calculated from the residence time of the aqueous solution passing through the tower to achieve a target equilibrating concentration. The influence of organic phase recycling on the calculation was discussed. Double column extraction experiments confirmed that the suggested calculation method obtained from single column extraction is reasonable. The present work {{is in favor of}} understanding the mass transferring kinetic behaviors of target components in that suggested bubbling <b>extraction</b> <b>tower,</b> and it highlights a feasible strategy directly from the experimental kinetic data to calculate the required mass transferring height of the tower for its structure design, optimization, and scale-up, and provides fundamental data for future industrial application of the tower to extract and recover other heavy metal ions from wastewater...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aspen Plus is a {{simulation}} system of large-scale generalized flowsheet. It {{is to describe}} the chemical process by using a digital model, and to obtain the desired results on the computer by changing various effective conditions. The main component with higher value in citronella oil is high purity citronellal. Due to its boiling point, temperature-sensitive and other issues, the difficulty of distillation process increases. This paper conducts process design and simulation on citronella oil high vacuum distillation process by using Aspen Plus software, obtains the process parameters of citronellal <b>extraction</b> <b>tower,</b> explores the relationship between reflux ratio {{and the number of}} theoretical plates, and provides data support for the continuous production of citronellal in citronella oil system.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the study deals with {{evaluation}} of dynamic characteristics of selected typical industrial facilities, such as the <b>extraction</b> steel <b>tower,</b> reinforced concrete tower skips. These structures are located in the coal mine area. The constructions of the test items are varied and complicated, which causes difficulties in the research in situ. In the investigation we used normal and emergency operation of lifting equipment, the effect of wind gusts and rhythmic man swaying. The second part of the study involves the determination of the dynamic characteristics of tailing dam. In this case mining tremors were used as the sources of vibration excitations. By using natural vibration excitation source it was possible to determine the lowest frequency of free vibration of the tailing dam. The third part of the paper focuses on the results of measurements of mine-induced ground vibrations and vibrations of residential buildings of various types. Typical one-family masonry houses as well as 5 and 12 storey reinforced prefabricated buildings were examined. The studies were conducted to determine the transmission of free-field vibrations to the building foundations. According to the significant differences between the simultaneously measured ground and building foundation vibrations, results of experimental tests obtained by means of response spectra are essential for the proper adoption of kinematic loads for dynamic models of these structures. The results of experimental studies were the basis for the verification of dynamic models of investigated structures...|$|R
5000|$|Diffusers {{are long}} vessels of many metres {{in which the}} beet slices go in one {{direction}} while hot water goes in the opposite direction. The movement may either {{be caused by a}} rotating screw or the whole rotating unit, and the water and cossettes move through internal chambers. The three common designs of diffuser are the horizontal rotating 'RT' (Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, manufacturer), inclined screw 'DDS' (De Danske Sukkerfabrikker), or vertical screw [...] "Tower". Modern <b>tower</b> <b>extraction</b> plants have a processing capacity of up to 17,000 t per day. A less-common design uses a moving belt of cossettes, with water pumped onto the top of the belt and poured through. In all cases, the flow rates of cossettes and water are in the ratio one to two. Typically, cossettes take about 90 minutes to pass through the diffuser, the water only 45 minutes. These countercurrent exchange methods extract more sugar from the cossettes using less water than if they merely sat in a hot water tank. The liquid exiting the diffuser is called raw juice. The colour of raw juice varies from black to a dark red depending on the amount of oxidation, which is itself dependent on diffuser design.|$|R
40|$|Butadiene 1 : 3 is {{separated}} from other C 4 -hydrocarbons by extractive distillation in a sieve plate tower. Prior to the development work to be described, the pressure in the <b>extraction</b> <b>tower</b> was controlled at a fixed value. The tower pressure-boilup control loop did not behave satisfactorily {{in the presence of}} non-condensables which entered with the feed. The capacity of the flooded reflux drum condenser for the tower was limiting production during summer months. The tower pressure control loop was put on manual. The pressure was allowed to drop to its lowest attainable value for the existing conditions of boilup and condenser cooling capability. This manner of operation is known as floating pressure control. By taking advantage of the higher relative volatility at the lower tower pressure, energy usage was reduced and there was an increase in production capacity. The tower operation at a lower temperature reduced tower and reboiler fouling. Substantial savings have resulted from these improvements. The annual energy consumption has been reduced by 25 % and maximum productive capacity is higher by 15 %. The rate of tower and reboiler fouling has not been fully quantified but is greatly reduced. A more stable tower operation has also contributed to higher productivity and reduced energy usage. Venting of non-condensables does not affect tower stability and the operators have adapted well to the new control strategy...|$|E
