Welles later said that the nightclub set was available after another film had wrapped and that filming took 10 to 12 days to complete. For these scenes Welles had Comingore's throat sprayed with chemicals to give <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> harsh, raspy tone. Other scenes shot in secret included those in which Thompson interviews Leland and Bernstein, which were also shot on sets built for other films.|$|E
25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{provides}} {{a way for the}} clients and therapist to work together to create subjective truth and meaning for the client. Where other therapies such as Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Rational-emotive behavioral therapy, Dialectical-behavioral therapy, and other eclectic approaches frequently create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client. For example, a client seeing a counselor may want to work on becoming more of an individual by exploring his or her self-concept by finding personal meaning, breaking away from social trends and peer pressure, and discovering his or her own interests. Therapists utilizing traditional theories, like cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, or even eclectic approaches, will guide the client in this process according to how the therapist's chosen therapy would say about how an individual ought to go about this process. In other words, the client will have to commit to exploring his or her self-concept based on how cognitive behavioral therapy, or another therapy, says the client should learn about who they are, therefore limiting the amount of freedom afforded to the client to creatively develop his or her own ways of self-exploration. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that hermeneutic psychotherapy strives to provide freedom to the client by affording his or <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> privileged position in therapy to develop their own options.|$|E

McEntire has often credited Dolly Parton for influencing this trait, stating that she would always listen to Parton's records and find her style of vocal gymnastics [...] "so pretty".|$|E

500|$|The major voice work of E.T. for {{the film}} was {{performed}} by Pat Welsh. She smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, which gave <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> quality that sound effects creator Ben Burtt liked. She spent nine-and-a-half hours recording her part, and was paid $380 by Burtt for her services. He also recorded 16 other people and various animals to create E.T.'s [...] "voice". These included Spielberg, Debra Winger, his sleeping wife, who had a cold, a burp from his USC film professor, raccoons, otters, and horses.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Chis Payne commented for Billboard magazine: [...] "Evancho’s stratospheric vocals are {{of course}} {{impressive}} for someone her age, though pipes like this are incredible for just about anyone." [...] in 2015, the reviewer for Digital Journal wrote: [...] "The control she displays over her voice is tremendous, and she tackles the high notes ... effortlessly, showcasing her angelic vocals and piercing pipes." [...] Robin Leach wrote of Evancho's 2015 concert in Las Vegas: [...] "She’s still got the voice of an angel. It’s remarkable, and her power is growing as she grows up. [...] had the audience on its feet with wild applause {{at the end of}} every song". Some reviewers, beginning in 2015, noticed a lack of connection with the text; a review in The Washington Post called <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> [...] "bell-like instrument, devoid of any messy human emotions [...] an ethereally floating tone. ... But imagine what Evancho can achieve once she stops obsessing over just sounding pretty, and actually listens to the words she’s singing." [...] Reviewing one of Evancho's 2016 concerts, Steve Barnes similarly wrote for the Times Union that her voice is [...] "an instrument of pristine beauty. It peals with the purity of bells and lofts tones that shimmer with celestial iridescence" [...] but that her performance lacks [...] "an apparent interpretive style or emotional connection to the material".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Donna Murphy's vocal {{performance}} as Gothel has garnered unanimous praise. Critics hailed the actress as a [...] "standout" [...] – in particular, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly singled out Gothel as [...] "a firecracker" [...] amidst an otherwise [...] "sedate" [...] cast. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that [...] "Donna Murphy does evil deliciously {{as the voice}} of Mother Gothel", while Nows Norman Wilner felt that the actress successfully [...] "channelled" [...] Broadway actress Patti LuPone in her performance. Meanwhile, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph compared Murphy's performance to actress and singer Julie Andrews, writing, [...] "the Julie-Andrews-on-stimulants vocal stylings of Broadway star Donna Murphy ... makes Mother Gothel into a memorable manipulative diva". Joe Neumaier of the Daily News called Murphy's acting [...] "deliciously mischievous". Meanwhile, Jonathan Crocker of Total Film wrote, [...] "Donna Murphy's vocal {{performance as}} the vain, villainous fake-matriarch is marvellous", adding, [...] "her belted-out rendition of 'Mother Knows Best' is easily the film's top musical number". Likewise, the Tampa Bay Times Steve Persall penned, [...] "Nobody but Murphy should be cast as Gothel", continuing, [...] "her 'Mother Knows Best' is a knockout". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy felt that [...] "Donna Murphy steals the show". Similarly dubbing Murphy a scene-stealer, Canoe.ca's Lindsey Ward wrote that [...] "Murphy ... turns into a giant spectacle with <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>a</b> powerful force to be reckoned with". David Edelstein of Vulture.com hailed Murphy as [...] "Broadway's gift to animated movies", praising in particular the actress' delivery of [...] "the movie's best line: [...] "Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?” Quickflix deemed Murphy [...] "wonderful", while Stephen Witty of The Star-Ledger called her [...] "terrific". Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media opined, [...] "As for the dramatic tension, it's best in the form of Mother Gothel – brilliantly played by Murphy, whose signature Broadway voice ... adds the necessary punch". Chen added that Gothel [...] "is ... a personal favorite" [...] while comparing the character to Cher and actress Sophia Loren. The A.V. Clubs Tasha Robinson wrote that Gothel was [...] "magnificently voiced by star Murphy". Murphy's performance of [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] has also been very positively received, with critics again comparing the actress to Julie Andrews. While calling Gothel's voice [...] "to die for", Peter Travers of Rolling Stone deemed her performance of the song [...] "comic bliss". Linda Cook of the Quad-City Times penned that the song was [...] "belted out wonderfully by Murphy and makes the purchase of the soundtrack worthwhile". Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle opined, [...] "Murphy brings stage showmanship to her musical interludes as Mother Gothel, which drip with sarcasm and biting wit." [...] Slant Magazines Christian Blauvelt, who felt that the film's songs lacked as a result of Moore's [...] "pop-star vocals", happened to very much enjoy Gothel's performances, writing, [...] "when Broadway vet Murphy takes to scaling Menken's octave-climbing melodies like a vocal escalator, it's a different story". Calling Gothel [...] "one of the most potent schemers in the Disney canon", Times Richard Corliss felt that Murphy's performance was worthy of a Tony Award for Best Actress, concluding, [...] "no one can summon the malice in humor, and the fun in pain, like this prima Donna". In his review of the film's soundtrack, James Christopher Monger of AllMusic wrote that both [...] "Moore and Murphy take on the lion's share of the work here, and both deliver the goods".|$|E

2500|$|She celebrated her {{retirement}} by issuing a vocal album entitled Modae no Heya. On this disc's recent re-release in CD format, a reviewer commented of Tani's vocals, [...] "There’s a worldliness {{in her voice}} and a maturity which suggests she’s seen it all... There is however a fragility to <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>a</b> cracking sense of the truly erotic, the unseen, the taboo which drapes each syllable... hearing music which would usually be readily associated with a mid-70s Samurai movie bedding down with such muted eroticism {{is more than a}} winning formula." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, 2008, on the 85th {{anniversary of}} Callas's birth, {{a group of}} Greek and Italian {{officials}} unveiled a plaque in her honor at Flower Hospital (now the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center) where she was born. Made of Carrara marble and engraved in Italy, the plaque reads, [...] "Maria Callas was born in this hospital on December 2, 1923.

2500|$|Sirens {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a symbol for the dangerous temptation embodied by women regularly throughout Christian art of the medieval era; however, in the 17th century, some Jesuit writers began to assert their actual existence, including Cornelius a Lapide, who said of woman, [...] "her glance is that of the fabled basilisk, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> siren's voice—with her voice she enchants, with her beauty she deprives of reason—voice and sight alike deal destruction and death."

2500|$|From {{her work}} with the Blake Babies to the present, Hatfield's output has been {{characterized}} by an alternation between heavy, rocking tunes and songs written in a gentler, more melodic or folk-oriented style. [...] Hatfield has stated that in the 1990s she tried smoking cigarettes {{for a short time}} in the hope of giving <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> rougher quality, but eventually reconciled herself with her distinctive vocal instrument. A survey of her releases shows her voice to be remarkably agile, with little vibrato but capable of both forcefulness and sensitivity, making it well suited to the multitracked vocal harmonies that feature prominently on most of her albums.|$|E
2500|$|Following Clinton's [...] "choked up moment" [...] in New Hampshire and {{surprise}} victory there the following day, discussion of gender's {{role in the}} campaign moved front and center. Clinton's win in New Hampshire {{was the first time}} a woman had ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. (Shirley Chisholm's prior [...] "win" [...] in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern.) Women following the campaign recalled a series of criticisms of Clinton, such as the pitch of <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>a</b> debate moderator's question of whether she was [...] "likeable" [...] (and Obama's reply that she was [...] "likeable enough", felt by some to be condescending), and hecklers' demands that she [...] "iron their shirt", as motivations for re-examining who they would support in the contest.|$|E
2500|$|Bene Gesserit {{are trained}} in what they call [...] "the Voice" [...] a means [...] "to control others merely by {{selected}} tone shadings of the voice." [...] By modulating the subtleties of <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>a</b> Bene Gesserit can issue commands on a subconscious level, compelling obedience in others that they cannot resist, whether they are consciously aware of the attempt or not. This control can be as subtle as influencing thoughts and motivations, or as strong as forcing physical actions and even temporary paralysis in the subject. To effect this, the Bene Gesserit must [...] "register" [...] the intended target by analyzing his or her personality and vocal patterns through observation or seemingly innocuous direct questions. Training in the Voice is independent of the Reverend Mother ritual, so individuals outside the order may even be instructed in its use. Prior to Dune, Jessica has begun teaching it to Paul; after the Reverend Mother Mohiam tests him in the novel, she urges Jessica to [...] "ignore the regular order of training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it, but we both know how much more he needs ... and that desperately." [...] Jessica herself later notes of Paul's novice attempt: [...] "The tone, the timbre excellent – imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man's spectrum." [...] The Voice may also be subtly employed in any manner of conversation, public speaking, or debate to help soothe, convince, persuade, influence, or otherwise enhance {{the effect of the}} words being spoken.|$|E
