25|$|The Bell 430 {{features}} several {{significant improvements}} over the 230, {{the most significant}} of these being the new four-blade, bearingless, <b>hingeless,</b> composite main rotor. Although both the 230 and 430 are powered by Rolls-Royce (Allison) 250 turboshaft engines, the 430's engines are 10% more powerful. Other changes include the 1ft 6in (46cm) stretched fuselage, providing for two extra seats, an optional EFIS flight deck, and a choice of either skids or retractable wheeled undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|The EC135 started {{development}} {{prior to}} the formation of Eurocopter under Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) under the designation Bo 108 in the 1970s. MBB developed it in partnership with Aérospatiale, the Bo 108 was initially intended to be a technology demonstrator, combining attributes of the successful MBB Bo 105 with new advances and an aerodynamically streamlined design. Technologies included on the Bo108 included the first full-authority digital engine controls (FADEC) on a helicopter, a <b>hingeless</b> main rotor, and the adoption of a new transmission. The first prototype made its first flight on 17 October 1988, powered by two Allison 250-C20R/1 engines. A second Bo108 followed on 5 June 1991, this time with two Turbomeca TM319-1B Arrius engines; unlike later production aircraft, both technology demonstrators flew with conventional tail rotors.|$|E
25|$|The Tiger {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} {{a wide range of}} combat missions, including armed reconnaissance and surveillance, anti-tank and close air support, escort and protection of friendly assets; and can operate during day or night in all-weather conditions, and has been designed to include operations in the aftermath of nuclear, biological, or chemical warfare. The Tiger can also be used in the maritime environment, able to operate from the decks of ships including frigates and during extreme weather conditions. Amongst the Tiger's notable qualities, it possesses very high levels of agility, much of which is attributed to the design of its 13-meter four-bladed <b>hingeless</b> main rotor; the Tiger can perform full loops and negative g manoeuvres. Power is provided by a pair of FADEC-controlled MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce MTR390 turboshaft engines.|$|E
2500|$|Bell {{participated in}} a joint Bell-Government {{integrated}} test team during the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the H-1 program. The AH-1Z program progressed slowly from 1996 to 2003 largely as a research and development operation. [...] The existing two-blade semi-rigid, teetering rotor system is being replaced with a four-blade, <b>hingeless,</b> bearingless rotor system. The four-blade configuration provides improvements in flight characteristics including increased flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate of climb, payload and reduced rotor vibration level.|$|E
2500|$|The AH-1Z's new bearingless, <b>hingeless</b> {{rotor system}} has 75% fewer parts {{than that of}} {{four-bladed}} articulated systems. The blades are made of composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, {{and there is a}} semiautomatic folding system for storage aboard amphibious assault ships. [...] Its two redesigned wing stubs are longer, with each adding a wingtip station for a missile such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder. [...] Each wing has two other stations for 2.75-inch (70mm) Hydra 70 rocket pods, or AGM-114 Hellfire quad missile launchers. The AN/APG-78 Longbow fire control radar can also be mounted on a wingtip station.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existing}} two-bladed semi-rigid, teetering {{rotor system}} is being {{replaced with a}} four-bladed, <b>hingeless,</b> bearingless composite rotor system. The improvement in flight characteristics provided by the four-bladed configuration has led to increases in flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate-of-climb, payload and [...] reduced rotor vibration. The rotor system has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems, and the improved yokes allow for weight saving with {{the elimination of all}} bearings, hinges, and vibration absorbers in the rotor hub. The blades are made of carbon fiber-based composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, and there is a semiautomatic folding system for stowage aboard Amphibious assault ships. Both helicopters will receive an upgraded, four-blade tail rotor and drive system.|$|E
2500|$|The EC135 is a {{twin-engine}} rotorcraft. It can be alternatively {{powered by}} a pair of Turbomeca Arrius 2B or Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206B engines, dependent on customer's preference. [...] The main rotor is of a four-bladed, <b>hingeless</b> fiber-composite design; progressive improvements to the main rotor have increased its performance and reduced maintenance costs since the type's introduction. The EC135 holds the distinction of being the quietest helicopter in its class, featuring an anti-resonance isolation system to dampen vibration from the main rotor. The type's fenestron anti-torque device can be actively regulated via a HI NR rotor optimization mode, which provides for greater controllability during higher weight take-off and landings. It is capable of performing Category A operations throughout its full flight envelope.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few basic}} items of {{equipment}} {{are needed to}} collect stamps. Stamp tongs help to handle stamps safely, a magnifying glass helps in viewing fine details and an album is a convenient way to store stamps. The stamps need to {{be attached to the}} pages of the album in some way and stamp hinges are a cheap and simple way to do this. [...] Hinging stamps can damage them, thus reducing their value; today many collectors prefer more expensive <b>hingeless</b> mounts. Issued in various sizes, these are clear chemically neutral thin plastic holders that open to receive stamps and are gummed on the back so that they stick to album pages. [...] Another alternative is a stockbook where the stamps drop into clear pockets without the need for a mount. Stamps should be stored away from light, heat and moisture or they will be damaged.|$|E
60|$|As {{he crossed}} the square, walking homeward, the light {{laughter}} of a girl reached his burning ear. The frail gay sound smote his heart more strongly than a trumpet blast, and, not daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, into {{the shadow of the}} tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma appeared before him, and under her eyes the flood of shame rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind had subjected her or how his brute-like lust had torn and trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils. The soot-coated packet of pictures which he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of whose shameless or bashful wantonness he lay for hours sinning in thought and deed; his monstrous dreams, peopled by ape-like creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes; the foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or beneath some <b>hingeless</b> door in some niche in the hedges where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these things? A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain.|$|E

[...] The mata mata's plastron is reduced, narrowed, <b>hingeless,</b> shortened towards the front, and deeply notched at the rear with narrow bridges. These may be meant to allow the turtle to resemble a piece of bark, camouflaging it from possible predators. The plastron and bridges are cream to yellow or brown.|$|E

50|$|The mast is a {{cylindrical}} {{metal shaft}} that extends upwards from the transmission. At {{the top of}} the mast is the attachment point for the rotor blades called the hub. The rotor blades are attached to the hub. Main rotor systems are classified according to how the rotor blades are attached and move relative to the hub. There are three basic types: <b>hingeless,</b> fully articulated, and teetering; although some modern rotor systems use a combination of these.|$|E
50|$|The Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105 is a light, twin-engine, {{multi-purpose}} helicopter developed by Bölkow of Ottobrunn, Germany. It holds {{the distinction of}} being the first light twin-engine helicopter in the world, and is the first rotorcraft that could perform aerobatic maneuvers, such as inverted loops. The Bo 105 features a revolutionary <b>hingeless</b> rotor system, at that time a pioneering innovation in helicopters when it was introduced into service in 1970. Production of the Bo 105 began at the then-recently merged Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB).|$|E
5000|$|Utility Helicopter Bo 105 - {{flight testing}} the <b>hingeless</b> rotor system. This {{helicopter}} {{is a success}} story and does not need further introduction. First attempt to lift off was on September 14th, 1966 in the Bo 105 V1. The prototype was lost when it entered ground resonance. Fred emerged uninjured and was quoted “that he had lots of room to exit the helicopter”. First flight was on February 16th, 1967. According to Fred´s logbook this flight lasted from 17:04 to 17:24 LT and was a success.|$|E
50|$|The {{carapace}} is flattened dorsally {{and highest}} anterior to the bridge. It has a medium-sized, broad head that appears triangular from above. The head's concave sides are most obvious {{on the upper}} part of the short snout. It has paddle-like forelimbs, each having two anterior claws. The upperparts are grayish green to olive in color, but sometimes appear reddish due to algae growing on the carapace. The bridge and <b>hingeless</b> plastron of an adult varies from greenish white in younger individuals to a creamy yellow in older specimens.|$|E
5000|$|The A160's rotor {{includes}} blades whose {{stiffness and}} cross-section vary along their length. Their low loading and rigid, <b>hingeless</b> design allows for changing RPM between 140 and 350 using a two-speed transmission to optimize efficiency at different speeds and altitudes, {{a technique called}} [...] "optimum speed rotor technology", invented by Abe Karem. It is primarily because of these features that the Hummingbird can fly with less power - and thus use less fuel - than comparable conventional helicopters, which only adjust blade pitch and keep the rotor at constant rpm.|$|E
50|$|Nicolas Florine, a Russian engineer, {{built the}} first twin tandem rotor machine to perform a free flight. It flew in Sint-Genesius-Rode, at the Laboratoire Aérotechnique de Belgique (now von Karman Institute) in April 1933, and {{attained}} an altitude of six meters (20 ft) and an endurance of eight minutes. Florine chose a co-rotating configuration because the gyroscopic stability of the rotors would not cancel. Therefore, the rotors had to be tilted slightly in opposite directions to counter torque. Using <b>hingeless</b> rotors and co-rotation also minimised the stress on the hull. At the time, {{it was one of}} the most stable helicopters in existence.|$|E
5000|$|The AH-1Z's new bearingless, <b>hingeless</b> {{rotor system}} has 75% fewer parts {{than that of}} {{four-bladed}} articulated systems.

50|$|Even {{with the}} use of peelable hinges and care to {{minimize}} the moisture used, the hinge will leave a visible disturbance in the gum of an unused stamp. While this was formerly a matter of indifference, since about the middle of the 20th century many collectors have come to prefer “unhinged stamps” showing no trace of hinging. In some cases, the price differential is 2-to-1 or more, resulting in the quip that the “gum {{on the back of a}} stamp is the most valuable substance in the world”. Collectors preferring unhinged stamps typically use pocket-like or sleeve-like <b>hingeless</b> mount. Nevertheless, stamp hinges remain popular as a mounting method.|$|E

5000|$|The S-97 design {{includes}} {{variable speed}} rigid coaxial main rotors and a variable-pitch pusher propeller, making the S-97 a compound helicopter. Like the X2, it has fly-by-wire control and dynamic anti-vibration actuators {{to cancel out}} shaking. The main rotors have <b>hingeless</b> hubs and stiff blades, to improve low-speed handling and efficiency of hover. At high speeds, the close spacing of the hubs reduces drag. The stiff blades allow each rotor to have low lift on the retreating side of its rotor disk (reducing drag), whereas each rotor on a conventional coaxial rotor with [...] "floppy" [...] blades needs nearly equal lift distribution. The propeller relieves the rotor of propulsion, further reducing drag.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{preceding}} LZ-1 through LZ-4, the LZ-5 utilized designer Glidden Doman's unorthodox gimbaled rotor head system, which featured {{the elimination of}} rotor hinges and dampers and included blades of soft-in-plane dynamic design. The servo control system was entirely contained within the rotor head, with no external oil tanks or plumbing. The tail rotor was also <b>hingeless</b> and free floating to eliminate stresses in rapid tail rotor turns. In other ways it had a conventional helicopter main rotor and tail rotor configuration. The pilot and co-pilot were seated over the engine, {{which was in the}} nose, and a six-passenger compartment was located behind them. The engine was cooled by exhaust ejectors, producing an energy saving that increased payload by 800 pounds. The aircraft featured wheeled quadricycle undercarriage, the main units of which carried dual wheels.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "rigid rotor" [...] usually {{refers to}} a <b>hingeless</b> rotor system [...] with blades {{flexibly}} attached to the hub. Irv Culver of Lockheed developed {{one of the first}} rigid rotors, which was tested and developed on a series of helicopters in the 1960s and 1970s. In a rigid rotor system, each blade flaps and drags about flexible sections of the root. A rigid rotor system is mechanically simpler than a fully articulated rotor system. Loads from flapping and lead/lag forces are accommodated through rotor blades flexing, rather than through hinges. By flexing, the blades themselves compensate for the forces that previously required rugged hinges. The result is a rotor system that has less lag in control response because of the large hub moment typically generated. The rigid rotor system thus eliminates the danger of mast bumping inherent in teetering rotors.|$|E
5000|$|The EC145 {{features}} a larger cabin space than the older BK 117 C1 helicopter with internal space increased by 46 cm (18 in) {{in length and}} 13 cm (5 in) in width, increasing cabin volume by 1.0 m³ (35 ft³) to 6.0 m³ (211 ft³). Other improvements over the BK 117 include an increased maximum take-off weight and greater range, achieved partially by the adoption of composite rotor blades, which were derived from the smaller EC135. The EC145 has a <b>hingeless</b> rotor system with a monolithic titanium hub; the helicopter was originally powered {{by a pair of}} Turboméca Arriel 1E2 turboshaft engines, later aircraft are powered by the upgraded Turboméca Arriel 2E engine. A key feature of the rotorcraft is the variable rotorspeed and torque matching system (VARTOMS), derived from the BK 117, which Eurocopter has attributed as making the EC145 [...] "the quietest helicopter in its class".|$|E
50|$|The {{carapace}} of T. s. troostii is olive {{brown with}} yellow markings. It has two rounded projections on the posterior {{edge of the}} shell, and is slightly keeled. The adult carapace is wrinkled and oval-shaped. The plastron is <b>hingeless</b> and slightly smaller than the carapace. Each of the bottom sides of the marginals has a spot. The skin is brown with an olive to greenish tint with yellow striping. There is a distinct bar behind the eyes that can vary from yellow to red and be either thin or wide. The plastron of the turtle has dark spots, {{as well as the}} ridge of the carapace. Also, the plastron has bars or stripes of yellow. The turtle's legs in front have larger yellow stripes than most slider species. There is a yellow and orange stripe directly behind each eye. The stripe is never entirely one color, it starts out yellow and then fades into a dark orange-to-red color closer {{to the back of the}} neck.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, {{development}} work began at Bölkow upon the helicopter {{that would become}} the Bo 105, although work on the <b>hingeless</b> rotor it would use had begun earlier. On 16 February 1967, the second Bo 105A prototype conducted its maiden flight at Ottobrunn in Germany; the first public demonstration was held in May 1967. The test program was broken down into stages as the Bo 105 comprised a new airframe, new rotor system, and a new engine; thus the flying Bo 105 prototype was initially equipped with a main rotor from Westland Helicopter's Scout rotorcraft {{and a pair of}} Allison Model 250 turboshaft engines instead of their production counterparts. Sud Aviation worked with Bölkow on developing the rotorcraft; an Alouette II helicopter was modified with the Bo 105's rotor and used to test its performance envelope. The third Bo 105 prototype was equipped with the initial production standard MAN Turbo 6022 turboshaft engines; a total of six pre-production Bo 105s were constructed for testing.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} feature of the Bo 105 is its rotor blades and rotor head. The rotor system is entirely <b>hingeless,</b> the rotor head consisting of a solid titanium block to which the four blades are bolted; {{the flexibility of the}} rotor blades works to absorb movements typically requiring hinges in most helicopter rotor designs. The rotor blades are made from reinforced-plastic glass-fiber composite material; the flexibility of the main rotor allows for active elements other than rotor pitch changes to be removed, greatly simplifying maintenance and extending blade lifespan. The reliability of the advanced rotor system is such that, in over six million operating hours across the fleet, there were a total of zero failures (as of 1991). The rigid rotor blade design adopted on the Bo 105 has been partially responsible for the type's agility and responsiveness; it remained an uncommon feature on competing helicopters throughout the Bo 105's production life.|$|E
50|$|The {{helicopter}} rotor {{is powered}} by the engine, through the transmission, to the rotating mast. The mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends upward from—and is driven by—the transmission. At {{the top of the}} mast is the attachment point for the rotor blades called the hub. The rotor blades are then attached to the hub, and the hub can have 10-20 times the drag of the blade. Main rotor systems are classified according to how the main rotor blades are attached and move relative to the main rotor hub. There are three basic classifications: <b>hingeless,</b> teetering, and fully articulated, although some modern rotor systems use a combination of these classifications. A rotor is a finely tuned rotating mass, and different subtle adjustments reduce vibrations at different airspeeds. The rotors are designed to operate at a fixed RPM (within a narrow range of a few percent), but a few experimental aircraft used variable speed rotors.|$|E
50|$|Nine {{species of}} Graptemys turtle could allow {{confusion}} in distinguishing it from other {{species in the}} same genus. A few key diagnostic features set the Alabama map turtle apart. The black stripe {{down the center of}} its back with knobs extruding from it is a diagnostic characteristic for this species that separates it from other turtle species. Adult males range from 9.0 - 12.7 cm and retain most coloration and pattern from its juvenile stage. Females range from 18.0 - 29.2 cm, have extremely large heads for crushing snails and mollusks, and lose a majority of their markings and patterns, becoming drabber than juveniles and males. Carapace (upper half of shell) color can be olive to dull green with a slightly visible black stripe in adults. Juveniles exhibit a dark stripe running down a more olive carapace. The outermost edge on the upper half of the shell usually contains light reticulate markings and the scutes (scale-like structure) contain a yellowish bar or semicircle. Dark rings are usually present on the lower surface of each outer scute. It contains a <b>hingeless</b> yellow plastron (bottom half of shell) notched in the back. A narrow black margin borders the edge of each scute. It has a brown to olive head with a large mark that ranges from light green to yellow located between and behind the eyes. The lateral and dorsal head stripes can be continuous or separated. Chin stripes are found transversally and/or longitudinally. The feet are webbed with a striped tail and limbs. Growth rate is rapid in juveniles, but slows promptly at maturity. Females reach full size around 23 years old and can live 50 years or more in natural conditions. Females have significantly larger jaws, while males have long and thick tails with vents past the edge of the carapaces.|$|E
