5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and <b>deep</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E

40|$|Intrinsic, three-dimensionally resolved, {{microscopic}} imaging of dynamical {{structures and}} biochemical processes in living preparations has been realized by nonlinear laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. The search for useful two-photon and three-photon excitation spectra, {{motivated by the}} emergence of nonlinear microscopy as a powerful biophysical instrument, has now discovered a virtual artist's palette of chemical indicators, fluorescent markers, and native biological fluorophores, including NADH, flavins, and green fluorescent proteins, that are applicable to living biological preparations. More than 25 two-photon excitation spectra of ultraviolet and visible absorbing molecules reveal useful cross sections, some conveniently blue-shifted, for near-infrared absorption. Measurements of three-photon fluorophore excitation spectra now define alternative windows at relatively benign wavelengths to excite <b>deeper</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> fluorophores. The inherent optical sectioning capability of nonlinear excitation provides three-dimensional resolution for imaging and avoids out-of-focus background and photodamage. Here, the measured nonlinear excitation spectra and their photophysical characteristics that empower nonlinear laser microscopy for biological imaging are described...|$|R

25|$|Rows 1–4 of the midband are {{specialised}} for colour vision, from ultraviolet to longer wavelengths. Their UV vision {{can detect}} five different frequency bands in the <b>deep</b> <b>ultraviolet.</b> To do this they use two photoreceptors {{in combination with}} four different colour filters. They are not currently believed {{to be sensitive to}} infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490-550nm. Rows 5–6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision. They can detect different planes of polarised light. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye.|$|E
500|$|Diamond {{has a wide}} bandgap of [...] {{corresponding}} to the <b>deep</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> wavelength of 225 nanometers. This means that pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear as a clear colorless crystal. Colors in diamond originate from lattice defects and impurities. The diamond crystal lattice is exceptionally strong, and only atoms of nitrogen, boron and hydrogen can be introduced into diamond during the growth at significant concentrations (up to atomic percents). Transition metals nickel and cobalt, which are commonly used for growth of synthetic diamond by high-pressure high-temperature techniques, have been detected in diamond as individual atoms; the maximum concentration is 0.01% for nickel and even less for cobalt. Virtually any element can be introduced to diamond by ion implantation.|$|E

We also present new 90 cm VLA {{images of the}} NML. The radio morphology at this wavelength is indicative of a more complex system than either a straightforward flaring jet (Morganti et al. 1999) or a bubble with trailing stem (Saxton et al. 2001).

40|$|A {{scheme is}} {{analyzed}} for effcient generation of vacuum ultraviolet radiation through four-wave mixing processes assisted by {{the technique of}} Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passage. These opportunities are associated with pulse excitation of laddertype short-wavelength two-photon atomic or molecular transitions so that relaxation processes can be neglected. In this three-laser technique, a delayed-pulse of strong oR-resonant infrared radiation sweeps the laser-induced Stark-shift of a two-photon transition in a such way that facilitates robust maximum two-photon coherence induced by the first ultraviolet laser. A judiciously delayed third pulse scatters at this coherence and generates short-wavelength radiation. A theoretical analysis of these problems based on the density matrix is performed. A numerical model is developed to carry out simulations of a typical experiment. The results illustrate a behavior of populations, coherence and generated radiation along the medium as well as opportunities of effcient generation of <b>deep</b> (vacuum) <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation.

Thus, light-emitting diodes emitting from infrared to <b>deep</b> into <b>ultraviolet</b> can be fabricated using ternary III-nitrides InGaN, AlGaN, and AlInN with appropriate composition. However, growing the compounds with any desirable composition often encounters substantial difficulties due to phase separation, structural quality of the epilayers, impurities and extended defects, etc. The spatial inhomogeneity of emission properties in III-nitride epilayers and quantum well structures provides an informative insight into carrier migration, localization, and recombination and is important for development of light-emitting devices. In this paper, we introduce the techniques for luminescence study with spatial resolution (microphotoluminescence, confocal microscopy, scanning near field optical microscopy and cathodoluminescence), discuss material properties leading to emission inhomogeneity and review results on spatial distribution of photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence in InGaN and AlGaN, which {{are the most important}} ternary III-nitride compounds for application in light-emitting devices.
