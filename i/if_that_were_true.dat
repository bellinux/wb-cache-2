2500|$|Modern-era {{music was}} written for the gallichon by [...] Ruggero Chiesa (1933-1993). Other composers {{included}} the German Schiffelholtz and the Italian Brescianello. Chiesa also called the instrument the colascione. Gottfried Finger suggested that it was used in Boheman musical circles. Francis William Galpin thought that the earliest versions of the colascione were initially called the Guitarra morisca. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> {{it would take the}} history of the instrument back into the 13th Century, when it was illustrated as a smaller instrument in the Cantigas de Santa Maria.|$|E
2500|$|Bibby {{details the}} {{construction}} of the wall and deduces that [...] "the wall was built of a coral like conglomerate called farush," [...] which to Bibby [...] "felt wrong because of the fluctuating level of sea water." [...] He stated; [...] "If anywhere there was a subkha today there should have been water even as recently as 2000 years ago. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> then this wall (at Uqair) could not be as old as the wall at Thaj." [...] (Bibby, p.324). [...] (The walls of Thaj, another ruined city near Qatif, were built during the same period as Gerrha - the Greek period.) [...] But as Bibby concludes ... "in the cities of the Greek period on Bahrain and the temple of towns of the Seleucid on Failaka (an island off the coast of Kuwait once thought to be a Hellenistic foundry of coins) farush was never used. [...] The walls there were made of quarried limestone." [...] (Bibby, p.324.) ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the idea}} that newly {{isolated}} human genes of unknown function could prove useful for drug development was widely criticized. Haseltine's experience with HIV taught him that knowledge of the genome without prior knowledge of function was useful and had led {{to the discovery of}} new and useful drug targets and new and effective drugs. Haseltine argued that if one new human gene were discovered, the techniques of modern biology would allow its natural function and potential medical use identified. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> for one gene, then why not all the human genes? New tools had been developed that allowed what had been tedious hard work of gene isolation and characterization to be replaced by highly automated instruments and the data regarding the structure, tissue and cell location and the results of functional tests to be stored and easily accessed using advanced computer technologies. He summarized these views [...] with the statement [...] "Genomics is not necessarily Genetics". It was not until the Human Genome Science approach was validated by its own work and [...] the work of its partners that it was ultimately adopted by the scientific community. Today, the approach pioneered by Human Genome Sciences is one of the principal tools used today for the discovery and characterization of novel human genes and as well as the genes of other species.|$|E

2500|$|The Nova {{documentary}} The Case of the Ancient Astronauts {{shows that}} all of the claims made by von Däniken about the Pyramid of Cheops were wrong. The technique of construction is well understood, the tools the Egyptians used are known, marks left in the quarries by those tools are still visible, and many examples of the tools are preserved in museums. Von Däniken claims that it would have taken the Egyptians too long to cut all the blocks necessary and drag them to the construction site in time to build the Great Pyramid in only 20 years; but the documentary demonstrates how quickly a block of stone can be cut with the available tools, and presents examples of the rollers used in their transportation. Von Däniken also claims that Egyptians built perfect pyramids from the beginning, but numerous pyramid precursors survive, showing the errors made, and corrected, by Egyptian architects while they were perfecting the technique. [...] These include simple mastabas, the Step Pyramid of Djoser, and the so-called Bent Pyramid. [...] Von Däniken claims that the height of the Cheops pyramid multiplied by one million is the distance to the Sun; <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> the pyramid would be 150km (93 miles) high. [...] He also claims that the Egyptians could not align the edges so perfectly to true North without advanced technology that only aliens could give them; but Egyptian builders knew of simple methods to find North via star observation, and it is trivial to make straight edges.|$|E
2500|$|At Elimination Chamber, Nikki Bella and Natalya had a {{backstage}} confrontation {{that lead}} to Natalya shoving Nikki into Maryse. Later that night, The Miz attempted to eliminate John Cena from the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match only for Miz to get eliminated by Cena. On the February 21 episode of SmackDown, Nikki and Natalya's Falls Count Anywhere match led to the backstage area, where Natalya again shoved Nikki into Maryse, who retaliated by attacking Nikki with a lead pipe, thus costing her the match. In that episode's main event, the same incident between Cena and Miz happened in the WWE Championship number one contender's battle royal, but this time, Miz returned and caused Cena's elimination. Cena was then the guest on Miz TV where Miz criticized Cena for being a hypocrite, as Cena was basically {{doing the same thing}} that he himself had criticized The Rock for doing: leaving the WWE and going to Hollywood. Miz said that he works as hard as Cena, but does not get the same opportunities, and he eliminated Cena to prevent him from going to WrestleMania 33 and wanted Cena to know what he felt when Cena defeated him for the WWE Championship back in 2011. Miz also said that Cena gets what he wants, but Cena said <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> he would be facing The Undertaker. Cena then criticized Miz for copying other people's gimmicks and moves, which caused Maryse to slap Cena for insulting her husband. Nikki then came out and Maryse and Miz retreated. The following week, The Miz and Maryse attacked Cena and Nikki after the latter two's match against James Ellsworth and Carmella. The Miz said he was tired of Cena's lies and said his relationship with Nikki was also a lie. Afterwards on Talking Smack, The Miz and Maryse said that Nikki was in her current position because of her relationship with Cena and that Nikki was jealous of them because Cena would not marry Nikki. The following week, Miz and Maryse continued their insults against Cena and Nikki and the two came out and chased Miz and Maryse out of the ring. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then came out and said that since he could not fight The Miz, who had been insulting him for several months, both The Miz and Maryse would face Cena and Nikki at WrestleMania; Maryse's last match was in 2011. The Miz and Maryse then made fun of Cena and Nikki's reality show Total Bellas by impersonating them in [...] "unaired footage". On March 27, Cena was a guest host on NBC's Today and revealed weatherman Al Roker as the guest ring announcer for the match. On the final SmackDown before WrestleMania, more [...] "unaired footage" [...] from Total Bellas was shown. The Miz and Maryse then threw more insults at Cena and Nikki, including Cena not wanting to have kids. Cena retaliated and asked how many kids Miz and Maryse had. Cena said that although he takes time off to make movies, he comes back to WWE when he is done, just as The Miz and other WWE Superstars have done before. Cena called Maryse a waste of a paycheck as she does not do much on the show and that she was only back in the WWE because Miz begged for it. Cena then said that he and Nikki would destroy Miz and Maryse at WrestleMania.|$|E
60|$|The {{incident}} gave me considerable {{food for}} speculation, since if I were {{right in the}} conclusion induced by the cursory glimpse I had had of the spy, then Matai Shang and Thurid must suspect my identity, and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> not even the service I had rendered Kulan Tith could save me from his religious fanaticism.|$|E

6000|$|... "Even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> their {{testimony}} would lack the convincing power that flames from Morselli's book or Bottazzi's report. The essential {{weakness of the}} spiritist's testimony {{lies in the fact}} that for the most part he assumes that the facts of mediumship are somehow, and necessarily, in opposition to somebody's religion. He finds it sustained (or opposed) by the Bible, or he fancies it mixed with deviltry or the black art. He trembles for fear it will affect the scheme of redemption or assist some theosophical system. Whereas, a man like Bottazzi is engaged merely with the facts; he lets the inferences fall where they may. He is not concerned with whether Eusapia's manifestations oppose Christian theology or not; he wants the phenomena. He is alert to note their effect on biologic science, but he does not shrink from any report of them. So far as I am concerned, my lot is cast with these men who put the clamps on the fact and wait for larger knowledge before constructing a system of religion on the half-discovered." ...|$|E
60|$|His spirit jumped {{almost out}} of him with contempt, when he thought {{that for the first}} time in his life, he had fled in abject terror from the face of man! He could not conceal that from himself, despite the excuse {{suggested}} by pride--that he had half believed Zeppa to be an apparition. What even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true?</b> Had he not boastfully said more than once that he would defy the foul fiend himself if he should attempt to thwart him? Then his spirit bounded into a region of disappointed rage when he thought of the lost opportunity of stabbing his enemy to the heart. After that, unbidden, and in spite of him, it dropped into an abyss of something like fierce despair when he recalled the past surveyed the present, and forecast the future. Truly, if hell ever does begin to men on earth, it began that day to the pirate, as he sat in the twilight on the gnarled root, with one of his feet dangling in the slimy water, his hands clasped so tight that the knuckles stood out white, and his eyes gazing upwards with an expression that seemed the very embodiment of woe.|$|E
60|$|Now my {{old friend}} proceeded, and said: But when Christiana {{came up to the}} Slough of Despond, she began to be at a stand; for, said she, this is the place in which my dear husband had like to have been smothered with mud. She perceived, also, that {{notwithstanding}} the command of the King to make this place for pilgrims good, yet it was rather worse than formerly. So I asked <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true.</b> Yes, said the old gentleman, too true; for that many there be that pretend to be the King's labourers, and that say they are for mending the King's highway, that bring dirt and dung instead of stones, and so mar instead of mending.[42] Here Christiana, therefore, with her boys, did make a stand; but, said Mercy, Come, let us venture, only let us be wary. Then they looked well to the steps, and made a shift to get staggeringly over.[43] Yet, Christiana had like to have been in, and that not once nor twice. Now they had no sooner got over, but they thought they heard words that said unto them, 'Blessed is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord' (Luke 1:45).|$|E

60|$|It {{is just as}} easy to argue, on Mr. Pollock's other line, that Prance {{varied from}} Bedloe in order that the {{inconsistencies}} might prove his own falsehood. But {{we have no reason}} to suppose that Prance did know the details of Bedloe's confession, as to the motive of the murder, the hour, the exact spot, and the names of the criminals. Later he told L'Estrange a palpable lie: Bedloe's confession had been shown to him before he made his own. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> he purposely contradicted Bedloe in detail. But Mr. Pollock rejects the myth. Then how did Prance know the details given by Bedloe?* Ignorant of Bedloe's version, except in two or three points, Prance could not but contradict it. He thus could not accuse Bedloe's Jesuits. He did not name other men, as Mr. Pollock holds, to shield the Jesuits. Practically they did not need to be shielded. Jesuits with seven weeks' start of the law were safe enough. Even if they were caught, were guilty, and had the truth extracted from them, involving Prance, the truth about HIM would come out, whether he now denounced them or not. But he did not know that Bedloe had denounced them.|$|E
60|$|That the constables {{had been}} guilty of gross exaggeration was shown by their {{evidence}} as to the desperate injuries the combatants had inflicted upon one another. Of Paradise in particular it had been alleged that his features were obliterated. The jury had before them in the dock the man whose features had been obliterated {{only a few weeks}} previously. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> where had the prisoner obtained the unblemished lineaments which he was now, full of health and good-humor, presenting to them? (Renewed laughter. Paradise grinning in confusion.) It was said that these terrible injuries, the traces of which had disappeared so miraculously, were inflicted by the prisoner Byron, a young gentleman tenderly nurtured, and visibly inferior in strength and hardihood to his herculean opponent. Doubtless Byron had been emboldened by his skill in mimic combat to try conclusions, under the very different conditions of real fighting, with a man whose massive shoulders and determined cast of features ought to have convinced him that such an enterprise was nothing short of desperate. Fortunately the police had interfered before he had suffered severely for his rashness. Yet it had been alleged that he had actually worsted Paradise in the encounter--obliterated his features. That was a fair sample of the police evidence, which was throughout consistently incredible and at variance with the dictates of common-sense.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked down}} to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally {{returning}} to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.|$|E
