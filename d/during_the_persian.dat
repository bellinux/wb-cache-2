Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E

5|$|Greek {{influence}}, {{which had}} {{made its way}} to Phoenicia <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen. This spreading Hellenization interacted with the local Semitic population substratum, which remained faithful to its gods and its language. It resulted in an artistic and architectural symbiosis best illustrated in the artifacts of Umm el 'Amed and Bustan esh Sheikh.|$|E

5|$|Aramaic {{became the}} common {{language}} in the north, in Galilee and Samaria.

Alexander conquered Judah in 332BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic (Greek) domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmonean dynasty, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led {{to the destruction of}} the Second Temple in 70CE, and the second Bar Kokhba revolt in 132–135 led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea.|$|E

5|$|The first Persian {{invasion}} of Greece, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Wars, began in 492 BC, {{and ended with}} the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The invasion, consisting of two distinct campaigns, was ordered by the Persian king Darius I primarily in order to punish the city-states of Athens and Eretria. These cities had supported the cities of Ionia during their revolt against Persian rule, thus incurring the wrath of Darius. Darius also saw the opportunity to extend his empire into Europe, and to secure its western frontier.|$|E

5|$|On the Byzantine side, Emperor Michael III had {{assembled}} his army {{to counter the}} Arab raid, and met them at a battle in an area called Marj al-Usquf ("Bishop's Meadow") by Arab sources, a highland near Malakopeia, north of Nazianzus. The battle was bloody with many casualties on both sides; according to the Persian historian al-Tabari, only a thousand of Umar's army survived. Nevertheless, the Arabs managed to escape the Byzantines and continue their raid north into the Armeniac Theme, eventually reaching the Black Sea and sacking {{the port city of}} Amisos. The Byzantine historians report that Umar, enraged at the sea blocking his advance, ordered it to be lashed, but this is most likely inspired by the similar account of Xerxes <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Wars.|$|E
5|$|Gaza is also {{mentioned}} in the Hebrew Bible as the place where Samson was imprisoned and met his death. The prophets Amos and Zephaniah {{are believed to have}} prophesied that Gaza would be deserted. According to biblical accounts, Gaza fell to Israelite rule, from the reign of King David in the early 11th century BCE. When the United Monarchy split in about 930 BCE, Gaza became a part of the northern Kingdom of Israel. When the Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II around 730 BCE, Gaza came under Assyrian rule. In the 7th century, it again came under Egyptian control, but <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> period (6th-4th centuries BCE) it enjoyed a certain independence and flourished. In 529 BCE, Cambyses I unsuccessfully attacked Gaza and later, around 520 BCE, the Greeks established a trading post in Gaza. The first coins were minted on the Athens model around 380 BCE.|$|E
