5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, {{although it is not}} possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E

In 1955 an organization called Friends of Boscobel saved it at the last minute from a contractor who had bid $35 to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> down after the Veterans' Administration had built a hospital on the site. They arranged for it to be moved to a similar location upriver, near Cold Spring, a year later, using photographs from the Historic American Buildings Survey to guide the reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots defense {{continued}} {{to dominate the}} Colts in the second quarter. On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Law intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it six yards to the 41-yard line. The Patriots then drove 52 yards and increased their lead to 13–0 with a second Vinatieri field goal. Brady completed three passes for 42 yards on the drive, including a 17-yarder to Givens and a 16-yard completion to Troy Brown on fourth down and 8. For {{the first time in}} the entire postseason, the Colts were forced to punt on their next drive. Apparently, they were very out of practice, because the snap from center Justin Snow sailed over the head of punter Hunter Smith. The ball went into the end zone, and Smith was forced to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> out of bounds for a safety, making the score 15–0.|$|E
500|$|Leaf related poorly to {{both the}} media and his teammates, whom he tended to blame for his poor play. In a locker-room {{incident}} during Leaf's rookie year, he was caught on camera screaming [...] "Don't talk to me, alright? <b>KNOCK</b> <b>IT</b> OFF!" [...] to San Diego Union Tribune reporter Jay Posner, and was physically restrained by Junior Seau. He soon developed a reputation for a poor work ethic {{to the point of}} occasionally being found on the golf course while the other quarterbacks were studying film. After Leaf's rookie season ended, Charger safety Rodney Harrison described it as [...] "a nightmare you can't even imagine," [...] adding: [...] "If I had to go through another year like that, I'd probably quit playing." ...|$|E

To play duck on a rock most effectively, Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought that later proved essential for the invention of basketball. Orphaned early in his life, Naismith lived with his aunt and uncle for many years and attended grade school at Bennies Corners near Almonte. Then he enrolled in Almonte High School, in Almonte, Ontario, from which he graduated in 1883.|$|E

[...] "The final scenes do a very nice job of closing the high school chapter of the Veronica Mars story, while also leaving plenty {{of questions about the}} future of some characters in particular." [...] Goldman also lauded the performances of Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni, writing that [...] "As always, Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> out of the park, with Bell especially having to go through a rather stunning amount of emotional transitions, all of which she does spectacularly." ...|$|E
500|$|Tigers {{are thought}} to be mainly nocturnal predators, but in areas where humans are {{typically}} absent, they have been observed via remote-controlled, hidden cameras, hunting in daylight. They generally hunt alone and ambush their prey as most other cats do, overpowering them from any angle, using their body size and strength to knock the prey off balance. Successful hunts usually require the tiger to almost simultaneously leap onto its quarry, <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> over, and grab the throat or nape with its teeth. Despite their large size, tigers can reach speeds of about [...] but only in short bursts; consequently, tigers must be close to their prey before they break cover. If the prey catches wind of the tiger's presence before this, the tiger usually abandons the hunt rather than chase prey or battle it head-on. Horizontal leaps of up to [...] have been reported, although leaps of around half this distance are more typical. One in 2 to 20 hunts, including stalking near potential prey, ends in a successful kill.|$|E

500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E
500|$|The central ground {{assault was}} to be {{conducted}} by the 1st Panzer Division {{and supported by the}} Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland and the Sturmpionier-Battalion 43 (43rd Assault Engineer Battalion) as the 1st Panzer only had a single rifle regiment. The Großdeutschland would be attached to the 1st Panzer Division {{for the remainder of the}} campaign and it was the first unit to breach the defences on Hill 247, the high ground dominating Gaulier. The regiment, much to their surprise, discovered the Luftwaffe had failed to destroy the enemy bunkers. Enemy small arms fire ensured that crossing the river at Pont Neuf bridge could not be done in rubber assault boats as intended. The Regiment retreated. Reconnaissance found an enemy Bunker, No. 211, was still active. Its location guarded the bridgehead, making it dangerous for German infantry attempting a crossing. A platoon of infantry guns (75mm short barrel artillery) failed to <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> out. An 8.8cm FlaK dual purpose gun (88mm) was brought in to do the job. It succeeded, but the following crossing failed as machine gun fire came from another flanking position that had not been spotted. Once this was dealt with by the 2nd Battalion, the remainder of the regiment crossed the river. Throughout the rest of the day, the regiment moved up and into the French defences, the 2nd Battalion's 6th, 7th and 8th Companies gradually knocking out each bunker. Despite the other two battalions being held up further south, by 20:00 the central Hill 247 had been taken. The Großdeutschland Regiment had now penetrated [...] into the French defences.|$|E

2500|$|The breed has {{a natural}} {{guardian}} instinct {{and ability to}} guard livestock. An athletic dog, the Komondor is fast and powerful and will leap at a predator to drive it off or <b>knock</b> <b>it</b> down. It can be used successfully to guard sheep against wolves or bears.

2500|$|Stern entered {{national}} syndication when Infinity's WYSP in Philadelphia first simulcast {{his show}} on August 18, 1986. James McKinney, {{chief of the}} FCC's Mass Media Bureau, reported that more Philadelphia listeners complained about Stern {{in the first three}} months on WYSP than those in New York had in three years. McKinney opened an investigation on November 14, 1986 after WYSP was among three stations cited for material considered indecent. Infinity was given 30 days to respond to three singled-out complaints that believed Stern had violated Section 1464 of the United States Code, as well as Philadelphia's community standards. Two of them were forwarded on September 26 and November 6 by Donald Wildmon, a United Methodist minister and director of the National Federation for Decency. The third was filed on October 27 by Mary Keeley, a mother of a 15-year-old Stern fan, who was directed to the FCC by Morality in Media. In one cited excerpt, Stern asked a caller if they ever had sex with an animal, and replied with [...] "Well, don't <b>knock</b> <b>it.</b> I was sodomized by Lamb Chop, you know that puppet Shari Lewis holds?"
