25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
500|$|Independent of the LM, the LCL {{had begun}} to change. It {{eventually}} supported Don Dunstan's bills for electoral reform, both to the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised, particular {{with the arrival of}} Tonkin, its first urban leader. The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart. Thus, many {{of the reasons for the}} LM's split had become null. Combined with the LM's declining membership (one third of members had not renewed) and its large debt, it found itself in a precarious position. Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party, and news of the secret talks were leaked in April. Once the news became public, Millhouse stated his complete opposition: [...] "I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and I do not see any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view." [...] He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self-respect, and described the LM as the only [...] "genuine Liberal party" [...] in the nation, boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society. Millhouse's stand was widely condemned by the media, who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism, and unhelpful for anti-Labor politics. Hall, however, wanted to unite the non-Labor forces, and acknowledged that [...] "there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups... in simple terms, our alternatives are to swallow some little pride, and unite to fight Labor." [...] He said to do otherwise would be to [...] "exist in splendid selfish isolation", and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote. Hall said the LM's reform agenda had been fulfilled, their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split. This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse, who continued to describe the Liberals as [...] "very conservative". Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger, owing to the long-standing antipathy between the two groups, and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years.|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, the {{president}} of Pride FC made a public apology to Mezger at the Tokyo Dome for the miscommunication. Braverman added, [...] "We had a big meeting (with PRIDE). We {{were able to get}} some concessions out of them, money and guarantees of future fights. They wanted to make it right. One thing <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meeting was, [...] "Do you want me to call Kenny back in here and see what he says?" [...] "No, no, no, no!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "For what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to-day <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gardens. Oh, why, why did I {{say such}} dreadful things! Oh, I am so--so sorry--I am so sorry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 780. Or have <b>I</b> <b>said</b> enow? <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{edition of}} Comus {{published}} in 1645 this passage reads, Or have <b>I</b> <b>said</b> enough? <b>In</b> <b>the</b> edition of 1673, the latest that he revised, Milton changed enough to enow. Grammatically, enough {{is the better}} form, as the Elizabethan usage favored enough {{for the form of}} the adjective with singular nouns and for the adverb, and enow as the adjective with plurals. It would seem that the poet must have had some motive of euphony for the change he made.|$|R
2500|$|According to Norris, he {{was only}} read two {{paragraphs}} of the interview before publication, and he asked for corrections {{to be made to}} those paragraphs, and these corrections were not made. In a May 2011 statement on his Presidential campaign website, Norris affirmed [...] "I did not ever and would not approve of the finished article as it appeared". Norris asserts that he and Burke engaged in an [...] "academic discussion about Classical Greece and sexual activity in a historical context; it was a hypothetical, intellectual conversation" [...] and that the [...] "presentation of references to sexuality in the article attributed to me were misleading in that they do not convey the context in which they were made". Norris also spoke about the Magill profile in an interview with Joe Jackson for the Sunday Independent, in which he refutes the allegations, saying he responded in [...] "horror", and that “it so completely misrepresents everything <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> interview I said I cannot understand how anyone would consider it appropriate to have sex with children".|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Frazier's {{testimony}} [...] adds, [...] "Just as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of Mr. Curly, {{my initial}} feeling was, when I {{first heard about}} this, that the facts had not been established and we needed to be careful {{to make sure we}} understood the facts. As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was said in the presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bill," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next clinch, so low only {{he could}} hear. [...] "Bill, {{remember}} the La Blanche swing. Give it to me, hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{speaking}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> natural {{tones of}} that good-for-naught Gaston de Luynes, [...] "I have already decided, {{and you have}} my permission to accompany your father." ...|$|R
60|$|Every {{plant is}} divided, as <b>I</b> just <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main, into two parts, and these have {{opposite}} natures. One part seeks the light; the other hates it. One part feeds on the air; {{the other on}} the dust.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>said</b> early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day to Mrs. Sanderson {{that the}} weather had become so {{threatening}} that I would very much prefer taking the children home, she silenced me by reminding me that Mariposilla was visiting with the full consent of the Doña Maria.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to {{apologize}} for what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden," [...] I resumed. [...] "I spoke thoughtlessly, Lucilla. It is impossible that I could intentionally offend you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have passed}} our word {{that we have}} no firearms," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most dignified manner that I could command, [...] "and that should be enough for you, O Komba." ...|$|E
6000|$|I fancied it was {{possible}} to read in his face the thought which he had in mind, and my cheeks were flaming red as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tone of one who admits his error: ...|$|E
60|$|Such was the {{application}} {{that had come}} to me this morning,--only, instead of by note, it came, as <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> person of the applicant, a thin, delicate, consumptive-looking being, wearing that rusty mourning which speaks sadly at once of heart bereavement and material poverty.|$|R
6000|$|... 2. No {{dead bodies}} lay unburied or uncovered; {{and if any}} one walked {{from one end of}} the city to another, no funeral, or sign of it, was to be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daytime, except a little, as <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first three weeks in September.|$|R
60|$|The soldiers, <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dim light. Gavin {{had almost}} reached them, when a little hand touched his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-morning," [...] said Mrs. Lecount, {{opening the}} door. [...] "One last word, Miss Garth. Do {{think of what}} <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back room! Do try the Golden Ointment for that sad affliction in your eyes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [16] For which reason, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Appendix to {{the third}} volume, [...] that the {{expression}} [...] "finite realization of infinity" [...] was a [...] considerably less rational one than [...] "black realization of white." ...|$|E
60|$|And this {{relation}} to the higher arts we will study at the source of chief power in all the normal skill of Christendom, Florence; and chiefly, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work of one Florentine master, Sandro Botticelli.|$|E
6000|$|... "William, {{how dare}} you," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same moment I saw that this father {{might be useful}} to me. [...] "How does your baby sleep, William?" [...] I asked in a low voice, [...] "how does she wake up? what do you put in her bath?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Hamzah responded: [...] "It’s {{not true}} that I protect them and I don’t regret what <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past [...] - [...] {{it relates to the}} past. But now if there is a {{connection}} we want to know whether it is true that Indonesia has a terrorist network." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be honest {{enough to}} own it, {{and that what}} <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town was true, though your fancy-man was so up about it--hey, my sly one? You ought to beg my pardon for that blow of his, considering." ...|$|E
60|$|Sin, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of}} it, is horrible, though it be but one single sin as to act; yea, though it be but a sinful thought; and so worthily {{calls for the}} damnation of the soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{language}} of Ahm, and I {{stepped out into}} the firelight before them. Lys gave a little cry of joy and started toward me, but Tsa grasped her arm and dragged her back.|$|E

5000|$|Mohammed later apologized in an {{interview}} for referring to Jews as pigs, and said that his reference to jihad was misunderstood. [...] In September 2012, speaking of his record controversial statements, Mohammad said: [...] "So, not that I retract what <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, but <b>I</b> now am wiser than I was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here was an {{opportunity}} of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when he made that random shot. [...] "May I ask, my lad," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blandest voice, [...] "what your trade may be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Wanhope {{had that}} distant {{look in his}} eyes which warned his familiars of a {{possible}} excursion, and <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of keeping him from it, [...] "Then isn't there a turn of phrase somewhat analogous to that in a personification?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Dingaan," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{midst of}} the intense silence that followed, [...] "it seems that it is I who have won the bet, not you. I killed this king of birds, but being a king it chose to die high up and alone, that is all." ...|$|E

6000|$|...
