[...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law.

5000|$|One of Gates's lawyers, Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr, {{a former}} {{professor}} of Obama, stated that [...] "I {{think the president}} has taken the right approach by trying to make sure we move forward ... He's always had the ability to negotiate difficult conversations, and his steps today are an important step in the right direction. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> given his assessment, which makes a lot of sense, and, however you feel about it, it has reduced the temperature and allowed everyone to move forward in a constructive way." [...] Ogletree has since written a book about the case. Steve Killion, president of the Cambridge patrol officers association, also stated [...] "I'm absolutely pleased with call. I {{think it was a good}} thing for the president to do. .... We all want to see this behind us." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{chairman}} of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (which is tasked with investigating [...] "waste, fraud, and abuse" [...] in the executive branch), Chaffetz {{has been criticized for}} showing a disinterest in investigating President Trump's conflicts of interest and for failing to criticize him for not resolving ethical questions. Chaffetz has said that Trump's global financial ties don’t merit a congressional investigation: [...] "It’s interesting, because under Section 208 of the criminal code, the president is exempt from almost every conflict-of-interest law... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> a duty and an obligation {{to live up to the}} Constitution and the law. And what he’s required to do by law, it appears he’s done." [...] However, ethics experts have said that Trump's business conflicts and his failure to resolve them are [...] "nakedly unconstitutional." [...] Chaffetz also declined to investigate the circumstances surrounding the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who stepped down amid controversy over his communications with the Russian government before Trump took office. Chaffetz said that [...] "it's taking care of itself" [...] and that any investigation into Flynn was for the House Intelligence Committee to conduct; Chaffetz also asked the Justice Department inspector general to investigate the leaks that brought Flynn's contracts with Russian officials to public light.|$|E

Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of them as were not captured, were cut off from town, either designedly on their part or because they could not help it. Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corps is above them. Miles's division, 2d corps, was sent from the White Oak Road to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he met them, and at last accounts was engaged with them. Not knowing whether Sheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was sent with another division from here. The whole captures since the army started out gunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery.

60|$|Not so Leghorn (made illustrious by SMOLLETT'S grave), {{which is}} a thriving, business-like, matter-of-fact place, where idleness is {{shouldered}} {{out of the way}} by commerce. The regulations observed there, in reference to trade and merchants, are very liberal and free; and the town, of course, benefits by them. Leghorn had a bad name in connection with stabbers, and with some justice it must be allowed; for, not many years ago, there was an assassination club there, the members of which bore no ill-will to anybody in particular, but stabbed people (quite strangers to them) in the streets at night, for the pleasure and excitement of <b>the</b> recreation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of this amiable society was a shoemaker. He was taken, however, and the club was broken up. It would, probably, have disappeared in the natural course of events, before the railroad between Leghorn and Pisa, {{which is a}} good one, and has already begun to astonish Italy with a precedent of punctuality, order, plain dealing, and improvement--the most dangerous and heretical astonisher of all. There must have been a slight sensation, as of earthquake, surely, in the Vatican, when the first Italian railroad was thrown open.|$|R

[...] At first, Brown disputed the factual basis of Davis' statement, claiming that the performance was ended because Brown [...] "was over [...] time by a few minutes."

40|$|Genre {{analysis}} mainly {{focuses on}} the description of language use in the different professional and institutional domains (Bhatia 2004). Due to the ongoing processes of internationalisation and globalisation genre boundaries are becoming less clear-cut (Candlin and Gotti 2004; Cortese and Duszak 2005), resulting in textual realization hybridity (Poppi 2007). Institutional communication genres have been experiencing in-depth transformation {{in the last few}} decades, mainly due to evolutions in the media market, fuelled by technological developments and by globalisation (Blumler and Kavanagh 1999). Since text is nothing but phraseology {{of one kind or another}} (Sinclair 2008), our aim is to uncover recurrent phrases in the White House Press Briefings to look at their diachronic variation and at the variables determining it. In other words, our main objective is to analyse how the discourse preferences constructing the podiums and the press in their way of projecting the referenced context and their subjectivity vary across 18 years. The data come from a corpus including all the Press briefings from January 1993 to May 2011. The addition of XML mark-up, including information about individual speakers and their role, allows us to compare different discourse strategies adopted by the participants at different points in time. This leads us to determine the extent of the differences in the patterns found as well as the nature of the variation. The analysis of keywords and key-clusters helps to identify the “aboutness” and the style in each presidency (Scott & Tribble 2006), and allows the access to the identification of “pointers to the typical structure of discourse” (Bondi 2010 : 10) highlighting static strategic communicative clusters, organizational phrases dynamic markers of authorial stance and content clusters. The analysis relies on two pieces of software: Wordsmith Tools (Scott 2007) to retrieve key clusters and Xaira to study their distribution across the years. Our findings show a more prominent interactive presence of the podium as an individual in Clinton’s first term than in the following years. The dominant key clusters include mental and cognitive verb phrases (e. g. I don’t believe; <b>I</b> <b>think)</b> expressing a hedging function that is less prominent in Bush’s briefings, where the podium seems to perform only the ‘mediator’ role. In Obama a higher involvement of the speaker is confirmed by <b>the</b> key cluster <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> not merely used to project an idea but rather to mitigate his assertions. The analysis further demonstrates that a speaker’s power of persuasion is greatly determined by an ability to shift in and out of various roles within and across ‘discourse spaces’. Thus, the exploitation of specific discourse strategies by political actors goes hand in hand with their political strategies. These are realized through the repetition of specific patterns and subtly conveyed meanings. Although the context plays its role (attenuation and boosting depend on the importance and delicacy of the topics at issue) the main strategy of communication has got pragmatic reasons. The different shades of the meanings of the mental verbs confirm that the genre of conversation is one of the main components of this institutional genre together with their hedging function typical of political discourse and in particular of political interview...|$|R

Well, many things have happened since I sat here before, and now that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> reference to <b>the</b> debts which were left by the bankrupt firm of Charles L. Webster & Co. gives me an opportunity to say a word which I very much wish to say, not for myself, but for ninety-five men and women whom I shall always hold in high esteem and in pleasant remembrance--the creditors of that firm. They treated me well; they treated me handsomely. There were ninety-six of them, and by not a finger's weight did ninety-five of them add to the burden of that time for me. Ninety-five out of the ninety-six--they didn't indicate by any word or sign that they were anxious about their money. They treated me well, and I shall not forget it; I could not forget it if I wanted to. Many of them said, [...] "Don't you worry, don't you hurry"; that's what they said. Why, if I could have that kind of creditors always, and that experience, I would recognize it as a personal loss to be out of debt. I owe those ninety-five creditors a debt of homage, and I pay it now in such measure as one may pay so fine a debt in mere words. Yes, they said that very thing. I was not personally acquainted with ten of them, and yet they said, [...] "Don't you worry, and don't you hurry." [...] I know that phrase by heart, and if all the other music should perish out of the world it would still sing to me. I appreciate that; I am glad to say this word; people say so much about me, and they forget those creditors. They were handsomer than I was--or Tom Reed.|$|R
