Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state. One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration.

40|$|Abstract Ceramic <b>engobe</b> is an {{intermediate}} layer between the substrate and the glaze of a ceramic tile. It is basically composed by plastic material, clays, and non-plastic material, feldspar and frit. Light-colored clays with good plasticity and low-fire temperature {{are used in}} ceramic <b>engobe</b> formulations, typically ball clays. However, these clays contain different accessory minerals, which can adversely affect the opacity and the whiteness. The use of washed kaolin, with a lower content of accessory minerals, tends to lead to higher opacity and whiteness. In addition, its mechanical activation can increase the plasticity, allowing its use {{as a replacement for}} ball clay. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the use of mechanically-activated kaolin to replace ball clay in an <b>engobe</b> employed in the production of ceramic tiles. Samples of kaolin were activated by high energy mill (1 and 4 h, at 500 rpm) and characterized by surface area and particle size measurements, crystallography, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Cylindrical specimens of four ceramic <b>engobe</b> formulations were submitted to splitting tensile strength and bulk density tests. The specimens were fired in a laboratory kiln and characterized through the determination of water absorption, bulk density, relative density and by reflectance spectrophotometry. Crystallographic analysis with Rietveld refinement and microstructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy were also carried out. After the high energy milling, the kaolin had less crystallinity and the specific surface area increased from 4. 6 to 46. 1 m 2 /g. The use of mechanically-activated kaolin as a replacement for ball clay in a ceramic <b>engobe</b> increased the mechanical strength, crystalline phase content and whiteness...|$|R

In this thesis a commercial roof tile, which was taken from a company, was used. For good fitting between the engobe and the roof tile their coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) should be almost the same. One way of adjusting the CTE values, the chemical analysis of the roof tile was analyzed and based on these different engobe recipes with high purity raw materials and frit that was made in the laboratory with high purity raw material were prepared. The roof tiles were rich in SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, (Na+K) 2 O. Therefore, by changing the percentage of these oxides new engobe recipes were prepared to find the most suitable composition for roof tiles. After application on surfaces of roof tiles, the samples were fired at 1000 oC for 75 min. 70 % SiO 2, 20 % Al 2 O 3, 10 % (Na+K) 2 O with 10 % laboratory frit and 70 % SiO 2, 20 % Al 2 O 3, 10 % (Na+K) 2 O with 30 % laboratory frit were found to be two of the most proper engobe compositions for the roof tile. Later these engobe recipes were prepared with lower purity industrial grade raw materials and industrial frit because the cost of producing frit is high for a roof tile manufacturer. The low purity <b>engobes</b> were applied successfully on the surface. However, lower purity raw materials containing little Fe and Ti led to a slightly darker color compared to higher purity <b>engobes.</b> The life cycle of the products were tested with different kinds of acids and temperature tests. And the results showed that the engobe samples were durable against the environmental effects.

They belong to the period between the end of themid- 7 th century andthe first half of the 4 th century BC, and were excavated from the Toppicelli archaeological district near the suburbs of Canosa (Puglia, Italy). Forty-eight pottery fragments were available for this study.

40|$|Water is, of course, a {{universal}} substance, and indeed, {{has been the}} subject of artistic depiction from time immemorial. Thus, it has been typically depicted two dimensionally in an impressionistic format, as for example waves shown in either geometric or organic design. E. g., certain of the prehistoric painted vases from Susa employed the geometric chevron wave pattern; organic wave patterns appeared in Hokusai's famous wood-block print, "Mt. Fuji Seen Below a Wave at Kanagawa". My work attempts to challenge the two dimensional limitation and bring water to a three dimensional perspective, but again employing the wave configuration. The vitality of waves and the variety of imaginable momentary forms provide an opportunity to capture the movement or flow of nature. Thus, these works have been, to some extent, influenced by the classic Japanese garden with its violent and subdued extremes. In executing my works, I have attempted to manipulate the properties of clay. In its plastic stage, clay is capable of being shaped into smooth, subtle lines and graceful curves for subdued expression. When less moist, it may result in harsh and violent configurations and rough textures. By employing the variety of forms made possible by the properties of clay, the ceramic medium is able to depict the full scope of wave forms present in nature, ranging from rolling to choppy to rough and every conceivable quality between. Waves in nature also appear in a wide range of color and tone, from blue to green to white, red, black and grey, and from dull and dim to shiny and glistening bright. In various firings, such as sagger, and from cone 3 to cone 12, and by using <b>engobes</b> and high fire glazes, I attempted to produce the wide variety of colors and tones for waves that appear in nature.

The plastic potential contained in the ceramic materials regarding to exploring visual and tactile qualities have created an attraction in some plastic artists, throughout the history. What did attract them? An idea inspired by the pictorial materials of ceramic that generates the impulse to create? An idea that is subsequently created by means of these materials?

The aim of this work is to analyze the implications in the pictorial process of ceramic painting and to understand its identity.

Materials like clays, <b>engobes,</b> pigments and glazes are characterized. A reference to the media and means of ceramic painting is also included in this first part. To complete this introduction we point out some contexts of ceramic painting such as the chromatic component, the light reflection, the action of textures, and the influence of surfaces. In a second moment the ceramic paintings of the portuguese ceramist Cecilia de Sousa between 1980 and 1990 is analyzed. Cecilia de Sousa uses the ceramic materials on a painting that, in our point of view, strengthens the ceramic materials.

The peculiarity {{of this kind of}} ceramics consist of the unusual presence of a white <b>engobe,</b> traditionally termed stucco, between the ceramic body and the decoration elements, hence the name estucado ceramics. The aim of this work was to study the unusual manufacturing technique and to identify the chemical composition of the <b>engobe</b> and of the pigment palette. The results showed that the stucco layer is made of clay (kaolinite) with traces of titanium oxide (anatase). Remarkably, this is the same composition of the white pigments used for the decoration layer, thus excluding an early use of natural titanium oxide as a white pigment in the estucado productions as suggested in previous investigations. Moreover, the presence of kaolinite and anatase both in the stucco and in the decoration layer suggests a cold-working or low temperature technique. The red, yellow and green decorations were realized by the use of natural ochre, while in all the blue and gray decorations Maya blue pigment was identified.

The waste materials were characterized and {{incorporated into the}} body as raw materials and <b>engobe</b> compositions of glazed red stoneware tiles. Technical characteristics of the obtained product were compared to those of a reference stoneware tile without waste products in its composition, showing that the addition of these materials {{up to more than}} 8 % wt involved a significant decrease of water absorption, increase of linear shrinkage and enhanced mechanical properties. Environmental and economic advantages were also obtained since the introduction of the ceramic waste materials allowed energy consumption decrease during firing and reduction of water consumption during grinding stage...|$|R
