Even the Percheron, which was internationally recognized as the Norman draft horse, was not as popular in the homeland of the Norman Cob breed. In 1945, Norman Cob stallions accounted for 40% of the conscripted horses, and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{name comes}} from a natural spring located along a trail on {{the south end of}} the park.

Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked eye}} from Earth.

25|$|While most colonies are annual, {{perennial}} colonies exist, {{especially in}} Florida. These nests {{tend to be}} found in the southernmost regions of their habitat where it is possible for the nest to survive through the winter. Because these nests are built for and inhabited for several years, they tend to be much larger than annual nests. In fact, these nests are about 50-60 liters in volume and can contain at least 60,000 cells. The decreased production of the winter brood further distinguishes overwintering nests from annual nests. In addition, continuous production of reproductives occurs <b>even</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> winter. These nests also have from six to over 100 reproductive queens.|$|E

During that period Nova was engaged in a rapid expansion meant {{to increase the number of}} Nova branches by 300 in an attempt to reach a total of 1,000. The parents' suit alleges that their son was required by Nova to work up to 80 hours of overtime in one month, and <b>even</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night on seven occasions, despite his inexperience. At one point he had requested to be relieved but was persuaded to stay, which eventually led to overwhelming stress shortly before his suicide.|$|E
25|$|Convinced that {{religious}} anti-Sovietism {{had become a}} thing of the past with most Soviet Christians, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s. Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during the Soviet war with Nazi Germany. Amid other accommodations to religious faith after Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, churches were reopened, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in 1943. Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the Soviet Union <b>even</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s. The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999, Chrétien {{supported}} Canada's involvement in NATO's bombing campaign of Yugoslavia {{over the issue of}} Kosovo, <b>even</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> operation was unsanctioned by the UN Security Council thanks to a Russian veto of an Anglo-American resolution asking for the Security Council's approval of the NATO bombing. The idea of bombing Yugoslavia caused some discomfort within the ranks of the Liberal party as the NATO campaign effectively meant supporting Kosovo separatists against a government determined to prevent Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia. Chrétien was personally uncomfortable with the idea of bombing Yugoslavia, but supported the war because he valued good relations with the United States far more than he cared about Yugoslavia. Chrétien's foreign minister at the time, Lloyd Axworthy justified Canada's involvement in NATO bombing of Yugoslavia under the grounds that allegations of massacres against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo made the use of force legitimate on humanitarian grounds, even without the approval of the UN Security Council. Likewise, Chrétien was later to tell Lawrence Martin that it was far better to intervene {{in the internal affairs of}} Yugoslavia to stop human rights violations in the Kosovo region by Serbian forces than to do nothing.|$|E

25|$|The Franco-Dutch {{failure in}} front of Leuven's walls allowed the Spanish to take the initiative. The Cardinal-Infante counter-attacked, pushing the Franco-Dutch army back to the Dutch border. He made a north-easterly thrust to the Rhine in the {{direction}} of Cleves, recapturing Diest and Tienen. A party of 500 German mercenaries under Lt.-Col. Eyndhouts, roaming on his left flank, managed to surprise the Dutch fortress of Schenkenschans that at the time had a garrison of only 120 soldiers, in the night of 27/28 July. A large garrison were put then in the fortress, at first under the command of Eyndhouts. The Dutch brought up reinforcements right away, but could not prevent the occupation by a Spanish army of 20,000 of the Duchy of Cleves during August and September, with the aim of linking the fort of Shenck with {{the main body of the}} Spanish Netherlands. This army threatened an invasion of the Dutch heartland and it was therefore essential that this threat be countered. Frederick Henry personally started the siege of Schenkenschans within days of its fall, but soon transferred command to his cousin John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. The fort fell after a long and costly siege that lasted <b>even</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> winter months. The Spanish turned then their attention against the French, invading the north of France towards the Somme and reaching as far as Corbie.|$|E
25|$|Because Music has {{the ability}} to access {{multiple}} parts of the brain, music therapy is highly effective in providing therapeutic support for individuals with all types of dementia. Research indicates that the sections of the brain weakened by dementia can be supported and in some cases strengthened by other areas of the brain through musical activities. Musical ability and awareness {{is also one of the}} last functions to be compromised in an individual with dementia, which makes it an especially effective intervention, even in people with very late stage forms of the disease. Music therapy is more than simply listening to or playing music. Through the use of evidence based interventions and clinical assessments, a music therapist works to improve the lives and abilities of individuals. These interventions can decrease anxiety, improve speech and self- expression, and a decrease in negative behaviors and isolation which are commonly found in individuals with dementia. Common negative behaviors that correspond with dementia are depression and agitation. According to Mary S. Mittelman, the director of psychosocial research at Langone Medical Center, music therapy helped to decrease both of these negative substantially. The reason for this is because in the brain, the parts corresponding to music are preserved <b>even</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> effects of dementia. Due to these being preserved, residents who live their lives in a blur find some clarity and familiarity through music, creating lower levels of stress and agitation.|$|E
