500|$|Many {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} suggest that the mysteries of Isis were connected {{in some way to}} salvation and the guarantee of an afterlife. The Greek conception of the afterlife included the paradisiacal Elysian Fields, and philosophers developed various ideas about the immortality of the soul, but Greeks and Romans expressed uncertainty about what would happen to them after death. In both Greek and Roman traditional religion, no god was thought to guarantee a pleasant afterlife to his or her worshippers. The gods of some mystery cults may have been exceptions, but evidence about those cults' afterlife beliefs is vague. Apuleius's account, if it is accurate, provides stronger evidence for Isiac afterlife beliefs than is available for the other cults. The book says Isis's power over fate, which her Greek and Roman devotees frequently mentioned, gives her control over life and death. According to the priest who initiates Lucius, devotees of Isis [...] "who had finished their life's span and were already standing on the threshold of light’s end, if only they could safely be trusted with the great unspoken mysteries of the cult, were frequently drawn forth by the goddess' power and in a manner reborn through her providence and set once more on the course of renewed life." [...] In another passage, Isis herself says that when Lucius dies {{he will be able to}} see her shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underworld and worship her there.|$|E

500|$|After {{the defeat}} at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{took more than}} six weeks in {{planning}} and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube. The French brought in more troops, more guns, and instituted better defensive measures to ensure {{the success of the}} next crossing. From 30 June to the early days of July, the French recrossed the Danube in strength, no less than 188,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Immediate resistance to the French advance was restricted to the outpost divisions of Nordmann and Johann von Klenau; the main Habsburg army was stationed five miles (8km) away, centred on the village of Wagram. After a successful crossing, Napoleon ordered an attack along the entire line so as to prevent the Austrians from escaping during the night. Furious assaults by the [...] "Terrible 57th" [...] Infantry Regiment and the elite 10th Light Infantry Regiment against the village of Baumersdorf led to an almost immediate French victory, but ultimately, the Austrians did not budge and kept the French from pressing further. Incessant attacks by the heroic Austrian Vincent Chevaulegers' cavalry forced the 10th and the 57th to retreat, leaving the French with no gains. Further attacks {{to the left of the}} line by Eugène and MacDonald also produced nothing. Bernadotte's troops attacked later with equally disappointing results, and on the right Davout decided to disengage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night. The first day ended with the French on the Marchfeld but with little results to show for their efforts.|$|E

[...] "Do what thy manhood bids thee do/ from none but self expect applause;/ He noblest lives and noblest dies/ who makes and keeps his self-made laws" [...] is The Kasidahs most often-quoted passage.

2500|$|On 26 July, {{pursuing}} the withdrawing Germans, the Soviet attack {{fell onto the}} Tannenberg Line before the vastly outnumbered Army Detachment [...] "Narwa" [...] had dug in.

Sturmbannführer Wilhelm Rehmann left the battlefield, as Leutnant George D'Haese stepped in to bring the brigade back to combat readiness. The German batteries were badly hit; the commander of one of them had been killed. It took a few days for Steiner to repair the assault guns and, until this had been completed, the impact of the German artillery remained modest.
