The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986.|$|E

5|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to greenlight the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season {{as if it was}} one television pilot.

5|$|On December 15, 1987, {{entrepreneur}} Jerry Richardson {{announced his}} bid for an NFL expansion franchise in the Carolinas. A North Carolina native, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the Baltimore Colts who had used his 1959 league championship bonus to co-found the Hardee's restaurant chain, later becoming president and CEO of TW Services. Richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from George Shinn, who had made a successful bid for an expansion National Basketball Association (NBA) team in Charlotte, the Charlotte Hornets. Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself, his family, {{and a number of}} businessmen from North and South Carolina were also recruited to be limited partners. Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing uptown Charlotte. In choosing the team name, the Richardsons did not run <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> with potential fans.

40|$|Ph. D. (Marketing Management) The {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{for the purpose of}} providing a scientific research quality framework to provide guidelines and new knowledge for <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research practice in South Africa. The need for a guiding <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> framework was borne out of the critical need for scientific and quality marketing information generated through <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research. The growing need for quality <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research information across industries in South Africa was evidently not met, due to the various challenges inherent within the local industry practice of <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research. The various challenges impacting on the quality of <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research were identified through an extensive literature investigation, and later confirmed through the empirical study which was preceded by an exploratory qualitative study. The major sources of research quality challenges identified and investigated for purposes of the study relate to non-systematic approaches to <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research, malpractices and misuse of the <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> method leading to quality compromises. The unstreamlined approach to <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research practice was found to be due to the different versions of the <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> process followed by many research practitioners, including their own self-guessed approaches. A further complication arises from lack of adherence to scientific procedures, either deliberately in the rush for profit or out of ignorance of research science with respect to the marketing research process. For these reasons, the quality of <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research produced within the local marketing research industry may not me deemed scientific. Evidence abound, a desirable <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research practice environment, guided through scientific application of the research method and conducive to the supply of quality <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research needed to be created, in order to mitigate the quality challenges. The implications for questionable research quality were confirmed through the study to be dire for research user organisations across industries.

This study aimed to know the effectiveness of <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> discussion in maximizing menopause women’s coping mechanism. Health education is one part of the whole health efforts (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative) which emphasize on healthy life attitudes. Method; This study was conducted by using randomized control trial which is used to examine the effectiveness of <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> discussion in maximizing menopause women’s coping mechanism. This study used a questionnaire which is examined validity and reliability (internal consistency) with using: item total correlation and alpha Crohnbach and taken 30 menopause women as the sample by using simple random sampling technique. Result; The analysis that used in this study is t-test with p value average difference of coping ability towards a group between health education and without <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> {{discussion is}} 0, 07. It means that there is a significant different between the two groups’ attitudes.
