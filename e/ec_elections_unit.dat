The influence of grassroots election on police {{trust in the}} four groups’ odds ratios are larger than 1, and all data show statistical significance, which means that grassroots election have positive impact on police trust. In particular, in the first group, if grassroots <b>election</b> increase 1 <b>unit,</b> the possibility of respondents choosing “somewhat not trust + between not trust and trust + somewhat trust + completely trust” increases 43.1  % comparing to choosing “not trust at all”; in the second group, grassroots <b>election</b> increases 1 <b>unit,</b> the possibility of choosing “between not trust and trust + somewhat trust + completely trust” will raises 23.3  % comparing to choosing “not trust at all + somewhat not trust”; in the third group, grassroots <b>election</b> increases 1 <b>unit,</b> the possibility of choosing “somewhat trust + completely trust” increases 29  % comparing to choosing “not trust at all + somewhat not trust + between not trust and trust”; in the fourth group, grassroots <b>election</b> increases 1 <b>unit,</b> the possibility of choosing “completely trust” adds 27.2  % comparing to choosing “not trust at all + somewhat not trust + between not trust and trust + somewhat trust.” The Hukou-grassroots election interaction term (“Hukou × grassroots election”) only shows weak statistical significance in relation to dependent variables {{in the last two}} groups. The odds ratios in the four groups are less than 1, thus we could assume that the influence of the interaction term on dependent variable is negative.
