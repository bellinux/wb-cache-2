5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. <b>For</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
500|$|In 1896, Major Deare led {{one such}} {{expedition}} north {{from the main}} seat of Company administration, Fort Salisbury, {{to meet with the}} Ngoni chief Mpezeni, who ruled to the east of Harrison Clark. One day, to Deare's surprise, a small group of warriors approached his party from the west, carrying a letter. This message, written in English and signed [...] "Changa-Changa, Chief of the Mashukulumbwe"—the name John Harrison Clark was given {{in the body of the}} letter—said that its author had heard of a white man being entertained recently by Mpezeni, and wished to provide the same hospitality at Algoa. [...] "Really, wonders never cease!" [...] Deare recalled. [...] "I had heard of this man on the Zambezi and had known him well many years ago in the Cape Colony... We had both lived in the same town <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> learnt his story later." [...] It is unclear whether Deare took up Clark's invitation to Algoa.|$|E

500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit {{and the next thing you}} knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea for the first time on any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E

Paul Martin, who had succeeded Chrétien as Prime Minister, asked her to use more tact and discretion when sharing her opinions about such subjects but stopped short of asking her to apologize.

Numan's wife later suggested he had Asperger syndrome; after reading about the syndrome and taking a series of online tests, he agreed, and identified himself as having AS, though he has not professionally been diagnosed with it. In a 2001 interview, he said, [...] "Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points. Just recently I actually found out that I'd got a mild form of Asperger's syndrome which basically means I have trouble interacting with people. <b>For</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> couldn't understand why people thought I was arrogant, but now it all makes more sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson's {{nomination}} {{sparked a}} controversy that erupted during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, {{based on his}} large stockholdings in General Motors. Reluctant to sell the stock, valued at the time at more than $2.5 million, Wilson agreed to do so under committee pressure. During the hearings, {{when asked if he}} could make a decision as Secretary of Defense that would be adverse to the interests of General Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively. But he added that he could not conceive of such a situation [...] "because <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa". This statement has frequently been misquoted as [...] "What's good for General Motors is good for the country". Although Wilson tried for years to correct the misquote, he was reported {{at the time of his}} retirement in 1957 to have accepted the popular impression.|$|E
2500|$|By July 1918, {{there was}} open {{criticism}} of the National Shipyards proposals in the House of Commons. [...] The Liberal M.P. Gerald France stated that the issue had [...] "become not a war emergency... but a speculative adventure", and Sir Hamar Greenwood described the initiative as a [...] "scandal". [...] Greenwood went on:"What really is a serious {{matter is that the}} time and energy of the War Cabinet, which should think of nothing but this awful War, where men are slaughtered daily, have been wasted by innumerable deputations, by arguments for and against, and by the pursuit of this phantom of a great national shipyard on the mud flats of a river in the West of England. Up to the present not a ship has been produced, and {{there is no sign of}} a ship being produced <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> urge the Government, however foolish it has been, to be strong enough now to stop this blunder." ...|$|E

2500|$|Navarro's joining and Kiedis's {{continued}} {{drug addiction}} {{had a profound}} effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, One Hot Minute (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel to create music, even though I'd known Hillel <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> <b>I</b> just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, [...] "Pea".|$|E
2500|$|This {{was a poor}} {{state of}} affairs {{considering}} German intelligence sources in Washington, prior to hostilities, had picked up minutely detailed reports on the performance and potential performance of American aircraft. Moreover, {{the capacity of the}} American aircraft industry was heavily documented in open source publications, and General Friedrich von Boetticher, Chief of Source and Information of the German military and air attaché at the Embassy in Washington, had produced a number of these reports on the Boeing B-17 four-engine heavy bomber development, supported by experts in the German aircraft industry, the War Economy and Armaments Office. [...] "Generaloberst" [...] Hans Jeschonnek, the Luftwaffe Chief of Staff, was impressed by these reports and arranged in May 1942 a meeting for Boetticher with Hitler to underline the threat posed by the USAAF. Hitler had then again dismissed the data and agreed with Göring. Jeschonnek despaired. He wrote to General Friedrich von Boetticher:Boetticher, we are lost. <b>For</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have, on the basis of your reports, forwarded demands to Göring and Hitler, but for years my requests for the expansion of the Luftwaffe have not been answered. We no longer have the air defence I requested and which is needed...we no longer have any time...to provide ourselves with the weapons to fight the dreadful threat which you have predicted and reported to us. Then we will be covered from the air with an enemy screen which will paralyze our power to resist.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Santos had {{the lead}} role in Kahit Isang Saglit. She portrayed Annie, a budding {{architect}} romantically torn between two best friends (played by Piolo Pascual and Leandro Munoz). The film received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Santos and Pascual. Santos next appearance with Pascual was in the 2001 television series Sa Puso Ko Iingatan Ka as Patricia Montecillo, an illegitimate daughter in a constant struggle for acceptance and independence, dealing with an alcoholic abusive stepfather. Dez Lucero from Chic commended Santos' breakthrough and innovative portrayal, [...] "Patricia [...] here is a fighter who stands up to anyone bent on demolishing her [...] she is a survivor, she is sarcastic, she is street smart, she is strong." [...] Asked what she hoped to accomplish in the drama series, Santos stated, [...] "After seeing me cry <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> think the public now wants me to make them laugh." [...] In the same year, Santos released her second album Bida Ng Buhay Ko. Singles from the album included [...] "Hello Goodbye", [...] "This Song's Dedicated To You", and [...] "Stop! Before You Break My Heart". The album was met with negative reviews. David Gonzales of AllMusic.com gave the album {{one out of five}} stars, stating, [...] "Santos is a popular young film actress, and this must be the reason why she has a recording contract. It isn't because of her singing, which ranges from bad to terrible. She sings in a low, whispery voice and hits many off-key notes throughout the album, which makes a listener cringe. Her voice is often difficult to hear above the backing instrumentation, but at least this spares a listener from more misery." [...] The album achieved moderate success, eventually certified platinum.|$|E

2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But every now and then I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. <b>For</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E
