Phase contrast MRI (pcMRI) technique is an add-on specification of MRI devices in order to quantify flow. Although different attempts have been introduced to measure orbital flows, a relationship between different ophthalmic physiological structures including superior ophthalmic vein, ophthalmic artery and optic nerve sheath (containing cerebrospinal fluid) using phase contrast MRI has not been established. In this study we investigate orbital flow in 5 normal subjects using a 3 tesla MRI device. pcMRI technique {{has been applied to}} <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> in the superior ophthalmic vein and optic nerve sheath. Electrocardiogram of each subject was monitored and gated to the MRI in order to <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> waveforms. Results show multiple peaks when assessing orbital flow waveforms, suggesting possible reflection of flow from back of the eye. These peaks have been characterized and a possible explanation to this phenomenon has been provided.

30|$|Kitchen <b>extracted</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{is not an}} {{influential}} factor in the south bedroom. As this room is upwind (Fig.  6), {{it is likely that}} wind effects prevail over the mechanical extraction [55]. This effect is amplified by the constant <b>extracted</b> volumetric <b>flow</b> rate considered in the model. In reality, the <b>extracted</b> <b>flow</b> rate can actually increase {{as a result of an}} overpressure caused by the wind. The bathroom <b>extracted</b> <b>flow</b> rate, which has a lower nominal value than the kitchen one, is not a major influential factor.|$|R
30|$|In all {{the rooms}} (Tables  7, 8, 9, 10, 11), we can notice {{that the number of}} {{occupants}} and the generation of CO 2 per person are more influential than the <b>extracted</b> <b>flow</b> rate. This is mainly due to the nominal and uncertainty values chosen for the flow rates and to the fact that an increase of the <b>extracted</b> <b>flow</b> rate will not necessarily lead to a significant increase of the inlet fresh air in the considered room. In fact, increasing the <b>extracted</b> <b>flow</b> rate can cause, in relation with the airflow pattern (Fig.  3), the transportation of CO 2 from other occupied rooms (for example, in the bathroom, kitchen, and corridor). This increase can also have a relatively limited impact on a room CO 2 concentration if the leakage and air inlet areas are considerably larger in other rooms.|$|R
30|$|This {{second part}} of the {{sensitivity}} analysis, performed on several indicators, highlights the strong influence of the bedroom-related parameters in the presented model configuration. Considering perfect air mixing in the building, a steady-state CO 2 concentration around 800  ppm would be reached in the building at night under average conditions. Therefore, the high concentrations observed are more due to the air distribution than to an insufficient <b>extracted</b> <b>flow</b> rate. In addition, increasing the <b>extracted</b> <b>flow</b> rate would lead to a higher energy consumption. The solutions suggested in the previous section to reduce the bedrooms or the whole building CO 2 concentrations and uncertainties are thus relevant.|$|R

However, current detection methods are inefficient to identify unknown botnet. The high-speed network environment makes botnet detection more difficult. To solve these problems, we improve the progress of packet processing technologies such as New Application Programming Interface (NAPI) and zero copy and propose an efficient quasi-real-time intrusion detection system. Our work detects botnet using supervised machine learning approach under the high-speed network environment. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) Build a detection framework using PF_RING for sniffing and processing network traces to <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> features dynamically.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} to <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> graphs from Java bytecode, focusing on exceptional control flows. We prove its correctness, {{meaning that the}} behaviour of the extracted control-flow graph is an over-approximation of the behaviour of the original program. Thus any safety property that holds for the extracted control-flow graph also holds for the original program. This makes control-flow graphs suitable for performing different static analyses. For precision and efficiency, the extraction is performed in two phases. In the first phase the program {{is transformed into a}} BIR program, where BIR is a stack-less intermediate representation of Java bytecode; in the second phase the control-flow graph is extracted from the BIR representation. To prove the correctness of the two-phase extraction, we also define a direct extraction algorithm, whose correctness can be proven immediately. Then we show that the behaviour of the control-flow graph extracted via the intermediate representation is an over-approximation of the behaviour of the directly extracted graphs, and thus of the original program...|$|E
40|$|Feature-based flow {{visualization}} {{is naturally}} dependent on feature extraction. To <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> features, often higher-order {{properties of the}} flow data are used such as the Jacobian or curvature properties, implicitly describing the flow features {{in terms of their}} inherent flow characteristics (e. g., collinear flow and vorticity vectors). In this paper we present recent research which leads to the (not really surprising) conclusion that feature extraction algorithms need to be extended to a time-dependent analysis framework (in terms of time derivatives) when dealing with unsteady flow data. Accordingly, we present two extensions of the parallel vectors based vortex extraction criteria to the time-dependent domain and show the improvements of feature-based flow visualization in comparison to the steady versions of this extraction algorithm both {{in the context of a}} high-resolution dataset, i. e., a simulation specifically designed to evaluate our new approach, as well as for a real-world dataset from a concrete application...|$|E

Therefore, we characterize transport in these flows in the very detail with Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) that reveal the geometry of irregular fluid motion, and especially emphasize lines of separation and merging of fluid patches. In particular, (1) we study the spreading of a phytoplankton plankton patch in a numerical NPZ model, (2) we examine the role of advection for the Madagascar plankton bloom, (3) we <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> patterns in the surface flow of the Ria de Vigo, an estuary in NW Spain, and (4) we analyze transport patterns in a turbulent laboratory flow induced by Faraday waves and relate the resulting Lagrangian coherent structures with the filamentous wave front of a chemical reaction.

40|$|Single Ventricle {{congenital}} heart defects with cyanotic mixing between systemic and pulmonary circulations afflict 2 per 1000 live births. The total cavo-pulmonary connection (TCPC), {{where the}} superior and inferior vena cavae are sutured {{to the left}} and right pulmonary arteries, is the current procedure of choice. It is believed that reducing the fluid mechanical power losses in the TCPC will relieve strain on the single functional ventricle. It is hypothesized that a proposed idealized TCPC design, decreases power losses to a level below that of any other TCPC designs, while providing other advantages and increased flexibility. Physical models with slightly different geometries of the proposed design were created, and in vitro experiments carried out with particle image velocimetry (PIV), phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI), and control volume flow analysis at physiological flow rates. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used for numerical studies of the same geometries as in the physical models. Power losses were calculated using the control volume method and the viscous power dissipation function. The latter method incorporated registration of high-resolution PC-MRI velocity vectors to tetrahedral meshes followed by inverse interpolation of the vectors onto the meshes. Detailed flow structures were analyzed. Results show that the new design is more energy efficient than any other idealized models. Furthermore, a tool was developed to <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> and vessel information from PC-MRI datasets obtained from patients with Fontan connections. The tool utilized a display algorithm, which was developed for optimal noise detection in PC-MRI images. This enabled accurate segmentation. Comparing PC-MRI images before and after this accurate segmentation showed that the standard deviations of the pixels at the perimeter of the segmented vessel were statistically significantly smaller after the segmentation in 94. 1 % of the datasets investigated. The developed tool was able to <b>extract</b> <b>flow,</b> flow in the quadrants of vessels, area of the segmented vessel, velocities and pulsatility indices.

A problem is that the water transport systems present low efficiencies in practice.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{combined}} post-filtering (CPF) method {{to improve the}} accuracy of optical flow estimation. Its attractive advantages are that outliers reduction is attained while discontinuities are well preserved, and occlusions are partially handled. Major contributions are the following: First, the structure tensor (ST) based edge detection is introduced to <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> edges. Moreover, we improve the detection performance by extending the traditional 2 D spatial edge detector into spatial-scale 3 D space, and also using a gradient bilateral filter (GBF) to replace the linear Gaussian filter to construct a multi-scale nonlinear ST. GBF is useful to preserve discontinuity but it is computationally expensive. A hybrid GBF and Gaussian filter (HGBGF) approach is proposed {{by means of a}} spatial-scale gradient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measure to solve the low efficiency issue. Additionally, a piecewise occlusion detection method is used to extract occlusions. Second, we apply a CPF method, which uses a weighted median filter (WMF), a bilateral filter (BF) and a fast median filter (MF), to post-smooth the detected edges and occlusions, and the other flat regions of the flow field respectively.

In connection with this phenomenon, we study the impact of spatial permeability fluctuations on the dynamic behavior of porous materials. This heterogeneous permeability distribution further complicates the ongoing efforts to <b>extract</b> <b>flow</b> permeability from seismic data. Based on the method of statistical smoothing applied to Biot's equations of poroelasticity, we derive models for the dynamic-equivalent permeability in 1 D and 3 D randomly inhomogeneous media. The low-frequency limit of this permeability corresponds to the flow permeability governing fluid flow in porous media. We incorporate the dynamic-equivalent permeability model into the expressions for attenuation and dispersion of P-waves, also obtained by the method of smoothing. The resulting attenuation and dispersion model is confirmed by numerical computations in randomly layered poroelastic structures. The {{results suggest that the}} effect of wave-induced fluid flow can be observed in a broader frequency range than previously thought.
