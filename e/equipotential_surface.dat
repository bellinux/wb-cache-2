25|$|The geoid, or {{mathematical}} mean sea surface, {{is defined}} {{not only on}} the seas, but also under land; it is the equilibrium water surface that would result, would sea water be allowed to move freely (e.g., through tunnels) under the land. Technically, an <b>equipotential</b> <b>surface</b> of the true geopotential, chosen to coincide (on average) with mean sea level.|$|E
25|$|The ocean's {{surface is}} closely {{approximated}} by an <b>equipotential</b> <b>surface,</b> (ignoring ocean currents) {{commonly referred to}} as the geoid. Since the gravitational force is equal to the potential's gradient, there are no tangential forces on such a surface, and the ocean surface is thus in gravitational equilibrium. Now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the Moon and Sun. These bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and act to alter the shape of an <b>equipotential</b> <b>surface</b> on the Earth. This deformation has a fixed spatial orientation relative to the influencing body. The Earth's rotation relative to this shape causes the daily tidal cycle. Gravitational forces follow an inverse-square law (force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance), but tidal forces are inversely proportional to the cube of the distance. The ocean surface moves because of the changing tidal equipotential, rising when the tidal potential is high, which occurs on the parts of the Earth nearest to and furthest from the Moon. When the tidal equipotential changes, the ocean surface is no longer aligned with it, so the apparent direction of the vertical shifts. The surface then experiences a down slope, in the direction that the equipotential has risen.|$|E

Sorted patterned ground and erosion patterns in polygonal terrain in the region support ice-rich material; hence a lake. Also, the presence of streamlined islands, cataracts, and dendritic channel systems suggest formation by water from a lake. [...] Some surfaces here show [...] "Rootless cones" [...] which are mounds with pits. They {{can be caused by}} explosions of lava with ground ice when lava flows on top of ice-rich ground. The ice melts and turns into a vapor that expands in an explosion that produces a cone or ring. Features like these are found in Iceland, when lavas cover water-saturated substrates. The western Elysium Planitia basin can be described as almost a perfect <b>equipotential</b> <b>surface</b> because it slopes only about 10m over a 500km distance—that’s about as level as the Earth’s ocean. [...] This very gentle slope argues against a lava flow. [...] In places, it has been found that the flow surface has been lowered by 50% which is expected if the flow was of water, but not if it were lava. The maximum depth of the lake was estimated to be between 31 and 53m.|$|E
50|$|An {{equipotential}} {{region of}} a scalar potential in three-dimensional space {{is often an}} <b>equipotential</b> <b>surface,</b> {{but it can also}} be a three-dimensional region in space. The gradient of the scalar potential (and hence also its opposite, as in the case of a vector field with an associated potential field) is everywhere perpendicular to the <b>equipotential</b> <b>surface,</b> and zero inside a three-dimensional equipotential region.|$|E

The inner cusp enables an accretion onto the central object. Influence of the repulsive cosmological constant, > 0, on the <b>equipotential</b> <b>surfaces</b> lies in the existence of the outer cusp (with a stabilizing effect on the thick discs) and in the strong collimation of open <b>equipotential</b> <b>surfaces</b> along the rotational axis.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to analyze the shape of anatomical structures. Our methodology is rooted in classical physics and in particular Poisson’s equation, a fundamental partial differential equation [1]. The solution to this equation and more specifically its <b>equipotential</b> <b>surfaces</b> display properties that are useful for shape analysis. We demonstrate the solution of this equation on synthetic and medical images. We present a numerical algorithm to calculate the length of streamlines formed by the gradient field of {{the solution to this}} equation for 3 D objects. We used the length of streamlines of <b>equipotential</b> <b>surfaces</b> to introduce a new function to characterize the shape of objects. A preliminary study on the shape of the caudate nucleus in Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD) illustrates the power of our method. ...|$|R

40|$|Recently Verlinde has {{suggested}} {{a new approach}} to gravity which interprets gravitational interaction as a kind of entropic force. The new approach uses the holographic principle by stating that the information is kept on the holographic screens which coincide with <b>equipotential</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Motivated by this new interpretation of gravity (but not being limited by it) we study <b>equipotential</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the Unruh-Verlinde temperature, energy and acceleration for various static space-times: generic spherically symmetric solutions, axially symmetric black holes immersed in a magnetic field, traversable spherically symmetric wormholes of an arbitrary shape function, system of two and more extremely charged black holes in equilibrium. In particular, we have shown that the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of the holographic screen reaches absolute zero on the wormhole throat independently of the particular form of the wormhole solution.

In this approach a new set of parameters is considered: (1) the density variations over <b>equipotential</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the height of interfaces above the corresponding <b>equipotential</b> <b>surfaces</b> and (2) the stress difference. The method is applied to lunar topographic and gravimetric data that are interpreted in term of transversally isotropic deviatoric stress within the Moon. It also provides inference on density and crustal thickness variations. The estimated lateral variation in deviatoric stress is about 500 bars within the crust and upper mantle. In the crust, because of topography, the strongest stress differences take place on the far side, with large lateral compressions beneath the south pole–Aitken basin.
