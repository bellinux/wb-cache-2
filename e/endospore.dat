5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one <b>endospore</b> is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can make up to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the <b>endospore.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reactivation of the <b>endospore</b> {{occurs when}} {{conditions}} are more favourable and involves activation, germination, and outgrowth. Even if an <b>endospore</b> {{is located in}} plentiful nutrients, it may fail to germinate unless activation has taken place. This may be triggered by heating the <b>endospore.</b> Germination involves the dormant <b>endospore</b> starting metabolic activity and thus breaking hibernation. It is commonly characterised by rupture or absorption of the spore coat, swelling of the <b>endospore,</b> an increase in metabolic activity, and loss of resistance to environmental stress.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{bacteria}} having terminal endospores include Clostridium tetani, the pathogen {{that causes the}} disease tetanus. Bacteria having a centrally placed <b>endospore</b> include Bacillus cereus. Sometimes the <b>endospore</b> can be so large the cell can be distended around the <b>endospore.</b> This is typical of Clostridium tetani.|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{collection}} of Pasteuria penetrans <b>endospores</b> was developed. Roots containing P. penetrans-infected root-knot nematode females were softened by pectinase digestion, mechanically processed, and filtered to collect {{large numbers of}} viable <b>endospores.</b> This method obviates laborious handpicking of Pasteuria-infected females and yields <b>endospores</b> competent to attach to and infect nematodes. <b>Endospores</b> are suitable for morphology studies and DNA preparations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Endospores</b> of Pasteuria penetrans were {{evaluated}} for their vertical distribution in field soil and their downward movement through {{soil in the}} laboratory. In the field trial, the number of <b>endospores</b> attached to second-stage juveniles (J 2) of Meloidogyne arenaria race 1 varied greatly in different soil depths. There were higher percentages of J 2 with <b>endospores</b> attached in former weed fallow plots during the first 3 years of growing peanut than in former bahiagrass and rhizomal peanut plots (P ≤ 0. 05). In weed fallow plots a higher average number of <b>endospores</b> per J 2 were maintained in all depths, upper three depths, and upper four depths in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively (P ≤ 0. 05). However, in 2002, {{there were no differences}} in the percentages of J 2 with <b>endospores</b> attached and in the average of the numbers of <b>endospores</b> per J 2 among the treatments (P > 0. 05). In laboratory trials, P. penetrans <b>endospores</b> were observed to move throughout the soil through the percolation of water. After one application of water, some <b>endospores</b> were detected 25 to 37. 5 cm deep. <b>Endospores</b> were present at the greatest depth, 37. 5 to 50 cm, after the third application of water. These results indicate that rain or water applications by irrigation are likely to move <b>endospores</b> to deeper levels of the soil, but the majority of <b>endospores</b> remain in the upper 0 -to- 30 -cm depth...|$|R
2500|$|Bacterial <b>endospores</b> are {{resistant}} to antibiotics, most disinfectants, and physical agents such as radiation, boiling, and drying. The impermeability of the spore coat {{is thought to be}} responsible for the <b>endospore's</b> resistance to chemicals. The heat resistance of <b>endospores</b> is due to a variety of factors: ...|$|R
25|$|Calcium dipicolinate, {{abundant}} {{within the}} <b>endospore,</b> may stabilize {{and protect the}} endospore's DNA.|$|E
25|$|When a {{bacterium}} detects environmental conditions are becoming unfavourable it may {{start the process}} of endosporulation, which takes about eight hours. The DNA is replicated and a membrane wall known as a spore septum begins to form {{between it and the}} rest of the cell. The plasma membrane of the cell surrounds this wall and pinches off to leave a double membrane around the DNA, and the developing structure is now known as a forespore. Calcium dipicolinate, the calcium salt of dipicolinic acid, is incorporated into the forespore during this time. The dipicolinic acid helps stabilize the proteins and DNA in the <b>endospore.</b> Next the peptidoglycan cortex forms between the two layers and the bacterium adds a spore coat to the outside of the forespore. In the final stages of <b>endospore</b> formation the newly forming <b>endospore</b> is dehydrated and allowed to mature before being released from the mother cell. The cortex is what makes the <b>endospore</b> so resistant to temperature. The cortex contains an inner membrane known as the core. The inner membrane that surrounds this core leads to the endospore's resistance against UV light and harsh chemicals that would normally destroy microbes. Sporulation is now complete, and the mature <b>endospore</b> will be released when the surrounding vegetative cell is degraded.|$|E
25|$|Finally, DNA repair enzymes {{contained}} within the <b>endospore</b> are able to repair damaged DNA during germination.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a quick, simple technique for the fluorescent staining of bacterial <b>endospores.</b> This technique was developed using Bacillus subtilis <b>endospores.</b> Our technique requires minimal sample heating so it can safely be carried out entirely in a glove-box. The <b>endospores</b> stain diagnostically as an oval with a standard fluorescent nucleotide stain, acridine orange...|$|R
40|$|Resistance of {{bacterial}} <b>endospores</b> to treatments including biocides, heat and radiation is a persistent problem. This study investigates the susceptibility of Bacillus and Clostridium <b>endospores</b> to 405 -nm visible light, wavelengths {{which have been}} shown to induce inactivation of vegetative bacterial cells. Suspensions of B. cereus <b>endospores</b> were exposed to high-intensity 405 -nm light generated from a light-emitting diode array and results demonstrate the induction of a sporicidal effect. Up to a 4 -log 10 CFU mL- 1 reduction in spore population was achieved after exposure to a dose of 1. 73 kJcm- 2. Similar inactivation kinetics were demonstrated with B. subtilis, B. megaterium and C. difficile <b>endospores.</b> The doses required for inactivation of <b>endospores</b> were significantly higher than those required for inactivation of B. cereus and C. difficile vegetative cells, where approximately 4 -log 10 CFU mL- 1 reductions were achieved after exposure to doses of 108 and 48 Jcm- 2, respectively. The significant increase in dose required for inactivation of <b>endospores</b> compared to vegetative cells is unsurprising due to the notorious resilience of these microbial structures. However, the demonstration that visible light of 405 -nm can induce a bactericidal effect against <b>endospores</b> is significant, and could have potential for incorporation into decontamination methods for the removal {{of bacterial}} contamination including <b>endospores...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ultrastructural {{observations}} of two Ophiostoma querci isolates {{presented in this}} paper showed <b>endospores</b> within hyphal cells and Sporothrix conidia.

25|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known {{bacterial}} adaptation to stress is the formation of endospores. Endospores are bacterial survival structures that are highly resistant to {{many different types of}} chemical and environmental stresses and therefore enable the survival of bacteria in environments that would be lethal for these cells in their normal vegetative form. It has been proposed that <b>endospore</b> formation has allowed for the survival of some bacteria for hundreds of millions of years (e.g. in salt crystals) although these publications have been questioned. <b>Endospore</b> formation is limited to several genera of gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium. It differs from reproductive spores in that only one spore is formed per cell resulting in no net gain in cell number upon <b>endospore</b> germination. The location of an <b>endospore</b> within a cell is species-specific and can be used to determine the identity of a bacterium. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound which composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores and is implicated in being responsible for the heat resistance of endospores. Archeologists have found viable endospores taken from the intestines of Egyptian mummies and also from sediment of over seven thousand years old taken from Minnesota's Elk Lake.|$|E
25|$|The cortex may osmotically remove {{water from}} the {{interior}} of the <b>endospore</b> and the dehydration that results is thought to be very important in the endospore's resistance to heat and radiation.|$|E
50|$|A novel {{method for}} the {{determination}} of the viability of rhinosporidial <b>endospores</b> by MTT-reduction led {{to the study of the}} sensitivity of <b>endospores</b> to biocides and anti-microbial drugs (paper in preparation for submission).|$|R
2500|$|Some {{classes of}} {{bacteria}} {{can turn into}} exospores, also known as microbial cysts, instead of <b>endospores.</b> Exospores and <b>endospores</b> {{are two kinds of}} [...] "hibernating" [...] or dormant stages seen in some classes of microorganisms.|$|R
40|$|Vegetative bacilli and refractile <b>endospores</b> of Bacillus subtilis 168 were {{disrupted}} by homogenization with glass beads and fractionated by differential centrifugation. Most of the protein of <b>endospores</b> was particulate, whereas for bacilli most was soluble. Alanine racemase activity was sixfold higher in extract of <b>endospores</b> than in extract of bacilli and was particulate, whereas the enzyme from bacilli was soluble. The specific activities of seven other enzymes involved in peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis were higher in extracts of bacilli {{than in those}} of <b>endospores.</b> The results suggest that restoration of activities of these seven enzymes to vegetative levels occurs during germination and outgrowth...|$|R
25|$|Outgrowth follows {{germination}} {{and involves}} {{the core of}} the <b>endospore</b> manufacturing new chemical components and exiting the old spore coat to develop into a fully functional vegetative bacterial cell, which can divide to produce more cells.|$|E
25|$|The <b>endospore</b> {{consists}} of the bacterium's DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of dipicolinic acid. Dipicolinic acid is a spore-specific chemical that appears {{to help in the}} ability for endospores to maintain dormancy. This chemical comprises up to 10% of the spore's dry weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the <b>endospore</b> differs among bacterial species and is useful in identification. The main types within the cell are terminal, subterminal, and centrally placed endospores. Terminal endospores are seen at the poles of cells, whereas central endospores {{are more or less}} in the middle. Subterminal endospores are those between these two extremes, usually seen far enough towards the poles but close enough to the center {{so as not to be}} considered either terminal or central. Lateral endospores are seen occasionally.|$|E
50|$|The Schaeffer-Fulton stain is a {{technique}} designed to isolate <b>endospores</b> by staining any present <b>endospores</b> green, and any other bacterial bodies red. The primary stain is malachite green, and the counterstain is safranin, which dyes any other bacterial bodies red.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Endospores</b> {{can survive}} without nutrients. They are {{resistant}} to ultraviolet radiation, desiccation, high temperature, extreme freezing and chemical disinfectants. Thermo-resistant <b>endospores</b> were first hypothesized by Ferdinand Cohn after studying Bacillus subtilis (pictured to the right) growth on cheese after boiling [...] the cheese. His notion of spores being the reproductive mechanism for the growth was a large blow to the previous suggestions of spontaneous generation. [...] Astrophysicist Steinn Sigurdsson said [...] "There are viable bacterial spores {{that have been found}} that are 40 million years old on Earth – and we know they're very hardened to radiation." [...] Common anti-bacterial agents that work by destroying vegetative cell walls do not affect <b>endospores.</b> <b>Endospores</b> are commonly found in soil and water, where they may survive for long periods of time. A variety of different microorganisms form [...] "spores" [...] or [...] "cysts," [...] but the <b>endospores</b> of low G+C gram-positive bacteria are by far the most resistant to harsh conditions.|$|R
500|$|<b>Endospores</b> show no {{detectable}} {{metabolism and}} can survive extreme {{physical and chemical}} stresses, such as high levels of UV light, gamma radiation, detergents, disinfectants, heat, freezing, pressure, and desiccation. In this dormant state, these organisms may remain viable for millions of years, and <b>endospores</b> even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space. According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, [...] "There are viable bacterial spores {{that have been found}} that are 40 million years old on Earth—and we know they're very hardened to radiation." [...] Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease: for example, anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis <b>endospores,</b> and contamination of deep puncture wounds with Clostridium tetani <b>endospores</b> causes tetanus.|$|R
25|$|Up to 20% of the {{dry weight}} of the <b>endospore</b> {{consists}} of calcium dipicolinate within the core, which is thought to stabilize the DNA. Dipicolinic acid could {{be responsible for the}} heat resistance of the spore, and calcium may aid in resistance to heat and oxidizing agents. However, mutants resistant to heat but lacking dipicolinic acid have been isolated, suggesting other mechanisms contributing to heat resistance are also at work. Small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs) are found in endospores. These proteins tightly bind and condense the DNA, and are in part responsible for resistance to UV light and DNA-damaging chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus {{is often}} {{associated}} with rust, especially rusty nails. Although rust itself does not cause tetanus, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbour anaerobic bacteria. Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides a habitat for C.tetani, while a nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body {{at the site of the}} wound. An <b>endospore</b> is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment may exist under the skin, and the puncturing object can deliver endospores to a suitable environment for growth.|$|E
25|$|Except in {{the case}} of some {{submerged}} aquatic plants, the mature pollen grain has a double wall. The vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered cellulose called the <b>endospore</b> or intine, and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of sporopollenin called the exospore or exine. The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as spinulose (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as echinate. Various terms also describe the sculpturing such as reticulate, a net like appearance consisting of elements (murus, muri) separated from each other by a lumen (plural lumina).|$|E

50|$|In {{bacteria}} (for instance, Azotobacter sp.), encystment occurs {{by changes}} in the cell wall; the cytoplasm contracts and the cell wall thickens. Bacterial cysts differ from <b>endospores</b> {{in the way they}} are formed and also the degree of resistance to unfavorable conditions. <b>Endospores</b> are much more resistant than cysts.|$|R
40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood monocytes readily phagocytized Coccidioides immitis <b>endospores</b> (2 to 5 microns) in vitro. Within 24 to 30 h at 37 degrees C, the phagocytized <b>endospores</b> started developing into immature spherules. However, when the monocytes were incubated with recombinant human gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma) or recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF-alpha) and then infected, fewer <b>endospores</b> developed into spherules. Treatment with rIFN-gamma or rTNF-alpha activated the fungicidal {{capabilities of the}} monocytes {{as evidenced by the}} significant reduction in CFU that could be recovered from rIFN-gamma- or rTNF-alpha-activated monocytes compared with nontreated controls...|$|R
2500|$|An <b>endospore</b> is a dormant, tough, and non-reproductive {{structure}} {{produced by}} certain bacteria from the Firmicute phylum. The name [...] "endospore" [...] is suggestive of a spore or seed-like form (endo means within), {{but it is}} not a true spore (i.e., not an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. <b>Endospore</b> formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients, and usually occurs in gram-positive bacteria. In <b>endospore</b> formation, the bacterium divides within its cell wall. One side then engulfs the other. Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries. Revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed. When the environment becomes more favorable, the <b>endospore</b> can reactivate itself to the vegetative state. Most types of bacteria cannot change to the <b>endospore</b> form. Examples of bacteria that can form endospores include Bacillus and Clostridium.|$|E
2500|$|Visualising endospores under light {{microscopy}} {{can be difficult}} due to the impermeability of the <b>endospore</b> wall to dyes and stains. While the rest of a bacterial cell may stain, the <b>endospore</b> is left colourless. To combat this, a special stain technique called a Moeller stain is used. That allows the <b>endospore</b> to show up as red, {{while the rest of}} the cell stains blue. Another staining technique for endospores is the Schaeffer-Fulton stain, which stains endospores green and bacterial bodies red. The arrangement of spore layers is as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Under {{conditions}} of starvation, especially {{the lack of}} carbon and nitrogen sources, a single <b>endospore</b> forms within some of the bacteria. The process is called sporulation (def). (Kaiser, 2011) ...|$|E
25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, <b>endospores</b> can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. <b>Endospores</b> are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as <b>endospores,</b> can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most <b>endospores.</b>|$|R

During this process, the bioaerosol is observed using in situ laser absorption and scattering diagnostics. Additionally, shock-treated samples are extracted for ex situ analysis including viability plating, flow cytometry and SEM imaging.

40|$|Pasteuria penetrans is an endospore-forming {{bacterial}} parasite of root-knot nematodes {{that has}} {{potential as a}} biological control agent.

Our objective {{was to develop a}} technique for extraction and purification of P. penetrans <b>endospores</b> from root-knot nematodes. Tomato roots infected with Meloidogyne arenaria that was parasitized by P. penetrans were digested with cytolase.
