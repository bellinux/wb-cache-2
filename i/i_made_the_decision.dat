500|$|There are {{contradictory}} claims {{as to who}} was {{the leader}} of the coup and had managed its execution, coming from Simović, Mirković, and Major Živan Knežević. Mirković claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that: [...] "Only after I had informed General [...] about my idea and he had accepted it did I make the decision to undertake the planned revolt. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> myself, and I also carried out the whole organization. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> as to when the revolt would take place." [...] It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an Italo-Yugoslav pact was signed. King Peter later credited simply the [...] "younger and middle ranks [...] of the Yugoslav army" [...] for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. Simović's response was published posthumously, he claimed that he [...] "stood {{in the center of the}} whole undertaking" [...] and [...] "personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirković for the action". Tomasevich considers Mirković's account to be the more credible of the two, and points out it is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis. The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon-to-be Yugoslav government-in-exile during the war.|$|E

Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in.

However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit.

He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E

In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time.
