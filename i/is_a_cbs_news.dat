40|$|SummaryThe {{cannabinoid}} CB 2 receptor {{is known}} to modulate osteoclast function by poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we report that the natural biphenyl neolignan 4 ′-O-methylhonokiol (MH) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor-selective antiosteoclastogenic lead structure (Ki < 50  nM). Intriguingly, MH triggers a simultaneous Gi inverse agonist response and <b>a</b> strong <b>CB</b> 2 receptor-dependent increase in intracellular calcium. The most active inverse agonists from a library of MH derivatives inhibited osteoclastogenesis in RANK ligand-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells and primary human macrophages. Moreover, these ligands potently inhibited the osteoclastogenic action of endocannabinoids. Our data show that CB 2 receptor-mediated cAMP formation, but not intracellular calcium, is crucially involved in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis, primarily by inhibiting macrophage chemotaxis and TNF-α expression. MH <b>is</b> <b>an</b> easily accessible <b>CB</b> 2 receptor-selective scaffold that exhibits a novel type of functional heterogeneity...|$|R
