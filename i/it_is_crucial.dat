5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> {{for these}} {{definitions}} that edges are only {{allowed to stay}} within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across {{the spine of the}} book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> that the court should not merely rely on international law to determine {{the meaning of the}} liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E

25|$|A {{life cycle}} {{analysis}} {{is only as}} valid as its data; therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> that data used for {{the completion of a}} life cycle analysis are accurate and current. When comparing different life cycle analyses with one another, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> that equivalent data are available for both products or processes in question. If one product has a much higher availability of data, it cannot be justly compared to another product which has less detailed data.|$|E

25|$|To {{achieve a}} {{low-cost}} net shape forging for demanding applications that {{are subject to}} {{a high degree of}} scrutiny, i.e. non-destructive testing by way of a dye-penetrant inspection technique, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> that basic forging process disciplines be implemented. If the basic disciplines are not met, subsequent material removal operations will likely be necessary to remove material defects found at non-destructive testing inspection. Hence low-cost parts will not be achievable.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, {{after the}} Malayan Union had been {{replaced}} by the semi-autonomous Federation of Malaya, UMNO shifted its focus to politics and governance. The Malay people thus search for their birth-rights since the government of Malaya did not proclaim it openly, resulting in a confusing situation. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> that UMNO's struggle is apparently not racial based. As they also fought for other races once they are {{at the helm of the}} country.|$|E
50|$|Popper {{argued that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> to avoid conventionalist stratagems if {{falsifiability}} {{of a theory}} was to <b>be</b> preserved. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> argued that the standard model of cosmology is built upon a set of conventionalist stratagems.|$|R
50|$|Aurora was a {{literary}} journal founded by Károly Kisfaludy in 1821. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> {{in the development}} of Romanticism in Hungarian literature, and in establishing Pest as {{a literary}} centre. The magazine adopted a progressive literary approach.|$|R
25|$|Díaz {{knew that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> {{for him to}} {{suppress}} banditry; he expanded the guardias rurales (countryside police), although it guarded chiefly only transport routes to major cities.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> that {{children}} are allowed to socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, children must be {{in an environment that}} allows them to communicate socially in that language. Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language.|$|E
25|$|Judicial {{independence}} in Singapore {{is protected by}} the Constitution, statutes such as the State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and the common law. Independence of the judiciary is the principle that the judiciary should be separated from legislative and executive power, and shielded from inappropriate pressure from these branches of government, and from private or partisan interests. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> as {{it serves as a}} foundation {{for the rule of law}} and democracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{point of}} release is the {{position}} of the ball in relation to the body at the moment when the ball is released. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> for the arm to be stiff, not bent, and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient bounce off the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble chucking. The left shoulder ought to be somewhat towards the stumps, the arm beside the bowler falling away, having just before this stage been pointing directly at the stumps.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall effect}} of 43 Group is unclear. Morris Beckman argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> in {{stopping}} {{a resurgence of}} fascism in post-war Britain. However, Nigel Copsey argues in Anti-Fascism in Britain that the fascists and anti-fascists might have only radicalised each other.|$|R

25|$|Matrix {{inversion}} {{also plays}} {{a significant role in the}} MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) technology in wireless communications. The MIMO system consists of N transmit and M receive antennas. Unique signals, occupying the same frequency band, are sent via N transmit antennas and are received via M receive antennas. The signal arriving at each receive antenna will be a linear combination of the N transmitted signals forming a NxM transmission matrix H. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> for the matrix H to be invertible for the receiver to be able to figure out the transmitted information.|$|E
25|$|Periphery {{countries}} are continuously exploited by countries {{due to the}} exportation of surpluses of raw goods to the more technologically industrialized core countries for manufacturing and distribution. Recently some of the manufacturing has been moved to periphery countries {{but it is still}} controlled and owned by the core countries. There are, however, ways in which periphery countries can rise from their poor status and become semi-periphery countries or even core countries. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> for the core countries to keep exploiting the natural resources of the periphery countries and to keep the governments semi-stable or else it could cause economic unrest for the core countries as a whole.|$|E
25|$|First and foremost, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> {{to realize}} that Iranian {{authorities}} insist on a long-term commitment and a transfer of technology as a requisite for getting {{a share in the}} market. Foreign companies are therefore advised to adopt a medium- to long-term strategy for the Iranian market. Iran will almost never honor the interests of a company that does not show long-term commitment. Tenders are strictly required for government contracts for purchasing or projects. These are rarely competitive. Breaking up contracts into smaller parts is a common practice to try to incorporate at least 30% of the contract's value in local capability and also to negotiate on specific prices.|$|E

25|$|Other {{possible}} {{complications that}} may arise include: pericarditis, endocarditis, left ventricular failure, valvulitis and fibrosis. Many people with RA do not experience the same chest pain that others feel {{when they have}} angina or myocardial infarction. To reduce cardiovascular risk, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to maintain optimal control of the inflammation caused by RA (which {{may be involved in}} causing the cardiovascular risk), and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to cardiovascular risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications, and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable.|$|E
25|$|Nance {{provides}} {{a discussion on}} suicide attacks, and stresses that in most cases those who commit suicide by bombing other individuals are generally not psychotic in nature. He emphasizes that these individuals {{are for the most}} part logical and smart people with extremist religious viewpoints. While not attempting to explain their acts, Nance notes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to comprehend terrorists' thought processes so that law enforcement officials may attempt to anticipate them. The book goes over common tactics used by clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents. Nance notes such organizations are a key component to terror operations, and require additional study. He gives forth an analysis of different types of clandestine cell systems, explaining common methodologies, covert communication methods, and from where they recruit their agents.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{detection}} experiments aim {{to observe}} low-energy recoils (typically a few keVs) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are {{passing through the}} Earth. After such a recoil the nucleus will emit energy as e.g. scintillation light or phonons, which is then detected by sensitive apparatus. In order to do this effectively <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from cosmic rays. Examples of underground laboratories which house direct detection experiments include the Stawell mine, the Soudan mine, the SNOLAB underground laboratory at Sudbury, the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, the Canfranc Underground Laboratory, the Boulby Underground Laboratory, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory and the China Jinping Underground Laboratory.|$|E
