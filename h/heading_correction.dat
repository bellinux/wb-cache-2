50|$|The {{angle is}} {{the angle of}} the wind or tide as it {{presents}} itself relative to the ship or aircraft, so if the wind is coming from the left at a relative angle of 30°, we use a sine of 0.5. Once the sine has been estimated, the drift due to wind or tide can be estimated accordingly by resolving the velocity of the wind or tide into a forward component and a sideways component. The sideways component is the windspeed x the sine, and the forward component is (1 - the sine) x windspeed (i.e. the cosine). Naturally we must apply these corrections to our groundspeed in the appropriate direction according to logic - a wind from the left will blow us off course in that direction; a headwind will slow our progress, a tailwind will increase it. Converting this back to a <b>heading</b> <b>correction</b> can be done using the 1 in 60 rule.|$|E

40|$|Hydroelectric {{reservoirs}} need to {{be managed}} carefully {{in order to maximize}} their benefits. Existing stochastic optimization approaches for making seasonal reservoir schedules often suffer from very high computing efforts, that grow exponentially with the problem size. This thesis investigates a relatively new approach to solve this problem, known as linear decision rules (LDR) approximation. Here, the decision variables are replaced with affine functions of the realizations of the uncertain parameters. The presented LDR optimization model takes uncertainty in price and multiple inflow series into account. Important considerations in hydropower scheduling, such as <b>head</b> <b>corrections</b> and finding water values, are also incorporated. The model is tested to find the applicability of LDR in the seasonal hydropower planning problem, and theoretical upper bounds are obtained to evaluate the quality of the solutions. The main result is that accuracy is traded expensively for tractability, as the solutions from the LDR-formulation are far from the upper bound. The solution values are also clearly beaten by a rolling intrinsic heuristic already in use in the industry. However, reasonable policies and water values are generated, and <b>head</b> <b>corrections</b> are easily included. Additionally, by reducing the number of realizations the decision rules are dependent on, very short computational times are achieved. Therefore, LDR are only a good fit if short running times are important...|$|R

In contrast to the traditional method of compass swinging, which computes a series of <b>heading</b> <b>correction</b> parameters and, thus, is limited to use with two-axis systems, this algorithm estimates magnetometer output errors directly. Therefore, this new algorithm {{can be used to}} calibrate a full three-axis magnetometer triad. The calibration algorithm uses an iterated, batch least squares estimator which is initialized using a novel two-step nonlinear estimator. The algorithm is simulated to validate convergence characteristics and further validated on experimental data collected using a magnetometer triad. It is shown that the post calibration residuals are small and result in a system with heading errors on the order of 1 to 2 degrees. ...|$|E

Another example is that of a convoy, in which only one vehicle (not necessarily the leading one) is instrumented with precision navigation instruments while all other vehicles use lower-precision instruments.

40|$|This article {{describes}} a simple monocular navigation {{system for a}} mobile robot based on the map-and-replay technique. The presented method is robust and easy to implement and does not require sensor calibration or structured environment, and its computational complexity is independent of the environment size. The method can navigate a robot while sensing only one landmark at a time, making it more robust than other monocular approaches. The aforementioned properties of the method allow even low-cost robots to effectively act in large outdoor and indoor environments with natural landmarks only. The basic idea is to utilize a monocular vision to correct only the robot's heading, leaving distance measurements to the odometry. The <b>heading</b> <b>correction</b> itself can suppress the odometric error and prevent the overall position error from diverging. The influence of a map-based heading estimation and odometric errors on the overall position uncertainty is examined. A claim is stated that for closed polygonal trajectories, the position error {{of this type of}} navigation does not diverge. The claim is defended mathematically and experimentally.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a {{nonlinear}} control has been de-signed using the dynamic inversion approach for automatic landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), along with associ-ated path planning. This {{is a difficult}} problem because of light weight of UAVs and strong coupling between longitudinal and lateral modes. The landing maneuver of the UAV is divided into approach, glideslope and flare. In the approach UAV aligns with the centerline of the runway by heading angle correction. In glideslope and flare the UAV follows straight line and exponential curves respectively in the pitch plane with no lateral deviations. The glideslope and flare path are scheduled {{as a function of}} approach distance from runway. The trajectory parameters are calculated such that the sink rate at touchdown remains within specified bounds. It is also ensured that the transition from the glideslope to flare path is smooth by ensuring C 1 continuity at the transition. In the outer loop, the roll rate command is generated by assuring a co-ordinated turn in the alignment segment and by assuring zero bank angle in the glideslope and flare segments. The pitch rate command is generated from the error in altitude to control the deviations from the landing trajectory. The yaw rate command is generated from the required <b>heading</b> <b>correction.</b> In the inner loop, the aileron, elevator and rudder deflections are computed together to track the required body rate commands. Moreover, it is also ensured that the forward velocity of the UAV at the touch down remains close to a desired value by manipulating the thrust of the vehicle. A nonlinear six-DOF model, which has been developed from extensive wind-tunnel testing, is used both for control design as well as to validate it. I...|$|E
40|$|Several crosswind-related {{incidents}} {{show that}} landing under heavy crosswind conditions {{can be challenging}} for pilots and may {{pose a threat to}} aviation or at least lead to higher pilot workload and/or irregularities in operations. For transport aircraft the common approach technique for crosswind landings is the so-called crabbed approach with wings level and a windward <b>heading</b> <b>correction.</b> This technique requires alignment of the aircraft with the runway prior to touchdown in order to keep lateral loads of the landing gear and tyres as low as possible and to maintain the controllability on ground after touchdown. The German Aerospace Center Institute of Flight Systems has used the idea of steerable main gears and developed a crosswind landing assistance system. During approach all gear struts are automatically aligned with the runway so that no decrab manoeuvre is required. On ground the assistance system uses each steerable landing gear, differential braking, and the aerodynamic control surfaces to control and stabilise the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft is automatically aligned with the runway centreline and the still existing crab angle is slowly reduced. A simulator study with pilots in the loop using a model of a typical medium range transport aircraft was conducted in order to evaluate the benefits of such a landing technique. The study revealed that not only the aircraft controllability could be improved by landing in crabbed motion under strong crosswind conditions, but that the side forces acting on the landing gear can be reduced significantly as well. It was also shown that the use of steerable main landing gears is able to enlarge the spectrum of autoland operations, which is relatively limited at present in terms of maximum allowable crosswinds. All together the system has shown to be able to improve flight safety, lower the risk of weatherrelated delays due to go-arounds or diversions, and it also reduces structural loads on the landing gear during touchdown and landing...|$|E

A foot-mounted inertial measuring units (IMUs) -based position estimation method, is aided by the received signal strengths (RSSs) obtained from several active RFID tags placed at known locations in a building. In contrast to other authors that integrate IMUs and RSS with a loose Kalman filter (KF) -based coupling (by using the residuals of inertial- and RSS-calculated positions), we present a tight KF-based INS/RFID integration, using the residuals between the INS-predicted reader-to-tag ranges and the ranges derived from a generic RSS path-loss model.

40|$|Autonomous {{navigation}} of {{a mobile}} robot is a challenging task. Much {{work has been}} done in indoor navigation in the last decade. Fewer results have been obtained in outdoor robotics. Since the early 90 's, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been the main navigation system for ships and aircrafts. In open fields, satellite navigation gives absolute position accuracy. The absolute heading information is also obtained by satellite navigation when the mobile robot is in motion. However, the use of GPS satellite navigation is mainly restricted to open areas where at least three satellites can be seen. For example, mobile robots working in underground or deep open mines cannot use satellite navigation at all, and in forest or city areas, there are serious limitations to its use. Laser range finder technology has evolved remarkably over the last decade, and offers a fast and accurate method for environment modeling. Furthermore, {{it can be used to}} define robot position and heading relative to the environment. It is obvious that the use of several alternative sensors according to the environment will make the navigation system more flexible. Laser range finder technology is particularly suitable for indoors or feature rich outdoor environments. The goal of this thesis is to develop a multi sensor navigation system for unknown outdoor environments, and to verify the system with a service robot. Navigation should be possible in unstructured outdoors as well as indoor environments. The system should use all available sensor information and emphasize those that best suit the particular environment. The sensors considered in this thesis include a scanning laser range finder, a GPS receiver, and a heading gyro. The main contribution of the thesis is a flexible navigation system developed and tested with a service robot performing versatile tasks in an outdoor environment. The used range matching method is novel and has not been verified earlier in outdoor environments. No unique solution can be guaranteed in the developed map matching algorithm, although it seems to work well in the practical tests. Position and heading errors grow without bound in successive map matchings, which could be referred to as laser odometry. Therefore, the position and heading have been corrected by means of global matching when the robot returns to a place it has previously visited. Alternatively, structured landmarks have been used for position and <b>heading</b> <b>correction.</b> In field tests, tree trunks and walls have been used as structured landmarks. When structured landmarks are not present, navigation has been based on counting the translation and rotation between two successive maps based on a scanning laser range finder. In featureless environments, the robot is able to switch automatically from laser based to satellite navigation. The biggest difference compared to other methods, such as iterative closest point, is that odometry is not needed since the matching is based on a global search. However, when included, mobile robot dynamics and odometry increase the reliability of the matching process. The flexibility of the navigation system presented here means that a mobile robot can enter different environments, and the system automatically selects an appropriate set of sensors for each particular environment. It additionally means that the system can work without landmarks, but if they exist, they will be used to improve navigation accuracy. This kind of flexibility in the navigation system is of the utmost importance when in the near future increasingly mobile robots will move out from structured indoor environments into unknown outdoor environments. reviewe...|$|E

With an introduction of Global Positioning System (GPS), the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system has seen a massive leap forward in technology. There has been talk of eliminating the current en route and approach navigation system utilizing VORs, NDBs and ILSs. That approach may have been premature.

Without WAAS, Free Flight crmaQt achieve its goal of t tmhg the u~rrent ATC system into more of a management role versus a control role.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This thesis {{addresses}} Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) {{control by}} leveraging learning based techniques to improve robustness {{of the control}} system. Applying classical control methods to MAVs is a difficult process due {{to the complexity of}} the control laws with fast and highly non-linear dynamics. These methods are mostly based on models that are diffcult to obtain for dynamic and stochastic environments. Due to their size, MAVs are affected by wind gusts and perturbations that push the limits of model based controllers where the linear approximation no longer holds. Instead, we focus on a control strategy that learns to map MAV states (e. g., heading, altitude, velocity) to MAV actions (e. g., actuator positions) to achieve good performance (e. g., flight time, minimal altitude and heading error) by maximizing an objective function. The main difficulty with this approach is defining the objective function and tuning the learning parameters to achieve the desired results. These learning based techniques have been used with great success in many domains with similar dynamics and are shown to improve MAV robustness with respect to wind gusts, perturbations, and actuator failure. Our results show significant improvements in response times to minor altitude and <b>heading</b> <b>corrections</b> over a traditional PID controller. In addition, we show that the MAV response to maintaining altitude in the presence of wind gusts improves by a factor of five.
