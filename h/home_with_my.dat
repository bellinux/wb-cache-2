500|$|Desolate {{and almost}} {{stripped}} of her belief, Marie {{turned to the}} religious teachings of the Bahá'í Faith, which she found [...] "vastly appealing". She was particularly attracted {{by the idea of}} humanity's unification under one faith, given her own religiously divided family. Introduced to the doctrine by Martha Root, Marie carried on a correspondence with Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Faith, where she expressed herself as a follower of the Bahá'í teachings. Additionally, she made several public statements promoting the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh, describing him as a prophet similar to Jesus or Muhammad. This written correspondence has led Bahá'ís to regard her as the first royal convert to their religion. Biographer Hannah Pakula notes that Marie [...] "continued to attend the Protestant Church", even though she [...] "prayed 'better at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> Baha-u-llah books and teachings.'" [...] In 1976, William McElwee Miller published a polemical book against the religion, which included selections from a letter written in 1970 by Marie's daughter Ileana denying any such conversion had taken place.|$|E
500|$|Lafourcade {{launched}} a promotional tour throughout Mexico and only performed at theaters {{that were at}} least 100 years old. The Village Voice, reporting on an interview with Lafourcade, noted, [...] "There are enough such grand old structures in her country to make this possible", although according to Lafourcade, [...] "some of them are better maintained than others." [...] The [...] "Hasta la Raíz Tour" [...] opened in Tijuana on April18, 2015, and also visited several cities in the United States such as San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In Hollywood, Lafourcade participated on the Latin Grammy Acoustic Sessions at the Fonda Theatre. A few dates in Argentina, Chile, Italy, and Spain were announced; however, her record label, Sony Music, announced that due to illness the performance in Spain, set for June, would be canceled. In September, Lafourcade performed at [...] "Festival DCODE 2015" [...] in Madrid, Spain. The singer also visited Colombia on October1, 2015, performing at Bogotá's Royal Center. On November4, 2015, Lafourcade fulfilled a long-held dream of performing {{for the first time}} at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. [...] "I've been here with Julieta Venegas, and someone reminded me that I opened for Juanes a few years ago. When I was 13 years old, I ran away from <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> best friend to come to the Auditorio Nacional to see Christina Aguilera, and I wanted to be on stage, longing to have this opportunity. After many years of work, this became a reality." [...] To further promote the album, Lafourcade became the first Mexican female singer-songwriter to record an acoustic session for the music streaming service Spotify. Titled Spotify Sessions, the live EP includes six tracks from Hasta la Raíz ("Para Qué Sufrir", the title track, [...] "Nunca Es Suficiente", [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer", [...] "Palomas Blancas", and [...] "No Más Llorar") and a cover version of Rafael Hernández's [...] "Silencio". Lafourcade performed [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2015. Lafourcade also presented the tour in a sold-out show held at the Teatro Cariola in Santiago de Chile, Chile on November 25, 2015.|$|E
