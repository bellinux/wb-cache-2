40|$|The Shuttle {{communications}} system consists of major space and ground elements. The compatibility {{and performance of}} each of these major elements functioning as a complete system must be certified prior to operational missions. This paper discusses the Shuttle communication systems compatibility and performance testing. The system test philosophy for the complex communication channels is described in terms of the major phases, which include early breadboard system <b>design</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>tests,</b> system development tests with prototype hardware, and system certification testing with qualifiable (flight) hardware. The system hardware configuration, facility requirements, test and evaluation techniques, and operational approaches required to accomplish each major phase of testing are reviewed. Results of recently completed space-to-space and space-to-ground system tests are presented. Test techniques and measurement accuracies proven over ten years of unique system-evaluation experience are reviewed. Techniques used in relating experimental and predicted system performance, and conclusions regarding the effectiveness of system level testing of such complex hardware, are addressed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} of the design considerations and the current status of the Miniature Optical Wide-Angle Lens Startracker Program. Mini-OWLS offers a revolutionary alternative to the conventional startracker. It is a small, lightweight, low cost, high performance startracker {{that can be used in}} a variety of applications including calibration and alignment of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU's) Mini-OWLS makes use of a strap down design incorporating Holographic Optical Elements (HOES) in place of conventional optics. HOES can be multiplexed so that the same aperture can be used for multiple separate optical paths looking in several directions simultaneously without startracker rotation. Additionally, separate Schmidt corrector plates are not required to compensate for spherical aberration. The optical assembly, or what would normally be considered as the telescope, is less than 20 cc in volume, weighs less than 55 grams, and contains the equivalent of three individual telescopes. Each one has a 4 deg Field of View (FOV) with a field of regard of 48 square degrees. Mini-OWLS has a bandwidth of approximately 300 nm in or near the visible wavelength. The projected resolution of the startracker is 5 to 10 arcseconds, depending on the centroiding algorithm used. The Mini-OWLS program was initiated last year and represents a miniaturized version of a similar design for aeronautical applications. The contract is managed by Wright Laboratory, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, with funding from the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization through Eglin AFB. The initial phase of the program is to build and test a development unit. The second phase is to integrate the startracker with the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory Micromechanical Inertial Guidance System (MIGS) and the Signal Processing Packaging Design (SPPD) being developed by Texas Instruments. The preliminary design review was conducted in November 1991. Three-axes prototype telescope assemblies have been built and <b>design</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>tests</b> initiated...|$|E

40|$|Flexible {{manufacturing}} system (FMS) {{design and}} implementation are lengthy and costly process. The lack of suitable reference models and connections between various development support tools further make the situation difficult. This paper addresses these problems by devising a generic flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) control software architecture, and an integrated development environment for FMC’s. The control software architecture consists of a three-layer hierarchy including the operation, networking and operating-system layer. This arrangement succeeds in separating the hardware and communication issues from the main FMC control applications. On the other hand, the proposed development environment integrates several development tools to support system development from <b>design,</b> <b>evaluation,</b> implementation, <b>testing</b> to deployment. Such a development environment streamlines FMS development process and saves both time and achieves better FMS design. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFPGAs are {{primarily}} digital devices and application designers {{have to follow}} the usual design methodologies of digital systems when they target FPGAs. Nevertheless, when the applications include cryptographic primitives these methodologies are not sufficient to achieve the security requirements of certification. The variability of parameters of the devices, due to electronic noises, aging, environmental fluctuations and CMOS/FLASH process variations, conduce to change the design methodologies and the designers have to consider analog phenomena during {{the design of the}} digital system. At the same time, the continuous {{increase in the number of}} research projects on hardware implementation of ciphers, true random number generators (TRNG) and physical unclonable functions (PUF) highlights their scientific and practical interest. But <b>design,</b> <b>evaluation</b> and <b>test</b> of such cryptographic primitives are arduous especially in FPGA when the designer doesn’t control all the design parameters and the estimation of entropy sources is tricky. This half-day tutorial will provide firstly an introduction to the physical phenomena for the security of digital integrated circuit including an introduction to the randomness generation (TRNG), to the device fingerprint (PUF) generation and to the protection of cryptographic primitives against physical attacks. Random numbers are crucial in cryptography: they are used as confidential keys, initialization vectors, nonces in challenge-response protocols, padding values, hardware identifiers, and as masks in side channel attack countermeasures. Random number generators (RNGs) and physical unclonable functions (PUF) must generate random numbers that have good statistical properties and the generated sequences must be impossible to predict and manipulate. To help FPGA designers with the TRNG/PUF <b>design</b> and <b>evaluation,</b> we will discuss the <b>design,</b> statistical <b>evaluation</b> and <b>tests</b> of TRNGs and PUFs when implemented in FPGA...|$|R
