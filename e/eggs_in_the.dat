5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E

5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain.|$|E
5|$|In {{colonies of}} the paper wasp, Polistes chinensis antennalis, workers can lay up to {{a quarter of the}} male <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony. The number of eggs that survived to hatching, however, was minimal {{compared}} to the number produced by the queen. Analysis of the microsatellite markers showed that both queens and workers contributed to policing of worker and queen-laid eggs even in monogynous and monandrous colonies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} oviparous {{like most other}} fish, laying their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water. In most oviparous shark species, an egg case with the {{consistency}} of leather protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. Once empty, the egg case {{is known as a}} mermaid's purse, and can wash up on shore. Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.|$|E

5|$|The Viduidae is {{a family}} of small {{passerine}} birds native to Africa that includes indigobirds and whydahs. All species are brood parasites, which lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nests of estrildid finches. Species usually have black or indigo predominating in their plumage.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} is {{socially}} monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood parasitism, where the female lays <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nest of others {{of their own}} species is common with nearly 40% of nests being parasitized on average. In terms of territory, this grebe will only defend its nest site.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E

5|$|The egg stage lasts a {{few weeks}} in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, {{especially}} in temperate regions, go through a diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring. Some temperate region butterflies, such as the Camberwell beauty, lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring and have them hatch in the summer.|$|E
5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E

5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the {{leatherback sea turtle}} (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
5|$|In the DVD commentary, Matt Groening {{notes that}} {{beginning}} any television series is difficult, {{but he found}} particular difficulty starting one {{that took place in}} the future because of the amount of setup required. As a trade off, they included a lot of Easter <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode that would pay off in later episodes. He and Cohen point these out throughout the episode. The scene where Fry emerges from a cryonic tube and has his first view of New New York was the first 3D scene worked on by the animation team. It was considered to be a defining point for whether the technique would work or not.|$|E

5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the <b>eggs.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} wasp, {{including}} especially the cuckoo or jewel wasps (Chrysididae), are kleptoparasites, laying their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nests of other wasp species to exploit their parental care. Most such species attack hosts that provide provisions for their immature stages (such as paralyzed prey items), and they either consume the provisions {{intended for the}} host larva, or wait for the host to develop and then consume it before it reaches adulthood. An example of a true brood parasite is the paper wasp Polistes sulcifer, which lays its <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nests of other paper wasps (specifically Polistes dominula), and whose larvae are then fed directly by the host. Sand wasps Ammophila often save time and energy by parasitising the nests of other females of their own species, either kleptoparasitically stealing prey, or as brood parasites, removing the other female's egg from the prey and laying their own in its place. According to Emery's rule, social parasites, especially among insects, tend to parasitise species or genera {{to which they are}} closely related. For example, the social wasp Dolichovespula adulterina parasitises other members of its genus such as D. norwegica and D. arenaria.|$|E
