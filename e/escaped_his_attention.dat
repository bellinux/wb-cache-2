60|$|At {{these latter}} words the girl shivered again, {{and for a}} moment paused in her rowing, seeming to turn deadly faint. It <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> for he was glancing over the stern at {{something}} the boat had in tow.|$|E
60|$|With {{increasing}} animation {{he stated}} again that I had missed his point. Entirely. And {{in a tone}} of growing self-conscious complacency he told me that few things <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> and he was rather used to think them out, and generally from his experience of life and men arrived at the right conclusion.|$|E
5000|$|Though Vanbrugh is {{best known}} in {{connection}} with stately houses, the parlous state of Londons 18th century streets did not <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> In the London Journal of 16 March 1722-23, James Boswell comments: ...|$|R
60|$|Courthorne {{appeared}} {{to consider a}} moment, {{and there was a}} curious little glint in his eyes which did not <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> companion's <b>attention,</b> but he laughed.|$|R
5000|$|Here is {{the letter}} that Dr. Theobald Smith wrote to Dr. White as [...] "health officer" [...] at Uxbridge. In 1889 and 1893, Dr. Theobald Smith made discoveries which implicated cattle ticks as the {{necessary}} developmental host of the causal agent of Texas cattle fever. The question of what caused malaria {{and how it was}} transmitted did not <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> In 1896, he wrote this letter to one Dr. White of Uxbridge, Massachusetts which {{was in the midst of}} a malaria outbreak.|$|R
60|$|He was {{preparing}} for bed, with something like renewed cheerfulness, when a sealed letter fell from his coat pocket. In the hurry of leaving London, it had <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> and had not occurred to him since, but it at once brought back to him the recollection of the mysterious behaviour of Newman Noggs.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of his climbings Dave {{presently}} came to a new turn, one which had before <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> This turn led upward and gave him fresh hope. But, just as he fancied that he was getting close to the outer air, he reached a flat wall, and further progress in that direction was out of the question.|$|E
60|$|Wilder turned, impatiently, {{and found}} that the {{landlord}} had entered the room, with a step so as to have <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> which had been drawn to his companion with a force that the reader will readily comprehend. The air of surprise, with which Joram regarded the speaker, was certainly not affected; for the question was repeated, and in still more definite terms, before he saw fit to reply.|$|E
60|$|How many the appreciative ladies consumed, {{the muse}} saith not; but the {{susceptible}} {{heart of the}} great garçon was deeply touched, and it was with difficulty that they finally <b>escaped</b> from <b>his</b> <b>attentions.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{an annual}} $2500 salary, he was Norwalk's first {{full-time}} mayor. He sold his {{business to be}} able to put in a full day's work at City Hall. No aspect of city government was too small to <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> He often exercised his ex officio authority on city boards and commissions, which is granted to the mayor under the city charter, but had rarely been used. He was known to be seen on top of the Department of Public Works snowplows as they cleared the streets after a winter storm.|$|R
50|$|Fonblanque {{was called}} to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, London, 26 November 1816 having kept the {{necessary}} terms at Lincoln's Inn during his residence at Cambridge. The next year Lord Eldon appointed {{him one of the}} then seventy commissioners of bankruptcy. The abuses and imperfections of the bankruptcy system did not <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> and long before law reform became fashionable he published a pamphlet on the subject. Having attracted the notice of Lord Brougham as a law reformer Fonblanque was appointed one of the original Commissioners of the newly instituted Court of Bankruptcy.|$|R
60|$|The {{individual}} to whom Lowten alluded, was a little, yellow, high-shouldered man, whose countenance, from his habit of stooping forward when silent, Mr. Pickwick had not observed before. He wondered, though, {{when the old}} man raised his shrivelled face, and bent his gray eye upon him, with a keen inquiring look, that such remarkable features could have <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> for a moment. There was a fixed grim smile perpetually on his countenance; he leaned his chin on a long, skinny hand, with nails of extraordinary length; and as he inclined {{his head to one}} side, and looked keenly out from beneath his ragged gray eyebrows, there was a strange, wild slyness in his leer, quite repulsive to behold.|$|E
60|$|Just as le Bourdon fancied {{that the}} crisis had arrived, {{and that he should}} soon be called on to kill his man, a shout was given by a savage at some {{distance}} in the river, and presently calls passed from mouth to mouth, among the swimmers. Our hero now listened to a degree that kept his faculty of hearing at a point of painful attention. The voices and plashes on the water receded, and what was startling, a sound was heard resembling that which as produced by a paddle when struck incautiously against the side of a canoe. Was it then possible that the Chippewa was out, or had the Pottawattamies one boat that had <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention?</b> The last was not very probable, as he had several times counted their little fleet, and was pretty sure of having taken it all {{to the other side of}} the river. The sound of the paddle was repeated, however; then it occurred to the bee-hunter, that Pigeonswing might be on the scent for another scalp.|$|E
6000|$|These various {{writings}} raise {{many points}} of interest regarding M. Comte's personal history, and some, not without philosophic bearings, respecting his mental habits: from all which matters we shall abstain, {{with the exception of}} two, which he himself proclaimed with great emphasis, and a knowledge of which is almost indispensable to an apprehension of the characteristic difference between his second career and his first. It should be known that during his later life, and even before completing his first great treatise, M. Comte adopted a rule, to which he very rarely made any exception: to abstain systematically, not only from newspapers or periodical publications, even scientific, but from all reading whatever, except a few favourite poets in the ancient and modern European languages. This abstinence he practised for the sake of mental health; by way, as he said, of [...] "hygiène cérébrale." [...] We are far from thinking that the practice has nothing whatever to recommend it. For most thinkers, doubtless, {{it would be a very}} unwise one; but we will not affirm that it may not sometimes be advantageous to a mind of the peculiar quality of M. Comte's--one that can usefully devote itself to following out to the remotest developments a particular line of meditations, of so arduous a kind that the complete concentration of the intellect upon its own thoughts is almost a necessary condition of success. When a mind of this character has laboriously and conscientiously laid in beforehand, as M. Comte had done, an ample stock of materials, he may be justified in thinking that he will contribute most to the mental wealth of mankind by occupying himself solely in working upon these, without distracting his attention by continually taking in more matter, or keeping a communication open with other independent intellects. The practice, therefore, may be legitimate; but no one should adopt it without being aware of what he loses by it. He must resign the pretension of arriving at the whole truth on the subject, whatever it be, of his meditations. That he should effect this, even on a narrow subject, by the mere force of his own mind, building on the foundations of his predecessors, without aid or correction from his contemporaries, is simply impossible. He may do eminent service by elaborating certain sides of the truth, but he must expect to find that there are other sides which have wholly <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> However great his powers, everything that he can do without the aid of incessant remindings from other thinkers, is merely provisional, and will require a thorough revision. He ought to be aware of this, and accept it with his eyes open, regarding himself as a pioneer, not a constructor. If he thinks that he can contribute most towards the elements of the final synthesis by following out his own original thoughts as far as they will go, leaving to other thinkers, or to himself at a subsequent time, the business of adjusting them to the thoughts by which they ought to be accompanied, he is right in doing so. But he deludes himself if he imagines that any conclusions he can arrive at, while he practises M. Comte's rule of hygiène cérébrale, can possibly be definitive.|$|E
50|$|His research, {{to which}} he devoted many years of his life, solved the {{cardinal}} problems of anthropology of the contemporary population of the Caucasus; {{the results of his}} investigations became widely known in the scientific world. He was a born scientist, and, owing to his exceptional purposefulness, his numerous works covered almost all the geographical problems of Georgia: geomorphology, cartography, the geographical distribution of the population, problems dealing with various peculiarities of the land and its people, and the varied terrain of the country; neither did the history of geography of Georgia <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|R
40|$|The myth of Apollo and Daphne recounts how {{the deity}} Apollo pursues the human Daphne until she is turned by an outside force into a laurel tree to <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attentions.</b> This thesis {{will look at}} some of the {{different}} views on the Apollo and Daphne story from its very beginnings until the end of the English Renaissance. This will be illustrated through Edmund Spenser’s Amoretti, Sonnet XXVIII, Thomas Carew’s “A Rapture” and “A Discription of the Stone” which can be found in Elias Ashmole’s collection of alchemical writings...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{his skill}} as a slash and dash murderer {{there have been}} {{sightings}} {{over the years and}} only five women have <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attentions.</b> He is given his name by the mask he wears, which is grey sackcloth sewn together. His mask is further complemented by a beautiful wig of brown hair. His face is seen only briefly in the beginning, when he speaks to Marey Woolbury. He is described as handsome with brown hair and a moustache, and gentle eyes. However, when he is not wearing his mask, his face is usually hidden by his coat and top hat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tower was}} sold in 1835 to James Kay (1774-1857), who had {{harnessed}} steam power and developed the first commercially successful wet-spinning process for flax in 1825. Kay restored the tower and few rooms in {{the main part of}} the Tower <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> but his valuable work was marred by his inability to resist the temptation to 'restore' what has never been there in the first place. James Kay sold the tower to Elizabeth and Anne Appleton who leased the tower to William Rigg, a calico manufacturer, whose daughter, Ellen, wrote her memories of Turton now published as [...] "Victorian Children at Turton Tower".|$|E
5000|$|He lifted The Wife of his Youth {{from its}} {{place on the}} table and opened its pages for the {{hundredth}} time. How much he admired the cool deliberation of its style, the sense of form, but more than all the civilized mind of this man who had surveyed the problems of his race from an Olympian height and had turned them into living and artistic drama. Nothing seemed to have <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> from the lowly life of the worker on the Southern plantation to the snobbery of the near whites of the north. Chesnutt had surveyed the entire field, calmly setting down what he saw, what he thought and felt about it.|$|E
50|$|Louis {{eventually}} {{tired of}} his fruitless attempts to pry the Dutch {{loose from the}} Grand Alliance, and turned his attentions to Great Britain. It had not <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> that great political changes had taken place there. Though Queen Anne was less partial than William III to the Whigs, she had soon discovered that she could as yet not govern with sole support of the Tories and had since the early experiments with a Tory government had a moderate Tory government with Whig support under Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin and the Whig-leaning Marlborough. However, Marlborough's wife Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, who had been Queen Anne's favorite for a long time, thereby giving her husband an informal powerbase, had had a falling-out with the Queen over Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham, Sarah's poor relative, who had replaced her in the Queen's favor. After that, Sarah's star declined and with it her husband's. Instead the star of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (Abigail's cousin) went into the ascendant, especially after the Tories won the parliamentary elections in 1710.Harley formed a new government with Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke as Secretary of State and this new government entered into secret negotiations with Louis XIV to conclude a separate peace between Great Britain and France. These negotiations soon achieved success as Louis was prepared to make great concessions (he basically offered the same concessions he had offered to the Dutch, and some more, like the port of Dunkirk as surety for his good intentions) and the new British government did not feel constrained to respect the interests of its Allies in any sense.|$|E
50|$|Norcom {{sexually harassed}} Harriet {{when she came}} of age. He refused {{to allow her to}} marry, {{regardless}} of the man's status. Hoping to <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attentions,</b> Jacobs took Samuel Sawyer, a free white lawyer, as a consensual lover. Sawyer was later elected {{as a member of the}} US House of Representatives. With Sawyer, she had two children, Joseph and Louisa. Because she was enslaved, their biracial children were born into slavery and Norcom was their master. Harriet later wrote that Norcom threatened to sell her children if she refused his sexual advances, but she continued to evade him.|$|R
5000|$|In 1938, after graduating, Patience {{travelled}} {{with her}} sister Tania to Eastern Europe, under {{a grant from the}} Quakers, who wanted to promote friendships with the Romanians. The sisters were there when Queen Marie, a grand-daughter of Queen Victoria, died in July. The lavishness of the funeral rites prompted Patience to write her first piece of journalism, which appeared in a Bucharest paper. Its editor became infatuated by Patience, filling her hotel room with tuberoses, the scent of which, she said, always filled her with remembered horror. Tania and Patience <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> by fleeing to the Black Sea in a monoplane piloted by a Romanian prince.|$|R
60|$|In this {{selfish and}} cruel {{calculation}} upon the supposed attachment of Ravenswood to Lucy, {{he was so}} far from considering the pain he might give to the former, by thus dallying with his affections, that he even did not think upon the risk of involving his own daughter in the perils of an unfortunate passion; as if her predilection, which could not <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> were like the flame of a taper which might be lighted or extinguished at pleasure. But Providence had prepared a dreadful requital for this keen observer of human passions, who had spent his life in securing advantages to himself by artfully working upon the passions of others.|$|R
60|$|He {{was aware}} {{that he had made}} a slip, but fancied it had <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> companion's <b>attention,</b> which, of course, {{displayed}} very little perspicacity. In the meanwhile, he got a turn of the weather tiller line round a cleat, and lowered himself further until he sat in the cockpit with several inches of water swishing about him.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} hotel, {{satisfied}} on the whole, {{though he had}} sacrificed a dollar or two an acre {{and there was an}} element of danger in what he had done. The sale of the land must be registered, and the date would be two or three days after the one on which Jernyngham was killed. The latter's homestead was, however, a long distance off, there was only one small weekly newspaper published in the district, and it was very probable that the agent would not hear of the affair until some time had elapsed, and then might not attach any importance {{to the fact that the}} victim's name was that of his customer. Even if he did so, the small discrepancy in the dates would, no doubt, <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> Wandle did not think he had much cause for uneasiness.|$|R
50|$|In 420-422, another Maximus (or {{perhaps the}} same) gained and lost power in Hispania. By {{the time of}} Honorius’s death in 423, Britain, Spain and large parts of Gaul had {{effectively}} passed into barbarian control. In his final years, Honorius reportedly developed a physical attraction to his half sister, {{and in order to}} <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> unwelcome <b>attentions,</b> Galla Placidia and her children, the future emperor Valentinian III and his sister, Honoria, fled to Constantinople.|$|R
60|$|THE {{sun shone}} pleasantly warm, {{and a soft}} wind sighed among the branches, when Violet Wayne pulled up her ponies where {{the shadows of the}} firs fell athwart the winding road that dipped to Northrop valley. There had been a shower, and a sweet {{resinous}} fragrance came out of the dusky wood. Godfrey Palliser, who sat by the girl’s side, however, shivered a little, and buttoned the big fur‐trimmed coat that lay loose about him, which did not <b>escape</b> <b>his</b> companion’s <b>attention.</b>|$|R

50|$|According to Ronald Pearsall {{the story}} {{reflects}} the novel sexual opportunities afforded by railway travel in Victorian England, {{focused on the}} erotic opportunities of a male passenger in a railway carriage, who, unusually for the period, finds himself alone with an unchaperoned woman, and the sexual perils of the lady in question who cannot <b>escape</b> from <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> or summon help from a closed carriage (corridors between carriages being a later innovation). The passage of the train through dark tunnels adds another frisson {{to the possibility of}} erotic adventure on the rails.|$|R

At a young age, he helped his {{grandmother}} sell balut, penoy, and other goods. He finished his high school education in Sorsogon. As a kid, he was very thin and was often bullied; as a way of <b>escape,</b> he focused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> on basketball.|$|R

Spider-Man manages to fight them off until he is shot with a Sonic Blaster device, which weakens him. Despite this, Spider-Man manages to <b>escape,</b> and focuses <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> on Eddie Brock and Jonah Jameson and warns him to call off his reward, also mentioning Rhino and how Brock neglected to mention him. After Jonah visits his hospitalized son, Jameson finds out from him that Brock was lying and fires him. He also calls off the manhunt for Spider-Man.|$|R
60|$|During the momentous {{five minutes}} {{occupied}} in these private movements, Raoul affected to be gaping about in vulgar astonishment, examining the guns, rigging, ornaments of the quarter-deck, etc.; though, in truth, nothing that passed among those near him <b>escaped</b> <b>his</b> vigilant <b>attention.</b> He was uneasy at {{the signs of}} the times, and now regretted his own temerity; but still he thought his incognito must be impenetrable. Like most persons who fancy they speak a foreign language well, he was ignorant, too, in how many little things he betrayed himself; the Englishman, cateris paribus, usually pronouncing the Italian better than the Frenchman, on account of the greater affinity between his native language and that of Italy, in what relates to emphasis and sounds. Such was the state of mind of our hero then, as he got an intimation that the captain of the ship wished to see him below. Raoul observed as he descended the ladder, to comply with what sounded very much like an order, that he was followed by the two Elban functionaries.|$|R
5000|$|Francis {{was from}} his {{experiences}} suspicious {{and set up}} an extensive network of police spies and censors to monitor dissent (in this he was following his father's lead, as the Grand Duchy of Tuscany had the most effective secret police in Europe). [...] Even his family did not <b>escape</b> <b>attention.</b> <b>His</b> brothers, the Archdukes Charles and Johann had their meetings and activities spied upon. [...] Censorship was also prevalent. The author Franz Grillparzer, a Habsburg patriot, had one play suppressed solely as a [...] "precautionary" [...] measure.
