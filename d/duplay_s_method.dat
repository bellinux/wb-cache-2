40|$|In this paper, an Improved Fourier Five-Sensor (IF 5 <b>S)</b> {{measurement}} <b>method</b> {{is proposed}} for separating the straightness and yawing motion errors {{as well as}} determining {{the profile of a}} linear slide. The previous F 5 <b>S</b> <b>method</b> [3] used the constant parameters initially to estimate the profile function based on three sensor equations for different angle ranges. The profile estimation and error separation are implemented via an iterative method which can only yield acceptably accurate results with tremendous computational efforts.

From this view point the experiments were carried out and the results may be summarised as follows :- 1) Glucose was determined in a pure glucose solution, blood, and artificial mixed solutions by the methods of Benedict, Folin-Wu, Folin, Hagedorn, Shaffer-Hartmann, and Bang, among which the former three are colorirnetric methods and the latter three titration methods. 2) In the case of pure glucose solution, it was found that all the methods afford correct results at their standard concentration, but they show more or less errors when the concentration is deviated from the standard. Among the methods examined, Hagedorn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> showed the smallest amount of error. 3) Benedict 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> requires the largest quantity of sample for determination and Bang 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> the smallest. 4) The treatment of the colorimetric methods is generally simple but that of the titration methods more complex. 5) When blood was used as a sample, Bang 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> afforded the smallest result of sugar and Benedict method the lafgest, the order being as follows Benedict > Folin-Wu > Hagedorn > Folin > Shaffer-Hartmann > Bang 6) The results obtained in the mixed solutions were as follows :? a) Every method is effected by the addition of cystine in the samples, the effect being the largest in Bang 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method.</b> b) The addition of sodium sulfide g ives too high results in Folin-Wu 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> but too low results in Bang 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method.</b> Other methods are little effected. c) The addition of sodium phosphate gives too low results in Benedict 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> but shows little influence upon the other methods examined. 7) From the results of experiments I {{came to the conclusion that}} Hagedorn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> is the most reliable. 1) BENEDICT, FOLIN-WU, SHAFFER-HARTMANN, BANG 及び HAGEDORN の各方法を用ゐて純葡萄糖溶液, 血液, 及人工混合溶液に於て葡萄糖を定量したり。 2) 純葡萄椿溶液に於ける實驗に依れば何れの方法も標準濃度の砂糖を含有する場合には正確なる價を與ふるも標準濃度以外に於ては何れも多少の誤差は免れず但し HAGEDORN-JENSEN 法は最も誤差少なるが如し。 3) 所要供試料の最少なるは BANG 法にして最大なるは BENEDICT 法なり。 4) 一般に比色法は操作簡單にして滴定法は複雜なり。 5) 血液に於て行ぴたる定量結果は BANG 法は最小にして BENEDICT 法は最大なりき其の順位は BANG < SHAFFER-HARTMANN = FOLIN < HAGEDORM < FOLIN-WU < BENEDICT 6) Cystin の添加に依りて何れの方法も影響を被る其の影響の頗る大なるは BANG 法なり。 7) 硫化曹達の添加は FOLIN-WU の方法に過大なる結果を生じ BANG の方法には過少なる結果を與ふ他の方法には影響殆んどなし。 8) 燐酸曹達の添加は BENEDICT 法に過少なる結果を與へ他の方法には多少の影響あり。 9) HAGEDORN-JENSEN の方法は Cystin 及鹽類の影響を被る事比較的少に最良法と考ふる事を得べし...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{improved}} Fourier eight-sensor (F 8 <b>S)</b> measurement <b>method</b> for separating the straightness, yawing and rolling motion errors {{as well as}} determining {{the profile of a}} linear slide. The previous F 8 <b>S</b> <b>method</b> [1] used the constant parameters C 2 and C 4 to estimate the profile function f 1 (θ) in different angle ranges and f 2 (θ) is also computed with the same fused sensor data. By constant parameters, the profile estimation and error separation are implemented via iterative method which is a time-consuming procedure and can not maintain the acceptable accuracy. Here, the improved F 8 <b>S</b> <b>method</b> applies the matrix technique instead of the iterative method to estimate the profile functions by three distinct sets of C 2 and C 4 parameters and different fused sensor data according to the linear slide motion within different angle ranges. Furthermore various errors can be separated through simple equations based on the calculated profile functions. In the second part of this paper the uncertainty induced by the sensor reading error is analyzed in both frequency and spatial domains, and the uncertainty for the profile function can also be obtained.
