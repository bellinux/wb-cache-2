I was told that Protestantism still survived in this <b>head</b> <b>seat</b> of Protestant resistance; so much the priest himself had told me in the monastery parlour. But I had yet to learn if it were a bare survival, or a lively and generous tradition. Again, if in the northern Cevennes the people are narrow in religious judgments, and more filled with zeal than charity, what was I to look for in this land of persecution and reprisal--in a land where the tyranny of the Church produced the Camisard rebellion, and the terror of the Camisards threw the Catholic peasantry into legalised revolt upon the other side, so that Camisard and Florentin skulked for each other's lives among the mountains? ...|$|E

5000|$|Muirchú {{has also}} been credited, along with others, most notably Tirechan, with helping to {{establish}} Armagh as the <b>head</b> <b>seat</b> of the church through his writings in his Vita Patricii. Armagh held a powerful position in the Irish church from the early Middle Ages onward. There are no sources earlier than Muirchú and Tirechan’s works that suggest Patrick had a special connection with Armagh. This goal of making Armagh head {{of the church is}} evident throughout the entire Vita, where numerous references are made to Armagh. Most scholars agree that this was an attempt to compete with Cogitosus and his attempts to establish Kildare as head of the church. Cogitosus had written a Life of Saint Bridget, much in the same style as Muirchú’s Vita and the hagiographies were used to contest supremacy for their separate churches. According to Muirchú, Patrick founded his main church at Armagh, and stated in his work that Armagh was beloved by Patrick. In the Vita, Muirchú writes that Patrick intended to die in Armagh, and though an angel convinced him not to specifically go there, the angel stated that Patrick’s ‘pre-eminence’ would be at Armagh.|$|E
5000|$|... 1 (prose): Noys {{displays}} the created universe to Natura {{and points out}} its various features.2 (verse): With the work of Noys, Silva has recovered her true beauty. Noys (still speaking to Natura) declares herself proud of the harmony she has brought to the universe.3 (prose): Noys says that for {{the completion of the}} cosmic design, the creation of man is needed. For this it is necessary that Natura seek out Urania (the celestial principle) and Physis (the material principle). Natura sets forth and searches through various regions of the heavens. When she reaches the outermost limit of the heavens, she encounters the Genius whose responsibility it is to delineate the celestial forms on the individual objects of the universe. He greets Natura and points out Urania, whose brightness dazzles Natura.4 (verse): Urania agrees to descend to Earth and collaborate in the creation of man. She will take with her the human soul, guiding it through all the heavens so that it may become acquainted with the laws of fate and learn the rules that govern its behavior.5 (prose): To gain the sanction of the divine powers, Natura and Urania travel outside the cosmos, to the sanctuary of the supreme divinity, Tugaton (the Good; Greek [...] ), whose favor they pray for. They then descend, one by one, through the planetary spheres.6 (verse): Having reached the lower boundary of the sphere of the Moon, where the quintessence meets the terrestrial elements, Natura pauses to look about her.7 (prose): Natura and Urania see thousands of spirits. Urania tells Natura that, in addition to the angels who dwell beyond the created universe and in the heavenly spheres, there are spirits below the Moon—some good, some evil.8 (verse): Urania bids Natura to review the totality of the universe and note the principles of divine concord that it manifests.9 (prose): Natura and Urania descend to Earth and reach a secluded locus amoenus (called Gramision or Granusion—the readings of the manuscripts are disputed). There they meet Physis, accompanied by her daughters Theorica (Contemplative Knowledge) and Practica (Active Knowledge), who is rapt in contemplation of created life in all its aspects. Suddenly, Noys appears.10 (verse): Noys explains that Natura, Urania, and Physis can collaborate to complete the creation by fashioning a creature who participates in both the divine and earthly realms.11 (prose): Noys assigns Urania, Physis, and Natura specific tasks in the creation of man, providing a model for each. Urania, using the Mirror of Providence, is to provide him with a soul derived from Endelechia; Physis, using the Book of Memory, is to provide him with a body; and Natura, using the Table of Destiny, is to unite the soul and the body.12 (verse): Natura summons her two companions to begin the work. Physis, however, is somewhat angry, since she sees that matter is ill suited for the fashioning of a being that requires intellect. Urania assists her by eliminating the evil taint from Silva and containing the matter within definite limits.13 (prose): Physis—making use of the imperfect aspects of Silva that had (somewhat uncertainly) submitted to the will of God and had been left over from the rest of creation—fashions a body. The four humors are described, along with the tripartite division of the body into the <b>head</b> (<b>seat</b> of the brain and the sensory organs), the breast (seat of the heart) and the loins (seat of the liver).14 (verse): The powers of the senses and the brain, heart, and liver are detailed. The organs of generation will prevent human life from wholly passing away and the universe from returning to chaos.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—CFD {{analysis}} is useful tool to optimise the intake port design for better breathing {{performance of the}} engine. Volumetric efficiency {{is expected to increase}} if the optimum mass flow rate is achieved in the combustion chamber. Virtual flow bench is the best evaluation technique to validate the CFD analysis, so that the time required for the product design can be very well reduced. Flow bench test rig is compared with the CFD virtual analysis results. The calculation is carried out for different stage of valve lift. The flow coefficient and swirl ratio are measured from it. Both CFD and flow bench test measurement are compared and for its accuracy, methodology has been developed for the future development. In the combustion chamber the important part is to increase the performance of the intake port. The importance of the port flow effects the performance of the engine and also the engine efficiency. The instantaneous valve flow area depends on valve lift, the geometric details of the valve <b>head</b> <b>seat</b> and valve stem. II.

40|$|The Hybrid III 6 -year-old ATD {{has been}} benchmarked against adult-scaled {{component}} level tests {{but the lack}} of biomechanical data hinders the effectiveness of the procedures used to scale the adult data to the child. Whole body kinematic validation of the pediatric ATD through limited comparison to post mortem human subjects (PMHS) of similar age and size has revealed key differences attributed to the rigidity of the thoracic spine. As restraint systems continue to advance, they may become more effective at limiting peak loads applied to occupants, leading to lower impact environments for which the biofidelity of the ATD is not well established. Consequently, there is a growing need to further enhance the assessment of the pediatric ATD by evaluating its biofidelity at lower crash speeds. To this end, this study compared the kinematic response of the Hybrid III 6 year old ATD against size-matched male pediatric volunteers (PVs) (6 – 9 yrs) in low-speed frontal sled tests. A 3 -D near-infrared target tracking system quantified the position of markers at seven locations on the ATD and PVs (head top, opisthocranion, nasion, external auditory meatus, C 4, T 1, and pelvis). Angular velocity of the <b>head,</b> <b>seat</b> belt forces, and reaction forces on the seat pan and foot rest were also measured. The ATD exhibited significantly greater shoulder and lap belt, foot rest, and seat pan normal reaction loads compared to the PVs. Contrarily, PVs exhibited significantly greater seat pan shear. The ATD experienced significantly greater head angular velocity (11. 4 ± 1. 7 rad/s vs. 8. 1 ± 1. 4 rad/s), resulting in a quicker time to maximum head rotation (280. 4 ± 2. 5 ms vs 334. 2 ± 21. 7 ms). The ATD exhibited significantly less forward excursions of the nasion (171. 7 ± 7. 8 mm vs. 199. 5 ± 12. 3 mm), external auditory meatus (194. 5 ± 11. 8 mm vs. 205. 7 ± 10. 3 mm), C 4 (127. 0 ± 5. 2 mm vs. 183. 3 ± 12. 8 mm) and T 1 (111. 1 ± 6. 5 mm vs. 153. 8 ± 10. 5 mm) compared to the PVs. These analyses provide insight into aspects of ATD biofidelity in low-speed crash environments...|$|E

25|$|Initial hip {{designs were}} made of a {{one-piece}} femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate head piece. Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some <b>heads</b> <b>seat</b> more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.|$|R
