40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportFemale {{carpenter}} {{bees are}} wood-destroying insects that build individual gallery nests in exposed, dry wood. Although solitary, these bees may nest in aggregations, especially since offspring sometimes complete their lifecycle {{close to where}} they were born. Combined with possible damage from foraging woodpeckers, extensive carpenter bee tunneling can result in aesthetic damage to wood and reduce its structural integrity. For management of this insect, pest professionals apply insecticidal dusts to gallery openings, which kills adult bees and offspring, as well as secondary pests that may occupy used galleries. However, several online resources provide instructions for Do-It-Yourself carpenter bee traps made of scrap wood and plastic bottles that may prevent structural damage and the reactionary use of insecticide applications. This preliminary field study evaluated the use of carpenter bee traps to determine if they are effective at catching females (the sex that creates tunnels and reproduces). Twelve carpenter bee traps were hung at six sites in Westchester County, yielding a total of 54 carpenter bees: 21 males, 33 females. Twenty-seven of these bees were from a single, heavily infested site, where residents noted a dramatic decrease in bee activity as a result of trapping. However, 148 non-target arthropods were collected in traps, including blow flies, <b>European</b> <b>paper</b> <b>wasps</b> (Polistes dominula), yellowjacket queens, and especially Monobia quadridens, demonstrating the non-selective nature of traps. A proposed method to reduce by-catch is to only deploy traps in the spring during gallery building...|$|R

5000|$|Wasps of the {{cosmopolitan}} genus Polistes (the only genus in {{the tribe}} Polistini) {{are the most}} familiar of the polistine wasps, and {{are the most common}} type of paper wasp in North America. It is also the single largest genus within the family Vespidae, with over 300 recognized species and subspecies. Their innate preferences for nest-building sites leads them to commonly build nests on human habitation, where they can be very unwelcome; although generally not aggressive, they can be provoked into defending their nests. All species are predatory, and they may consume large numbers of caterpillars, in which respect they are generally considered beneficial. The <b>European</b> <b>paper</b> <b>wasp,</b> Polistes dominula, was introduced into the US about 1981 and has quickly spread throughout most of the country, in most cases replacing native species within a few years. This species is very commonly mistaken for a yellow jacket, as it is black, strongly marked with yellow, and quite different from the native North American species of Polistes. The cuckoo wasp, Polistes sulcifer, is an obligate social parasite, whose only host is P. dominula. Polistes annularis, whose species name is Latin for [...] "ringed", is also known for its distinctive red body color. Polistes metricus adults malaxate their insect prey by chewing them into a pulp, sucking out and ingesting the body fluids, then feeding the rest of the morsel to their larvae. The most widely distributed South American wasp species, Polistes versicolor, is particularly common in the southeastern Brazilian states. This social wasp is commonly referred to as the yellow paper wasp due to the distinct yellow bands found on its thorax and abdomen. Polistes wasps can be identified by their characteristic flight; their long legs dangle below their bodies, which are also more slender than a yellow jacket.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundVes v 5 and Pol d 5, which {{constitute}} antigen 5, {{are recognized}} as the major, most potent allergens of family Vespidae. Several studies have reported the diagnostic sensitivity of the novel recombinant (r) Ves v 5 and rPol d 5 allergens in routine clinical laboratory settings by analyzing a group of Vespula and Polistes venom-allergic patients. In this study, we analyzed the sensitivity to venom specific (s) IgE by spiking with rVes v 5 and rPol d 5 in Japanese patients suspected of Hymenoptera venom allergy. MethodsSubjects were 41 patients who had experienced systemic reactions to hornet and/or <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> stings. Levels of serum sIgE against hornet and <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> venom by spiking with rVes v 5 and rPold d 5, respectively, as improvement testing, compared with hornet and <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> venom, as conventional testing, were measured by ImmunoCAP. ResultsOf the 41 patients, 33 (80. 5 %) were positive (≥ 0. 35  UA/ml) for hornet and/or <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> venom in conventional sIgE testing. sIgE levels correlated significantly (P <  0. 01) between hornet (R =  0. 92) or <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> venom (R =  0. 78) in improvement testing and conventional testing. To determine specificity, 20 volunteers who had never experienced a Hymenoptera sting were all negative for sIgE against these venoms in both improvement and conventional testing. Improved sensitivity was seen in 8 patients negative for sIgE against both venoms in conventional testing, while improvement testing revealed sIgE against hornet or <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> venom in 5 (total 38 (92. 7 %)) patients. ConclusionsThe measurement of sIgE following spiking of rVes v 5 and rPol d 5 by conventional testing in Japanese subjects with sIgE against hornet and <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> venom, respectively, improved the sensitivity for detecting Hymenoptera venom allergy. Improvement testing for measuring sIgE levels against hornet and <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> venom has potential for serologically elucidating Hymenoptera allergy in Japan...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of social}} insect invasions {{to date have}} focused {{primarily}} on highly eusocial insects such as ants and yellowjacket wasps. Yet insect societies without fixed, morphological caste systems may be particularly good invaders due to their behavioral flexibility, {{as demonstrated by the}} recent invasion of the <b>European</b> <b>paper</b> <b>wasp</b> Polistes dominulus into North America. Here we provide a review of this ongoing invasion in terms of (1) population genetic variation in P. dominulus, and (2) comparative behavior and ecology of P. dominulus vs. the native P. fuscatus. We present new genetic evidence supporting the occurrence of multiple independent introductions of P. dominulus into the USA, confirming previous results demonstrating relatively high genetic variation in introduced populations. We also present behavioral and demographic evidence suggesting that P. dominulus is displacing the native P. fuscatus in at least part of its range, most likely due to the superior productivity and survivorship of P. dominulus colonies. We review data from comparative studies where the two species are sympatric and discuss possible mechanisms contributing to the differences between them. Finally, we discuss the ecological impacts of this invasion and the role of P. dominulus as a model organism for invasion biology...|$|E
40|$|An {{invasive}} species is a nonnative organism that may cause damage to an ecosystem. Invasive species cause problems {{in an environment}} by outcompeting native organisms for resources or by feeding upon native species. Invasive insects in particular can harm an ecosystem by consuming foliage and decreasing biodiversity.

My project portrays an aesthetically pleasing visualization of several di erent species of invasive insects. I have created six acrylic paintings depicting six di erent invasive insects: the Asian Longhorned Beetle, Brown Marmorated Stink Bug, Emerald Ash Borer, <b>European</b> <b>Paper</b> <b>Wasp,</b> Japanese Beetle, and Spotted Lantern y. All species are considered invasive insects in the United States and are known to cause ecological damage. All paintings are 16 ”x 16 ” and completed on plywood.
