5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date <b>for</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> in the east. He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they applied only to Germany. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E

5000|$|Garver {{argues that}} the Chinese {{correctly}} assessed Indian border policies, particularly the Forward Policy, as attempts for incremental seizure of Chinese-controlled territory. On Tibet, Garver argues {{that one of the}} major factors leading to China's decision for war with India was a common tendency of humans [...] "to attribute others behavior to interior motivations, while attributing their own behavior to situational factors". Studies from China published in the 1990s confirmed that the root cause <b>for</b> China <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with India was the perceived Indian aggression in Tibet, with the forward policy simply catalysing the Chinese reaction.|$|R
25|$|Many {{adherents of}} the 9/11 Truth {{movement}} suspect that United States government insiders {{played a part}} in the attacks, or may have known the attacks were imminent, and did nothing to alert others or stop them. Some within the movement who argue that insiders within the United States government were directly responsible for the September 11 attacks often allege that the attacks were planned and executed in order to provide the U.S. with a pretext <b>for</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> in the Middle East, and, by extension, as a means of consolidating and extending the power of the Bush Administration.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} of all presidential powers is the command of the United States Armed Forces as its commander-in-chief. While the power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, the president has ultimate responsibility for direction and disposition of the military. The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces (belonging to the Department of Defense) is normally exercised through the Secretary of Defense, with assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Combatant Commands, as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP). The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explains this in Federalist No. 69: Congress, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual. Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. While historically presidents initiated the process <b>for</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war,</b> critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the invasions of Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1990.|$|E

An Iranian government spokesman described the film as [...] "hostile behavior which is the result of cultural and psychological warfare".

50|$|The Port of Southampton {{is a major}} {{passenger}} {{and cargo}} port located in {{the central part of}} the south coast of England. It has been an important port since the Roman occupation of Britain nearly two thousand years ago, and has a multifaceted history. From the Middle Ages to the end of the 20th century, it was a centre for naval shipbuilding and a departure point <b>for</b> soldiers <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> The port also played a role in the development of hovercraft, flying boat services, seaplanes and the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the advent of jet travel, Southampton was Britain's gateway to the world. The port also played a minor role in the history of Britain's canals.|$|R
5000|$|Two of {{the major}} factors leading up to China's {{eventual}} conflicts with Indian troops were India's stance on the disputed borders and perceived Indian subversion in Tibet. There was [...] "a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian efforts to undermine Chinese control of Tibet, Indian efforts which were perceived as having the objective of restoring the pre-1949 status quo ante of Tibet". The other was [...] "a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian aggression against Chinese territory along the border". John W. Garver argues that the first perception was incorrect based {{on the state of}} the Indian military and polity in the 1960s. It was, nevertheless a major reason <b>for</b> China's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> However, he argues the Chinese perception of Indian aggression to be [...] "substantially accurate".|$|R
50|$|The Atharvaveda Samhita {{contains}} hymns many {{of which}} were charms, magic spells and incantations meant to be pronounced by the person who seeks some benefit, or more often by a sorcerer who would say it on his or her behalf. The most frequent goal of these hymns charms and spells were long life of a loved one or recovery from some illness. In these cases, the affected would be given substances such as a plant (leaf, seed, root) and an amulet. Some magic spells were <b>for</b> soldiers <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with the goal of defeating the enemy, others for anxious lovers seeking to remove rivals or to attract the lover who is less than interested, some for success at a sporting event, in economic activity, for bounty of cattle and crops, or removal of petty pest bothering a household. Some hymns were not about magic spells and charms, but prayer qua prayer and philosophical speculations.|$|R

On 9 August, Bildt compared Russia's reason <b>for</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with Georgia to Adolf Hitler's actions, [...] "No state {{has the right to}} intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state. Attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged Europe into war in the past... And we have reason to remember how Hitler used this very doctrine little {{more than half a century}} ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central Europe".|$|E

Unlike her more combat-loving brothers, Temari values peace, as she {{questions}} Sunagakure's justifications <b>for</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with Konohagakure. This trait carries over to Part II, in which she begins acting as a liaison between Sunagakure and Konohagakure to help the two villages work together.

In battle, Temari wields a giant iron fan that can create powerful gusts of wind capable of leveling the surrounding landscape. As she is skilled at deducing an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins, she typically uses her winds to remove parts of the battlefield that might be advantageous to the enemy.

A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date <b>for</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> in the east. Goebbels {{was one of the most}} enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: [...] "ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing." [...] In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing [...] "war panic" [...] in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{chapters}} {{have focused}} on the mineralogically complex and structurally simple silver-uranium-base metal vein deposits in the Erzgebirge, such as Joachimsthal, which were relatively easy to find and mine. We now turn our attention to the tin mines, which could not be more different. The various deposit types exploited by the medieval Saxon miners illustrate the sophisticated prospecting, mining, and metallurgical skills that they had developed by the sixteenth century. Today, tin is just another alloy metal, like titanium or beryllium, and many geologists and mining engineers may never see a tin mineral outside a museum. Until the appearance of hard steel during the Industrial Revolution, tin held a similar strategic importance to that held by oil today because it is a vital component of bronze. Bronze was used to manufacture the first hard, corrosion-free metallic tools such as shovels, axes, chisels, and hammers, as well as weapons, ewellery, burial items, and bell metal. It became an indispensable commodity, worth scouring the world <b>for</b> and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> over, and t occupies a special place in the history of mining, economic geology, agriculture, warfare, art, and human development. Gold and silver could finance a war, but bronze could win it. The metal is even mentioned several times in the Bible; for example, “I will turn my hand upon thee, and purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin ” (Isaiah 1 : 25) ...|$|R
50|$|George Leslie {{was born}} in 1842, two years after his parents arrived in America from England. Early into his childhood, his father moved the family from their home of New York City to Cincinnati, Ohio. Leslie’s father started his own brewery there, and the {{business}} made their family wealthy. Following the move to Cincinnati, Leslie began his education towards becoming an architect in local schools. While in school, he came of age to be drafted into the Civil War, and Leslie’s father paid three-hundred dollars so {{he did not have}} to go. Despite their family’s high social standing, he was criticized <b>for</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> and upholding his community’s expectations. Putting the criticism behind him, Leslie went on to get a degree in architecture, and graduated at the top of his class at the University of Cincinnati. After graduating, he ran his own architectural firm in Cincinnati. Both of his parents died in 1867, which made him sell the family home, brewery, and his architectural firm, then he headed east to New York City. When Leslie arrived in New York City, he was met by the repercussions of the Civil War. The city was overcrowded, and the rate of crime was high. The corrupted politicians and police left the city to the many gangs that occupied it. Not long after his arrival, Leslie fell into the criminal lifestyle of the gangs. Due to his architectural skills, he quickly went to the top of the ranks in the criminal world.|$|R
40|$|During the {{intervention}} debate of the 2003 Iraq War, irreconcilable foreign-policy positions led to fierce transatlantic and inner-European disputes. The present analysis starts on the decisive pre-war-phase, which was essential for legitimising the Iraq War and explores, how identity ascription {{is used to}} develop a legitimising potential for foreign-policy actions, in addition to factual reasoning. The present study focuses on three discursive occurrences {{within the framework of}} the Iraq War debate: Donald Rumsfeld’s statement concerning “Old and New Europe”, the “Letter of the Eight” and after the official war’s end, the much debated contribution by Juergen Habermas, co-signed by Jacques Derrida, on “Our Renewal: After the War, Europe’s Rebirth”. Altogether 758 articles published in major German, US-American, Spanish and British print media constitute the base sample for a qualitative analysis paying special attention to key concepts used during the discourse events. Within the scope of the chosen discourse, all identity ascriptions and self-attributions, as well as factual arguments <b>for</b> and against <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> were classified and analysed regarding their legitimising potential. This thesis is a contribution to constructivist discourse analysis, scrutinising the importance of identity ascription, in order to legitimise foreign-policy actions. Once factual criteria had proven to be non-conclusive, identity rhetoric was increasingly applied in discourse. By using the example of {{the intervention}} discourse of the Iraq War it is illustrated to what extent ideational factors as regards to identity ascriptions may influence foreign-policy strategies...|$|R

U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, who had opposed the Kosovo War and would soon oppose the invasion of Iraq, voted to authorize military action against Afghanistan, although he would later characterize it as a [...] "disaster", a [...] "nightmare", and [...] "counterproductive". U.S. Representative Cynthia McKinney, speaking on September 24, acknowledged that [...] "We must find and hold accountable all those who perpetrated those most terrible crimes against our nation and its people", but denounced what she saw as impending [...] "suspensions of fundamental civil liberties" [...] and said that she was [...] "greatly concerned that we are about to engage in an extremely hazardous military campaign of unknown duration, with unrealistic objectives and perhaps even ultimately harmful long-term consequences for our nation", adding, [...] "Already there is growing disquiet in the Muslim world that the U.S. is poised to turn its terrorist campaign into a war against Islam." [...] Indian leftist writer Arundhati Roy, writing on September 29, strongly condemned both the attackers who had [...] "blown a hole in the world as we knew it" [...] and Bush <b>for</b> reacting by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> against Afghanistan: [...] "President Bush's ultimatum {{to the people of the}} world - 'If you're not with us, you're against us' - is a piece of presumptuous arrogance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to investigate the}} relationship between unique external events, such as news stories and the Superbowl, and the sensitivity of film demand. The initial hypothesis was that unique external events would reduce consumers’ leisure time which reduces their demand for movies. Understanding this relationship would provide movie studio managers with better information when making decisions. The desired end result was to improve the decision making process. Closely related to unique external events are seasonal events so their effects were also tested for. These events typically increase leisure time so we expected seasonality to increase movie demand. The first step towards reaching a conclusion involved the accumulation of the appropriate data. Our sample consists of the top 60 films and their specific characteristics from April 2000 until November 2003, a 189 weekend time period. This information was complemented by historical film performance data which would serve as a benchmark in our analysis. Lastly, a list of events whose effects were to be measured was compiled. To test our hypothesis several forms of analysis were performed. A parsimonious regression analyzed the effect unique external events had on overall weekend results. An average based model regression examined the average performance differences for a weekend while controlling for certain film specific variables. A movie specific regression examined how events affect film demand on a movie by movie basis. The results of our analysis suggest that unique external events do negatively affect film demand. For large national events, <b>for</b> instance <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war,</b> this effect was proven to be statistically significant, and it was estimated to decrease revenues by $ 21 million over an entire weekend. However, events not classified as “national” that were included in the other categories of news, sports, weather, and other holidays did not prove as conclusive. They may have affected film demand, but this effect was not large enough to be considered statistically significant. Seasonality, meanwhile, always demonstrated an observable increase in film demand at a statistically significant level. Our lack in ability to make more detailed conclusions is a shortcoming of this analysis and indicates the need for further research. Properly addressing these shortcomings should provide the quality of results needed to make good decisions. One difficulty we encountered was how to select and group the unique external events that were to be tested. There was no hard and fast rule as to which events should be included within the analysis. Grouping the unique external events into subgroups allowed us to better understand the difference between events and their effects. Our analysis highlights the importance of how each type of event differed. Proper analysis would include a larger amount of data so the specific effects of each type of event can be quantified. This level of information detail is needed before decisions can be significantly improved. As it stands now there is only incomplete information from which decisions can be made, yet this is still better than no information at all. In conclusion, this research project can be considered a success due to the results it was able to achieve and the improvements its shortcomings will have on future research. Managers will be better prepared to make decisions that react to unique external events. By understanding how the events affect film demand, managers will seek to minimize any decrease it causes. The film decision making process will be improved {{as a result of this}} information...|$|R

2500|$|Congress has an {{important}} role in national defense, including the exclusive power to declare war, to raise and maintain the armed forces, and to make rules for the military. Some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped Congress's constitutionally defined task of declaring war. While historically presidents initiated the process <b>for</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>war,</b> they asked for and received formal war declarations from Congress for the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the Spanish–American War, World War I, and World War II, although President Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903 did not get congressional approval. In the early days after the North Korean invasion of 1950, President Truman described the American response as a [...] "police action". According to Time magazine in 1970, [...] "U.S. presidents [...] ordered troops into position or action without a formal congressional declaration a total of 149 times."
