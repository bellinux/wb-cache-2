5|$|Pest {{control is}} the {{regulation}} or management {{of a species}} defined as a pest, {{a member of the}} animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest.

5|$|Many {{insects are}} {{considered}} pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include {{those that are}} parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce insecticides, but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control, or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered {{a key element of}} <b>integrated</b> <b>pest</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an <b>integrated</b> <b>pest</b> <b>management</b> programme.|$|E
5|$|Two {{kinds of}} control {{measures}} have been advocated since the 19th century. One aims at total pest population reduction, while the other is aimed at protection of the particular crop. , <b>integrated</b> <b>pest</b> <b>management</b> (IPM), an array of techniques and approaches to control pests, was recommended. Practices such as deep ploughing, mechanical destruction, and trap crops are also used to kill different instars. Chemical control is widely successful, and includes the use of applying mineral oil inside the tip of each corn ear, which suffocates the young larvae. Pesticides are one method by which corn earworm populations are controlled; however, since they have been widely used, the insects have become resistant to many pesticides. The use of biological controls, such as the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and various forms of nematodes, is also common, although not without their own problems. Corn earworm moths are not always vulnerable to the bacterium, and they are only afflicted by nematodes once the larvae have pupated and dropped to the ground.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we compare two {{different}} chemical treatments to control adults of chestnut weevils (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) in two-year period (2001 - 2002). Curculio elephas (Gyll.) and Curculio propinquus (Desbr.) are the insect key pests of chestnut in Monti Cimini area (Viterbo, Italy). The second {{one is the}} most dangerous. The active ingredients (a. i.) used are the Rotenone and Lambda-cyalothrine.

30|$|The {{attractive}} {{characteristics of}} Stethorus for mite biological control were their prey consumption, longevity, and high reproductive capacity (Biddinger et al. 2009). Hence, {{there is an}} immediate need for further studies on biology and ecology, with special preference on their predatory potential and effects of miticides or pesticides. These studies are {{necessary in order to}} promote them as a potential biological control agent on mites. There is a need for better knowledge of their requirements, including utilization of alternative foods, refuges for dormancy and from nonselective pesticides, and host-finding mechanisms as stated by Biddinger et al. (2009). These studies would help in <b>integrating</b> <b>pest</b> <b>management</b> strategies with inclusion of S. aptus as one of the biocontrol agent in management of European red mite among temperate fruits crops.|$|R
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, <b>integrated</b> <b>pest</b> <b>management</b> attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E

However thyme and oregano oil treated plots showed statistically lower values. Plant vegetative status, including phytosanitary aspects, had the same trend as the production as showed by the exponential regression between two parameters.
