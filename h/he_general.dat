Dange {{played an important role}} in bringing the labor activists amongst Bombay textile workers under the communist umbrella. Girni Kamgar Mahamandal was split and the communists formed their own union, the Girni Kamgar Union during the general strike of 1928.

500|$|The {{degree to}} which {{individuals}} {{are involved in the}} New Age varies. Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of [...] "serious part-timers" [...] who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of [...] "casual part-timers" [...] who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life. MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are [...] "consultative" [...] practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are [...] "serious" [...] practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are [...] "non-practitioner consumers", individuals affected by <b>he</b> <b>general</b> dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them. Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll for instance revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.|$|E

As more families came houses were built along Via Bologna, Via Salerno, Via Rosarno, and to the corner of Via Magazzini, as well as the Church of the Forgiveness (Chiesa del Perdono). The small one-story houses, which were organized around a courtyard, included a bedroom, kitchen, pantry and toilet and were made of volcanic stone sent by boat from the Aeolian Island of Lipari by Marquis, Don Francesco Barresi, father of General Nunziante. Some of these still remain standing, despite the progress of reconstruction in the center of town.|$|E

He got up from the log and went to one of our guns, a 12-pound Napoleon, Corporal Tommie Johnson, gunner, and remarked to him, I think you are shooting rather too high, and sighted the gun himself. He returned to a little knoll within a few feet of the log on which I was still sitting and was standing erect, his field glasses to his eyes, watching for the effect of the shot from our gun when he received the fatal wound not from a splinter from a shell, however, but from a solid shot. It is true that a horse was killed by the same missile and I noticed that the horse was dead some time before <b>he</b> <b>General</b> ceased to breathe, though he was unconscious.|$|E

However using his binoculars he soon identified them as being British, and so immediately ordered that the anti-tank mines be removed from the road. The four scout vehicles, commanded by Captain Wrottesley of No.5 Troop, C Squadron, the 2nd Household Cavalry, had been able to break through the German defences north of Nijmegen under the cover of fog, and they encountered the Polish bicycle patrol soon a few hours before arriving at Driel." [...] For leading his troop of armoured cars through the German lines, and establishing contact with the Polish Parachute Brigade on the south bank of the River Rhine, Wrottesley won his Military Cross. [...] Some years later Dick Wrottesley met the officer commanding the German tanks to whom he had given the slip. The German informed Dick's then wife, Mary, that: [...] "I went to Berlin to get a blast from Hitler, and Dick went to get a medal from the King." [...] He retired from the Army in 1950.|$|E
