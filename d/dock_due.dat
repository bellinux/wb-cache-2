5|$|The {{importance}} of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886, {{the year in}} which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea. The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond, and ships became too big for the port. The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971, and although they now house a marina they are currently little used. The surrounding quays have been developed for housing, although the remains of wooden quays on the riverbank can still be seen. All but a small remnant of the mump (a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations) was removed in the 1980s {{to make way for the}} development on the north side of the <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to the port, ship building was also an important industry, and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century by companies including David Williams, Joseph Gough, Watsons and William Lowther. F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town— the Irene. The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street.|$|E
25|$|Everton are {{currently}} looking to relocate. The club have had previously raised the subject before in 1996, and in 2003 {{were forced to}} scrap plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's <b>Dock</b> <b>due</b> to financial reasons. The latest plan has been to move beyond Liverpool's council boundary to Kirkby, but this has proved controversial with some fans, as well {{as members of the}} local community. At one point there was much talk for Everton to ground-share with Liverpool, at the proposed new Stanley Park Stadium, but this was not progressed by either club.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{originally}} {{planned to be}} registered in Finland, with Mariehamn painted on the hull as the home port when the ship was floated out of dry <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to difficulties in negotiations with the Finnish Seamen's Union and the generally higher personnel expenses under Finnish flag, the company decided to move the ship under Swedish flag in January 2008. In March 2008 Norrtälje in Sweden was revealed as the port of registry. But from 24 January 2014 Viking XPRS started sailing under Estonian flag, as it cuts costs for Viking Line. Because of that the ship got a new Estonian crew {{and all of the}} signs were replaced from Swedish to Estonian and English. The new home port is Tallinn.|$|E
50|$|Multihulls {{have more}} {{complicated}} conventional <b>docking</b> <b>due</b> to their wider beam. The beam requires a wider area for construction and dry dock {{and a larger}} haul-out ramp.|$|R
50|$|Four further {{locomotives}} {{were constructed}} in 1896 as replacements for the B4 class 0-4-0T dock shunters at Southampton <b>Docks</b> <b>due</b> to their increased coal and water capacity and enhanced power.

50|$|In May 2012, Sergio Ermotti, Group CEO, {{spoke at}} the UBS AGM about the changes {{implemented}} following the scandal. Ermotti spoke of improved internal monitoring and deficiencies in the financial reporting control system that have been addressed. Ermotti also made reference to employees that have been replaced or had pay <b>docked</b> <b>due</b> to serious mistakes or unreasonable behaviour.|$|R
500|$|Thousands of {{soldiers}} and civilians rushed for the sea, where hundreds drowned {{trying to reach the}} ships that could not <b>dock</b> <b>due</b> to the low tide. Thousands more died under the continuous communist artillery barrage. Of the government's four infantry divisions, four Ranger groups, armored brigade, air division, and thousands of Territorial, support, and staff personnel, only around 16,000 were pulled out as the communists swept in on 29 March. Of the almost two million civilians that packed Da Nang at the end of March, a little more than 50,000 were evacuated during the sea lift. Left behind were 70,000 South Vietnamese troops taken prisoner by northern forces. Also abandoned were 33 undamaged Air Force A-37 jet fighters at Da Nang and nearly 60 more aircraft at Phu Cat Air Base. During the fall of Da Nang no pitched battles had been fought and few of the South Vietnamese troops stationed in and around the city had even raised their rifles in its defense. In quick succession the few remaining centers of resistance along the coastline [...] "fell like a row of porcelain vases sliding off a shelf": Quảng Ngãi on 24 March; Qui Nhơn and Nha Trang on 1 April; and Cam Ranh Bay on 3 April.|$|E

25|$|Dan Stapleton of PC Gamer {{praised the}} {{versatility}} {{of the strategic}} zoom, and expressed his loathing of the next game that wouldn't feature it. The dual-screen mode was highly regarded, the mission design was praised, and the emotional presence of the story was also recognized. However, a few points were <b>docked</b> <b>due</b> to the general lack of diverse unit types, and the game's system requirements. It received a PC Gamer Editor's Choice Award with a score of 91%.|$|R
50|$|Piglets can be {{subjected}} to castration, tail docking to prevent tail biting, teeth clipping, and earmarking and tattooing for litter identification. Treatments are usually made without any pain killers. Weak runts could be killed shortly after birth. Injections with a high availability iron solution often are given, as sow's milk is low in iron. The <b>docking</b> <b>due</b> to tail biting is a common practice in intensive rearing facilities as animals in that environment {{are more prone to}} increased levels of aggression and instability.|$|R
50|$|In late August 2013, the ROC {{government}} {{announced that it}} would spend US$112 million on upgrading the island's airstrip, and constructing a dock capable of allowing its 3,000-ton Coast Guard cutters to <b>dock,</b> <b>due</b> to be completed by 2016.|$|E

50|$|The Tweed Dock officially {{opened in}} October 1876, {{replacing}} the older port {{on the north}} {{bank of the river}} which had become inadequate. Following improvement works in 1993 vessels with a maximum beam of 16 metres are now able to enter the <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to its geographical location the port primarily handles cargoes linked to the agricultural industry, with fertilisers, malting barley, feed barley and oilseed rape the principal commodities.|$|E

50|$|After the {{emancipation}} {{many of these}} slaves came to England, {{and it was not}} uncommon to see coloured people in Liverpool who bore a mark identifying them as having once been on the servitude of the Tobins. John became Mayor of Liverpool in 1819 and was knighted on the ascension of George IV to the throne. On 19 July 1821, George IV's Coronation Day, Prince's Dock was opened, and the Tobins ship, May, was the first ship which entered and in honour of the occasion she was exempted from paying Town or <b>Dock</b> <b>Dues.</b>|$|R
50|$|Solovyev {{commanded}} the mission, with Savinykh as his flight engineer, while Bulgarian Aleksandr Panayatov Aleksandrov flew {{as a research}} cosmonaut. Aleksandrov was the second Bulgarian to fly in space, the first being Georgi Ivanov, who flew on Soyuz 33. Ivanov failed to reach the Salyut 6 space station as his mission was aborted prior to <b>docking</b> <b>due</b> to an engine failure aboard his spacecraft Soyuz 33. As a result, prior to EP-2, Bulgaria was the only Eastern European Soviet ally to not have one of its citizens visit a Soviet space station.|$|R

5000|$|The Royal Navy Headquarters (RNHQ) Merseyside is on Brunswick Dock, which {{includes}} the HMS Eaglet establishment of the Royal Naval Reserve.

50|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the bridge in 1966, an automobile-carrying passenger ferry service had operated at this location, but the docks had rotted and silt had filled in the areas where the large ferryboats, if their service was to be restored, would need to <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to a dredging restriction in place because of Kepone contamination, it was not feasible to restore the automobile-carrying ferry service, although a similar operation was still serving about 35 mi downstream at the Jamestown Ferry.|$|E
50|$|Progress M1-7 was {{launched}} by a Soyuz-FG carrier rocket from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Launch occurred at 18:24:12 GMT on 26 November 2001.

It {{was unable to}} establish a hard <b>dock</b> <b>due</b> to debris from Progress M-45 on the docking port, {{which had to be}} removed in an unscheduled extra-vehicular activity on 3 December, after which it was able to establish a hard dock.|$|E
