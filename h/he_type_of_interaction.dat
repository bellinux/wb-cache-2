40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{identification}} of the relationship between gender representations and subject-environment interactions using the example of TV and the Internet. Among the considered interactions are object, subject and quasi-subject types. The survey involved 400 respondents, 40 % male and 60 % female, aged 18 to 65 years. The respondents filled out two online questionnaires. One questionnaire (GRBS) was aimed at assessing the respondents’ propensity to traditional or modern gender-role representations.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the relationship between online interactions and course effectiveness in a corporate setting. The research questions were: How do learners interact with the content, the teacher and other learners in online courses? How effective are online courses characterised by high levels <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>interactions?</b> Which online course design (i. e., emphasising learner-content, learner-teacher or learner-learner interactions) results in the highest levels of effectiveness? The research was conducted in a large Mexican organisation, involving 163 students, 30 teachers and 3 academic assistants. Three versions of an online course were designed, each emphasising a single <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction,</b> delivered online, thoroughly evaluated and compared. The researcher used a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data. She collected data through surveys, server logs, think aloud protocols, interviews, messages in discussion forums, exams, observations, sales records and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used across all sources of qualitative data. Results showed that course design does not dictate the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> that students use. In corporate settings, an online course can be effective in terms of satisfaction, learning, knowledge transfer, business results and return on expectations, as long as one <b>of</b> three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> (learner-content, learner-teacher or learner-learner) features prominently in the design, and delivery is consistent with the chosen <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction.</b> The main contributions to knowledge of this thesis are: an in-depth understanding <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> in the design and delivery of online courses in a large organisation; a comprehensive evaluation of online course effectiveness; the expansion <b>of</b> the <b>interaction</b> equivalency theorem; and how the above contributions can add value for learners and make online programmes a powerful lever for organisational change. Conclusions may be valuable for academics and practitioners interested in corporate e-learning. This study also provides evidence-based recommendations for online learning in organisations...|$|R
