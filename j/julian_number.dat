50|$|<b>Julian</b> day <b>number</b> is a {{count of}} days elapsed since Greenwich mean noon on 1 January 4713 B.C., Julian proleptic calendar. The Julian Date is the <b>Julian</b> day <b>number</b> {{followed}} by the fraction of the day elapsed since the preceding noon. Conveniently for astronomers, this avoids the date skip during an observation night.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{the system}} of Dominical letters (letters A to G {{identifying}} the weekday {{of the first day}} of a given year) has been used to facilitate calculation of the day of week.The day of the week can be easily calculated given a date's <b>Julian</b> day <b>number</b> (JD, i.e. the integer value at noon UT): Adding one to the remainder after dividing the <b>Julian</b> day <b>number</b> by seven (JD modulo 7 + 1) yields that date's ISO 8601 day of the week (for example, the <b>Julian</b> day <b>number</b> of [...] is [...] Calculating ( [...] mod 7 + 1) yields , corresponding to [...]).|$|R

For example, the <b>Julian</b> day <b>number</b> for the day starting at 12:00 UT on January 1, 2000, was 2,451,545.|$|R
