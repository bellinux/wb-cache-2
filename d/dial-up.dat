5|$|Symantec {{announced}} a Professional Edition on November 19, 2002. Data recovery tools in this version allow users to recover deleted or malware-damaged files. The {{inclusion of a}} data erasure tool allows users to delete files while minimizing the chance of recovery. Web Cleanup removes browser cache files, history, and cookies. To maintain <b>dial-up</b> connections, Connection Keep Alive simulates online activity during periods of user inactivity. Norton Productivity Control enables users to filter Internet content and block newsgroups. When used with the User Access Manager, multiple filtering profiles can be created, assigned to different users.|$|E
5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a <b>dial-up</b> connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E
5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Hyderabad {{began in}} 1974 with {{the launch of}} Doordarshan, the Government of India's public service broadcaster, which transmits two free-to-air terrestrial television channels and one satellite channel. Private satellite channels started in July 1992 with the launch of Star TV. Satellite TV channels are accessible via cable subscription, direct-broadcast satellite services or internet-based television. Hyderabad's first <b>dial-up</b> internet access became available in the early 1990s and was limited to software development companies. The first public internet access service began in 1995, with the first private sector internet service provider (ISP) starting operations in 1998. In 2015, high-speed public WiFi was introduced {{in parts of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} considered using {{a similar}} procurement solution {{to that in}} Denmark, where the spectrum was licensed to private enterprise, and the agencies purchase services from private telecommunications companies, based on conventional GSM technology. However, in Denmark this had not led to the desired results, with only Metropolitan Copenhagen being covered. Instead, the Norwegian Government chose to establish a government agency to build and operate the network. Use of the GSM and NMT450 network was insufficient {{because of lack of}} capacity in the conventional network in case of larger amounts of communication, lack of ability of group conversations, lack of priority systems and long <b>dial-up</b> times.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication in Sabah and Sarawak were {{originally}} administered by Posts and Telecommunication Department until 1967, and {{maintained by the}} British Cable & Wireless Communications before all telecommunications management in the state been takeover by Peninsular-based company. The British telecommunication company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet <b>dial-up</b> penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dial-up</b> Internet access – According to AOL {{quarterly}} earnings report May 8, 2015, 2.1 {{million people}} still use AOL's <b>dial-up</b> service.|$|E
25|$|Also that month, AOL {{informed}} its American customers {{it would}} be increasing the price of its <b>dial-up</b> access to US$25.90. The increase {{was part of an}} effort to migrate the service's remaining <b>dial-up</b> users to broadband, as the increased price was the same price they had been charging for monthly DSL access. However, AOL has since started offering their services for $9.95 a month for unlimited <b>dial-up</b> access.|$|E
25|$|FidoNet was {{historically}} {{designed to}} use modem-based <b>dial-up</b> (POTS) access between bulletin board systems, {{and much of}} its policy and structure reflected this.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} the first public library to be founded in North Shore City, the first to offer <b>dial-up</b> access to the New Zealand Bibliographic Network, and a leading proponent of full weekend services.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{a number of}} higher {{extension}} levels were envisaged for the specification, based on ideas then being promoted for worldwide videotex standards (telephone <b>dial-up</b> services offering a similar mix of text and graphics).|$|E
25|$|A <b>dial-up</b> home {{internet}} service is provided for free, however ADSL and Fiber Optic Internet services cost $40 per month. The Communication organisation {{does not provide}} mobile communications, these services are provided by national companies such as STC and Mobily.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} in every Apple Pippin package includes a <b>dial-up</b> analog modem (earlier packages included a 14.4 kbit/s modem (PA-82010 or PA-82007), while later packages included a 33.6 kbit/s modem (PA-82017/BDE-82017)) over a GeoPort interface, and one corded AppleJack game pad.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand has a {{high rate}} of {{internet}} use. , there are 1,916,000 broadband connections and 65,000 <b>dial-up</b> connections in New Zealand, of which 1,595,000 are residential and 386,000 are business or government. The majority of connections are Digital Subscriber Line over phone lines.|$|E
25|$|PowerPlay was {{described}} as a set of protocols and deployment standards at the router level to improve performance. It was claimed that a player with 1000ms ping was able to play against another player on a LAN connection with no noticeable disadvantage. Initially the protocol was to be released with PowerPlay 1.0 focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) and later a revision, PowerPlay 2.0 that would focus on functionality. Cisco and Valve intended to deliver a single <b>dial-up</b> service in Q1 2000 in the United States with a 30-day free trial with a bundled copy of Team Fortress modified to support PowerPlay. Despite never deploying the <b>dial-up</b> plan featuring PowerPlay 1.0, Valve announced in January 2001 that the standard had indeed been finalized.|$|E
25|$|The entire Grameenphone {{network is}} also GPRS/EDGE/3G enabled, {{allowing}} access to <b>dial-up</b> quality speed Internet and data services from anywhere within the coverage area. There are over 10 million GPRS/EDGE/3G {{users in the}} Grameenphone network. Grameenphone has 3G network at most of the urban and sub-urban area.|$|E
25|$|The Gaza Strip has {{rudimentary}} {{land line}} telephone service provided by an open-wire system, {{as well as}} extensive mobile telephone services provided by PalTel (Jawwal) and Israeli providers such as Cellcom. Gaza is serviced by four internet service providers that now compete for ADSL and <b>dial-up</b> customers.|$|E

Using fiber-optics to end users is called Fiber To The Home or similar names.|$|E
25|$|The first Internet service {{provider}} in Bangalore was STPI, Bangalore which started offering internet services in early 1990s. This Internet service was, however, restricted to corporates until VSNL started offering <b>dial-up</b> internet {{services to the}} general public at the end of 1995. Currently, Bangalore has the largest number of broadband Internet connections in India.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Taito {{introduced}} the X2000, which fetched music via a <b>dial-up</b> telephone network. Its repertoire {{of music and}} graphics was limited, but its smaller size and the advantage of continuous updates saw it gradually replace traditional machines. Karaoke machines which are connected via fiber-optic links enabling them to provide instant high-quality music and video are becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
25|$|Xtra Limited (now branded {{as part of}} Spark New Zealand) is New Zealand's largest Internet service {{provider}} (ISP). It was founded in 1996 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Spark New Zealand (formerly Telecom New Zealand). Xtra has provided <b>dial-up</b> Internet access throughout New Zealand {{since its inception in}} May 1996. In 1999 it created New Zealand's first ADSL service.|$|E
25|$|AOL (formerly {{a company}} known as AOL Inc., {{originally}} known as America Online, and stylized as Aol.) is a web portal and online service provider based in New York. It is a brand marketed by Oath, {{a subsidiary of}} Verizon Communications. AOL {{was one of the}} early pioneers of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the U.S. It originally provided a <b>dial-up</b> service to millions of Americans, as well as providing a web portal, e-mail, instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of Netscape. At the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of <b>dial-up</b> to broadband. AOL was eventually spun off from Time Warner in 2009, with Tim Armstrong appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies.|$|E
25|$|NTL {{purchased}} the ISP Virgin.net in 2004, having originally operated it as {{a joint venture}} with Virgin Group since it launched in November 1996. It sold ADSL broadband services through BT landlines to those living outside areas served by NTL's cable network and also offered subscription-based and subscription-free <b>dial-up</b> Internet access. Prior to acquiring Virgin.net, NTL offered a similar package called NTL Freedom.|$|E
25|$|Movie {{copyright}} infringement was {{looked upon}} as impossible by the major studios. When <b>dial-up</b> was common in early and mid-1990s, movies distributed on the Internet tended to be small. The technique that was usually used to make them small was to use compression software, thus lowering the video quality significantly. At that time, the largest copyright violation threat was software.|$|E
25|$|Tertiary {{education}} {{is provided by}} Bosaso College (BC), {{as well as the}} Puntland Nursing Institute (PNI). East Africa University (EAU) also has a Bosaso branch, one of its seven campuses in Puntland. Additionally, the Sam Greathouse School of Modern Technology (SG-SMT) has been working with the local government to construct a large scale <b>dial-up</b> network linking Bosaso to other northern Somali cities, including Berbera and Las Anod.|$|E
25|$|The American Mathematical Society grew rapidly during LeVeque's time as {{executive}} director (1977–1988). Revenues tripled from $5 million in 1977 to $14.9 million in 1988. The Society began computerizing at a rapid rate during this period, with Mathematical Reviews first becoming available electronically through existing academic <b>dial-up</b> services; this system later evolved into MathSciNet. Most of the headquarters staff received computer terminals {{for use in the}} new operations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of supervenience {{to be found}} in computer networking. For example, in a <b>dial-up</b> internet connection, the audio signal on a phone line transports IP packets between the user's computer and the Internet service provider's computer. In this case, the arrangement of bytes in that packet supervenes on the physical properties of the phone signal. More generally, each layer of the OSI Model of computer networking supervenes on the layers below it.|$|E
25|$|Pay BBSes such as The WELL and Echo NYC (now Internet forums {{rather than}} <b>dial-up),</b> ExecPC, PsudNetwork and MindVox (which folded in 1996) were admired for their tight-knit {{communities}} and quality discussion forums. However, many free BBSes also maintained close knit communities, {{and some even}} had annual or bi-annual events where users would travel great distances to meet face-to-face with their on-line friends. These events were especially popular with BBSes that offered chat rooms.|$|E
25|$|These {{increasing}} speeds had {{the side}} effect of dramatically reducing the noticeable effects of channel efficiency. When modems were slow, considerable effort was put into developing the most efficient protocols and display systems possible. Running a general-purpose protocol like TCP/IP over a 1200 bit/s modem was a painful experience. With 56 kbit/s modems, however, the overhead was so greatly reduced as to be unnoticeable. <b>Dial-up</b> Internet service became widely available in 1994, and a must-have option for any general-use operating system by 1995.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, the {{government}} of Belize nationalized Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL), which now competes directly with Speednet. As {{a result of the}} nationalisation process, the interconnection agreements are again subject to negotiations. Both BTL and Speednet boast a full range of products and services including basic telephone services, national and international calls, prepaid services, cellular services via GSM 1900 megahertz (MHz) and 3G CDMA 2000 respectively, international cellular roaming, fixed wireless, <b>dial-up</b> and internet, high-speed DSL, internet service, and national and international data networks.|$|E
25|$|Japan saw {{the release}} of the Satellaview, a modem which {{attaches}} to the Super Famicom's expansion port and connected to the St.GIGA satellite radio station from April 23, 1995 to June 30, 2000. Satellaview users could download gaming news and specially designed games, which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom titles, and released in installments. In the United States, the relatively short-lived XBAND allowed users to connect to a network via a <b>dial-up</b> modem to compete against other players around the country.|$|E
25|$|Chilean {{software}} engineer Jorge Arellano Cid conceived the Dillo project in late 1999, publishing {{the first version}} of Dillo in December of that year. His primary goal in creating Dillo was to democratize access to information. Arellano Cid believed that no one should have to buy a new computer or pay for broadband in order to enjoy the World Wide Web. To this end, he designed Dillo to be small, fast, and efficient, capable of performing well even on an Intel 80486 CPU with a <b>dial-up</b> Internet access.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to UUCP, early Usenet traffic was also exchanged with Fidonet and other <b>dial-up</b> BBS networks. Widespread use of Usenet by the BBS community was {{facilitated by the}} introduction of UUCP feeds made possible by MS-DOS implementations of UUCP, such as UFGATE (UUCP to FidoNet Gateway), FSUUCP and UUPC. In 1986, RFC 977 provided the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) specification for distribution of Usenet articles over TCP/IP as a more flexible alternative to informal Internet transfers of UUCP traffic. Since the Internet boom of the 1990s, almost all Usenet distribution is over NNTP.|$|E
25|$|All India Radio is {{a public}} radio station. Private FM {{stations}} are available in all major cities. Vodafone, Airtel, BSNL, Reliance Communications, Aircel, MTS India, Tata Indicom, Idea Cellular and Tata DoCoMo are available cellular phone operators. Maharashtra has the highest share of the internet market at 18.8% of total households internet users in India.

25|$|BlueLight {{internet}} service In 1999 Kmart began offering a <b>dial-up</b> {{internet service}} called BlueLight, which was eventually spun off {{as an independent}} company. BlueLight was initially free and supported by banner ads. BlueLight dropped the free service in February 2001 and was reacquired by Kmart in July 2001. In 2002 United Online, which also owns NetZero and Juno, bought the BlueLight service after Kmart filed for bankruptcy. In August 2006, Bluelight dropped the banners. In August 2006, the service cost $14.95 a month and had around 165,000 subscribers.|$|E
