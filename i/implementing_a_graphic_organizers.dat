An experiment was performed to investigate {{the effectiveness of these}} dynamic <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> as instructional tools. One-hundred-sixty-one students were recruited for participation in the study from a two-year community college and a four-year public university in the southeast United States. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> treatment groups: static, sortable, and shuffle-sortable. Response accuracy and response latency measurements for three types of mental tasks (factual, comparative, and inferential) were compared across the three treatment groups. A multivariate analysis of variance showed no significant difference between the three <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> types for response accuracy. A within-groups analysis of variance showed no significant differences in response accuracy between mental tasks within the static or sortable treatment groups. However, analysis of variance indicated that accuracy for inferential judgments was lower than that for factual judgments in the shuffle-sortable group. With respect to response latency, a multivariate analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between the three treatment groups. A within-groups analysis of variance showed significant differences in response latency between factual and inferential judgment-making for both the sortable and shuffle-sortable treatments. The sortable treatment had the most pronounced differences in latency between mental tasks, whereas no significant differences in response latency were observed within the static treatment. Participants in the two dynamic treatments reported much higher percentages of affirmative responses to the question, “Did you think your <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> was <b>an</b> effective instructional tool?” with 82. 7 % and 81. 5 % responding “yes” for the Sortable and Shuffle-sort groups, respectively, and only 60. 0 % responding “yes” for the Static group. The <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> in the study are known as adjunct displays and therefore each was associated with an accompanying text passage. Participants had the capability of viewing the accompanying text passage at will within the constraints of <b>a</b> five-minute <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> study period. Analysis of variance revealed that participants in the shuffle-sortable group spent significantly less time viewing the text passage than participants in the static group, possibly because the overhead associated with the shuffle-sortable <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer’s</b> user interface controls consumed time or mental resources that would have otherwise been used to view the text.

But retell a story is not easy, students have problems in the process of retelling story; especially they cannot organize their ideas about the story. So in the learning process, students need a tool to help them visualize and organize their thought. Story maps, one of the kinds of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> that featured areas for students to fill in the basic story element. The main goal of the usage of story map is to improve students retelling story skill. <b>A</b> <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> technique is <b>an</b> outline of concepts that uses twodimensional format to illustrate connection and hierarchies between concepts. Story map {{is one of}} types of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> {{that can be used to}} help students in retelling story.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{comprehend}} expository text {{is vital for}} academic and professional success; however, many students struggle with this genre. While {{it has been found}} that text structure-based <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> (GOs) may assist older students in comprehending expository text, it is uncertain whether this type of scaffold is effective for primary-grade students. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers,</b> level of text structure complexity, and content familiarity on second grade students' comprehension, recall, and sensitivity to cause/effect text structure. A mixed-factorial posttest-only design was utilized, with two between-subjects factors (<b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> and level of cause/effect structure complexity) and one within-subjects factor (content familiarity). Eighty second-grade students from two elementary schools were asked to read four cause/effect passages with familiar content (i. e. concerning objects and events that students encounter in their everyday lives) and four cause/effect passages with unfamiliar science content. Students were randomly assigned to either <b>a</b> <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> condition or <b>a</b> control condition. Students in the <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> condition read <b>a</b> cause/effect <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> after reading each passage, while students in the control condition re-read the passage. Half of the students read passages with a one cause-one effect text structure and half read passages with a more complex one cause-multiple effects structure. Text structure comprehension, recall, and sensitivity were measured via student performance on three tasks. In the first task, students answered questions designed to assess structural awareness and comprehension. The proportions of structure questions answered correctly were calculated for the set of four passages used in this task. In the second task, students answered similar questions about non-structure sentences; again, proportion scores were calculated. Finally, students were asked to provide an oral free recall of text after reading each passage and its corresponding <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> (or after reading and re-reading each passage). Protocols were scored for the proportions of structure and non-structure details correctly recalled for the four additional passages utilized in this task. A mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to analyze the data. Results indicated that reading the <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer,</b> as opposed to re-reading the passage, lead to significant improvements in both recall and text structure sensitivity. In contrast, students in the control group demonstrated lower recall and structural sensitivity. There was a significant main effect for level of causal structure (one cause-one effect and one cause-multiple effects) on comprehension questions requiring structure sensitivity, with students demonstrating higher performance on the simpler one cause-one effect passages. A significant interaction was found between GO condition and level of structure complexity, such that students who re-read the text experienced a decline in performance on comprehension questions at the one cause-multiple effects level. No other effects emerged for structure complexity. Students demonstrated significantly greater performance on structure and non-structure comprehension questions and structure recall when reading familiar rather than unfamiliar content. Additionally, a marginally significant interaction was found between GO condition and familiarity; students in the re-reading condition experienced a decline in structure comprehension question performance when reading unfamiliar content. These results may inform efforts toward improving second-graders' text structure sensitivity and expository text comprehension through the use of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers...</b>|$|R

The chapters will be divided into three sections, one explaining the use of tiered <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> in draft writing, one sharing a model lesson and the third to include three <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers.</b> Using what is known as tiered instruction (leveled responses), each <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> would be designed to the same outcome, but created at different levels of complexity to meet student need. This demands the creator design <b>a</b> criteria specific <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer,</b> recreate two similar <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> at different levels of complexity and evaluate their usefulness. The resulting book will be published by Scholastic, Inc...|$|R
