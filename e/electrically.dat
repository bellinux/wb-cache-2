5|$|Ferrite, {{a type of}} {{sintered}} ceramic {{composed of}} Iron Oxide (Fe2O3) and barium oxide (BaO), is both <b>electrically</b> nonconductive and ferrimagnetic, and can be temporarily or permanently magnetized.|$|E
5|$|It is {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated that}} hydrogen passivates <b>electrically</b> active boron and phosphorus impurities. As {{a result of}} such passivation, shallow donor centers are presumably produced.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) is an <b>electrically</b> {{conducting}} ceramic {{with primary}} use in heating elements operating at temperatures above 1500°C in air.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle with rechargeable battery packs {{that can be}} charged from the electric grid, and the electricity stored on board drives or contributes to drive the wheels for propulsion. Plug-in {{electric vehicle}}s are also {{sometimes referred to as}} grid-enabled vehicles (GEV) and also as <b>electrically</b> chargeable vehicles.|$|E
5|$|As an <b>electrically</b> {{conductive}} liquid, it {{was used}} in mercury switches (including home mercury light switches installed prior to 1970), tilt switches used in old fire detectors, and tilt switches in some home thermostats.|$|E
5|$|Electrochemistry {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are <b>electrically</b> powered using rechargeable cells.|$|E
5|$|Experiments done by William Tavolga provide {{evidence}} that fish have pain and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, toadfish grunted when <b>electrically</b> shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater-fed {{systems are}} {{resilient}} to impacts from ashfall, although airborne ash {{can interfere with}} the operation of well-head pumps. Electricity outages caused by ashfall can also disrupt <b>electrically</b> powered pumps {{if there is no}} backup generation.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} {{typically have}} high melting and boiling points, and are hard and brittle. As solids {{they are almost}} always <b>electrically</b> insulating, but when melted or dissolved they become highly conductive, because the ions are mobilized.|$|E
5|$|Polymer {{dispersed}} {{liquid crystal}} (PDLC) sheets and rolls are available as adhesive backed Smart film {{which can be}} applied to windows and <b>electrically</b> switched between transparent and opaque to provide privacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept car}} had a Connolly Leather-trimmed {{interior}} produced by Callow & Maddox, and was fitted with {{front and rear}} heated windscreens, electric windows, air conditioning, heated <b>electrically</b> adjustable seats with an Alpine CD player. The dashboard was supplied by Veglia.|$|E
5|$|The {{sulfuric acid}} {{droplets}} {{can be highly}} <b>electrically</b> charged, and so they offer the potential for lightning. Venus' small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation may result in cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges.|$|E
5|$|Type A: The plug (male) {{connector}} outside {{dimensions are}} 13.9mm × 4.45mm, and the receptacle (female) connector inside dimensions are 14mm × 4.55mm. There are 19 pins, with bandwidth to carry all SDTV, EDTV, HDTV, and 4K UHD modes. It is <b>electrically</b> compatible with single-link DVI-D.|$|E
5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly <b>electrically</b> conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rainfall}} is low, Sismiut has abundant natural {{supplies of}} fresh, drinkable surface water, collected from a reservoir under Alanngorsuaq. Water is also pumped to the waterworks from another lake around 2.5 kilometers {{away in the}} mountains. The water mains are preinsulated and <b>electrically</b> heated to supply the residents during the winter months. The water supply network is capable of producing some 882,000 cubic meters of water per year; two water-supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7.2 million cubic meters.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the opening}} of the Bloor–Danforth line and the {{additional}} services that were required, a new set of trains were purchased from the Hawker Siddeley group. These trains, which were a part of the H-series, were similar to the M-1 series trains with newer features such as <b>electrically</b> operated doors. With the introduction of the T-1 series subway trains, the H-1 and H-2 subway trains were retired from service, while the remaining H-4 trains (along with some earlier T-1 series trains) were shifted to the Bloor–Danforth line.|$|E
5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become <b>electrically</b> charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I, {{and the development of}} the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which <b>electrically</b> provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The guns were fired simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Queen Mary received her director before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore <b>electrically</b> uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{implements}} the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, {{transport of}} compressed, uncompressed, and LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID. CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are <b>electrically</b> {{compatible with the}} CEA-861 signals used by the digital visual interface (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{are used}} in lighting, lasers, and {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs). Flat panel displays incorporate a thin film of <b>electrically</b> conducting indium tin oxide. Fluorescent lighting relies on mercury vapour for its operation. Ruby lasers generate deep red beams by exciting chromium atoms; the lanthanides are also extensively employed in lasers. Gallium, indium, and arsenic; and copper, iridium, and platinum {{are used in}} LEDs (the latter three in organic LEDs).|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) is the relativistic {{quantum field theory}} of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving <b>electrically</b> charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.|$|E
5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were <b>electrically</b> controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility of a fire, everything in the turret was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it. For this case, plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid (an <b>electrically</b> non-conducting material) {{as can be seen}} in the adjacent image, which shows a discharge tube as a simple example (DC used for simplicity).|$|E
5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also <b>electrically</b> conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses <b>electrically</b> charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Plasma is a {{state of}} matter in which an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly <b>electrically</b> conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas. Unlike these other states of matter, plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the Earth's surface under normal conditions, and must be artificially generated from neutral gases.|$|E
5|$|Prodigy: Building onto {{what the}} AT-X offers, the semi-luxury Prodigy, branded the Touring in New Zealand and the Middle East, {{features}} an <b>electrically</b> adjustable driver's seat, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, parking sensors, wood grain interior and full leather upholstery. The Prodigy also sees a chrome grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels along with {{front fog lamps}} as standard.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{is often}} used as an {{insulator}} and chemical barrier in manufacturing integrated circuits, to <b>electrically</b> isolate different structures or as an etch mask in bulk micromachining. As a passivation layer for microchips, it is superior to silicon dioxide, {{as it is a}} significantly better diffusion barrier against water molecules and sodium ions, two major sources of corrosion and instability in microelectronics. It is also used as a dielectric between polysilicon layers in capacitors in analog chips.|$|E
5|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} {{are some}} of the brightest lights on earth. It is the single most powerful tool available to X-ray crystallographers. It is made of X-ray beams generated in large machines called synchrotrons. These machines accelerate <b>electrically</b> charged particles, often electrons, to nearly the speed of light and confine them in a (roughly) circular loop using magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|The B.1 {{had four}} {{elevators}} (inboard) and four ailerons (outboard). In the B.2, these {{were replaced by}} eight elevons. The Vulcan was also fitted with six <b>electrically</b> operated three-position (in, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly <b>electrically</b> conductive material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The McKenzies had {{a mutual}} {{interest}} in tropical fish {{and had an}} enormous fish pond in the front yard. She spoke of heating water <b>electrically</b> to house tropical fish {{at home in the}} early 1920s, and of having given talks on radio 2FC about tropical fish in the days when she was doing electrical contracting work. In January 1933 the American journal Aquariana published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank.|$|E
5|$|The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic {{scattering}} experiments {{of the late}} 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data {{in a way that}} did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by <b>electrically</b> neutral particles in the nucleon. These <b>electrically</b> neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Interface 1 add-on module {{included}} 8KB of ROM, an RS-232 serial port, {{a proprietary}} LAN interface (called ZX Net), and an interface for {{the connection of}} up to eight ZX Microdrives– somewhat unreliable but speedy tape-loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983. These were used in a revised version on the Sinclair QL, whose storage format was <b>electrically</b> compatible but logically incompatible with the Spectrum's. Sinclair also released the ZX Interface 2 which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured <b>electrically</b> operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|E
