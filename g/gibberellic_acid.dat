25|$|In {{groundbreaking}} research, Paul K. Boss and Mark R. Thomas of the CSIRO Plant Industry and Cooperative Research Centre for Viticulture in Glen Osmond, Australia, {{found that}} Pinot Meunier has a mutation (VvGAI1) that stops it from responding to <b>gibberellic</b> <b>acid,</b> a plant growth hormone. This leads to different, white-haired, leaf and shoot growth, {{and also to}} a slight stunting in growth, explaining why Pinot Meunier plants {{tend to be a}} bit smaller than Pinot noir. The mutation exist only in the outermost cell layer of the cultivar, the L1 or 'epidermal' layer, meaning Pinot Meunier is a chimera. Through tissue culture, it is thus possible to separate out plants containing both the mutant (L1) and non-mutant (L2) genotypes, yielding a normal Pinot noir -like genotype and an unusual looking L1-genotype vine with compressed internodes and thickly clustered leaves. The mutants could not produce full-grown tendrils, it seems that <b>gibberellic</b> <b>acid</b> converts grapevine flower buds into tendrils.|$|E

40|$|A novel Chinese {{chestnut}} (Castanea mollissima Bl.) mutant {{with extreme}} short catkins, here was named sck 1 {{and has been}} characterized in the present study. This sck 1 caused 6 -fold shorter than wild-type catkins. Endogenous <b>gibberellic</b> <b>acids</b> markedly decreased in the mutant, and application of exogenous GA 3 could partially restore the sck 1 phenotype to the wild-type phenotype. Paclobutrazol (PP 333), an antagonist of GAs biosynthesis, could significantly inhibit the wild-type catkins growth, and lead to a short catkins phenotype similar to the sck 1. In addition, compared to the wild-type catkins, the mRNA expression level of ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), a gibberellin biosynthsis key gene, was significantly down-regulated (P, 0. 01) in the sck 1. Importantly, transient over-expression of a normal CmKAO gene in short catkins also could partially restore the wild-type phenotype. Real-time PCR and semi-quantitative analysis showed that the mRNA expression level of KAO was significantly up-regulated. In addition, transient RNA interference of CmKAO in wild-type catkins led the mRNA expression level of KAO decrease significantly and inhibited the wild-type catkins elongation strongly.

40|$|Legume {{plants are}} capable of {{entering}} into a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This results {{in the formation of}} novel organs on their roots, called nodules, in which the bacteria capture atmospheric nitrogen and provide it as ammonium to the host plant. Complex molecular and physiological changes are involved in the formation and establishment of such nodules. Several phytohormones are known to play key roles in this process. Gibberellins (gibberellic acids; GAs), a class of phytohormones known to be involved {{in a wide range of}} biological processes (i. e., cell elongation, germination) are reported to be involved in the formation and maturation of legume nodules, highlighted by recent transcriptional analyses of early soybean symbiotic steps. Here, we summarize what is currently known about GAs in legume nodulation and propose a model of GA action during nodule development. Results from a wide range of studies, including GA application, mutant phenotyping, and gene expression studies, indicate that GAs are required at different stages, with an optimum, tightly regulated level being key to achieve successful nodulation. <b>Gibberellic</b> <b>acids</b> appear to be required at two distinct stages of nodulation: (i) early stages of rhizobia infection and nodule primordium establishment; and (ii) later stages of nodule maturation...|$|R

In this study, the Arabidopsis DREB 1 A gene driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter was introduced into soybean plants by Agrobacterium- mediated transformation. The results showed that the transgenic soybean plants exhibited a typical phenotype of GA-deficient mutants, such as severe dwarfism, small and dark-green leaves, and late flowering compared to those of the non-transgenic plants. The dwarfism phenotype was rescued by the application of exogenous GA 3 once a week for three weeks with the concentrations of 144 mM or three times in one week with the concentrations of 60 mM. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcription levels of the GA synthase genes were higher in the transgenic soybean plants than those in controls, whereas GA-deactivated genes except GmGA 2 ox 4 showed lower levels of expression. The transcript level of GmGA 2 ox 4 encoding the only deactivation enzyme using C 20 -GAs as the substrates in soybean was dramatically enhanced in transgenic plants compared to that of wide type.

However, new scientific achievements have revealed that many of these traits depend on different genes and complex interactions of proteins reacting to various external stimuli. These findings open up new possibilities for breeding where variations in several genes can be combined to enhance productivity and quality.

40|$|Plant growth {{promoting}} rhizobacteria (PGPR) are diverse, naturally occurring bacteria that establish a close association with plant roots {{and promote the}} growth and immunity of plants. Established mechanisms involved in PGPR-mediated plant growth promotion include regulation of phytohormones, improved nutrient availability, and antagonistic effects on plant pathogens. In this study, we isolated a bacterium from the rhizospheric soil of a soybean field in Chungcheong buk-do, South Korea. Using 16 S rRNA sequencing, the bacterium was identified as Bacillus aryabhattai strain SRB 02. Here we show that this strain significantly promotes the growth of soybean.

SRB 02 -treated soybean plants showed significantly better heat stress tolerance than did untreated plants.

40|$|In the {{germinated cereal}} {{aleurone}} layer, <b>gibberellic</b> <b>acids</b> (GA) induce {{expression of a}} number of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes that participate in the mobilization of stored molecules. Previous analyses suggest that the key events controlling the GA-regulated gene expression in the aleurone are formation of active transcription machinery referred to as the GA responsive complex, followed by recruiting GAMYB. In general, bipartite promoter contexts composed of the GA-responsive element and the pyrimidine box are observed within the regulatory regions of cereal GA-responsive genes. Protein factors that recognize each promoter sequence were identified and distinct effects on the GA-mediated activation of gene expression have been also investigated; however, the connection and intercalation between two promoter motifs remain obscure. In this study, I have evaluated cooperative function of GAMYB and a pyrimidine box-binding protein OsDOF 3 that influenced the promoter activity of the most predominant GA-responsive gene (RAmy 1 A) of rice (Oryza sativa). Transient expression of OsDOF 3 in the germinated aleurone prolonged GAMYB function on the reporter expression in the absence of GA. The synergistic effect required a set of DNA bindings of two proteins on the RAmy 1 A promoter region. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed the physical interaction of GAMYB and OsDOF 3 in yeast cells, indicating that the association of GAMYB and OsDOF 3 may be a functional unit in transcription regulation.

40|$|The plant-{{pathogen}}ic fungus Fusarium fujikuroi is {{a notorious}} rice pathogen causing hyper-elongation of infected plants {{due to the}} production of <b>gibberellic</b> <b>acids</b> (GAs). In addition to GAs, F. fujikuroi produces a wide range of other secondary metabolites, such as fusarins, fusaric acid or the red polyketides bikaverins and fusarubins. The recent availability of the fungal genome sequence for this species has revealed the potential of many more putative secondary metabolite gene clusters whose products remain to be identified. However, the complex regulation of secondary metabolism is far from being understood. Here we studied the impact of the heterotrimeric G protein and the cAMP-mediated signaling network, including the regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), to study their effect on colony morphology, sexual development and regulation of bikaverins, fusarubins and GAs. We demonstrated that fusarubin biosynthesis is negatively regulated by at least two Ga subunits, FfG 1 and FfG 3, which both function as stimulators of the adenylyl cyclase FfAC. Surprisingly, the primary downstream target of the adenylyl cyclase, the PKA, is not involved in the regulation of fusarubins, suggesting that additional, yet unidentified, cAMP-binding protein(s) exist. In contrast, bikaverin biosynthesis is significantly reduced in ffg 1 and ffg 3 deletion mutants and positively regulated by FfAC and FfPKA 1, while GA biosynthesis depends on the active FfAC and FfPKA 2 in an FfG 1 - and FfG 3 -independent manner.

40|$|Gibberellins (GAs) or <b>gibberellic</b> <b>acids</b> are {{ubiquitous}} diterpenoid phytohormones {{required for}} {{many aspects of}} plant growth and development, including repression of photosynthetic pigment production (i. e. deetiolation) {{in the absence of}} light. The committed step in GA biosynthesis is catalyzed in plastids by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), whose substrate, (E,E,E,) -geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), is also a direct precursor of carotenoids and the phytol side chain of chlorophyll. Accordingly, during deetiolation, GA production is repressed, whereas flux toward these photosynthetic pigments through their common GGPP precursor is dramatically increased. How this is accomplished has been unclear because no mechanism for regulation of CPS activity has been reported. We present here kinetic analysis of recombinant pseudomature CPS from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; rAtCPS) demonstrating that Mg 2 + and GGPP exert synergistic substrate inhibition effects on CPS activity. These results suggest that GA metabolism may be limited by feed-forward inhibition of CPS; in particular, the effect of Mg 2 + because light induces increases in plastid Mg 2 + levels over a similar range as that observed here to affect rAtCPS activity. Notably, this effect is most pronounced in the GA-specific AtCPS because the corresponding activity of the resin acid biosynthetic enzyme abietadiene synthase is 100 -fold less sensitive to [Mg 2 +]. Furthermore, Mg 2 + allosterically activates the plant porphobilinogen synthase involved in chlorophyll production. Hence, Mg 2 + may have a broad role in regulating plastidial metabolic flux during deetiolation.

GAs are also successfully applied in agriculture and horticulture as plant growth regulators to enhance crop yields, fruit size, and to induce earlier flowering. In this study, six F. fujikuroi wild-type and mutant strains differing in GA yields and the spectrum of produced GAs were cultivated in high-quality lab fermenters for optimal temperature and pH control and compared regarding their growth, GA production, and GA gene expression levels. Comparative analysis of the six strains revealed that strain 6314 /DES/PPT 1, holding mutations in two GA biosynthetic genes and an additi onal deletion of the 4 '-phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene PPT 1, exhibits the highest total GA amount. Expression studies of two GA biosynthesis genes, CPS/KS and DES, showed a constantly high expression level for both genes under production conditions (nitrogen limitation) in all strains. By cultivating these genetically engineered mutant strains, we were able to produce not only mixtures of different bioactive GAs (GA 3, GA 4, and GA 7) but also pure GA 4 or GA 7.

GA production was shown to provide a selective advantage during infection of the preferred host plant rice. Here, we provide genome sequences of eight additional F. fujikuroi isolates from distant geographic regions. The isolates differ {{in the size of}} chromosomes, most likely due to variability of subtelomeric regions, the type of asexual spores (microconidia and/or macroconidia), and the number and expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters. Whilst most of the isolates caused the typical bakanae symptoms, one isolate, B 14, caused stunting and early withering of infected seedlings. In contrast to the other isolates, B 14 produced no GAs but high amounts of fumonisins during infection on rice. Furthermore, it differed from the other isolates by the presence of three additional polyketide synthase (PKS) genes (PKS 40, PKS 43, PKS 51) and the absence of the F. fujikuroi-specific apicidin F (NRPS 31) gene cluster. Analysis of additional field isolates confirmed the strong correlation between the pathotype (bakanae or stunting/withering), and the ability to produce either GAs or fumonisins. Deletion of the fumonisin and fusaric acid-specific PKS genes in B 14 reduced the stunting/withering symptoms, whereas deletion of the PKS 51 gene resulted in elevated symptom development.

Treatment with BA at 300 mg L- 1 concentration in both cultivars tested did not influence total length and number of sylleptic shoots, as well as the number of sylleptic shoots longer than 20 cm. The most positive influence on all studied parameters was observed on nursery trees treated with the concentration of 1, 200 mg L- 1 BA. The lowest concentration of BA+GA 4 + 7 (500 mg L- 1) caused the low feathering of both studied cultivars. The higher concentrations (1, 000, 1, 500 and 2, 000 mg L- 1) similarly increased the number and total length of sylleptic shoots of nursery trees. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.
