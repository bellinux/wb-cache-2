The present work is focused on the optimization of the <b>hemp</b> seed <b>oil</b> extractive process at laboratory level using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) as solvent.

Independent variables were operating temperature (40, 50 and 60 ◦C), pressure (250, 300 and 350 bar) and particle diameter (0. 59, 0. 71 and 0. 83 mm).

40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is {{probably}} one of the oldest field crops used in nutrition, but also for the production of fibres for clothes, ropes or canvas. Cannabis sativa is one of the most spread species of cannabis which belongs to family Cannabinaceae. The seeds are important part of cannabis sativa, which contains high part of lipids and proteins. It provides also valuable essential fatty acids, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Due to low content of THC is possible to produce valuable oil from seeds, which is used in cosmetic and food industry. The aim of this work was to evaluate composition of hemp seeds from one harvest, observe and compare quality of parameters both cold pressed <b>hemp</b> seed <b>oil</b> and <b>hemp</b> seed <b>oil</b> by CO 2 extraction.   Both oils are comparable in composition of fatty acids which follow from results of analyses.

Also were found dissimilarities in colours, phospholipides, unsaponifiable matter, acid value and peroxide value. The cold pressed <b>hemp</b> seed <b>oil</b> contained lower values of unsaponifiable matter, colours and higher concentration of phospholipides and lower acid value. It is caused by influence of CO 2. The oxidation stability of cold pressed <b>hemp</b> seed <b>oil</b> was four times higher than oil by CO 2 extraction.   doi: 10. 5219 / 32  </p...|$|R

Our aim was to examine cannabinoids and fatty acid composition as well as metal and non-metal element compositions in products, like <b>hemp</b> seed <b>oil</b> and chopped <b>hemp</b> seed capsule. The cannabinoids were separated by thin layer chromatography. Fatty acid composition was determined with gas chromatography, and elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Sn, Sr, V, and Zn) were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometric method.

Unfortunately, flaxseed also picks up cadmium very efficiently from the soil, which has to be kept in mind when choosing what regions to cultivate it in.

Hemp proteins are good source of essential amino acids particularly methionine, cysteine, arginine and glutamic acid. Numerous clinical studies have shown that food from industrial hemp seeds has a positive effect on the immune system and general health. Although the industrial hemp seeds do not contain THC and other cannabinoids, they can be found on the outer surface of seeds because seeds were in contact with parts of the plants containing them in greater amount. Consumption of 10 mg of THC per day is considered as NOAEL for the psychotropic effects of THC because it does not show a cumulative effect. 10 mg of THC per day is taken as LOAEL (the dose that is not distinct in terms of psychotropic placebo effect and thus represents NOAEL) for a person weighing 70 kg and safety factor of 20 was applied. ADI of 0. 5 mg/day was derived. Based on literature data limits for THC are proposed: 20 mg/kg for cold-pressed <b>oils</b> of <b>hemp</b> seeds and 2 mg/kg for seeds, other food from seeds and that contains seeds of industrial hemp.
