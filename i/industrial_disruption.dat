40|$|Current {{innovation}} management literature and research statically differentiates between incremental and disruptive innovation, {{as far as}} the trajectory development is concerned. Incremental innovation is generally comprehended as an improvement of technology performance or product feature enhancement, whereas disruptive innovation is defined based on technologies previously new to the world, combined with their effects on markets. The authors of this research present how a convergence of several well-known, incrementally developing technologies can result in innovations with highly disruptive character in terms of innovation trajectories. Paradoxically, in disruptive situations, operative actions must be taken before strategic planning can be made, as the industrial and economic environment can be regarded as extremely uncertain. In this context, however, we argue that this special case caused by the convergence of technologies can serve to understand certain areas of emerging <b>industrial</b> <b>disruptions</b> and hence support the strategic planning and technology management of a firm acting in this area. The case of information and communication technology (ICT) industry is used to highlight this convergence phenomenon as a special case of emerging disruptive innovation. Based on this example, the process of innovations transforming from incremental towards disruptive due to convergence will be examined, and entrepreneurial recommendations for sustaining the competitive advantage and supporting value creation will be derived.

40|$|The {{majority}} of faults on a utility system are line-to-ground faults, {{and it is}} also {{the most common cause of}} voltage dips in <b>industrial</b> system. The <b>disruption</b> of an <b>industrial</b> process due to a line-to-ground fault can result in substantial costs to operation. The dip in the single phase associated with this fault is either type B or D. However, type D is also associated with to line-to-line faults. For the application of a suitable mitigation scheme to voltage dips, it is essential to distinguish between type B and D from measured sag voltages. This article discusses the characteristics of dips associated with line-to-ground and line-to-line faults and presents a new method to detect type B and D with the help of positive- and negative-sequence potential gradient methods derived as a function of distance to fault location. The need to distinguish type B and D, and the advantages of characterization through the sequence component, are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|McKell’s {{drive to}} {{implement}} his ‘vision splendid’ came up against some harsh political realities. Probably {{the major problem}} was widespread postwar <b>industrial</b> <b>disruption</b> as unions battled for {{their share of the}} fruits of victory. McKell did what he could to deal with a complex and intractable situation. He tried to become as publicly and actively involved as possible in solving disputes in the hope of convincing the voters that everything feasible was being done to deal with a situation that admitted of no easy solution. A subsidiary aim was to persuade the electorate that Labor was more competent and better placed with its links to the union movement to deal with industrial unrest than the opposition. Another central policy was unwavering support for the principles of arbitration as the best means of resolving disputes and as a bulwark against industrial anarchy. McKell also strongly attacked Communist influence in the union movement and called on militant union leaders to show a sense of responsibility to the State as a whole by minimising stoppages. He strove to project an image of the Government working together with reasonable elements in the unions to minimise strikes. Finally, McKell was also prepared to give some concessions to ease the industrial pressure. The main example was an extra week of annual leave, a key union demand, which McKell legislated for in 1944.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect on}} industry output of union density both conceptually and empirically {{in the case of}} the Australian Building and Construction industry. The classical view of the effects of a heavily unionised industry is that by exhibiting some market power, unions are able to extract above normal rents and cause <b>industrial</b> <b>disruption,</b> which is reflected in lower industry employment and higher wages. More contemporary beliefs describing the effect of unions concentrates on issues related to the external information benefits provided by union movements. By voicing information related to exit, it is argued that the resulting lower labour turnover and other related costs dominate possible higher wage and lower employment outcomes supposedly generated by heavily unionised sectors. Empirical evidence from Australia {{in the case of the}} heavily unionised Building and Construction industry, does not support the classical view that higher union density inhibits the output performance of the industry in the long run. The estimates also reveal a quick path to long run equilibrium...|$|E

While all prior wars affected their nations as sons died and treaties changed political borders, the First World War touched home in ways never experienced before.

40|$|In this {{perspective}} article, we critically explore ‘disruption’ {{in relation to}} sustainability transitions in the energy sector. Recognising significant ambiguity associated with the term, we seek to answer the question: What use has ‘disruption’ for understanding and promoting change towards low carbon energy futures. First, we outline that different understandings and dimensions of ‘system disruption’ exist with different linkages to institutional and policy change. This variety points out a need to research in more detail the particular effects of differing low-carbon innovations {{in terms of their}} disruptive consequences for whole socio-technical systems. Thus, disruption can be utilised as a useful conceptual tool for interrogating in more detail the ways in which energy systems are changing in particular contexts. Second, we reflect on the relationship between ‘green <b>industrial</b> policy’ and <b>disruption.</b> In some contexts ‘energy disruption’ has been facilitated by green industrial policy, and {{it would seem that the}} profound changes said to be on the horizon in terms of disruption are also a motivator of green industrial policy. New industrial policy can be an important way in which the negative consequences of disruptive change, such as job losses, can be managed and facilitated...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} Companies today face {{a complex}} global business environment, characterized mainly by {{longer and more}} variable transportation delays; larger number of suppliers, more volatile demand; and more exposure to high-impact disruptive events - a situation that requires organizational flexibility and operational responsiveness {{that is not necessarily}} available in all current supply chain systems. It is to cope with these issues that companies must adapt the structure of their production-distribution networks and planning systems. This research proposes an approach for modeling the problem at the strategic level with the objective of enhancing the flexibility of the production-distribution system. It considers that future business environment is prone to <b>disruptions</b> (<b>industrial</b> accidents, epidemics or natural disasters) that could reduce the production and distribution capacities of the network and that can also suddenly raise products demand. In addition, it takes into account the option to consider new flexible production technologies providing modularity capabilities and more process responsiveness. The mathematical model builds on stochastic programing to consider uncertainty into a set of scenarios and on the concepts of chaining and multiple sourcing to foster flexibility. This gives rise to a two-stage stochastic location-allocation model with multiple products and capacitated production features, and where the decisions include technology and facilities mission selection. </p...|$|R

We first analyze media sources in conjunction with industrial statistics to demonstrate that several technologies proclaimed by media to be disruptive have failed to displace the industry order. We then offer a general model of industry disruption based upon field research. Our analysis shows that three types of uncertainties – technical, market, and organizational – may explain why such potentially disruptive technologies fail to displace the existing industrial order. Our work should not be misconstrued as a contradiction of Christensen’s work. Our general model, perhaps the first differential model of industry disruption contributed to innovation literature, in fact builds upon Christensen’s conditions, and argues for broadening the research agenda for understanding industry disruption...|$|E
40|$|The Coal Mining Industry {{has evolved}} {{from the days of}} Land mining into a highly {{mechanised}} process becoming Australia 2 ̆ 7 s largest export industry and the major source of fuel in the generation of power required for both industrial and domestic use. As in all commodity markets the Coal Mining Industry will only remain viable whilst the product can be competitive with alternate fuel sources such as Hydro-Electric, Solar and Nuclear Power. In order to meet the above objective it is important to maintain products superior in quality or cheaper to other sources such as Asia, South Africa, Europe and North America. Over the last two decades highly productive longwall units have been developed to provide bulk tonnes from operations, however, other important support services have largely been ignored. Exploration techniques required to understand the resource prior to mining are inadequate. Safety performance is not competitive with other industries. Development and auxiliary equipment are largely incapable of providing timely exposure of coal and support to longwall equipment. Marketing and transport infrastructure is costly. Maintenance is generally carried out to meet legislative requirements. Industrial relations and human resources management issues have often been referred to independent arbitrators for settlement. This thesis systematically addresses the major components involved in improving the productivity and viability of the underground coal mining industry. Whilst each individual component may have an incremental effect on the industry, but collectively they may have a major effect on competitiveness. Chapter 1 summarises the current exploration techniques available to understand a resource and predict mining conditions prior to commitment to major expenditure. It also describes some of the impediments to running areas for legislative reasons. Chapter 2 describes the marketing and transportation opportunities available within the mining operation. Chapter 3 demonstrates the cost to the industry of poor safety performance and the opportunities for cost saving where industry attempts to eliminate disabling injuries. Chapter 4 analyses the reasons for <b>industrial</b> <b>disruption</b> in the Mining Industry and the cost of this <b>industrial</b> <b>disruption</b> both directly and because of poor work performance. Chapter 5 describes mainly the development machinery presently available to the industry and that machinery being introduced in order to gain the 2 ̆ 2 quantum leap 2 ̆ 2 in development performance, thus, leading to greater utilisation of longwall equipment. Chapter 6 describes changing philosophy to maintain mme machinery by better condition monitoring techniques whilst sharing improvements with equipment suppliers. Chapter 7 details conclusions and recommends further research. In order to achieve the optimum improvement in productivity and viability of underground coal mining in Australia, this thesis demonstrates the interdependencies of exploration, marketing, safety, human resources, machinery and maintenance...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} is submitted in partial fulfillment for the degree: Master of Architecture [Professional] at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, {{in the year}} 2014. Supervised by Professor Diaan van der WesthuizenHigh levels of unemployment are a reality {{in many of the}} urban areas of South Africa. Poverty and hardship compel many of the unemployed to venture into the urban informal economy in order to survive. The South African government have found new ways of creating employment opportunities, one of which is within the recycling industry. There is an increased demand for minimizing mankind’s environmental footprint. Glass is a material that has been used for centuries and has the ability to be recycled infinitely without losing its quality (Marson, n. d). This together with the need for glass amongst consumers and the endlessly recycling nature of glass makes glass recycling a significant sustainable measure in considering environmental impacts (2011, 2012 Annual Review: Glass Recycling Company). Despite these properties, glass continues to be an undervalued material that can utilize low technology in its recycling process. This study aimed at investigating the formal and informal recycling economy within the city of Johannesburg by providing the opportunity for the Waste Reclaimers (Trolley Pushers) to {{be an integral part of}} the recycling process, specifically with glass. A further aim was to explore the tectonics of a factory to create a space where the Waste Reclaimers could gather, connect and engage with the product of glass. Lastly it aimed to provide a space where the general public could also engage in the product of glass recycling thereby creating awareness and promotion of recycling. The project proposed a glass recycling factory where the process of glass recycling culminates with the production of glass. The site selected for this research is located within the industrial part of the Newtown precinct. This has become a central recycling hub for the Waste Reclaimers of Johannesburg as it links private recycling centres within the city. Newtown is an area of flux, marked by a history of <b>industrial</b> and political <b>disruption.</b> This area represents change and opportunity for growth and life. A space recycled and regenerated throughout the history of Johannesburg. The reason for the choice of topic is that the evolution of recycling in Johannesburg has reached a point where municipalities need to acknowledge the informal sector as a valuable part of the recycling economy. The majority of the literature on recycling and the organization of the recycling process predominantly focuses on the collection of waste as means of job creation. An opportunity therefore presented itself to highlight the production, and craftsmanship of recyclable material. To clarify and further place the Waste Reclaimers within the existing waste management system, the theory of Phenomenology has been explored. It will focus on the phenomenological term of “Lifeworld” which describes a way of life where the individual’s aspiration, perceptions, experiences, beliefs and behaviour forms a holistic unity towards a fulfilling, meaningful, existence (Seamon, 2012). This exploration will give insight to how this building will provide the Waste Reclaimer a sense of identification and orientation within this system of the recycling industry. In order to better understand the complexity of the existing waste management system, the theory of Systems has been explored focusing on the principal of an open system as a way of broadening the lifeworld of the Waste Reclaimers Precedent studies of PFG Building Glass windscreen recovery facility; Zama City Waste; the comparison of factory tectonics between the Crystal Palace, Toledo Museum of Art Glass and the Crucible Glassblowing studio; the Glass Chapel and The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art were used to inform the design. The network of the Waste Reclaimers was also documented in order to understand their routes and network across the city and the surrounding suburbs. The impact of the design found that the proposed space created opportunities for pause and transformation using light, space and process. The idea of transformation is process. Process is represented by a linear path with adjacent spaces of function and support. These spaces will transform according to their activities and associated light qualities. These spaces will thus become the medium through which people and activities change...|$|R
