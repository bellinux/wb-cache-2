25|$|Titan Magazines {{released}} {{the first issue}} of Heroes Magazine on November 20, 2007. It is {{the first of a series}} of six, slated to be released bi-monthly. The first issue is a 100-page premiere issue. Feature articles include a cast <b>group</b> <b>interview,</b> a secret origins featurette, and a season one episode guide. Greg Beeman, executive producer of Heroes has confirmed that this is an official Heroes release, with the full support and cooperation of Tim Kring and the rest of the Heroes production team. The magazine ceased publication with the twelfth issue.|$|E
25|$|Accustomed {{to writing}} the scripts for movies, Gowariker {{said that he}} found it {{difficult}} to write the script for Everest. Typically, {{in the case of a}} soap opera, the story is not written entirely prior to release. Rather, it is written as the soap opera goes on, analysing various factors such as the TRPs (television rating points) and the audience feedback. Everest, however, was not written this way. Gowariker has also said that it was while writing the story that he realised the self-satisfaction that people get after climbing Mount Everest. After finishing writing the story, he realised not only that he wanted to produce the show, but also that he also needed experts to direct it. Gowariker said in a <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> that through Everest he would also be addressing the girl child issue.|$|E

40|$|Focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> as a data {{collecting}} strategy Background. Focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> are {{a method for}} collecting qualitative data and have enjoyed a surge in popularity in health care research over the last 20 years. However, the literature on this method is ambiguous {{in relation to the}} size, con-stitution, purpose and execution of focus groups. Aim. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore some of the methodological issues arising from using focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> in order to stimulate debate about their efficacy. Discussion. Methodological issues are discussed in the context of a study examining attitudes towards and beliefs about older adults in hospital settings among first-level registered nurses, nursing lecturers and student nurses. Focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> were used to identify everyday language and constructs used by nurses, with the intention of incor-porating the findings into an instrument to measure attitudes and beliefs quantitatively. Conclusions. Experiences of conducting focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> demonstrated that smaller groups were more manageable and that groups made up of strangers required more moderator intervention. However, as a {{data collecting}} strategy they are a rich source of information...|$|R
30|$|The <b>group</b> <b>{{interview}}s</b> were audio-recorded. After {{each interview}} the recording was independently audited by two authors conducting thematic analyses {{to determine the}} key psychosocial consequences. In the subsequent <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> the identified themes were discussed. Furthermore, the participants’ verbatim comments were used to define a construct, e.g. negative experiences from the examination.|$|R

Following the [...] and during a <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> with The Washington Times, Beltran joked {{that he was}} asked to perform in Hamlet during the summer in Albuquerque, but had been asked to wear Chakotay's facial tattoo. During that time he worked on the Oliver Stone film Nixon (1995). During the period when Voyager was run by Taylor and Piller as the executive producers, Beltran gave feedback on the character which was taken into account. He later explained that this ended following the introduction of Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine onto the cast and Brannon Braga taking over from Taylor and Piller. Beltran felt that Chakotay was one of the characters alongside Harry Kim, Tuvok, and Neelix who were left behind by the new writers, who tended to concentrate on Janeway, Seven, and [...]|$|E
500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had known for years, and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, it sure is nice to be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{increase}} awareness about and stimulate interest in using focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews,</b> a qualitative research technique, to advance the state-of-the-art of education and learning about health. After a brief discussion of small group process in health education, features of focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> are presented, and a theoretical framework for planning a focus group study is summarized. Then, litera-ture describing traditional and health-related applications of focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> is reviewed and a synthesis of methodological limitations and advantages of this tech-nique is presented. Implications are discussed regarding: need for more inductive qualitative research in health education; utility of focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> for research and for formative and summative evaluation of health education programs; appli-cability of marketing research to understanding and influencing consumer behav-ior, despite notable distinctions between educational initiatives and marketing; and need for professional preparation faculty to consider increasing emphasis on qualita-tive research methods...|$|R

In the present study, {{these men were}} re-invited in groups of five to participate in three <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> that took place on August and September 2012.

50|$|In the <b>group</b> <b>interview,</b> {{multiple}} applicants are interviewed {{at one time}} {{by one or more}} interviewers. This type of interview can be used for selection, promotion, or assessment of team skills. Interviewers may also use a <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> to assess an applicant’s stress management skills or assertiveness because in such a group setting the applicant will be surrounded by other applicants who also want to get the job. Group interviews can be less costly than one-on-one or panel interviews, especially when many applicants need to be interviewed in a short amount of time. In addition, because fewer interviewers are needed, fewer interviewers need to be trained. These positive qualities of the <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> have made them more popular.|$|E

40|$|Abstract For {{this project}} we have {{conducted}} a research aiming at investigating how young people {{at the age of}} 20 - 25 uses Snapchat and Instagram and how, and why, their perception and use of these platforms differ. We have conducted three focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> based on theoretical reading of Steinar Kvale. For analysing the focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> we have used Norman Fairclough’s Critical Discourse Analysis and Erving Goffman’s theory about frontstage and backstage from his book Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. From analysing the focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> we can conclude that the use of the platforms differs greatly in terms of how to communicate, how to present yourself and how to act with situational appropriateness...|$|R

40|$|There is a sharp {{divide between}} {{quantitative}} and qualitative methodologies in the social sciences. We investigate an innovative way to bridge this gap that incorporates quantitative techniques into a qualitative method, the “quanti-qualitative method ” (QQM). Specifically, our research utilized small survey questionnaires and experiment-like activities {{as part of the}} question route in a series of five focused <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> on nutrition education. We show how these quantitative-type activities fit naturally with our question route and contributed to testing the hypotheses {{within the context of the}} five important characteristics of focused <b>group</b> <b>interviews.</b> The innovative use of QQM in focused <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> makes data analysis easier and more transparent and permits collection of richer, more multifaceted data in a cost-effective fashion.

50|$|Group {{interviews}} haven’t {{been studied}} {{as much as}} one-on-one interviews, but the research {{that has been done}} suggests that in the field of education group interviews can be an effective method of selection. For example, a 2016 study found that applicants for teaching jobs thought that the <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> was fair. A 2006 study found conflicting findings. These include that applicants in a <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> who were questioned later in the interview gave more complete and higher quality responses and that group interviews were seen as not fair. They also found that group interviews were not as effective as one-on-one interviews. Further research needs to be conducted to more extensively evaluate the group interview’s usefulness for various purposes. This research needs to be done across various domains outside of the education sector. Research also needs to clarify conflicting findings by determining in which situations study results can be applied.|$|E

50|$|The highly {{competitive}} application process requires several steps. Applicants must first submit an application, resume, and cover {{letter to the}} NBCUniversal career site. Following the online submission, Page Program coordinators review materials and select individuals {{to move on to}} the phone screen. In the phone screen stage, Page Program coordinators conduct an individual interview that examines an applicant's relevant skills, leadership experience, and knowledge of NBCUniversal. Candidates applying for the East Coast Page Program who make it through the phone interview are then invited to a <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> at NBC's offices at Rockefeller Center. Group interviews typically have six applicants applying with two or three interviewers. The <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> is three parts: a group portion where all applicants are asked the same questions, an individual interview with the two or three NBCUniversal interviewers, and a presentation portion where applicants must present to the NBCUniversal interviewers and fellow applicants.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> in Asian medical education evaluative research. Methods: Randomly selected medical students {{were invited to participate}} in 30 focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> to provide in-depth data about the effect on their learning of the introduction of early clinical skills. Efforts were made to meet all the students to help them understand the objectives of the focus group. Confidentiality was emphasised and a non-faculty interviewer was recruited for the interviews. Results: The students considered the use of focus groups to be a more meaningful way of collecting students' opinions than other methods, for example structured questionnaire, because it allowed an interactive discussion. They also felt that having an independent non-faculty interview moderator had encouraged them to express their opinions more candidly during the interviews. Conclusion: The use of focus <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> among Asian medical students for evaluative research is practical and efficient. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
