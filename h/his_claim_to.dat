5|$|Around 1968, Clarence13X fathered a {{son with}} a young convert named Gusavia. That year, Gloria Steinem {{published}} an article about Clarence13X in New York magazine. She blamed the NOI for the previous attempt to kill him, arguing that they were angered by <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> be Allah and thus above Elijah Muhammad. Clarence13X also received coverage from international media, including a Canadian television program.|$|E

5|$|By {{ordering}} {{the display of}} one part of Koppány's quartered corpse in Gyulafehérvár, {{the seat of his}} maternal uncle, Gyula the Younger, Stephen asserted <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.|$|E
5|$|Henry I of Jerusalem came to Antioch {{to mediate}} {{a peace treaty}} in early 1195. After Bohemond renounced <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> {{suzerainty}} over Cilicia and acknowledged Leo's possession of Bagras, Leo released him and his retainers. Before long, Bohemond's son, Raymond, married Leo's niece and heir, Alice.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian of Habsburg renounced <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> Hungary in the Peace of Pressburg on 7 November 1491.

In the same year, Ernuszt and Ladislaus Kanizsai were jointly appointed Bans of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia.|$|E
50|$|With {{this new}} focus, {{he changed the}} {{spelling}} of his last name from Quénum to Houénou, went by his traditional name Kojo rather than Marc, and claimed the royal title of Prince. Although he was the nephew of Béhanzin, the last independent king of Dahomey, <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> be the Prince were dubious. Indeed, <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> being the prince were directly challenged in the later Knowlton divorce case in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Hamyon Shah Aasifi {{represented}} monarchist groups, {{although the}} former King, Mohammed Zahir Shah, has renounced <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> be head of state.|$|R

5|$|The {{senators}} {{responded by}} acknowledging Elagabalus as emperor and accepting <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> be {{the son of}} Caracalla. Caracalla and Julia Domna were both deified by the Senate, both Julia Maesa and Julia Soaemias were elevated {{to the rank of}} Augustae, and the memory of both Macrinus and Diadumenian was expunged by the Senate. The former commander of the Third Legion, Comazon, was appointed commander of the Praetorian Guard.|$|E
5|$|Vlad did {{not abandon}} <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> Wallachia {{and settled in}} Transylvania. A Neo-Renaissance mural in a three-storey house in the main square of Sighișoara (which was {{uncovered}} on the 500th anniversary of the death Vlad Dracul's son, Dracula) may depict Vlad Dracul after an original painting, according to Radu Florescu. The mural depicts a corpulent man with oval-shaped eyes and long moustaches wearing a white turban.|$|E
5|$|Willem Janszoon {{returned}} to the Netherlands apparently {{in the belief that}} the south coast of New Guinea was joined to the land along which he sailed, although his own chart did not verify <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> have continuously followed the coastline where the Torres Strait is found.|$|E

50|$|As Phang's name did {{not appear}} on Singapore's 40 Richest list from Forbes in 2007 and 2008, <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> {{personal}} success and wealth is therefore highly improbable.|$|R
5|$|As the British {{government}} has no legal jurisdiction, it requires the local residents to form a representative committee according {{to the laws of}} the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them. Ancient Burgundian law requires that the Duke himself appoint a council. Sébastien de Charolais arrives and presents <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the title, which is verified by Professor Hatton-Jones. He forms the governing body which includes the local policeman, Spiller, and the manager of the bank branch, Mr. Wix; the neighbourhood shop keeper, Arthur Pemberton, is appointed as Burgundy's Prime Minister. The council begin discussions with the government, particularly about the Burgundian treasure.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 2004, the Writers Guild of America, west {{conducted}} arbitration {{through the}} scripts {{that had been}} written since Barry Levinson developed the film at Warner Bros. in 1987. Lewis Colick, James Toback and Tom Epperson disassociated themselves for credit by the WGA. The Guild justified credit to Lewis Colick, who wrote {{the first draft of}} The Bobby Darin Story in 1987, and Kevin Spacey. Actor-writer Jeffrey Meek believed he should have deserved credit; he was paid $85,000 of a promised $125,000 to settle <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> have performed writing services.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's stepmother, Sybil, {{wanted to}} secure the {{succession}} of Antioch to her son, William. Leo, Lord of Armenian Cilicia exploited her ambitions. With her assistance, he captured and imprisoned Bohemond III in early 1194. Leo also forced Bohemond III to surrender Antioch to him, but the Latin and Greek burghers formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from seizing the town. The commune proclaimed Bohemond III's elder son, Raymond, regent. Bohemond hurried from Tripoli to Antioch {{at the head of}} his army to help his brother, compelling the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia. Leo released their father only after Bohemond III renounced <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> suzerainty over Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|Born into a rural working-class family, Pickingill {{grew up in}} Hockley, Essex and was baptised {{into the}} Church of England. Working as a farm labourer, in 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman in Gravesend, Kent. The couple moved back to Essex, settled in Canewdon and had four children. Pickingill's wife died in 1887, and in later life he {{attracted}} limited press attention for <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of the}} oldest men in England. These claims also appeared in his obituaries, although were later shown to be incorrect.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{adopted an}} active foreign policy {{soon after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the Mongols. In the second half of 1242 he invaded Austria and forced Duke Frederick II to surrender the three counties ceded to him during the Mongol invasion. On the other hand, Venice occupied Zadar in the summer of 1243. Béla renounced Zadar on 30 June 1244, but Venice acknowledged <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> one third of the customs revenues of the Dalmatian town.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult}} to enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E

5|$|However, Béla, who {{actually}} {{had no intention}} of renouncing <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> succeed his brother in favor of his nephew, fled to Poland and sought military assistance from Duke Boleslaus II of Poland (r. 1058–1079). With Duke Boleslaus's support, Béla returned to Hungary at the head of Polish troops. On the other hand, the Dowager Empress Agneswho governed the Holy Roman Empire in the name of her minor son, Henry IVsent Bavarian, Bohemian and Saxon troops to assist Andrew.|$|E
5|$|In early 1147 Roger II of Sicily {{extended}} {{an offer}} to Louis VII of France to transport the French crusaders to the Holy Land during the Second Crusade. Fearing that Roger only wanted to assert <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> Antioch, LouisVII and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine (niece of Raymond of Poitiers) declined. Louis and his crusaders came to the principality in March 1148. Before long, rumors spread among the crusaders about a love affair between Raymond and Eleanor. The crusaders tried to convince her husband to launch a campaign against Aleppo, the capital of Nur ad-Din, but LouisVII decided to leave Antioch to Jerusalem, forcing Eleanor to accompany him.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund's rule {{began with}} his mother's death. Rather than {{adopting}} a new title, {{he continued to}} style himself rex electus (king-elect). Mihály Csáky, Christopher and Stephen Báthory, and his mother's other advisors continued to participate in state administration. John Sigismund sent envoys to Ferdinand to propose marriage with one of Ferdinand's daughters, but also to announce <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the parts of Hungary under Ferdinand's rule. His demands were rejected, but peace was preserved.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} month and a half, {{the idea of a}} peace was discarded, and Swedes {{proposed}} to retreat from all Prussia for a 50-year truce if Władysław renounced <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> the Swedish crown.|$|R
