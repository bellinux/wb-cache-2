2500|$|On a few occasions, Obama has {{joked about}} the {{conspiracy}} theories surrounding his birth certificate and citizenship. At the 2010 White House Correspondents' Dinner, Obama {{said there are}} few things in life harder to find and more important to keep than love, and then added, [...] "Well, love and a birth certificate." [...] At the 2011 Gridiron Dinner, Obama referred to Bruce Springsteen's song, [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", and commented, [...] "Some things just bear repeating." [...] On March 17, 2011 (Saint Patrick's Day), Obama said, [...] "Now, speaking of ancestry, {{there has been some}} controversy about my own background. Two years into my presidency, some are still bent on peddling rumors about my origins. So today, I want to put all those rumors to rest. It is true my great-great-great-grandfather really was from Ireland. It’s true. Moneygall, to be precise. I can’t believe <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pointing this out." [...] On January 17, 2012, during a televised tribute to actress Betty White on her 90th birthday, Obama taped a segment in which he wrote White a letter saying that, given her appearance and vitality, he not only could not believe she was 90, he did not believe her, and requested to see her birth certificate.|$|E

6000|$|... "By the way," [...] said Gerald, [...] "there's one thing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her {{jollying}} along all the time, so for goodness' sake don't go {{letting it}} out that we're engaged." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my appointment; and {{the sooner}} Helena Gracedieu and I {{understood}} each other the better.|$|R
30|$|We {{had lots}} of cash flow {{problems}} beyond our control, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> personally investing out of pocket to pay bills.|$|R
6000|$|Violet {{looked at}} him in evident bewilderment, and Nasmyth spoke again deprecatingly. [...] "You see," [...] he explained, [...] "I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> faith with those ranchers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{is three}} months short of eighteen!' he exclaimed. ''Tis too soon. I won't hear of it! If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him off sword in hand, he shall not have her yet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a lot}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{this house}} and pay the maids and everything, and I want to know how I stand. I am not going to make debts. That's hateful." ...|$|E
60|$|And yet, {{just because}} I am an author, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on being photographed. It is {{the fault of}} {{publishers}} and editors, of course, really, {{but it is the}} photographer who comes in for the author's hate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry," [...] he answered, [...] "I <b>have</b> a lot <b>to</b> do this afternoon. I came {{directly}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> your note; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{some other}} people waiting." ...|$|R
6000|$|I couldn't tell her. Knowledge {{like this}} {{was too much for}} the {{ordinary}} run-of-the-mill person. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it <b>to</b> myself. [...] "Nothing," [...] I gasped. I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.|$|R
5000|$|... "In recent years, I've {{been criticized}} for only {{fighting}} at home but we never got offers to go elsewhere and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> boxing," [...] Bute said. [...] "I decided that this time, I'll make my 10th defence in Nottingham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} had not dreamt of doing so, Bertie. But if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on getting fresh outfits for you, {{the idea has}} come into my mind during the last half-hour that I could not do better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, the doctor--both doctors--have told me that. I can eat starches, and albumens, all right, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{right away}} from all carbons and nitrogens. I've been dieting that way for two years, except that now and again I take a little glucose or phosphates." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lizzy rose, and put {{her hand}} upon his shoulder. 'Don't ask that,' she whispered. 'You don't know what you are asking. I must tell you, though I meant not to do it. What I make by that trade is all <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my mother and myself with.' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{arrived here}} late last night, and all day Aunt Martha has kept her room <b>to</b> rest. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> mine also, {{although}} I felt {{as fresh as}} a morning lark, and just {{in the mood for}} enjoyment.|$|R
5000|$|... "I was desperate. I couldn’t {{sleep at}} night. <b>I</b> kept <b>having</b> nightmares {{about all those}} poor girls in the cellar. But <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> talking <b>to</b> Fred. Otherwise, how would their {{families}} ever know what <b>had</b> happened <b>to</b> them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must never}} do that, Aunt Janet. You and I are too good friends <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sense of {{distrust}} or annoyance come between us--which would surely happen if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> thinking that you {{or anyone else}} might be watching me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} feel that I'm making none. She {{looks at me}} half amused and half astonished when I express my opinions; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a curb on myself when I talk to her. In fact, I've once or twice got mad. I can take a joke, but her condescending smile is riling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't {{make any}} matte what you wear," [...] said Mrs. Lander. [...] "It'll be the {{greatest}} thing; and if 't wa'n't for this sea-sickness that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> fightin' off he'a, night and day, I should come up and see you myself. You ah' just lovely in that dance, Clementina." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{not sure}} that I can do it,' said the man, 'for I {{have to go to a}} wedding with this cask of mead which I have been to fetch, and the tap has fallen out on the way, so now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my finger in the tap-hole as I drive.' ...|$|E
3000|$|... “Although it was hard, <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the family}} {{and stay in the}} relationship…I sort of {{accepted}} that this is my fate. There may be something to be resolved or should happen now in relation to my previous life.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "And of course," [...] {{said the}} late Mr Shorter apologetically to me, [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a gentleman at home from keeping an {{appointment}} with a lady, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come with something rather hot and strong--rather urgent. It wouldn't <b>have</b> done <b>to</b> be tame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got a boy I'll {{be sending}} {{to school to}} you next week. He'd oughter gone this week, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him home <b>to</b> help me put the pertaters in; for his father won't work and doesn't work and can't be made to work.|$|R
6000|$|... "'--but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it now. However, I {{promise you}} that I will not get another hat for three years or for the {{duration}} of the war, if it lasts longer than that. Even you'--oh, the sarcasm I put into the 'you'--'cannot say that what I paid was too much when spread over at least three years.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A taxicab," [...] Mr. Parker explained, [...] "is {{of no use}} to me--of no {{more use}} than a hansom cab. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a car in order to slip about quietly. Now in what part of London shall we look for a {{gambling}} hell, Mr. Walmsley? I know of eleven. Name your own street--somewhere in the West End." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid you'll {{have to wait}} an hour or two," [...] he said. [...] "You see, {{there are}} several more big logs ready for hauling down, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the boys supplied. I'll be at liberty after supper, and you can't get back to-night. In the {{meanwhile}} {{you might like to}} walk along to where we're getting the logs out." ...|$|E
50|$|After the game, David was keen to {{play down}} any talk of revenge, she said, “There is no thought of revenge. It is more about wanting to win that medal. She is a hard player <b>to</b> play and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{her out of her}} comfort zone.|$|R
6000|$|... “‘Mind, Davy! I’ve {{told them}} that you {{generally}} sleep aft in the hammock under the awning over the cabin. They have been asking me about your ways and about your ship, too. I told them all <b>I</b> knew. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in with them. And Bamtz would have told them if I hadn’t—you understand?’ ...|$|R
60|$|Luckily plain {{work in the}} school-room had {{not gone}} out in our day, and I could make and mend respectably, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a volume of Shakespeare, Scott, or Wordsworth open before me, and learn it by heart, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> away thoughts, {{which might have been}} good for me; but no--they were working on their own bitterness.|$|R
6000|$|HARRY. Of course not. I say, won't {{you have}} a cigar? [He goes to his desk.] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them locked up. I think the boys find them very much to their taste. [He puts the key into the lock.] Hulloa, the drawer's open. I could have sworn I locked it. [He takes out a box of cigars {{and hands it to}} KNOX.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{believe he}} would get you under his thumb, as he would me. You've got more {{back-bone}} than I have. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> out of temptation; you have noticed that I never drink, and I would rather not look upon Witherby when he is red and giveth his color in the cup. I'm sorry if I've let you in for anything that you regret. But Witherby's sincerity makes him dangerous,--I own that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You must know,' said he, 'that though I am a bachelor, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up a {{considerable}} staff of servants at Hurlstone, {{for it is}} a rambling old place, and takes {{a good deal of}} looking after. I preserve, too, and in the pheasant months I usually have a house-party, so that it would not do to be short-handed. Altogether there are eight maids, the cook, the butler, two footmen, and a boy. The garden and the stables of course have a separate staff.|$|E
2500|$|Growing {{up with an}} oral tradition, {{listening}} to stories from her grandfather (who was {{the model for the}} character of [...] "Mr." [...] in The Color Purple), Walker began writing, very privately, when she was eight years old.

6000|$|... "You {{never can}} {{know just how}} much of a thing {{children}} have taken in, or how much they have understood," [...] she continued, repeating herself, as she did throughout, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this in mind when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my talks with Fay about her father. She wanted to write to him at first, and of course I let her--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't much to tell, sir. I jest {{heard the}} baby yellin', an' went in after it. Then the smoke {{made me feel}} silly, an' <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> sayin' <b>to</b> myself what I heard you tellin' the class, about a clear head bein' {{the next best thing}} to a ladder, else I'd gone under before I found the rope." ...|$|R
