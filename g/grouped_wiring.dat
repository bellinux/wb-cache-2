40|$|Background: One of {{the methods}} used for joining metals {{together}} is welding, which can be carried out using different techniques such as electric spot welding. This study evaluated the effect of electric spot welding on the load deflection rate of stainless steel and chromium-cobalt orthodontic wires. Materials and Methods: In this experimental-laboratory study, load deflection rate of 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch stainless steel and chromium cobalt wires were evaluated in five groups (n = 18) : group one: Stainless steel <b>wires,</b> <b>group</b> two: chromium-cobalt <b>wires,</b> <b>group</b> three: stainless steel wires welded to stainless steel <b>wires,</b> <b>group</b> four: Stainless steel wires welded to chromium-cobalt <b>wires,</b> <b>group</b> five: chromium-cobalt <b>wire</b> welded to chromium-cobalt wires. Afterward, the forces induced by the samples in 0. 5 mm, 1 mm, 1. 5 mm deflection were measured using a universal testing machine. Then mean force measured for each group was compared with other groups. The data were analyzed using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), one-way ANOVA, and paired t-test by the SPSS software. The significance level was set as 0. 05. Results: The Tukey test showed that there were significant differences between the load deflection rates of welded groups compared to control ones (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Considering the limitation of this study, the electric spot welding process performed on stainless steel and chromium-cobalt wires increased their load deflection rates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the amount of nickel and titanium ions released from two wires with different shapes and a similar surface area. Methods Forty round nickel-titanium (NiTi) arch wires with the diameter of 0. 020  in. and 40 rectangular NiTi arch wires with the diameter of 0. 016 [*]×[*] 0. 016  in. were immersed in artificial saliva during a 21 -day period. The surface area of both wires was 0. 44  in. 2. Wires were separately dipped into polypropylene tubes containing 50  ml of buffer solution and were incubated and maintained at 37  °C. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was used to measure the amount of ions released after exposure lengths of 1  h, 24  h, 1  week, and 3  weeks. Repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey tests were used to evaluate the data. Results The results indicated that the amount of nickel and titanium concentrations was significantly higher in the rectangular <b>wire</b> <b>group.</b> The most significant release of all metals was measured after the first hour of immersion. In the rectangular <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> 243 [*]±[*] 4. 2  ng/ml of nickel was released after 1  h, while 221. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 7  ng/ml of nickel was released in the round <b>wire</b> <b>group.</b> Similarly, 243. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 8  ng/ml of titanium was released in the rectangular <b>wire</b> <b>group</b> and a significantly lower amount of 211. 9 [*]±[*] 2. 3  ng/ml of titanium was released in the round <b>wire</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions Release of metal ions was influenced by the shape of the wire and increase of time...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the application value of transpancreatic septotomy with pancreatic duct stent or guide wire in difficult {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). MethodsA total of 309 patients who underwent difficult ERCP in Medical Center for Digestive Diseases, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from June 2012 to May 2014 were selected; 228 patients among them received placement of pancreatic duct guide wire/plastic stent or conventional precut papillotomy, and achieved successful bile duct cannulation; the other 81 patients received transpancreatic septotomy with placement of guide <b>wire</b> (guide <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> 37 patients) or pancreatic duct stent (stent group, 44 patients). The success rate and incidence of complications were compared between these two methods for cannulation. ResultsOf the 81 patients who underwent transpancreatic septotomy, 77 achieved successful bile duct cannulation, and the success rate {{did not differ significantly}} between the guide <b>wire</b> <b>group</b> and stent group (91. 89 % (34 / 37) vs 97. 73 % (43 / 44); P＞ 0. 05). Seventeen patients experienced complications, with 8 cases of acute pancreatitis, 3 cases of hemorrhage, and 1 case of biliary tract infection in the guide <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> and 3 cases of acute pancreatitis, 1 case of hemorrhage, 1 case of biliary tract infection in the stent group; compared with the guide <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> the stent group had a significantly lower incidence of complications (11. 36 % vs 32. 43 %; χ 2 = 3. 75, P＜ 0. 05) and a significantly lower incidence of acute pancreatitis (6. 82 % vs 21. 62 %;χ 2 = 2. 25, P＜ 0. 05). ConclusionTranspancreatic septotomy can further improve the success rate of bile duct cannulation with ERCP. The stent group has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of pancreatitis after ERCP than the guide <b>wire</b> <b>group,</b> and thus the application of stent is safer in clinical practice...|$|R

30|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty pieces of {{rectangular}} stainless steel wires (0.43 [*]×[*] 0.64  mm) were randomly assigned into four groups. In each group, there were 15 pieces of bent wires and 15 straight ones. Prior to measurements of the wires, as individual experimental groups (group 1, 2, and 3), the wires were exposed to artificial saliva for 4  weeks at pH 5.6, 6.6, and 7.6, respectively. A control <b>group</b> of <b>wires</b> (<b>group</b> 4) remained in air {{for the same period}} of time before sent for measurements. Surface roughness (Ra-value) was measured by a profilometer.

40|$|Background: About {{half of the}} orthodontists recycle and reuse {{orthodontic}} wires {{because of}} their costs. So when talking about reuse and sterilization of wires, their effects on mechanical properties of wires should be clarified. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effects of sterilization and clinical use on mechanical properties of stainless steel wires. Materials and Methods: Thirty stainless steel orthodontic wires were divided into three equal groups of control, autoclave (sterilized by autoclave), and recycle <b>group</b> (<b>wires</b> were used for orthodontic patients up to 4 weeks, cleaned by isopropyl alcohol and sterilized by autoclave). The mechanical properties (tensile test, three-point loading test for load-deflection curve) were determined. Results: Fracture force, yield strength, stiffness and modulus of elasticity in recycle groups were significantly lower than the other groups (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Although recycle wires were softer than those of control group, relatively small differences and also various properties of available wires have obscured the clinical predictability of their application. There is seemingly no problem in terms of mechanical properties to recycle orthodontic wires...|$|R
