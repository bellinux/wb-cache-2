5|$|In April 1944, {{under the}} command of I Airborne Corps, the brigade took part in Exercise Mush. This was a three-day <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{counties}} of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire, during which the entire 6th Airborne Division was landed by air. Unknown to the troops involved, the exercise was a full-scale rehearsal for the division's involvement in the imminent Allied invasion of Normandy. In the invasion, the 6th Airborne Division's two parachute brigades would land {{in the early hours of}} 6 June in Operation Tonga; the 6th Airlanding Brigade would not arrive until almost dusk on the same day.

5|$|According to Hussein's {{account of}} the events, Abu Nuwar and the Free Officers had planned for the Bedouin-dominated First Infantry Regiment in Zarqa to {{participate}} in a training <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert without ammunition to render it unavailable for Hussein to use against a planned anti-government demonstration scheduled to be held by Nabulsi on 14 April. Hussein was still wary of Nabulsi due to an alleged intercept of a message from Nasser imploring Nabulsi to resist his dismissal from the premiership. Hussein was informed of the Free Officers' alleged plot by Sharif Naser and Bedouin officers from Zarqa on the evening of 13 April. The incident coincided with a delivery by Abu Nuwar of an ultimatum to Prime Minister Said al-Mufti (Nabulsi's successor) warning Hussein to appoint a government reflecting the will of the elected parliament or face an army revolt. Al-Mufti apparently broke down emotionally in Hussein's presence, prompting the latter to inquire from Abu Nuwar about the ultimatum, to which Abu Nuwar professed his surprise. Hussein then brought Abu Nuwar along with him to inspect the scene at Zarqa, where Hussein was told by loyalist officers from Zarqa that rumors of his death had provoked heavy clashes between his loyalists and those of Abu Nuwar and that only the physical presence of Hussein would {{put an end to the}} fighting. Moreover, Hussein was told that Rashid and Ma'an Abu Nuwar (a distant cousin of Abu Nuwar) had been ordered to Amman to besiege the royal palace and arrest Hussein.|$|E
5|$|Following Königs {{return from}} the Baltic, the ship was tasked with guard duties in the North Sea and with {{providing}} support for minesweepers. König returned to the Baltic on 22 December for further training, which lasted until 8 January 1918. Another round of exercises was conducted from 23 February to 11 March. On 20 April König steamed out to assist a German patrol that was engaged with British forces. The ship {{was part of the}} force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage. König was briefly grounded in the northern harbor of the island of Helgoland on 30 May. Two months later, on 31 July, König and the rest of IIISquadron covered a minesweeping unit in the North Sea. The ship then went to the Baltic for training on 7–18 August, after which König returned to the North Sea. König conducted her last <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic starting on 28 September; the maneuvers lasted until 1 October.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser Wilhelm II {{participated in}} an <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904, after which she {{returned}} to Kiel. She {{then went to the}} Norwegian city of Ålesund to assist with the major fire that devastated the largely wooden city on 23 January. Squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March. A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May, and Kaiser Wilhelm II was again present at Kiel Week in June, where she was visited by Britain's King Edward VII, Lord William Palmer, and Prince Louis of Battenberg. In June, Kaiser Wilhelm II won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery. The following month, the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain, including a stop at Plymouth on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; the I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea {{with the rest of the}} fleet. The squadron stopped in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the second}} series, Tom starts a brief {{relationship}} with Vicky Westbrook (Natasha Little), which he ends due to her behaviour after an EERIE (Extreme Emergency Response Initiative <b>Exercise)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth episode. In the following episode, Vicky retaliates by posting his phone number in Soho telephone boxes and clubs, garnering him unwanted attention. While Tom has Sam Buxton (Shauna Macdonald) find and destroy every leaflet, CIA liaison Christine Dale (Megan Dodds) makes Vicky stop the harassment. At {{the end of the}} episode, he starts a relationship with Dale, which superior Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) disapproves of, demanding that he end it. In later episodes, a shift in consciousness starts to interfere with Tom's work, such as when he goes undercover to stop a renegade British Army major. In the series two finale, he learns from Dale that an American assassin, Mickey Karharias, is visiting the UK. It is later revealed Karharias was actually killed, and the entire operation was orchestrated by supposedly dead CIA agent Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana), who is seeking revenge on Tom for ruining his daughter's life when Tom recruited her. Joyce frames Tom for assassinating the Chief of the Defence Staff. While Tom attempts to prove his innocence, Harry corners him, forcing Tom to wound Harry and escape into the North Sea. At the end of the episode, the team assumes he drowned.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} named after Honoré Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, an early leader of the French Revolution. Construction of Mirabeau began on 8 May 1906 by the Arsenal de Lorient and the ship was laid down on 4 May 1908. She was {{launched}} on 28 October 1909 and was completed on 1 August 1911. Mirabeau, together with four of her sisters, participated in a large naval review by the President of France, Armand Fallières, off Cap Brun on 4 September 1911. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Second Division of the First Squadron (escadre) of the Mediterranean Fleet when she was commissioned. The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between Provence and Tunisia in May–June 1913 and the subsequent naval review conducted by the President of the Council, Raymond Poincaré, on 7 June 1913. Afterwards, Mirabeau joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October–December 1913, making port visits in Egypt, Syria, and Greece, and participated in the grand fleet <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Mediterranean in May 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the I Squadron {{went on a}} pair of {{training}} cruises during 9–19 January and 27 February– 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The summer cruise ended on 9 August; the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, Swinemünde, and Flensburg, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; Kaiser Wilhelm II and the main German fleet were anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit's impact was lessened by the ongoing Anglo-German naval arms race. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. During the exercises, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse won the Kaiser's Schiesspreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the I Squadron. In October, the ship was reassigned to the I Division of the II Squadron. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. On the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.|$|E
