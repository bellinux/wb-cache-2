5|$|Russell Eugene Weston, Jr. (born December 28, 1956), {{also known}} as Rusty, grew up in Valmeyer, Illinois.

The only attempt his high school classmates made at <b>inviting</b> <b>him</b> to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written across it. Many of Weston's Montana neighbors had disliked him, and often ignored him. They considered him to be unusual, and sometimes eccentric. Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his television satellite dish to spy on his actions and believed Navy SEALs were hiding in his cornfield.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your {{silence is}} a {{sufficient}} answer,' said she, as I {{hesitated for a}} reply.

5|$|Tolman and Conant, {{in their}} role as the project's {{scientific}} advisers, drew {{up a list of}} candidate scientists and had them rated by scientists already working on the project. Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work. At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, <b>inviting</b> <b>him</b> to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E
5|$|War fever ran high, and by April, McKinley {{reported}} to Congress that efforts at diplomatic resolution had failed; a week later, Congress declared war.

Day, a McKinley associate of long standing, superseded his boss as the real power in the State Department. Sherman, sensing {{that he was being}} made a mere figurehead and recognizing, at last, his declining health and worsening memory, resigned his office on April 25, 1898.|$|E

At his new school, Chris is shunned by the wealthy students at the academy, being both verbally and physically assaulted, including being hit with socks full of paper money.

5|$|In early 1018 Vladislav led an {{unsuccessful}} attack against Dyrrhachium, outside whose walls {{he found his}} death. The chronicle asserts that Vladimir appeared before Vladislav when he dined in his camp outside Dyrrhachium, and slew him while he cried for help. In the same year, the Byzantine army—led by the victorious Emperor Basil—terminated the First Bulgarian Empire. As Vladimir and Kosara had no children, his successor was his uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia. Accompanied by soldiers, he set off for Duklja to establish himself as its ruler, probably {{in the first half}} of 1018. When he came to Kotor, the town's inhabitants ambushed and killed him after <b>inviting</b> <b>him</b> to a banquet, and his soldiers returned to Travunia. Duklja was not mentioned again in the sources until the 1030s. Some scholars believe that it was placed under direct Byzantine rule around 1018, while others believe it remained a Byzantine vassal state under an unknown native ruler.|$|E

The final team includes Cathy, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Jim, infuriating Dwight.

5|$|R.E.M. put Sweet {{in touch}} with Easter, who wrote Sweet a number of long letters, and {{suggested}} he move to Athens {{after graduating from high}} school.

All three sent Sweet postcards saying he should come perform in Athens, with Lynda and Linda <b>inviting</b> <b>him</b> to open for Oh-OK there. Sweet told his parents that he wanted to study at the University of Georgia, in Athens. Within weeks of moving there, he had become a member of Oh-OK, who recorded their EP Furthermore What in August 1983 with him on board. While a member of Oh-OK, Sweet also began collaborating with Michael Stipe as the band Community Trolls.|$|E
5000|$|Nady {{joined the}} 2011 {{revolution}} {{from the very}} beginning, participating politically at Tahrir Square and drawing cartoons on the spot, <b>inviting</b> those around <b>him</b> to suggest ideas and captions.

Drawing it off into the glasses with the skill of a practised hand, and mixing it with about a third part of water, Mr Quilp assigned to Richard Swiveller his portion, and lighting his pipe from an end of a candle in a very old and battered lantern, drew himself together upon a seat and puffed away.|$|R
5000|$|... The {{departure}} of the trio from Earth to Mongo is depicted. In order to make Zarkov sympathetic from the start, the original story element of him forcing Flash and Dale to board his rocket is changed to <b>him</b> <b>inviting</b> them in when they flee into his hidden laboratory/launch site, threatened by flooding molten lava. In this case, Zarkov's rocket is their only chance of survival and they board without hesitation with Zarkov's apologies that he cannot drop them off before continuing to Mongo. For their part, Flash and Dale understand Zarkov's mission and quickly agree to help him.|$|R
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{explained}} {{in his memoirs}} that Mikhaíl Azanchevsky had taken over that year {{as director of the}} Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and <b>inviting</b> <b>him</b> to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E
5|$|In September 1858, the Brazier family accused Mrs Mole, a labourer's {{wife who}} lived in East Thorpe, Essex, of bewitching their {{daughter}} and livestock. Hoping to have the bewitchment removed, they consulted a local cunning-man known as Burrell, who lived at nearby Copford. When Burrell was unable to help, they proceeded to consult Murrell, <b>inviting</b> <b>him</b> to come to East Thorpe to remove the curse. Murrell's planned visit generated much anticipation in East Thorpe's community, with the local rector attempting to calm the situation by requesting that the parish relieving officer move the allegedly bewitched girl to the union-house, where she could be examined by the parish surgeon. Nevertheless, the officer of the poor refused to comply, asserting that Murrell's arrival would correct the problem. Persisting, the rector applied to the local magistrate to ensure that police {{would be in the}} village on the day of Murrell's arrival, to ensure that the crowd would be controlled. On the day itself, a crowd of two hundred had gathered, and proceeded to Mrs Mole's house with the intention of carrying out folk justice; concerned by this illegal behaviour, the rector stood outside of her door and forbade the crowd entry, prior to police arriving and dispersing the mob.|$|E
5|$|Relations had {{apparently}} warmed between Tyndall and Jordan, for they met {{up after the}} latter {{was released from prison}} in 1968, and Tyndall again met with Jordan in Coventry in 1972, there <b>inviting</b> <b>him</b> to join the NF. However, a poor showing in the February 1974 general election resulted in Tyndall being challenged by two groups within the party, the 'Strasserites' and the 'Populists', the latter of whom were largely Powellite ex-members of the Conservative Party. The Populist challenge was successful and in October 1974 Tyndall was replaced as chairman by John Kingsley Read. Tyndall then used Spearhead as a vehicle to criticise rival factions with the NF. As a result, he was expelled from the party during a disciplinary tribunal in November 1975. Tyndall took the issue to the high court, who overturned the expulsion. The 'Populists' then left the party, splitting to form the National Party in January 1976, which for a short time proved more electorally successful than the NF. Back in the party and with his main rivals gone, Tyndall regained the position of chairman.|$|E
50|$|In the Methodist {{controversy}} on justification {{by faith}} provoked by John Wesley's Arminianism and the proceedings {{at the conference}} of 1770, Shirley took an active part on the Calvinist side with his cousin, the Countess of Huntingdon, as whose chaplain he acted for a time, and Augustus Toplady. A circular issued by <b>him</b> <b>inviting</b> the clergy and laity to oppose Wesley drew from John William Fletcher of Madeley his ‘Checks to Antinomianism,’ and Shirley's influence embittered the dispute. William Romaine, Henry Venn, and John Berridge were among his close associates. His portrait hung {{in the library of}} Cheshunt College, in the foundation of which he took an interest.|$|R
50|$|The 2004-05 season {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} season for Merson, on and off the field. Walsall went out of all cup competitions against lower league teams, and it was reported that Merson had had a rift with his wife, and had started drinking and gambling again, whilst the press reported on <b>him</b> <b>inviting</b> goalkeeper Mark Bosnich back into the game. Walsall slipped close to a second consecutive relegation. Merson responded by making several key signings on transfer deadline day; Julian Joachim, Andy Oakes, Anthony Gerrard (cousin of Steven Gerrard), Craig Pead and David Perpetuini. Merson's side went undefeated during May 2005, securing League One status for another year.|$|R
