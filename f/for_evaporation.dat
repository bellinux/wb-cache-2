More distant objects are unstable due to the gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough <b>for</b> <b>evaporation</b> of rocks to be the limiting factor in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area <b>for</b> <b>evaporation.</b> Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E

25|$|Field {{evaporation}} is {{an effect}} {{that can occur}} when an atom bonded at {{the surface of a}} material is {{in the presence of a}} sufficiently high and appropriately directed electric field, where the electric field is the differential of electric potential (voltage) with respect to distance.

25|$|As {{ambient air}} becomes hotter, {{additional}} evaporation {{can take place}} lower in the trachea making {{its way to the}} posterior sacs, shunting the lung surface. The trachea acts as a buffer <b>for</b> <b>evaporation</b> because of the length, and the controlled vascularization. The Gular is also heavily vascularized; its purpose is for cooling blood, but also evaporation, as previously stated. Air flowing through the trachea can be either laminar or turbulent depending {{on the state of the}} bird. When the common ostrich is breathing normally, under no heat stress, air flow is laminar. When the common ostrich is experiencing heat stress from the environment the air flow is considered turbulent. This suggests that laminar air flow causes little to no heat transfer, while under heat stress turbulent airflow can cause maximum heat transfer within the trachea.|$|E

Consider that the water of the Ebro, the Rhine, the Po, the Danube, the Don, the Dnieper, and the Nile, all flow directly or indirectly into the Mediterranean; that the volume of fresh water which they pour into it is so enormous that fresh water may sometimes be baled up {{from the surface of the}} sea off the Delta of the Nile, while the land is not yet in sight; that the water of the Black Sea is half fresh, and that a current of three or four miles an hour constantly streams from it Mediterraneanwards through the Bosphorus;--consider, in addition, that no fewer than ten submarine springs of fresh water are known to burst up in the Mediterranean, some of them so large that Admiral Smyth calls them [...] "subterranean rivers of amazing volume and force"; and it would seem, on the face of the matter, that the sun must have enough to do to keep the level of the Mediterranean down; and that, possibly, we may have to seek for the cause of the small superiority in saline contents of the Mediterranean water in some condition other than solar evaporation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Evaporation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of hydrologic cycle. Accurate estimation of this parameter is used for studies such as water balance, irrigation system design, and water resource management. In order to estimate the evaporation, direct measurement methods or physical and empirical models can be used. Using direct methods require installing meteorological stations and instruments <b>for</b> measuring <b>evaporation.</b> Installing such instruments in various areas requires specific facilities and cost which is impossible to be specified. Pan evaporation {{is one of the}} most popular instruments for direct measuring. In this research, by using daily temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, sunshine hours, and evaporation data in meteorological station and neural network model, daily evaporation is estimated. Network training using daily data takes three years and network testing takes one year in which data is standardize for training and testing the model. In this model, a feed forward multiple layer network with a hidden layer and sigmoid function is used. The results show the suitable capability and acceptable accuracy of artificial neural networks in estimating of daily <b>evaporation.</b> Best model <b>for</b> estimation of <b>evaporation</b> is ANN (5 - 4 - 1), it have MSE 0. 006716 and R 2 0. 725398.
