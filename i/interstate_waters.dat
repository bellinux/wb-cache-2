40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} evolving challenges of <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> disputes in India. It examines how the transboundary geographies of these conflicts relate {{in turn to}} the politics of dispute emergence, recurrence, and mitigation. Both formal statist spaces of contestation, and informal political spaces of nonstate engagement, are considered in this way. In contrast to a geopolitical enframing of the disputes as `water wars,' I offer the perspective of an `anti-geopolitical eye,' providing an embodied view from the ground-up of the relational linkages, practices, and processes mediating the political ecology of transboundary water sharing. The study uses mixed qualitative research methods involving analysis of archival sources and government reports, interviews, and field research to study the politics of <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> disputes in India. Besides a legal and political genealogy of disputes resolution in India more generally, the study also critically examines the empirical case of the Krishna river water dispute between the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. The analysis is informed by the theoretical traditions of critical geopolitics, political ecology, and postcolonial analysis as they relate to state-making and democracy in India. Viewed through the lens of transboundary sharing of interstate rivers, this work describes the spatiality of the overarching postcolonial condition of India. This inquiry into the colonial present of contentious politics has led to several conclusions concerning political mobilization and the nexus between the politics of <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> disputes and democratic politics; the particular nature of the political ecology of the disputes, and transboundary water conflicts generally; and state-making, interstate relations, and democracy in India. These conclusions offer lessons for informing <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> dispute resolution policies: the need for reviewing the bar on the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> disputes, and for supplementing legal approaches with appropriate institutions, practices, and governance structures to respond to the enduring challenges of <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> disputes in a more inclusive and dynamic way. Overall, the analysis of the political ecology of <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> disputes also offers insights for advancing efforts to theorize transboundary water conflicts...|$|R

2500|$|The SWANCC site ponds {{are known}} in section 404 parlance as [...] "isolated waters"- waters {{that are not}} {{traditionally}} navigable or interstate, nor tributaries thereof, nor adjacent to any of these. Long ago, the Supreme Court in United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. upheld the Corps' authority under section 404 to regulate wetlands (and other waters) adjacent to navigable and <b>interstate</b> <b>waters,</b> and their tributaries. It expressly left open the question, however, whether isolated waters, not being adjacent, lie within the reach of section 404, or, for that matter, within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Both before and after Riverside Bayview, the lower courts have wrestled with these questions.|$|E
2500|$|Federal {{policies}} {{regarding the}} national water resources, within which hydropower exists, were already well-established long before modern electricity {{was known to}} exist; as such, previous uses and decisions, as well as government policies and agencies affected how hydropower was later developed. [...] Chief among federal agencies was {{the involvement of the}} United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). [...] While federal policy regarding <b>interstate</b> <b>waters</b> dates to the constitutional landmark decision under the Commerce Clause in 1824, its implementation was initially limited to development of navigation and its safety, among other demands for such internal improvements. [...] Shortly thereafter, with the General Survey Act the USACE took the lead. [...] By the 1850s and increasingly later, flood control was added to the demands for improvements, as well as recognizing the need to investigate and better understand the science involved. [...] Much of these early improvements were legislated and authorized by rivers and harbors legislation and conducted by the Corps. [...] With the advent of the progressive era {{before the turn of the}} 20th century, new, different and often competing technical demands were being made for water resource improvements, including irrigation in the western states and demand for the recently developed electric power in all states. [...] Conservation and better utilization of natural resources in a historic relationship, first became topics of concern and consideration for policy at this time.|$|E

In the western United States, for example, the 1922 Colorado River Compact divides the Colorado River basin into two areas, the Upper Division (comprising Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming) and the Lower Division (Nevada, Arizona and California).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} closely {{examines the}} merits, weaknesses, and potential of decentralized environmental regulation. I examine three areas {{of particular concern}} {{in the structure of}} environmental regulation. In the first chapter, I examine how information problems resulting from incorrectly specified atmospheric models are likely to affect economic efficiency in a permit market. While permit markets have been heralded as a promising solution for controlling environmentally damaging emissions, there is no formal research linking the atmospheric model, which directly affects permit prices, with economic outcomes. In the chapter, I develop a generalized theoretical model that demonstrates the problems that are likely to arise when there is uncertainty in the underlying atmospheric parameter estimates. As it turns out, permit markets operating with incorrectly specified atmospheric models may result in large losses in economic efficiency, even if the permit market is operating ideally in an economic sense. The second chapter analyzes a much broader issue, that of state versus federal environmental regulation. The chapter focuses on the methods used by states attempting to control <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> pollution in the Ohio Valley in the early 1900 s. The time period was chosen to predate federal intervention into environmental regulation and, hence, allows for a clean test of how states might be expected to address difficult pollution problems under a system of state regulation. Using a simple game theoretic model, the paper explores <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> pollution control compacts and their uses in addressing <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> pollution. I find that states were able to overcome significant bargaining difficulties in formulating the compacts, which ultimately led to effective control of <b>interstate</b> <b>water</b> pollution. The final chapter focuses on voluntary overcompliance by firms facing environmental standards. The paper models environmental regulation according to the EPA's Best Available Control Technology (BACT). The model predicts voluntary overcompliance by firms as they attempt to raise the (endogenous) environmental standard and, in the process, raise their rivals' costs. The paper also demonstrates the merits of nonuniform environmental standards. In attempting to elicit efficient levels of R&D investment, the regulatory authority may discourage socially wasteful overinvestment in pollution technology through the use of nonuniform standards...|$|R
