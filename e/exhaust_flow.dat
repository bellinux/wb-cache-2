5|$|The {{valve gear}} that was settled upon was a {{modified}} form of Caprotti valve gear, the novel rotary cam-driven British Caprotti valve gear developed by Heenan & Froude with poppet valves. This {{was based on}} Italian locomotive practice and allowed precise control of steam admission to the cylinders while improving <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> and boiler draughting characteristics {{when compared to the}} more conventional Walschaerts and Stephenson valve gear. On paper this created a free-steaming, hard-working locomotive capable of hauling heavy loads over long distances but, in practice, fundamental design errors and undetected deviations from the drawings made during construction combined to prevent the locomotive from achieving its expected performance during British Railways ownership.|$|E
25|$|The Type B2 cabinet (also {{known as}} a Total Exhaust BSC) is {{expensive}} to operate because no air is recirculated within. Therefore, this type is mainly found in such applications as toxicology laboratories, where the ability to safely use hazardous chemistry is important. Additionally, there is the risk that contaminated air would flow into the laboratory if the exhaust system for a Type B1 or B2 cabinet were to fail. To mitigate this risk, cabinets of these types generally monitor the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow,</b> shutting off the supply blower and sounding an alarm if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> is insufficient.|$|E
25|$|A {{side effect}} of {{breaking}} the strong molecular bonds of dioxin {{is the potential for}} breaking the bonds of nitrogen gas (N2) and oxygen gas (O2) in the supply air. As the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> cools, these highly reactive detached atoms spontaneously reform bonds into reactive oxides such as NOx in the flue gas, which can result in smog formation and acid rain if they were released directly into the local environment. These reactive oxides must be further neutralized with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or selective non-catalytic reduction (see below).|$|E

With the increase of the <b>exhaust</b> mass <b>flow,</b> the lambda outlet signal increases nonlinearly; emissions are better {{at the beginning and}} then turns deteriorated {{in the case of a}} high mass flow after the lean-rich transition.

25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, cracking pressure and flow resistance of the exhaust valve, or intentional overpressure in a full-face mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the exhaust valve. A consistent variation in delivered pressure difference does not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but the effort required for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow,</b> but not necessarily to the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative pressure breathing, as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E

500|$|In addition, an {{exhaust system}} to reduce noise levels to below those from ejector {{exhausts}} was devised for the North Star/Argonaut. This [...] "cross-over" [...] system took the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> from the inboard {{bank of cylinders}} up-and-over the engine before discharging the exhaust stream on the outboard side of the UPP nacelle. As a result, sound levels were reduced by between 5 and 8 decibels. The modified exhaust also conferred an increase in horsepower over the unmodified system of , resulting in a 5 knot improvement in true air speed. Still-air range of the aircraft was also improved by around 4 per cent. The modified engine was designated the [...] "TMO" [...] and the modified exhaust system was supplied as kit that could be installed on existing engines either by the operator or by Rolls-Royce.|$|E
500|$|Maunsell {{initiated}} trials with Urie N15 No.442 in 1924, {{and proved}} that better performance {{could be obtained}} by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements. As a result, Clayton reduced the N15 cylinder diameter to [...] and replaced the safety valves with Ross pop valves set to [...] boiler pressure. The Urie boiler was retained, though the Eastleigh superheater {{was replaced by a}} Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area. This was supplemented by a larger steam chest and an increased-diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds. It incorporated a rim and capuchon to control <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> into the atmosphere. Valve events (the timing of valve movements with the piston) were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re-balanced to reduce hammerblow.|$|E
500|$|In 1940, after {{receiving}} a request in March of that year from the Ministry of Aircraft Production for a high-rated (...) Merlin for use as an alternative engine to the turbocharged Hercules VIII used in the prototype high-altitude Vickers Wellington V bomber, Rolls-Royce started experiments {{on the design of}} a two-stage supercharger and an engine fitted with this was bench-tested in April 1941, eventually becoming the Merlin 60. The basic design used a modified Vulture supercharger for the first stage while a Merlin 46 supercharger was used for the second. A liquid-cooled intercooler on top of the supercharger casing was used to prevent the compressed air/fuel mixture from becoming too hot. Also considered was an exhaust-driven turbocharger but, although a lower fuel consumption was an advantage the added weight and the need to add extra ducting for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> and waste-gates, meant that this option was rejected in favour of the two-stage supercharger. [...] Fitted with the two-stage two-speed supercharger, the Merlin 60 series gained 300 horsepower (224kW) at [...] over the Merlin 45 series, at which altitude a Spitfire IX was nearly [...] faster than a Spitfire V.|$|E

50|$|Spray towers are {{constructed}} in various sizes - small ones to handle small gas flows of 0.05 m³/s (106 ft³/min) or less, and large ones to handle large <b>exhaust</b> <b>flows</b> of 50 m³/s (106,000 m³/min) or greater. Because {{of the low}} gas velocity required, units handling large gas flow rates tend to be large in size. Operating characteristics of spray towers are presented in the following table.|$|R
2500|$|The {{variable}} geometry exhaust nozzle, {{developed by}} SNECMA, {{consisted of two}} [...] "eyelids" [...] which varied {{their position in the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> dependent on the flight regime, for example when fully closed (into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow)</b> they acted as thrust reversers, aiding deceleration from landing to taxi speed.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{change in}} 1970 was {{the switch to}} the [...] "dog-leg" [...] heads. These heads flow 20% better on the exhaust side than the 1966-'69 {{rectangle}} port heads and are thus the best for performance. There are two reasons for the flow increase: First, {{the area of the}} port is larger, due to the dog leg. Second, the shape of the port floor was changed from a concave to a convex curve. The concave floor tended to bend the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> upwards which caused turbulence when the flow was forced to go down into the exhaust manifolds. By switching to a convex floor the curvature of the flow starts in the head and proceeds much more smoothly into the exhaust manifold resulting in less turbulence and better flow.|$|E
2500|$|Two-stage {{variable}} twin-turbos {{employ a}} small turbocharger at low speeds {{and a large}} one at higher speeds. They are connected in a series so that boost pressure from one turbocharger is multiplied by another, hence the name [...] "2-stage." [...] The distribution of exhaust gas is continuously variable, so the transition from using the small turbocharger to the large one can be done incrementally. Twin turbochargers are primarily used in Diesel engines. For example, in Opel bi-turbo Diesel, only the smaller turbocharger works at low speed, providing high torque at 1,500–1,700rpm. Both turbochargers operate together in mid range, with the larger one pre-compressing the air, which the smaller one further compresses. A bypass valve regulates the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flow</b> to each turbocharger. At higher speed (2,500 to 3,000 RPM) only the larger turbocharger runs.|$|E

40|$|Scoping {{calculations}} {{to address}} the mixing behavior of benzene in the vapor space of Tank 48 and estimate maximum benzene concentrations have been completed. The analysis was focused on determining whether a detailed assessment using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the Tank 48 vapor space could support Safety Class calculations. The calculations included nominal boundary conditions for air inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>flows,</b> as well as benzene evolution from the tank liquid surface. Additional calculations included a reduced benzene evolution rate, reduced air inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>flows,</b> and a modified air inlet location.

The results showed that the vapor space was fairly well mixed and that benzene concentrations were relatively low for typical operating conditions. All the calculations addressing sensitivity issues such as differencing options, mesh density, and transient performance in the model demonstrated that the scoping model could capture the necessary phenomena without introducing nonphysical behavior because of the numerical discretization. Therefore, refining and upgrading the present scoping model is feasible for support of safety class calculations...|$|R
