30|$|The suction end of {{the return}} piping {{arrangement}} was connected to an air manifold with three automated control valves. When slurry pH rose above the desired set point (pH 7.0) the control valve connected to the flue gas would open, allowing flue gas to be introduced to the feed tank. When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue <b>gas</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would close and another control valve would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO 2 in the head space from venting from the system. The third control valve {{was used as a}} relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system. In this manner, as CO 2 was consumed by the algae, additional CO 2 was automatically fed into the system as needed to maintain the desired operating pH.|$|E

The wells with separators were located above 7,200 ft elevation, ranging upward to 9,000 ft.

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{development}} of a simulator for the Siemens Gas Tur-bine SGT- 600. An explanation on how a gas turbine works is also given, as well as the principles behind the control system used by Siemens to control the turbine. For Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery to be able to test its control sys-tem before delivering a gas turbine to the customer, a simulator is needed. The control system needs to be adjusted for every unique gas turbine, since there are several options for the customer to choose between when ordering the turbine. A control system standard is under development, which also needs to be tested in a simulator. The framework for the simulator, i. e. the hardware and software that form the simulator system, was predefined to suit this specific purpose. The Siemens software SIMIT is used for developing the model. SIMIT is a real time simulation tool where models are constructed using blocks, similar to MATLAB Simulink. A gas turbine is basically a heat engine that produces mechanical energy or electricity. The main task of the control system is to control the fuel flow to the combustion chamber and by that keeping the machine at desired speed. The gas turbine model was developed using measurement data from a site in Hungary, where a gas turbine of the type SGT- 600 is in service. The model is based on simplified relations between the signals. By analyzing measurement data and learning about the functionality of a gas turbine it was found out that the speed of the gas generator affected most other sig-nals, like temperatures and pressures. The gas generator speed was found to be dependent on the heat flow, which is determined by the openings of the <b>gas</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> As a result of this thesis a working simulator for the gas turbine SGT- 600 has been developed. The simulator can be used for testing the control sys-tem standard and for testing the control system when adapting it to a spe-cific delivery. It is also suitable for educational purposes, for example to instruct customers...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a control system that optimally {{controls}} the power output of a Brayton cycle based power plant. The original design of the PBMR power plant is considered. It uses helium gas as working fluid. The power output of the system can be manipulated by changing the helium inventory to the gas cycle. A linear model of the power plant is derived and modelled in Simulink®. This linear model is used as an evaluation platform for different control strategies. Four actuators are identified that are responsible for manipulating the helium inventory. They are: A booster tank A <b>gas</b> cycle bypass <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> Low-pressure injection at the low-pressure side of the system High-pressure extraction at the high-pressure side of the system The control system has to intelligently generate set point values for each of these actuators to eventually control the power output.

An optimisation technique called Genetic Algorithms is used to adapt the gain constants of the Fuzzy control strategy.

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R
