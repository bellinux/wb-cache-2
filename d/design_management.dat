5|$|<b>Design</b> <b>management</b> {{has taken}} a more {{strategic}} role within business since 2000, and more academic programs for <b>design</b> <b>management</b> have been established. <b>Design</b> <b>management</b> has been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the European Union as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations. The main issues and debates included the topics of design thinking, strategic <b>design</b> <b>management,</b> design leadership, and product service systems. <b>Design</b> <b>management</b> {{was influenced by the}} following design trends: sustainable design, inclusive design, interactive design, design probes, product clinics, and co-design. It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and design thinking.|$|E
5|$|<b>Design</b> <b>management</b> {{is not a}} {{standard}} model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. <b>Design</b> <b>management</b> processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different industries and enterprises with different sizes and traditions, whilst having different target groups and markets to serve. <b>Design</b> <b>management</b> is multifaceted, {{and so are the}} different applications of and views on <b>design</b> <b>management.</b> The function of <b>design</b> <b>management</b> in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.|$|E
5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, <b>design</b> <b>management</b> and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, <b>design</b> <b>management</b> is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. <b>Design</b> <b>management</b> requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires <b>design</b> <b>management</b> to know how to get there.|$|E

5|$|Three {{important}} {{works were}} published in 1990: the Publication of <b>Design</b> <b>Management</b> – A Handbook of Issues and Methods by Mark Oakley (Editor), the book <b>Design</b> <b>Management</b> by French researcher Brigitte Borja de Mozota, and the Publication of <b>Design</b> <b>Management</b> – Papers from the London Business School by Peter Gorb (Editor). This new method-based <b>design</b> <b>management</b> approach helped to improve communication amongst technical and marketing managers. Examples of the new methods included trend research, the product effect triad, style mapping, milieus, product screenings, empiric design methods, and service design, giving design a more communicative and central role within organizations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Designing</b> <b>management</b> systems {{based on}} serviceoriented {{principles}} is a pragmatic approach {{to handle the}} challenges that distributed management is faced today. In order to conform to service-oriented principles, {{the elements of the}} management systems architecture – the management services – have to be designed along domain-specific concepts. Thus, modeling the domain IT Management becomes evident within service-oriented development processes. Considering existing approaches, domain modeling is not addressed explicitly, thus hampering the construction of management systems based on service-oriented principles. In this paper, we propose an ontology for the specification of the domain IT Management and present a refined development approach that enables the application of the presented ontology. The application of the ontology is demonstrated by <b>designing</b> <b>management</b> services for a standardized Incident Management Process.
