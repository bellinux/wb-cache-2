50|$|Whey is used {{to produce}} whey cheeses such as ricotta, brunost, and whey butter and many other {{products}} for human consumption. The fat content of whey is low; for example 1,000 kg of whey are required to make typically 1 kg of whey butter. It is also an additive in many processed foods, including breads, crackers, and commercial pastry, and in animal feed. Whey proteins consist primarily of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin.

40|$|Various {{methods for}} {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} high value minor proteins (lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and immunoglobulins) directly from raw milk were explored. Extraction, purification and analysis of high-value minor proteins directly from milk without pre-treatment are major challenges for dairy industry, {{largely due to the}} complexity of milk and the presence of colloidal solids (casein micelles and milk fat globules). To overcome some of these challenges, this work focused on three main objectives: 1) characterization of cryogel monolith chromatography for purification of lactoferrin (LF) and lactoperoxidase (LP) directly from raw milk in single step, 2) identification and characterization of Protein A Mimetic affinity ligands for purification of immunoglobulins (Igs) from milk and 3) development and validation of a surface plasmon resonance method for simultaneous quantification of five whey proteins in multiple samples. Results portrayed the possibility of 40 – 50 column volumes of various milk samples (whole milk, skim milk and acid whey) to pass through a 5 mL cryogel monolith chromatography column at 525 cm hr⁻¹ without exceeding its pressure limits if the processing temperature is maintained around 35 – 37 °C. Ideally, this should be the milk secretion temperature. The dynamic binding capacity obtained for the cryogel matrix (2. 1 mg mL⁻¹) was {{similar to that of the}} binding capacity (2. 01 mg mL⁻¹) at equilibrium with 0. 1 mg mL⁻¹ of lactoferrin in the feed samples. Lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase was selectively bound to the cryogel column with trivial leakage in flowthrough fractions. Lactoferrin was recovered from elution fractions with a yield of 85 % and a purity of 90 %. These results, together with the ease of manufacture, low cost and versatile surface chemistry of cryogels suggest that they may be a good alternative to packed-bed chromatography for direct capture of proteins from milk, provided that the binding capacity can be increased. A Protein A Mimetic (PAM) hexapeptide (HWRGWV) peptide ligand that binds to the Fc portion of antibody molecules was explored for affinity purification of immunoglobulins from milk. The peptide has the ability to purify IgG from various milk and whey samples with a purity of greater than 85 % in single step. More than 90 % bound IgG was recovered with 0. 2 M acetate buffer at pH 4. 0 and total column regeneration was successfully achieved by 2. 0 M guanidine-HCl. At 9. 0 mg mL⁻¹ of IgG feed concentration, an equilibrium binding capacity of 21. 7 mg mL⁻¹ and dynamic binding capacity of approximately 12. 0 mg mL⁻¹ of resin was obtained. Recoveries and yields of IgG were significantly influenced by the feed IgG concentration. PAM hexamer ligand also contributed a significant amount of cross-reactivity with casein, <b>glycomacropeptides</b> and β-lactoglobulin proteins, however majority of these proteins were recovered in the regeneration step, except β-lactoglobulin, which co-eluted with IgG. Higher IgG concentration in feed vastly reduced the amount of cross-reactivity whilst increasing the recoveries and purities in the final product. PAM affinity ligands also showed interactions towards other classes of bovine immunoglobulins. These findings established the possibility of using PAM hexamer peptide as an alternative to conventional Protein A/G affinity chromatography for the isolation of Igs from milk in single step process. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method was developed for simultaneous, quantitative determination of commercially important whey proteins in raw and processed milk samples, whey fractions and various milk-derived products, with six samples per assay. Immobilized antibody stability and reproducibility of analyses were studied over time for 25 independent runs (n= 300), giving a relative standard deviation (RSD) of < 4 %. Immobilized antibodies showed negligible non-specific interactions (< 2 – 4 SPR response units (RU)) and no cross-reactivity towards other milk components (< 1 RU). Regeneration of immobilised antibodies with glycine at pH 1. 75 was determined to be optimal for maintaining the SPR response between samples. This method compared and validated well with reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) ...|$|R

Results showed that GHP significantly blocked H 2 O 2 -induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell viability reduction in a dose-dependent manner. Further, GHP concentration-dependently induced heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) expression and increased nuclear factor-erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) nuclear translocation. Moreover, pretreatment of GHP increased the activation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2), which were shown to contribute to Nrf 2 -mediated HO- 1 expression.

40|$|Background. Skeletal {{fragility}} is a {{complication of}} phenylketonuria (PKU). A diet containing amino acids compared with <b>glycomacropeptide</b> reduces bone {{size and strength}} in mice. Objective. We tested the hypothesis that amino acid medical foods (AA-MF) provide a high dietary acid load, subsequently increasing urinary excretion of renal net acid, calcium, and magnesium, compared to <b>glycomacropeptide</b> medical foods (GMP-MF). Design. In a crossover design, 8 participants with PKU (16 – 35 [*]y) provided food records and 24 -hr urine samples after consuming a low-Phe diet in combination with AA-MF and GMP-MF for 1 – 3 [*]wks. We calculated potential renal acid load (PRAL) of AA-MF and GMP-MF and determined bone mineral density (BMD) measurements using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Results. AA-MF provided 1. 5 – 2. 5 -fold higher PRAL and resulted in 3 -fold greater renal net acid excretion compared to GMP-MF (p= 0. 002). Dietary protein, calcium, and magnesium intake were similar. GMP-MF significantly reduced urinary excretion of calcium by 40 % (p= 0. 012) and magnesium by 30 % (p= 0. 029). Two participants had low BMD-for-age and trabecular bone scores, indicating microarchitectural degradation. Urinary calcium with AA-MF negatively correlated with L 1 –L 4 BMD. Conclusion. Compared to GMP-MF, AA-MF increase dietary acid load, subsequently increasing urinary calcium and magnesium excretion, and likely contributing to skeletal fragility in PKU.

40|$|Interactions {{mediated}} by layers of κ-casein and para-κ-casein have been calculated and compared using the {{self consistent field}} (SCF) approach, at pH and electrolyte concentrations found in milk. Our results show the interaction potentials at close separation distances to be repulsive for κ-casein, while they are attractive for para-κ-casein. We have also studied κ-casein chains stripped of their sugar moieties and highlighted the important role that the carbohydrate side chains play {{in the provision of}} steric forces. The point of transition from a repulsive to an attractive interaction is found to be rather sensitive to the degree of coverage of the surface by the protein chains. At Γ= 0. 0025 chains per unit monomer area, the value is just over 40 % renneted chains, whereas at Γ= 0. 0032 this increases to 87 %. At the coverage values higher than those we estimate for the surface of casein micelles, no transition is detected and the interactions remain repulsive even when all of κ-casein has been converted to para-κ-casein, as already shown by Mellema, Leermakers, and de Kruif (1999). At lower surface coverage values, the interaction potential curves forotherwise uncharged surfaces, covered with para-κ-casein, posses an energy barrier. We have demonstrated that the origin of this energy barrier is electrostatic, with para-κ-casein contributing a net positive charge to the surface. We have also explored the importance of the asymmetry in the distribution of charge between the para-κ-casein and the <b>glycomacropeptide</b> sides of the protein. The <b>glycomacropeptide</b> is net negative while para-κ-casein side is net positive at neutral pH. Our results suggest that on a negatively charged surface, such as the surface of casein micelles, this uneven distribution of charge is just as important in determining the conformation of κ-casein chains as is the difference in the hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature of the two sides of this protein...|$|E

Enzyme deficiency causes accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) and if left untreated will lead to profound and irreversible intellectual disability in most children. Traditionally, it has been managed with a low-Phe diet supplemented with a Phe-free protein substitute although newer treatment options mainly in combination with diet are available for some subgroups of patients with PKU, for example, sapropterin, large neutral amino acids, and <b>glycomacropeptide.</b> The diet consists of three parts: 1) severe restriction of dietary Phe; 2) replacement of non-Phe L-amino acids with a protein substitute commonly supplemented with essential fatty acids and other micronutrients; and 3) low-protein foods from fruits, some vegetables, sugars, fats and oil, and special low-protein foods (SLPF). The prescription of diet is challenging for health professionals. The high-carbohydrate diet supplied by a limited range of foods may program food preferences and contribute to obesity in later life. Abnormal tasting and satiety-promoting protein substitutes are administered to coincide with peak appetite times to ensure their consumption, but this practice may impede appetite for other important foods. Intermittent dosing of micronutrients when combined with L-amino acid supplements may lead to their poor bioavailability. Much work is required on the ideal nutritional profiling for special SLPF and Phe-free L-amino acid supplements.

30|$|Aspartic proteinases (APs; EC. 3.4. 23.-) {{also known}} as acid proteases are a {{significant}} group of enzymes, produced {{by a variety of}} organisms including plants and animals, mainly used as milk coagulating agents in industrial cheese production (Yegin and Dekker 2013; Hsiao et al. 2014). Rennet, a milk coagulant obtained from the abomasum of milk-fed lambs and calves, is regarded as the industrial gold standard in cheese manufacturing (Kethireddipalli and Hill 2015). Chymosin (EC 3.4. 23.4) is the main milk-clotting component of natural rennet with activity amounting to about 90 % of the total observed potency (Salehi et al. 2017; Kumar et al. 2010). Chymosin specifically cleaves the Phe 105 -Met 106 bond of κ-casein (κ –CN) resulting {{in the formation of the}} (hydrophobic) para-κ-casein and the (hydrophilic) biologically active component <b>glycomacropeptide</b> (Neelima et al. 2013). The <b>glycomacropeptide</b> further diffuses into cheese whey and the destabilized micelles consequently aggregate to form cheese curd via the Ca 2 + induced aggregation (Hang et al. 2016; El-Baky et al. 2011). Due to increased demand for cheese products, animal-derived milk coagulants are not enough to cover the production, and this has prompted research efforts in the search, manufacture of recombinant and microbial rennin. Substitutes with milk coagulating ability must present some of calf rennet specific properties like a high ratio of milk clotting activity and suitable thermal stability. Microbial milk coagulants, {{also known as}} mucor rennins produced by microorganisms like Rhizomucor miehei (Gray et al. 1986; Ottesen and Rickert 1970), Rhizomucor pusillus (Arima et al. 1968; Tonouchi et al. 1986), and Endothia parasitica have found extensive application as milk coagulating enzymes in industrial cheese production (Jacob et al. 2011; Nasr et al. 2016). However, these fungal enzymes have several disadvantages when compared to their animal counterpart rennet, due to the flavour and bitter taste that dominate the cheese products; produced especially after a long period of maturation. For this reason, researchers have focused on finding new enzymes that possess the desired properties and characteristics dearly needed in cheese manufacturing. With this goal in focus, aspartic proteinase was isolated from M. circinelloides and further characterized.|$|E

Casein is inactive within the parent protein but can be lib-erated by various proteases and enzymatic hydrolysis during microbial fermentation and gastrointestinal digestion. Once absorbed, casein exhibits different bioavailabilities in the body. Specifically, casein-derived peptides function as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in the cardiovascular system; thus, they are expected to reduce and prevent hyperten-sion. Additionally, casein-derived peptides behave as opioid-like peptides in the nervous system, which impacts relaxation. These peptides are also expected to modulate various aspects of immune functions. Finally, caseinophosphopeptide (CPP) and <b>glycomacropeptide</b> (GMP) may exhibit a number of nutritional effects such as the absorption of calcium, iron or zinc. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate casein-derived peptides due to their multifunctional properties and the results of these studies have contributed {{to the development of a}} wide variety of functional dairy products.

40|$|Bovine whey protein {{consists}} of {{different type of}} proteins such as βlactoglobulin (β-lag), α-lactalbumin (α-lac), immunoglobulin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and <b>glycomacropeptide.</b> Single protein is more valuable compare to the mixture of proteins {{and it can be}} used for specific application. The main objective {{of this study is to}} fractionate whey protein components into several groups or single protein fraction using SP-sepharose TM Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) cation exchange chromatography column. The chromatographic process was run at different pH range from pH 4 to pH 8 using 24 ml column. All major whey proteins were recovered in the elution fraction at pH 4 and pH 4. 5. No protein was bound at pH 7 and pH 8. The best whey fractionation from 2 ml whey feed was achieved at pH 4 with the yield for β-lag, BSA and α-lac are 83. 33 %, 66. 44 % and 10. 51 % respectively. Different protein fraction recovered during fractionation process at different pH using cation exchange chromatography process, can be used as a guideline to isolate particular protein of interest from bovine whe...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of cooling technology {{as a tool for}} maintaining the microbiological and organoleptic characteristics of milk, Without effective hygienic practices throughout the milk production, caused the psychrotrophic micro-organisms to become major deteriorative bacteria in the dairy industry. The present study aimed to assess how the proteolytic psychrotrophic metabolism responds to different milk storage temperatures, drawing a parallel among psychrotrophic growth, amount of micro-organisms capable of breaking down proteins and amount of GMP (<b>glycomacropeptide)</b> released. Milk samples were collected directly from the cooling tank and subjected to count of psychrotrophs, count of proteolytic micro-organisms and the concentration of GMP at different storage times and temperatures. There was no linearity between the microbiological parameters and the GMP measured, according to the time/temperature binomial. The highest concentration of GMP (5. 07 mg/mL) was measured in the binomial 8 °C/ 24 h (T 8 / M 24). The data make clear the need for further studies about questions involving the psychrotrophic microbiota in order to clarify extremely important basic questions about their metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} mechanism of protein-based bioactive compounds (a peptide fraction from whey protein concentrate, <b>glycomacropeptide</b> and lactoferrin), from chitosan films to liquid medium, was studied. Mathematical models {{were used to}} discuss the {{transport mechanism}}. Data from release experiments was successfully described by a model which accounts for both Fick and Case II transport – the linear superimposition model. Results show that the mechanism of transport {{and the effect of}} temperature and peptide type could be related with physical properties of chitosan films where the tested bioactive compounds were incorporated. The approach presented here allows interpretation of the phenomena involved in mass transport in the systems studied and, once extended to other systems, may contribute to an understanding of transport in hydrophilic bio-polymeric matrices.

40|$|The {{partition}} {{behavior of}} <b>glycomacropeptide</b> (GMP) was determined in polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium citrate aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). It {{was found that}} the partitioning of GMP depends on PEG molar mass, tie line length, pH, NaCl concentration and temperature. The obtained data indicates that GMP is preferentially partitioned into the PEG phase without addition of NaCl at pH 8. 0. Larger tie line lengths and higher temperatures favor GMP partition to the PEG phase. Furthermore, it was verified that PEG molar mass and concentration have a slight effect on GMP partition. The increase in the molar mass of PEG induces a reduction of the protein solubility in the top PEG rich phase, being shown that the use of PEG 1500 is beneficial for the extraction of GMP. A protein recovery higher than 85 % was obtained in the top phase of these systems, clearly demonstrating its suitability {{as a starting point for}} the separation of GMP.

40|$|Whey protein {{concentrates}} (WPC) and isolates (WPI), comprised mainly of β-lactoglobulin (β-LG), α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and casein <b>glycomacropeptide</b> (GMP), {{are added to}} foods to boost nutritional and functional properties. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCO 2) {{has been shown to}} effectively fractionate WPC and WPI to obtain enriched fractions of α-LA and β-LG, thus creating new whey ingredients that exploit the properties of the individual component proteins. In this study, we used SCO 2 to further fractionate WPI via acid precipitation of α-LA, β-LG and the minor whey proteins to obtain GMP-enriched solutions. The process was optimized and α-LA precipitation maximized at low pH and a temperature (T) ≥ 65 °C, where β-LG with 84 % purity and GMP with 58 % purity were obtained, after ultrafiltration and diafiltration to separate β-LG from the GMP solution. At 70 °C, β-LG also precipitated with α-LA, leaving a GMP-rich solution with up to 94 % purity after ultrafiltration. The different protein fractions produced with the SCO 2 process will permit the design of new foods and beverages to target specific nutritional needs...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Certain milk {{factors may}} help to promote {{the growth of a}} host-friendly colonic {{microflora}} (e. g. bifidobacteria, lactobacilli) and explain why breast-fed infants experience fewer and milder intestinal infections than those who are formula-fed. The effects of supplementation of formula with two such milk factors was investigated in this study. Materials and Methods: Infant rhesus macaques were breastfed, fed control formula, or formula supplemented with <b>glycomacropeptide</b> (GMP) or alpha-lactalburnin (alpha-LA) from birth to 5 months of age. Blood was drawn monthly and rectal swabs were collected weekly. At 4. 5 months of age, 10 (8) colonyforming units of enteropathogenic E. coli O 127, strain 2349 / 68 (EPEC) was given orally and the response to infection assessed. The bacteriology of rectal swabs pre- and post-infection was determined by culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridization. Results: Post-challenge, breast-fed infants and infants fed alpha-LA-supplemented formula had no diarrhea, whilst those infants fed GMP-supplemented formula had intermittent diarrhea. In infants fed control formula the diarrhea was acute. Conclusions: Supplementation of infant formula with appropriate milk proteins may be useful for improving the infant's ability to resist acute infection caused by E. coli...|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common skin diseases, whose incidence is increasing in industrialized countries. The epicutaneous application of a hapten, such as 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), evokes an experimental murine AD-like reaction. <b>Glycomacropeptide</b> (GMP) is a dairy bioactive peptide derived from hydrolysis of κ-casein by chymosin action. It has anti-inflammatory, prebiotic, and immunomodulatory effects. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of GMP administration on DNCB-induced AD in rats. The severity of inflammatory process, pruritus, production of cytokines, and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) content were measured, and the histopathological features were analyzed. GMP reduced the intensity of inflammatory process and edema of DNCB-induced dermatitis, with a significant decrease in eosinophils recruitment and mast cells hyperplasia. In addition GMP suppressed the serum levels of total IgE and IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13 expression in AD-lesions. Besides, the levels of IL- 10 were significantly increased. Remarkably, GMP administration before AD-induction abolished pruritus in dermatitis-like reactions in the rats. Taken together, these results indicate that GMP has an inhibitory effect on AD by downregulating Th 2 dominant immune response, suggesting GMP as a potential effective alternative therapy for the prevention and management of AD...|$|E
40|$|During {{enzymatic process}} of cheese manufacturing, rennin cleaves &# 954;-casein {{releasing}} two fractions: para-&# 954;-casein and <b>glycomacropeptide</b> (GMP), which remains soluble in milk whey. GMP is a peptide with structural particularities such as chain carbohydrates linked to specific threonine residues, {{to which a}} great variety of biological activities is attributed. Worldwide cheese production has increased generating high volumes of milk whey that could be efficiently used as an alternative source of high quality peptide or protein in foodstuff formulations. In order to evaluate isolation and recovery on whey GMP by means of thermal treatment (90 °C), 18 samples (2 L each) of sweet whey, resuspended commercial whey (positive control) and acid whey (negative control) were processed. Indirect presence of GMP was verified using chemical tests and PAGE-SDS 15 %. At 90 °C treated sweet whey, 14, 20 and 41 kDa bands were observed. These bands may correspond to olygomers of GMP. Peptide recovery showed an average of 1. 5 g/L (34. 08 %). The results indicate that industrial scale GMP production is feasible; however, further research must be carried out for the biological and nutritional evaluation of GMP's incorporation to foodstuff as a supplement...|$|E
