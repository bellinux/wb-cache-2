5|$|It is {{said that}} the MacIntyre chief {{at the time of}} the Jacobite rising of 1745, James (born c. 1727), would have joined the clans {{rallying}} to Prince Charles Edward Stuart but was dissuaded from doing so by his wife, who was a Campbell, and his neighbors. His loyalties to the Campbells were further deepened by the fact that his legal studies had been sponsored by the Campbell Earl of Breadalbane.

5|$|The {{combined}} school retains the name School for the Creative and Performing Arts. Private donors {{will have a}} significant and ongoing voice in how the school is operated.
