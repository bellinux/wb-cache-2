5|$|Furniture {{during the}} Baroque <b>era</b> <b>was</b> {{in keeping with}} the style: ornate, gilded and {{frequently}} with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room, for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque <b>era</b> <b>was</b> always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles.|$|E

5|$|The {{emergence}} of a woman writing {{in the press and}} composing poetry in this dark <b>era</b> <b>was</b> a significant event.

5|$|After the Qing {{government}} {{defeated the}} Ming loyalist forces {{maintained by the}} Zheng family in 1683, parts of Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing Empire. Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan's highly populated western plain for over two centuries, until 1895. This <b>era</b> <b>was</b> characterized by a marked {{increase in the number}} of Han Chinese on Taiwan, continued social unrest, the piecemeal transfer (by various means) of large amounts of land from the aborigines to the Han, and the nearly complete acculturation of the Western Plains Aborigines to Taiwanese Han customs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{location}} in the city used for large productions is the Hamasa Shrine Temple Theater. The Temple Theater houses a 778-pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater Organs still in their original installations in the state. With seating for 1800 persons, the silent movie <b>era</b> <b>was</b> a prosperous time for the Temple.

5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a tripartite system of education that, taking shape during the Hellenistic <b>era,</b> <b>was</b> maintained, with inevitable changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. The stages of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, Galveston {{emerged as an}} {{international}} city with immigration and trade from around the U.S. and the world.

Galveston became Texas' largest city and, during that <b>era,</b> <b>was</b> its prime commercial center. In 1900, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane. Even post-Hurricane Katrina, this event holds the record as the United States' deadliest natural disaster.|$|E
5|$|Eorzea's history {{revolves}} around {{a series of}} Umbral and Astral Eras. Umbral Eras are periods of great calamity—the First Umbral Era {{marked the end of}} the age of gods. The guardian deities of Eorzea, known as the Twelve, retreated from direct involvement with mortals during this time. Umbral Eras are followed by periods of enlightenment and cultural growth called Astral Eras. The Third Astral <b>Era</b> <b>was</b> particularly noted for presiding over the Allagan Empire, an ancient civilization whose technology far exceeds the level of the modern age. Each Umbral and Astral Era pair corresponds to one of the six basic elements—wind, lightning, fire, earth, ice, and water. The Sixth Umbral <b>Era</b> <b>was</b> believed to be the last and the civilized races hoped the Sixth Astral Era would last forever. However, five years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Garlean Empire catalyzed a series of events that would lead to the Seventh Umbral Era.|$|E

5|$|For 1996, the Angels {{replaced}} Smith in {{the closer}} role with second-year pitcher Troy Percival. After only eight {{games as a}} setup pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, was traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, {{who was in the}} midst of his best season—but did not fare as well in his return to the National League. His <b>ERA</b> <b>was</b> nearly as high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E
5|$|Greinke {{returned}} to the rotation in 2008 and performed well that season. He made 32 starts in 2008 and finished with a 13-10 record along with 183 strikeouts.

5|$|His {{place in}} the genealogical {{tradition}} of the MacDonalds is the only reason for believing in his existence, a genealogical tradition that not all historians have accepted. Beyond his actual existence, there is little that is certain. Three entries in Irish annals may discuss him, though he is never named; a praise poem surviving from the Early Modern period may be descended from a poem originally written for him; a miracle in a Manx chronicle {{may or may not}} have Domhnall as its subject; and a doubtful charter surviving from a similarly late <b>era</b> <b>was</b> allegedly issued by him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this <b>era</b> <b>was</b> based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon became}} evident that Wong's career would {{continue}} to be limited by American anti-miscegenation laws, which prevented her from sharing an on-screen kiss with any person of another race, even if the character was Asian, but being portrayed by a white actor.
