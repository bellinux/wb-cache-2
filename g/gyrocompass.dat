Hudecek and U-17 made two unsuccessful attacks on enemy destroyers in January. On 23 February, Hudecek attempted {{an attack on a}} cargo ship off Durazzo, but was discovered and depth charged.

5|$|Paul Jacobi bombarded Soviet {{forces on}} 6–9 March and alternated between {{bombardment}} and escort tasks {{for the rest}} of the war as the Germans evacuated East Prussia in the face of advancing Soviet armies. On 2 May, her <b>gyrocompass</b> was sabotaged by some of her crew to prevent the ship from screening the last few refugee convoys. Three men were convicted by a drumhead court-martial and sentenced to death by Rear Admiral (Konteradmiral) Bernhard Rogge. Paul Jacobi was decommissioned five days later at Flensburg and sailed to Wilhelmshaven under British control on 21 May to have her fate determined. France was initially denied any of the captured ships, but eventually received Paul Jacobi and three other destroyers. She arrived in Cherbourg on 15 January 1946 and was turned over to the French on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|U-16 {{set out on}} {{her next}} patrol on 3 December, but {{had to return to}} fix a broken <b>gyrocompass,</b> and was {{underway}} for Albania the next day. On 5 December, the sailboat Xephanie was stopped, searched, and allowed to proceed. Near the same location, U-16 next encountered Fione Albania again. When stopped this time, the 62-ton ship had Montenegrin soldiers, weapons, and ammunition aboard. The vessel was seized as a prize and taken back to Kotor. U-16 attempted two more Albanian patrols at the end of December. The first, departing Kotor on 19 December, was cut short by severe weather that forced the submarine back to port. The next attempt, on 25 December, ended when U-16 suffered engine problems. U-16 sailed for Pula on 27 December for more extensive engine repairs at the naval base there.|$|E

25|$|GPS {{compasses}} {{share the}} main advantages of <b>gyrocompasses.</b> They determine true North, {{as opposed to}} magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with <b>gyrocompasses,</b> they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone {{to be affected by}} mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm. <b>Gyrocompasses</b> remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.|$|R
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's <b>gyrocompass</b> (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} came to be called the 'Run to the North', after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships {{maintained}} full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. At 5:40pm they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 6:44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast four minutes later searching for Hipper's ships. Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand and then slowed down to eighteen knots and altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet. At this moment Lions <b>gyrocompass</b> failed, and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again. At 6:55 Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.|$|E
25|$|A <b>gyrocompass,</b> {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the <b>gyrocompass</b> device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the <b>gyrocompass</b> device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a <b>gyrocompass</b> can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.|$|E
50|$|Precession or {{gyroscopic}} considerations have {{an effect}} on bicycle performance at high speed. Precession is also the mechanism behind <b>gyrocompasses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>gyrocompass's</b> north-seeking {{function}} {{depends on}} the rotation around the axis of the Earth that causes torque-induced gyroscopic precession, it will not orient itself correctly to true north if it is moved very fast in an east to west direction, thus negating the Earth's rotation. However, aircraft commonly use heading indicators or directional gyros, which are not <b>gyrocompasses</b> and do not align themselves to north via precession, but are periodically aligned manually to magnetic north.|$|R

25|$|In the 1860s, {{the advent}} of {{electric}} motors {{made it possible for}} a gyroscope to spin indefinitely; this led to the first prototype heading indicators, and a rather more complicated device, the <b>gyrocompass.</b> The first functional <b>gyrocompass</b> was patented in 1904 by German inventor Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe. American Elmer Sperry followed with his own design later that year, and other nations soon realized the military importance of the inventionin an age in which naval prowess was the most significant measure of military powerand created their own gyroscope industries.

40|$|The prelaunch-alignment {{program which}} aligns the stable {{platform}} to some desired orientation {{with respect to}} the local navigation reference frame is discussed.

50|$|There {{are certain}} {{circumstances}} when magnetic compasses and <b>gyrocompasses</b> are unreliable. The most obvious is in polar regions, where the force exerted on the needle of {{a magnetic compass}} is nearly vertical and <b>gyrocompasses</b> become unstable due to {{the rotation of the}} Earth. Magnetic compasses are also susceptible to disruption from magnetic fields other than the Earth's, such as those produced by the hulls of some metal vehicles or craft. Before the advent of electronic navigational aids such as GPS the most reliable way to ascertain north in such circumstances was through the use of an astrocompass.|$|R

25|$|Unlike a {{directional}} gyro or heading indicator, a <b>gyrocompass</b> seeks north.

40|$|Abstract — North-finding {{based on}} micromachined {{gyroscopes}} {{is an attractive}} possibility. This paper analyzes north-finding methods and demonstrates a measured 4 mrad standard devia-tion azimuth uncertainty using an in-house developed vibratory silicon MEMS quadruple mass gyroscope (QMG). We instru-mented a vacuum packaged QMG with isotropic Q-factor of 1. 2 million and Allan deviation bias instability of 0. 2 °/hr for azimuth detection by measuring the earth’s rotation. Continu-ous rotation (“carouseling”) produced azimuth datapoints with uncertainty diminishing as the square root {{of the number of}} turns. Integration of 100 datapoints with normally distributed errors reduced uncertainty to 4 mrad, beyond the noise of current QMG instrumentation. We also implemented self-calibration methods, including in-situ temperature sensing and discrete ± 180 ° turning (“maytagging ” or two-point <b>gyrocompassing)</b> as potential alternatives to carouseling. While both mechanizations produced similar azimuth uncertainty, we conclude that carousel-ing is more advantageous as it is robust to bias, scale-factor, and temperature drifts, although it requires a rotary platform providing continuous rotation. Maytagging, on the other hand, can be implemented using a simple turn table, but requires calibration due to temperature-induced drifts.

40|$|The {{concept of}} carouseling an IMU is {{simulated}} {{in order to}} improve the accuracy of MEMS IMUs. Carouseling consists of slewing the IMU through a pre-determined trajectory that is selected based on inherent properties that lead to improved performance. MEMS devices typically have far more uncertainty than standard inertial measurement devices, yet are considerably less massive and require less power, so implementing this carouseling scheme could make the use of these lightweight systems possible even in high-accuracy situations, such as <b>gyrocompassing.</b> In <b>gyrocompassing,</b> the most significant benefit provided by the carouseling scheme is the reduction in the error contribution of gyroscope bias, as this error is almost completely eliminated. Additionally, it was found that although implementing the carouseling scheme required the addition of error states to account for the size effect, in many cases these error states may not be necessary. Overall, the carouseling of the MEMS IMUs was shown to be effective in reducing azimuth error covariance significantly. by Benjamin Matthew Renkoski. Thesis (S. M.)
