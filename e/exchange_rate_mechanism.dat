5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the factors of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{volatility}} from the macroeconomic perspective for four neighbouring ASEAN economies. Design/methodology/approach – This study has scrutinised the link between macroeconomic factors and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility in both the short and the long run by applying econometrics techniques. Findings – This study further suggests the link between macroeconomic factors and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility in both the short and the long run for the selected economies. The empirical results, however, indicate that a set of common factors seems to influence the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, whereby the stock market is a great influence commonly found across countries. The Indonesian rupiah seems to be the most sensitive to the innovations in macroeconomic factors, while the Singapore dollar is the least. Research limitations/implications – The macroeconomic factors are believed to be the forces behind <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility through the presumable rigidities of their <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> resulting from the managed float <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system adopted by those countries. Their capital markets are vital in maintaining <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stability, hence suggesting the imperative role of respective authorities and market players in managing a viable capital market.

The conclusion that follows from the paper is that achieving full monetary union in Europe {{by the end of this}} decade is certainly possible but not certain. A major recession or other shock affecting asymmetrically more than one large member nation could derail or at least delay the process of monetary union.

40|$|Design {{of policy}} rules for an an {{emerging}} market central bank (EMCB) operating in an inflation-targeting framework presents additional challenges beyond those for describing {{the behavior of}} a central bank in a developed economy. Even though an inflation-targeting regime entails abolishing the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target in favor of an inflation target, it is more difficult for an EMBC to ignore movements in <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> given the relatively shallow depth of financial markets and the the high degree of dollarization. Additionally the EMCB may be forced to change the pursued <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime following a capital account reversal so that linear Taylor rules may be inadequate for describing EMCB reactions. We develop an empirical framework that addresses these issues and propose a new methodology to estimate unobserved variables such as expected inflation and potential output within the rule. Specifically, we employ a structural, nonlinear Kalman filter algorithm to estimate time-dependent parameters and unobserved variables, and we experiment with various <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that can be employed by an EMCB. This approach allows us to track any changes in EMCB behavior - including regime shifts - following a switch to inflation targeting. Using post- 2001 data from Turkey, which is a fairly dollarized small open economy, we document that the Central Bank of Turkey has given relatively more importance to the inflation gap than to the output gap or to <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> but not until some time after it had switched to an inflation-targeting framework. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} three essays, all {{of which}} are empirical studies of different issues on <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> Implementing advanced econometrics methodologies with monthly time series data, these studies focus on macroeconomic determinants to measure the relationships within the variables. The first essay (Chapter Two) re-examines the robustness of the export-led growth hypothesis across the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes in Malaysia. According to the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime history, Malaysia experienced three different <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>mechanisms</b> from 1990 to 2010. Generally, the results vary across the time and regimes. Specifically, the study suggests bi-directional and/or unidirectional causality between exports and economic growth across the regimes, both in the short-run and long-run. The second essay (Chapter Three) tries {{to bridge the gap between}} the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> issues by investigating the impact <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure on sector level in Malaysia from October, 1992 to December, 2010. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure in Malaysia sectorial returns by using an augmented model. Overall, in all instances, the results suggest that the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposures in Malaysia can be categorized as the long memory in the volatility process. After investigating currency exposure in two types of models, the results further suggest that the sectors are largely affected by the currency fluctuations. The third essay (Chapter Four) explores the channels and magnitude of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility-export nexus empirically on the export flow of five ASEAN countries namely, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia to the United States from January, 1990 to December, 2010. The major results show that increases in the volatility of the real bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> exert significant effects upon export demand in the short run in each of the ASEAN countries. This study further suggests significant negative effects from the bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility of exports flow in Singapore, Malaysia and Philippines.
