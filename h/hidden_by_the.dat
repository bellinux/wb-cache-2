5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the {{painting}} was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was displayed {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. The painting was <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the painting was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the painting has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown. The painting is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The painting was restored in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, an Apple II {{software}} cracker {{team found}} an Easter egg <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> game's creator 33 years prior. Cook had hidden a secret congratulations {{screen in the}} game for players who entered a specific keyboard key combination at a specific time and solved the resulting series of substitution ciphered clues. Cook congratulated the cracker team on Twitter. The crackers found the secret while working to preserve the game for the Internet Archive by removing its digital copyright protections. One of the crackers said that while most 1980s games could be cracked by automation, Gumball protections, coded by Roland Gustafsson, were exceptional.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the problems of}} capacity, the National Stadium was also very well <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring buildings to the south in Park Street, Wood Street and to the east in Westgate Street, and also by Cardiff Rugby Ground in the north. It was only fully visible from across the River Taff in the west. Access to the ground was also very restricted with the main entrance being a narrow opening in Westgate Street to the east which was shared by both vehicles and spectators alike.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Matsui was executed, he was cremated and the US Army {{took away}} his ashes {{to prevent a}} {{memorial}} from being created. However, unbeknownst to them, some of the ashes had been <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> owner of the crematorium. He later brought these ashes to the shrine Matsui had founded, the Koa Kannon, and they remain there to this day. In 1978, all seven war criminals executed by the IMTFE, including Iwane Matsui, were officially enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine in a secret ceremony conducted by head priest Nagayoshi Matsudaira. This event did not become publicly known until the following year.|$|E
5|$|The magma {{intrusion}} rate below Uturunku {{is considerably}} {{larger than the}} magma output of the Pleistocene volcano, being comparable to the magma flux of historic eruptions and estimates of magma generation rates in local caldera forming magma chambers. Evidence {{for the formation of}} such a magma chamber is elusive but might be <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> deformation activity of the APVC melt generation zone. Uturunku may be developing into a supervolcano, and a caldera forming super-eruption may occur there; this possibility has resulted in international media attention.|$|E

5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled {{around to the}} south of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E

5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E
5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E
5|$|Captain John Hart appears {{through the}} Cardiff space-time Rift using a vortex {{manipulator}} and asks Jack Harkness {{for help in}} locating three radioactive cluster bombs, apparently scattered across Cardiff. Jack Harkness tells his team that John cannot be trusted but agrees to help him. True to Jack's word, Captain John is lying and seizes the containers, trying to kill Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) using a paralyzing lip gloss, shooting Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), punching Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and pushing Jack {{off the top of}} a building, thinking he's dead. However the containers, which are supposed to contain the location of a valuable diamond <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lover he murdered, instead contain an explosive which latches on the DNA signature of her killer. As insurance against Torchwood leaving him to die, John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key. After superficially altering his DNA using that of the Torchwood staff, Jack and Owen are able to save John's life before banishing him. Spurned by his former lover, John leaves by means of his Vortex Manipulator.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impact. Debate {{continues}} {{about how}} much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of Comet Borrelly. It {{was found that the}} surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between , and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation, or is <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> soot-like material that covers Borrelly. In July 2005, the Deep Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1. Renamed EPOXI, it made a flyby of Comet Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
