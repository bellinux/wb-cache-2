60|$|Analogous facts {{have been}} {{observed}} with plants: Major Trevor Clarke crossed the little, glabrous-leaved, annual stock (Matthiola), with pollen of a large, red-flowered, rough-leaved, biennial stock, called cocardeau by the French, {{and the result was}} that half the seedlings had glabrous and the other half rough leaves, but none had leaves in an intermediate state. That the glabrous seedlings were the product of the rough-leaved variety, and not accidentally of the mother-plant's own pollen, was shown by their tall and strong habit of growth. (15/19. 'Internat. Hort. and Bot. Congress of London' 1866.) in the succeeding generations raised from the rough-leaved crossed seedlings, some glabrous plants appeared, showing that the glabrous character, though incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves, was all the time latent in this family of plants. The numerous plants formerly referred to, which I raised from reciprocal crosses between the peloric and common Antirrhinum, offer a nearly parallel case; for in the first generation all the plants resembled the common form, and in the next generation, out of one hundred and thirty-seven plants, two alone were in an intermediate condition, the others perfectly resembling either the peloric or common form. Major Trevor Clarke also fertilised the above-mentioned red-flowered stock with pollen from the purple Queen stock, and about half the seedlings scarcely differed in habit, and not at all in the red colour of the flower, from the mother-plant, the other <b>half</b> <b>bearing</b> blossoms of a rich purple, closely like those of the paternal plant. Gartner crossed many white and yellow-flowered species and varieties of Verbascum; and these colours were never blended, but the offspring bore either pure white or pure yellow blossoms; the former in the larger proportion. (15/20. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 307. Kolreuter 'Dritte Fortsetszung' s. 34, 39 however, obtained intermediate tints from similar crosses in the genus Verbascum. With respect to the turnips see Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' 1837 page 370.) Dr. Herbert raised many seedlings, as he informed me, from Swedish turnips crossed by two other varieties, and these never produced flowers of an intermediate tint, but always like one of their parents. I fertilised the purple sweet-pea (Lathyrus odoratus), which has a dark reddish-purple standard-petal and violet-coloured wings and keel, with pollen of the painted lady sweet-pea, which has a pale cherry-coloured standard, and almost white wings and keel; and from the same pod I twice raised plants perfectly resembling both sorts; the greater number resembling the father. So perfect was the resemblance, that I should have thought there had been some mistake, if the plants which were at first identical with the paternal variety, namely, the painted-lady, had not later in the season produced, as mentioned in a former chapter, flowers blotched and streaked with dark purple. I raised grandchildren and great-grandchildren from these crossed plants, and they continued to resemble the painted-lady, but during later generations became rather more blotched with purple, yet none reverted completely to the original mother-plant, the purple sweet-pea. The following case is slightly different, but still shows the same principle: Naudin (15/21. 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 100.) raised numerous hybrids between the yellow Linaria vulgaris and the purple L. purpurea, and during three successive generations the colours kept distinct {{in different parts of the}} same flower.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the North Pacific {{consistently}} {{range as}} far north as the Bering Sea. While occasional sightings of fin whales occur north of the Bering Strait, they are rarely documented north of 67 °N. However, a recent increase in passive acoustic monitoring has shown that fin whales are more prevalent in the Chukchi Sea than previously thought. During a 2012 field survey in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea, fin whale calls were detected on a DiFAR sonobuoy deployed at 71. 575 °N, 157. 823 °W, 50 km off Barrow near the mouth of Barrow Canyon.

Since only one sonobuoy was deployed, in situ localization of the calls was not possible. Post hoc range estimates using a combination of modal dispersion techniques, nonlinear time-domain warping, and geoacoustic inversion resulted in a source range estimate of less than 5 km. This location is approximately 280 and 365 km northeast of the previous closest acoustic detection and confirmed visual sighting of a fin whale, respectively.

40|$|A wave {{journal bearing}} concept {{features}} a waved inner bearing {{diameter of the}} non-rotating bearing side {{and it is an}} alternative to the plain journal bearing. The wave journal bearing has a significantly increased load capacity in comparison to the plain journal bearing operating at the same eccentricity. It also offers greater stability than the plain circular bearing under all operating conditions. The wave bearing's design is relatively simple and allows the shaft to rotate in either direction. Three wave bearings are sensitive to the direction of an applied stationary side load. Increasing the number of waves reduces the wave bearing's sensitivity to the direction of the applied load relative to the wave. However, the range in which the bearing performance can be varied decreases as the number of waves increases. Therefore, both the number and the amplitude of the waves must be properly selected to optimize the wave bearing design for a specific application.

Deficiencies in data coverage and quality, and the feedback of case study results, are discussed. A model to improve maintenance experience is proposed and discussed. Using vibration to monitor component condition, the accurate prediction of remaining life requires (a) enough vibration measurements, (b) numerate records of operating conditions, (c) better discrimination between frequencies in the spectrum and (d) correlation of (b) and (c).

50|$|Many {{people think}} that {{long-term}} use may induce additional wear {{due to lack of}} oil lubrication. For the crankshaft <b>bearing</b> <b>half</b> shells and the big end bearings this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of boundary lubrication, metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing’s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled at what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature bearing wear, depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional bearing shells with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles. In a start stop system the short stop times keep the engine and oil warm, retaining lubrication. Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. Mazda i-stop used in their Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to restart their engine by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.|$|R

40|$|Analysis of the waved {{journal bearing}} concept {{featuring}} a waved inner bearing diameter {{for use with}} a compressible lubricant (gas) is presented. A three wave, waved journal bearing geometry is used to show the geometry of this concept. The performance of generic waved bearings having either three, four, six, or eight waves is predicted for air lubricated bearings. Steady-state performance is {{discussed in terms of}} bearing load capacity, while the dynamic performance is discussed in terms of dynamic coefficients and fluid film stability. It was found that the bearing wave amplitude has an important influence on both steady-state and dynamic performance of the waved journal bearing. For a fixed eccentricity ratio, the bearing steady-state load capacity and direct dynamic stiffness coefficient increase as the wave amplitude increases. Also, the waved bearing becomes more stable as the wave amplitude increases. In addition, increasing the number of waves reduces the waved bearing's sensitivity to the direction of the applied load relative to the wave. However, the range in which the bearing performance can be varied decreases as the number of waves increases. Therefore, both the number and the amplitude of the waves must be properly selected to optimize the waved bearing design for a specific application.
