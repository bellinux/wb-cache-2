The replacement combat system consists of the tactical and fire control components from the Raytheon CCS Mk2 system, combined with the sonar interfaces developed for the improved combat system used aboard Sheean and Dechaineux. Countermeasures include a Condor CS-5600 ESM intercept and warning unit, and two SSE decoys. The boats are fitted with a Marconi SDG-1802 degaussing system, and a receive-only Link 11 combat information exchange datalink.

5|$|Beginning in 2000, German IDS and ECR Tornados {{received}} the ASSTA 1 (Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada) upgrade. ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer, new GPS and Laser <b>Inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems.</b> The new computer allowed {{the integration of}} the HARM III, HARM 0 Block IV/V and TAURUS KEPD 350 missiles, the Rafael Litening II Laser Designator Pod and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs. The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005, primarily consisting of several new digital avionics systems, a new ECM suite and provision for the Taurus cruise missile; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados (20 ECRs and 65 IDSs), as the Tornado {{is in the process of}} being replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon. The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme, started in 2008, will introduce support for the laser-targeted Joint Direct Attack Munition along with further software changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give its astronauts {{experience}} before these programs started, the Blue Gemini program was proposed, which would have seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions. This would have first seen cooperative missions between NASA and the US Air Force, with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from NASA, and one from the USAF, followed by two missions with all-USAF crews, but performing missions for NASA. After these flights, the US Air Force would have flown a number of missions of its own. Firstly, it would have flown a two-man Agena rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research missions. Other proposed missions included tests of the Astronaut Mobility Unit {{which was designed to}} assist with EVAs, <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems,</b> and flying a radar imaging system.|$|E

With the {{rotation}} modulation, a strapdown <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> (INS) can keep high accuracy navigation without high accuracy gyro and high accuracy accelerometer. Firstly {{we give the}} error equation of strapdown INS, and then deduct the navigation error propagation of system. From partial analysis way, the modulation process of gyro constant error is obtained. Form global analysis way, the navigation error roused by constant error and the modulation effects are deducted here. 1. The technology scheme of single axis rotation error modulation The strapdown INS navigation error automatic compensation is based on inertial system error spread rule, it improves navigation precision effectively. One of the most typical, the most common automatic compensation error suppression method is rotating modulation [1 - 3]. Rotating modulation technology {{as a kind of}} inertial components deviation modulate the measurement components [4 - 5] deviation and counteract the influence of the system accuracy [6] caused by component offset by means of rotating inertia measurement components around a shaft or more axis, so as to improve the strapdown <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> long time work precision. The basic principle of rotary strapdown <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> shows as figure 1.

A Global Positioning System module is able to accurately determine position without sensor drift, but its usage is limited in heavily urbanized environments and heavy vegetation. While high-cost tactical-grade <b>Inertial</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>System</b> can determine position accurately, low-cost micro-electro-mechanical <b>system</b> <b>Inertial</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>System</b> sensors are plagued by significant errors.

2500|$|<b>Inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> used {{a cluster}} of {{gyroscopes}} and accelerometers to determine accelerations relative to inertial space. After a gyroscope is spun up in a particular orientation in inertial space, the law of conservation of angular momentum requires that it retain that orientation as long as no external forces are applied to it. [...] Three orthogonal gyroscopes establish an inertial reference frame, and the accelerators measure acceleration relative to that frame. The accelerations, along with a clock, can then be {{used to calculate the}} change in position. Thus, inertial navigation is a form of dead reckoning that requires no external input, and therefore cannot be jammed by any external or internal signal source.|$|E

[...] In 1981, acoustic positioning was proposed as part of the U.S. military's MX missile system. [...] A network of 150 covert transponder fields was envisioned. [...] Submarines typically are guided by <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems,</b> but these dead reckoning systems develop position drift which must be corrected by occasional position fixes from a GNSS system. [...] If the enemy were to knock out the GNSS satellites, the submarine could rely on the covert transponder network to establish its position and program the missile's own inertial navigation system for launch.|$|E
