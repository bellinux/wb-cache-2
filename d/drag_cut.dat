25|$|The heavy winter snows and {{the network}} of {{waterways}} were used to move logs to the mills. Loggers were able to <b>drag</b> <b>cut</b> trees over the winter snow to the roads or water bodies. In the southwest, the sledding season lasted about 100 days per year; the season was even longer {{to the north and}} the east. The country's network of lakes and rivers facilitated log floating, a cheap and rapid means of transport. Each spring, crews floated the logs downstream to collection points; tugs towed log bundles down rivers and across lakes to processing centers. The waterway system covered much of the country, and by the 1980s Finland had extended roadways and railroads to areas not served by waterways, effectively opening up all of the country's forest reserves to commercial use.|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{a series of}} laboratory experiments to test a cutting technique for hard rock using large-scale <b>drag</b> cutters. <b>Cutting</b> experiments were performed on rocks ranging in compressive strength from 10, 000 to 27, 000 Ib/in 2, using large drag cutters from 3 to 6 in. in width. The tests were conducted on a special test apparatus, called a ripper tester, which made a curvilinear cut across the rock sample while measuring the cutting force acting on the drag cutter. The cutting method that evolved from these experiments is called ripper cutting, and its energy efficiency appears superior to all other large-scale mechanical fragmentation techniques. In addition, the method cre-ated very little dust, and the wear on the bits was negligible. A fragmentation system based on ripper cutting was then devised, and a large-scale test device was fabricated to allow full-scale laboratory testing of the system. The results of these tests will be published in future Bureau reports...|$|R

While St. Louis <b>dragged</b> for and <b>cut</b> the three cables, Yankee and Marblehead covered her activities by engaging the Spanish gunboats Alvarado and Sandoval. After putting the Spanish gunboats to flight, the two American warships turned their attention toward the fort at Caimanera which had been making a nuisance of itself with its single large-caliber gun—a venerable, smooth-bore muzzleloader. As Yankee and Marblehead silenced their last adversary, St. Louis completed her cable-cutting mission; and the three ships exited the bay.|$|R

5000|$|The 458 Speciale {{is the top}} {{performing}} 458 Italia. Distinctions of the Speciale are the forged wheels, vented bonnet, finned side sills, taller {{rear spoiler}} and redesigned bumpers, which include active aerodynamics designed by Ferrari Styling Centre in cooperation with Pininfarina; front and rear movable flaps balance downforce and <b>cut</b> <b>drag</b> at speed. The engine was revised, with power increased to [...] at 9,000 rpm, 540 Nm of torque at 6,000 rpm. Electronic systems were updated too, introducing side slip angle control (SSC) to improve car control on the limit. SSC performs instant-to-instant analysis of the car’s side slip, comparing it with the target value and then optimising both torque management (via integration with F1-Trac traction control) and torque distribution between the two wheels (via integration with the E-Diff electronic differential). The weight/power ratio (1,290 kg dry, 1,395 kg at the kerb, 90 less than the standard 458) is equal to 2.13 kg/cv, sprints from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in just three seconds (0-125 mph or 0-200 km/h in 9.1 seconds with a response time of just 0.060 seconds).

The Captain, second mate and two boys jumped in to get her clear, when about 25 passengers jumped in and swamped her. The twenty-five, together with the second mate and two boys, perished. The captain caught a rope hanging over the quarter, and was drawn on board by the first mate. When the long boat was got clear, a number of passengers jumped over to swim to her, but all perished. The captain, first mate (Mr. Crawford), and seven of the crew swam to and reached the boat.|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} rate awarded to appraisal petitioners has recently become a surprising source of controversy. Since 2007, Delaware has presumptively awarded dissenting stockholders prejudgment interest {{at a rate}} equal to 5 % above the prevailing federal funds rate. In other work, we have documented a marked increase in appraisal activity that began in 2011. Despite evidence that petitioners target low-premium transactions and insider privatizations, some practitioner and judicial commentary {{has suggested that the}} statutory interest regime may be driving this increase. In 2015, Delaware’s blue-ribbon corporate law Council proposed a sensible amendment to the statutory interest regime, but it languished through one legislative session, and the issue is again poised for reconsideration. Selecting the appropriate {{interest rate}} is a complex and under-examined issue in the optimal design of legal remedies. We argue that the primary goal of interest in appraisal — or any form of prejudgment interest — is to make parties to the dispute indifferent to the passage of time, with no incentive either to <b>drag</b> out or <b>cut</b> short the proceeding. We propose an interest rate regime that builds upon the 2015 Council proposal and promotes time-indifference and dispute resolution. Like the Council, we argue that the respondent companies should be given a unilateral option to make an initial payment to dissenting stockholders that would stop the running of interest on the amount paid. To preserve balanced risk for both sides, the initial payment should not constitute a concession about the minimum amount of fair value, and companies should be entitled to recover from petitioners if the trial judgment is lower than the initial payment. We propose two additional and important features: First, the right to make such a payment to dissenting stockholders should be limited to a discrete 30 -day window following the close of the transaction. This ensures that the prepayment right furthers time indifference and is not just a tool of tactical gamesmanship. Second, the prevailing interest rate should be equal to the target company’s weighted average cost of capital. This would have beneficial effects on both parties: it would make the surviving company indifferent between paying the fair value after judgment and making an initial payment, and it would also encourage dissenters to be reasonable about litigating in hopes of obtaining more than the initial payment...|$|R
