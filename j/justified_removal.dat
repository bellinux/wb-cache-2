5000|$|The {{managers}} {{presented their}} case over three days, from January 14 to 16, with {{discussion of the}} facts and background of the case; detailed cases for both articles of impeachment (including excerpts from videotaped grand jury testimony that Clinton had made the previous August); matters of interpretation and application of the laws governing perjury and obstruction of justice; and argument that the evidence and precedents <b>justified</b> <b>removal</b> of the President from office by virtue of [...] "willful, premeditated, deliberate corruption of the nation's system of justice through perjury and obstruction of justice." [...] The defense presentation took place from January 19-21. Clinton's defense counsel argued that Clinton's grand jury testimony had too many inconsistencies to be a clear case of perjury, that the investigation and impeachment had been tainted by partisan political bias, that the President's approval rating of more than 70 percent indicated that his ability to govern had not been impaired by the scandal, and that the managers had ultimately presented [...] "an unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that {{does not meet the}} constitutional standard to remove the President from office." [...] January 22 and 23 were devoted to questions from members of the Senate to the House managers and Clinton's defense counsel. Under the rules, all questions (over 150) were to be written down and given to Rehnquist to read to the party being questioned.|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear {{registration}} is mostly performed after initialization by a global, linear transformation (in this work, {{we focus on}} similarity transformations), computed by a linear registration method. For the further processing of the results, it is mostly assumed that this preregistration step completely removes the respective linear transformation. However, we show that in deformable settings, {{this is not the}} case. As a consequence, a significant linear component is still existent in the deformation computed by the nonlinear registration algorithm. For construction of statistical shape models (SSM) from deformations, this is an unwanted property: SSMs should not contain similarity transformations, since these do not capture information about shape. We propose a method which performs an a posteriori extraction of a similarity transformation from a given nonlinear deformation field, and we use the processed fields as input for SSM construction. For computation of minimal displacements, a closed-form solution minimizing the squared Euclidean norm of the displacement field subject to similarity parameters is used. Experiments on real inter-subject data and on a synthetic example show that the theoretically <b>justified</b> <b>removal</b> of the similarity component by the proposed method has a large influence on the shape model and significantly improves the results. 1...|$|E

Most of the bone defects result from a bone tumour resection whereas a post-traumatic bone loss is more rare due to the numerous options available for bone fixation.

30|$|Taken together, {{these seven}} tests {{demonstrated}} many {{important aspects of}} the full-structure response of composite steel-framed buildings during fire. In particular, they shed light on the secondary load carrying mechanisms which can be activated during fire to prevent collapse, the potential importance of restraint to thermal expansion on heating (and thermal contraction on cooling) on localized buckling and/or connection failures, and the fact that full-structure response in fire is markedly different than that observed in standard fire resistance tests performed in furnaces. In the case of regular grid plan composite steel-framed buildings such as the one tested at Cardington, the fire resistance appears to be far greater than is normally assumed on the basis of furnace tests. This conclusion has been used to great advantage in recent years by the Steel Construction Industry (in particular in Europe) to <b>justify</b> <b>removal</b> of passive fire protection from secondary steel beams and steel decking in composite framed steel buildings, with considerable aesthetic, economic, sustainability, and constructability benefits.|$|R

5000|$|Nine portmen (like aldermen, but town councillors of a port city) of the {{chartered}} Corporation of Ipswich {{claimed in}} a writ of scire facias {{that they had}} been ejected wrongfully and therefore that the contemporary portman was an impostor. It was alleged that they had wilfully failed to attend [...] "four occasional great Courts". These were yearly public meeting events at the [...] "Moot Hall" [...] to conduct the borough's business. It was alleged by the town's bailiffs that the portmen should have attended every meeting. There was a hearing where the portmen gave reasons for not attending. However the bailiffs did not accept them, and the portmen were dismissed. After the nine portmen had been dismissed, an election meeting was held, and a bailiff, Thomas Richardson was chosen. The dismissed portmen alleged this was unlawful, because their dismissals were improper and so there was no vacancy.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to determine individual scatter kernels and to use them for scatter correction by integral transformation of the projections. Methods: Individual scatter components are fitted on the projections of a line source by monoexponentials. The position-dependent scatter parameters of each scatter component are then used to design non-station ary scatter correction kernels for each point in the projection. These kernels are used in a convolution-subtraction method which consecutively removes object, collimator and detector scatter from projections. This method is based on a model which assumes that image degradation results exclusively from Comp-ton interactions of annihilation photons, thus neglecting further Compton interactions of object scatters with collimator and de tector. Results: Subtraction of the object scatter component improved contrast typical of what is obtained with standard con volution-subtraction methods. The collimator scatter component is so weak that it can be safely combined with object scatter for correction. Subtraction of detector scatter from images did not improve contrast because statistical accuracy is degraded by removing counts from hot regions while cold regions (back ground) remain unchanged. Conclusion: Subtraction of object and collimator scatter improves contrast only. The slight gain in image sharpness resulting from the subtraction of detector scat ter does not <b>justify</b> <b>removal</b> of this component at the expense of sensitivity.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Polyorchidism {{is defined}} as the {{presence}} of more than two testes. The management of this rare condition is still debatable, particularly when it is an incidental finding at surgery. Case presentation We present the case of an 8 -year-old boy with triorchidism found incidentally during an elective orchidopexy. This supernumerary, ectopic and atrophic testis was removed to avoid an increased risk of malignancy. Conclusion Risk of malignancy <b>justifies</b> the <b>removal</b> of an atrophic and ectopic testis in triorchidism. However, it would appear safe to preserve a viable intrascrotal supernumerary testis found incidentally at surgery provided that the patient is followed up in the long term. </p...|$|R

5000|$|John Rohr, in {{defining}} bureaucrats as public administrators, approaches ethic standards in {{government as a}} requirement {{due to the nature}} of the work of administrators.

[...] Rohr assumes that public administrators are working to benefit the general public’s needs. When an elected official does not act in line with the public’s expectations, they can be removed from office. However, public administrators are protected with due process rights as government employees, and ethical violations can be difficult to <b>justify</b> the <b>removal</b> of a person from an office.|$|R
