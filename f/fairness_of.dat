40|$|In this study, I {{examined}} {{high school}} students' level of engagement by exploring {{the relationship between}} students' phenomenological perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> and their levels of engagement. This involved collecting and analyzing data based upon engagement and fairness scales that were created by a research team. Data were descriptively analyzed and factored to identify potentially distinct dimensions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> and engagement. Analysis included a correlation of four dimensions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> and five dimensions <b>of</b> engagement. <b>Fairness</b> and engagement were significantly related in almost all dimensions. One distinct finding was that "personal" perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> were more correlated with engagement than other dimensions <b>of</b> <b>fairness.</b> When personal fairness was partialled out of the correlation, other dimensions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> failed to relate significantly with engagement. This suggests that personal experience <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> has a more significant and salient affect on levels of engagement than any other identified dimension <b>of</b> <b>fairness...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E
5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the hearing.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least {{clear and convincing}} {{evidence}} of neglect.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> has {{received}} great attention in consumer behavior research lately.

5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In October 2004, Tony Blair {{announced}} he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year. Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; {{he was the only}} candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds {{in the war on terror}} as key priorities.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to test the hypothesis that relations between <b>fairness</b> perception <b>of</b> human resource management (HRM) practices and organizational commitment are affected by the quality of leader-member exchange (LMX). Specifically, we predicted the unique (positive) contribution <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> perception <b>of</b> HRM practices and LMX as well as their interaction to organizational commitment. A sample of 224 managers was drawn from nine diverse multinational, manufacturing companies located in Northern Malaysia. Participation in the research was voluntary. Data were gathered by means of a survey questionnaire that consisted of a series of psychometrically sound scales to assess the employed variables in the study. Hierarchical multiple regression results provided support for the direct impact <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> perceptions and LMX on each component of commitment. But significant interactions were convincingly evident only in the case of affective commitment. These interactions suggest that the impact <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> perceptions <b>of</b> HRM practices on affective commitment is not unconditional.

40|$|Objectives: Discussions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> in {{criminal}} justice risk assessments typically lack conceptual precision. Rhetoric too often substitutes for careful analysis. In this paper, {{we seek to}} clarify the tradeoffs between different kinds <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> and between fairness and accuracy. Methods: We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science and statistics to provide an integrated examination <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> and accuracy {{in criminal}} justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments. Results: We show that {{there are at least}} six kinds <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> some <b>of</b> which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy. Conclusions: Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time, and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds <b>of</b> <b>fairness.</b> In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging tradeoffs. Comment: Under a Revise and Resubmi...|$|R

40|$|The moral {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> or {{fair play}} {{is widely believed}} to be a solid ground for political obligation, i. e., a general prima facie moral duty to obey the law qua law.

This justificatory gap is unaffected by the ongoing debate between the voluntarist and the nonvoluntarist accounts <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> and it cannot be bridged by the two arguments that are perhaps implicit in Klosko‟s account, namely the presumptive benefits argument and the democratic procedure argument...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this article is to derive, test and {{validate}} a comprehensive, inclusive measure <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> in consumers <b>of</b> financial services, as current attempts to measure fairness in a broad-based multi-dimensional manner are underdeveloped. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach where a large-scale sample of the perceptions of financial services consumers is taken in three periods. Subsequently, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis are used to analyse the data. Findings - Fairness comprises three distinct but related elements, namely, procedural, interactional and distributive fairness, and further sub-dimensions are also apparent. The measurement scale exhibits a high degree of validity and reliability and represents a robust measure <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> perceptions. Research limitations/implications - Previous conceptual suppositions as to the multi-dimensional nature <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> are strongly supported. A comprehensive scale is provided for fellow researchers to utilise in other settings. The main limitation is that the measures were tested in a single context, although this is offset by the large scale of the pilot exercise and multiple waves of data collection. Practical implications - Perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> can be measured accurately and tracked, measures for sub-dimensions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> can be compared and differences among sectors and demographic segments can be explored. Perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> can be related to factors such as trust and purchase intentions in addition to other attitudinal measures. Originality/value - The fairness measure developed, tested and validated here is the most comprehensive, multi-dimensional measure <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> available that the authors know of. As such, it represents a valuable conceptual contribution to the assessment <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fairness...</b>|$|R
