2500|$|The {{satisfaction}} {{theory of}} atonement {{is a theory}} in Christian theology that Jesus Christ suffered crucifixion {{as a substitute for}} human sin, satisfying God's just wrath against man's transgression due to Christ's infinite merit. The theory draws primarily from the works of Anselm of Canterbury. It has been traditionally taught in the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Reformed traditions of Western Christianity. Theologically and historically, the word [...] "satisfaction" [...] does not mean gratification as in common usage, but rather [...] "to make restitution": mending what has been broken, or paying back what was taken. Since one of God's characteristics <b>is</b> <b>justice,</b> affronts to that justice must be atoned for. It is thus connected with the legal concept of balancing out an injustice.|$|E

2500|$|Instead, Anselm {{suggested}} that we owe God a debt of honor: [...] "This is the debt which man and angel owe to God, and no one who pays this debt commits sin; but every one who does not pay it sins. This <b>is</b> <b>justice,</b> or uprightness of will, which makes a being just or upright in heart, that is, in will; {{and this is the}} sole and complete debt of honor which we owe to God, and which God requires of us." [...] Having failed to render to God this debt, {{it is not enough to}} restore the justice originally owed, but the offense to God's honor must be satisfied, too. [...] "Moreover, so long as he does not restore what he has taken away, he remains in fault; and it will not suffice merely to restore what has been taken away, but, considering the contempt offered, he ought to restore more than he took away." [...] This debt creates an imbalance in the moral universe; God cannot simply ignore it according to Anselm. The only way to satisfy the debt was for a being of infinite greatness, acting as a man on behalf of men, to repay the debt of justice owed to God and satisfy the injury to divine honor. In light of this view, the [...] "ransom" [...] that Jesus mentions in the Gospels would be a sacrifice and a debt paid only to God the Father.|$|E
