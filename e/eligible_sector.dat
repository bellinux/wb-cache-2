This paper attempts to address some of the pertinent questions of climate change impacts in Nepal and then emphasizes on efforts required to make community forestry an <b>eligible</b> <b>sector</b> for international climate funds. Importance of the initiative lies on the fact that rural communities of developing nations have a crucial role to restore and manage local forests.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in European energy policy reveal an increasing interest {{in implementing the}} so-called ‘Tradable White Certificate’ (TWC) schemes to improve energy efficiency. Based on three evaluation criteria (cost-effectiveness, environmental effectiveness and distributional equity) this paper analyses the implications of implementing a European-wide TWC scheme targeting the household and commercial sectors. Using a bottom-up model, quantitative results show significant cost-effective potentials for improvements (ca. 1400 TWh in cumulative energy savings by 2020), with the household sector, gas and space heating representing most of the TWC supply in terms of <b>eligible</b> <b>sector,</b> fuel and energy service demand, respectively. If a single market price of negative externalities is considered, a societal costeffective potential of energy savings above 30 % (compared to the baseline) is observed. In environmental terms, the resulting greenhouse gas emission reductions are around 200 Mt CO 2 -eq by 2010, representing nearly 60 % of the EU-Kyoto-target. From the qualitative perspective, several embedded ancillary benefits are identified (e. g. employment generation, improved comfort level, reduced ‘fuel poverty’, security of energy supply). Whereas an EU-wide TWC increases liquidity and reduces the risks ofmarket power, autarky compliance strategies may be expected in order to capture co-benefits nationally. Cross subsidies could occur due to investment recovery mechanisms {{and there is a}} risk that effects may be regressive for low-income households. Assumptions undertaken by the modelling approach strongly indicate that high effectiveness of other policy instruments is needed for an EU-wide TWC scheme to be cost-effective...|$|E

Several distribution rules are simulated based on: the historical emissions, the least-cost approach and the auctioning scheme with and without a preliminary selection of <b>eligible</b> <b>sectors.</b> (1) The resulting marginal abatement cost in ETS <b>eligible</b> <b>sectors</b> is only 5. 75 EUR/t CO 2 for reducing pollution by 20. 7 %. Such a low level is explained by low energy prices and by substitution possibilities with low carbon content resources (nuclear and hydroelectricity). (2) Including all sectors in the trade creates a more flexible market than in the ETS, since more reduction options are available. (3) The ETS has high feasibility for monitoring. All <b>eligible</b> <b>sectors</b> (except refineries and metallurgy) present the lowest abatement cost in the economy. (4) Auctioning introduces a strong carbon price-signal, which reduces emission intensity but creates distortions in terms of trade and worsens the country's energy dependency.

40|$|U. S. {{adoption}} of a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases could place some domestic producers at a disadvantage relative to international competitors who do not face similar regulation. To address this issue, proposed federal climate change legislation includes a provision that would freely allocate (or rebate) emission allowances to <b>eligible</b> <b>sectors</b> using a continuously updating output-based formula. Eligibility for the rebates would be determined at the industry-level based on emissions or energy intensity and a measure of import penetration. Dynamic updating of permit allocations {{has the potential to}} mitigate adverse competitiveness impacts and emissions leakage in eligible industries. It can also undermine the cost-e¤ectiveness of permit market outcomes, as more of the mandated emissions reductions must then be achieved by sources deemed ineligible for rebates. This chapter investigates both the bene…ts and the costs of output-based updating. It identi…es di¤erences between proposed eligibility criteria and those consistent with standard measures of economic e ¢ ciency. The analysis underlines the importance of taking both bene…ts and costs into account when determining the scale and scope of output-based rebating provisions in cap-and-trade programs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis of market behaviour under 'Tradable White Certificate' (TWC) schemes. It {{focuses on the}} entire set of 'flexibilities' granted to obliged parties to meet a mandatory energy-saving target cost-effectively, i. e. range eligible measures, <b>eligible</b> end-use <b>sectors,</b> banking provision, market engagement of non-obliged parties, and trading as such. We found that market behaviour responds to the unique design and context in which TWC schemes are implemented. Contrary to expectations, limited trading is observed so the 'to-trade-or-not-to-trade' dilemma is further analysed. A real TWC market has emerged only in Italy, where obliged parties (i. e. energy distributors) show preference towards 'to-trade'. In Great Britain and France, an autarky compliance approach is identified, with obliged parties (i. e. energy suppliers) showing preference towards 'not-to-trade' driven by, among many factors, commercial benefits of non-trading (e. g. increased competitiveness). At the same time, results show clearer indications of cost-effectiveness for Great Britain than for Italy. In general, high energy-saving effectiveness is observed, but low ambitious saving targets and pitfalls in the regulatory framework {{need to be considered}} to further develop TWC markets. Initial market and institutional conditions strongly suggest that trading might not be an immediate outcome. Ambitious energy targets can trigger a more dynamic usage of all flexibilities by eligible parties and thus active behaviour in TWC markets...|$|R

Despite this designation, virtually no data are available on the diversity of this Reserve and Opwall is establishing a field camp to start annual surveys from 2012 onwards in these northern forests. These data together with those from Lambusango can then be compiled into a Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance report that will make the Buton forests <b>eligible</b> for corporate <b>sector</b> funding under the REDD+ initiative. Corporate investors benefit by receiving Voluntary Carbon Scheme (VCS) credits and quantifiable benefits to biodiversity and poverty alleviation to surrounding communities from the annual REDD payments, which are based on performance in protecting the forests.|$|R

40|$|Current human {{energy use}} and waste {{management}} practices {{have been associated}} with massive greenhouse gases emission resulting in climate change. Degradation of the already indebted environment and potential threat to sustainability due to the impacts is on the rise and has led to a unique synergy by world leaders to find antidotes. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) through Kyoto Protocol in 1997 practically began championing the remedial effort mainly through one of the flexible mechanisms, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), by which industrialized nations invest in green developments in developing nations and invariably earn carbon credits for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction with a parallel greening of the development nation. University of Malaya is among the five pilot centres for low carbon city frame work assessment in Malaysia; hence this study was conducted to ascertain the eligibility of the institution for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as its transits to a low carbon campus. The focal points for the evaluation was electricity use and waste management practices as they fall into two of the six <b>sectors</b> <b>eligible</b> for CDM in Malaysia; energy efficiency and waste management. The objectives have been effectively analyzed adopting a conservatively prudent analysis incorporating primary and secondary data, onsite assessments and evaluation, perusal and integration of associated literature. Finally CDM methodologies AMS 11. N/ version 01. 0 and AMS 111. AO. /Version 01 are applied.
