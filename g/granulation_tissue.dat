5|$|If <b>granulation</b> <b>tissue</b> grows {{over the}} injured site, {{it can cause}} {{stenosis}} of the airway, after a week to a month. The <b>granulation</b> <b>tissue</b> must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E

Full-thickness skin wounds were created on the backs of mice, and angiogenesis in wound <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> was estimated. Wound closure and re-epithelization in EP 3 receptor knockout mice (EP 3 −/−) were significantly delayed compared with their wild-type (WT) mice, whereas those in EP 1 −/−, EP 2 −/−, and EP 4 −/− were not delayed. Wound-induced angiogenesis estimated with CD 31 immunohistochemistry in EP 3 −/− mice was significantly inhibited compared with that in WT mice. Immunoreactive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in wound <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> in EP 3 −/− mice was markedly less than that in WT mice. Wound closure in WT mice was delayed significantly by VEGF neutralizing antibody compared with control IgG. Wound-induced angiogenesis and wound closure were significantly suppressed in EP 3 −/− bone marrow transplantation mice compared with those in WT bone marrow transplantation mice. These were accompanied with the reductions in accumulation of VEGF-expressing cells in wound <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> and in mobilization of VEGF receptor 1 -expressing leukocytes in peripheral circulation. These results indicate that the recruitment of EP 3 -expressing cells to wound <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> is critical for surgical wound healing and angiogenesis via up-regulation of VEGF...|$|R

The tibial attachments of the ACLs from 32 rheumatoid knees taken during total knee replacement were examined by light microscope. Sections of samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H. E.) and peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) methods. The destructive changes of ligament attachments were degeneration of collagen fibers, disappearance of fibrocartilage zone and mineralized fibrocartilage zone, increase of fibroblast-like cells at the area of ligament insertion, change and disappearance of tide mark, invasion of fibrous <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues,</b> bone trabecular thinning, inflammation of intramedullary space, and proliferation of blood vessels at the ACL with <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues.</b> Statistical examination of these findings showed that the condition of tide mark is characteristic in destruction of the enthesis of rheumatoid knees. Calcification and ossification of the enthesis were not observed, and turnover of the enthesis can be very active. On the other hand, large monocytes and fibroblast-like cells at the area invasived by fibrous <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> have positive staining for lysozyme by PAP method. Monocytes and chondrocytes at the area remained in the fibrocartilage zone and mineralized fibrocartilage zone were positive for S- 100 protein. The present pathological study of the ACL destruction of the rheumatoid knees confirmed that tide mark is very peculiar in the changes of the enthesis. Invasion of the <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> from intramedullary space {{can also be a}} cause to destruct the ligament attachment...|$|R

The mean value (0. 12 ± 0. 01 SD) {{of the type}} V/type I ratio in the <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> was significantly higher (p < 0. 001) than that (0. 03 ± 0. 01 SD) of the ratio in normal skin. The average ratio of α 1 (V) :α 2 (V) :α 3 (V) of type V collagen purified from the <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> {{was determined to be}} about 5 : 3 : 1. SD-polyacrylamide {{gel electrophoresis}} patterns of 3 α chains were not affected in {{the presence or absence of}} 2 -mercaptoethanol. Purified type V collagen was degraded by bacterial collagenase, but remained intact after tadpole collagenase digestion, in contrast to type I and type III collagens. Amino acid analyses of each α chain separated on SDS-gel electrophoresis of type V collagen revealed that all 3 α chains of type V collagen were poor in alanine, rich in hydroxylysine, and had high ratios of hydroxylysine/lysine, which are typical features of type V collagen. The purified type V collagen was further fractionated by ammonium sulfate into 2 molecular species, [α 1 (V) ] 2 α 2 (V) and α 1 (V) α 2 (V) α 3 (V). Our data demonstrate that type V collagen in preparations from human post-burn <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> consists of 3 α chains and can be resolved into 2 distinct heterotrimers...|$|R

25|$|In {{skin wound}} healing, CYR61 is highly {{expressed}} in the <b>granulation</b> <b>tissue</b> by myofibroblasts, which proliferate and rapidly synthesize ECM to maintain tissue integrity and to promote regeneration of parenchymal cells. However, excessive matrix deposition can lead to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of tissue function. In skin wounds, CYR61 accumulates in the <b>granulation</b> <b>tissue</b> as myofibroblasts proliferate, and eventually reaches a sufficiently high level to drive the myofibroblasts themselves into senescence, whereupon these cells cease to proliferate and express matrix-degrading enzymes. Thus, CYR61 limits synthesis and deposition of ECM by myofibroblasts, {{reducing the risk of}} fibrosis during wound healing. In addition to skin wound healing, CYR61 expression is elevated in remodeling cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, in vascular injury, and in the long bones during fracture repair. Blockade of CYR61 by antibodies inhibits bone fracture healing in mice. In the kidney, CYR61 is expressed in podocytes in normal adult and embryonic glomeruli, but expression is decreased in IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy, particularly in diseased kidneys with severe mesangial expansion.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of mild moxibustion on {{angiogenesis}} and microcirculation in wound repair after operation of anal fistula, and to explore the mechanism of action. Methods: Seventy-two SD male rats were made to bear an “acute, open, bleeding, infected” wound surface and were divided randomly into mild moxibustion group, microwave group and control group (24 rats per group). The wound surfaces of the treatment groups were treated for 15 min with mild moxibustion or microwave medical instrument {{from the first day}} after operation, and the control group was not given any treatment. At the first, third, seventh and fourteenth days after operation (1, 3, 7 and 14 days of treatment), six rats in each group were sacrificed after examining the blood flow of the wound surface, and the samples of <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> were collected. The numbers of CD 34 and positive expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> were detected. Results: In the early and middle stages of wound healing, mild moxibustion could obviously increase the expression of VEGF, the number of CD 34, and the blood flow of the wound surface. And the expression of VEGF, the number of CD 34, and the blood flow of the wound surface began to increase at the third day, and reached the peak level at the seventh day, and then began to decrease. In the late stage of wound healing (day 14), mild moxibustion could decrease the expression of VEGF, the number of CD 34, and decrease the blood flow of the wound surface. There were significant differences between the mild moxibustion group and the control group in the blood flow of the wound surface, the expression of VEGF and the numbers of CD 34 in <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> (P＜ 0. 05) after treatment, and except the number of CD 34 at 14 -day treatment, there were also differences between the mild moxibustion group and the microwave group. Conclusion: Mild moxibustion has better regulative actions on blood flow of the wound surface and the number of CD 34 and positive expression of VEGF in <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues,</b> and can regulate microcirculation in wound surface and promote the wound healing...|$|R

Additionally, infected wounds may have a gangrenous smell, be discolored, and may eventually produce more pus.|$|E
25|$|Tattooing {{involves}} {{the placement of}} pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin <b>granulation</b> <b>tissue</b> forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary.

To better understand the effects of HGF on wound healing, we performed human HGF-gene transfer into skin wounds in rats. The rat HGF mRNA levels, and human and rat HGF protein concentrations in the wounds in HGF gene-transfer rats were significantly elevated at 3 days, 3 to 14 days, and 3 and 14 days after gene transfer, respectively. An expression of human HGF mRNA and protein was revealed in squamous cells in the epidermis, in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in blood vessels, and in fibroblasts in <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> at 3, 7, and 14 days after gene transfer in HGF gene-transfer rats. The wound lesion area in HGF gene-transfer rats was significantly less than that in control rats from 3 to 7 days after gene transfer. The re-epithelialization rate, microvessel counts in <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues,</b> proliferating cell nuclear antigen index of fibroblasts in <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues,</b> and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen index in the epidermis of HGF gene-transfer rats were significantly increased at 3 and 7 days after gene transfer. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression levels of transforming growth factor-β 1 and Colα 2 (I) mRNAs in the wounds of HGF gene-transfer rats were significantly decreased at 7 and 14 days, respectively. The hydroxyproline concentration in the wound was significantly less in HGF gene-transfer rats than in control rats at 3 days after gene transfer. These results suggest that HGF gene transfer into a skin wound may aid re-epithelialization and neovascularization in the early phase of wound healing, and that HGF {{may play a role}} in modulating cutaneous wound healing...|$|R

The experiment took place in Histology Laboratory, School of Medicine, Padjadjaran University, Bandung, November 2006 -April 2007. The prospective experimental method was held in 10 days. Subjects were male ddy mice divided into 3 groups (each consisted of 9 mices), which were control group solcoseryl jelly, 10 % ALEC in vaseline and 1. 0 g Khaula honey treated group. The comparisons in accelerating skin wound healing were investigated by using full thickness skin wound model produced {{on the back of the}} mice. Solcoseryl jelly was applied topically to wound of group 1, group 2 and group 3 mice were treated topically with 10 % ALEC in vaseline and Khaula honey, respectively. The mice were sacrificed on 4 th, 7 th, and 10 th day of post wounding for evaluating the histological changes. Data was obtained by microscopically analysis of the skin based on the epidermal regeneration, <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> thickness and angiogenesis and then analyzed by using parametric independent T-test. The level for statistical significant was set p < 0. 05. The result of this experiment showed that there were significant difference between control group and ALEC 10 % in vaseline in three mentioned above. Comparison between control and Khaula honey showed differences only in epidermal regeneration and angiogenesis. Wound treated with ALEC 10 % in vaseline and Khaula honey group showed significantly difference in epidermal regeneration (mean 2. 19 (0. 81) for ALEC 10 % and 2. 67 (0. 67) for honey group, p value < 0. 001) and <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> thickness (mean 2. 99 (0. 94) for ALEC 10 % and 3. 23 (0. 99) for honey group, p value 0. 038).

25|$|The cause(s) of {{dry socket}} are not {{completely}} understood. Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is extravasated into the socket, and a blood clot (thrombus) forms. This blood clot is replaced with <b>granulation</b> <b>tissue</b> which consists of proliferating fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from remnants of the periodontal membrane, surrounding alveolar bone and gingival mucosa. In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, fibrillar bone and finally by mature, woven bone. The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g., secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause sclerotic bone to form). The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the degeneration of the clot and {{may be caused by}} the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and formation of kinins.

25|$|Obsidian {{can be used}} to make {{extremely}} sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type {{of glass}} knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, as with any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less <b>granulation</b> <b>tissue</b> at seven days, in a group of rats, although no differences were found after 21 days. Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes, and has written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may currently be purchased for surgical use on research animals.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, {{the most}} serious and {{immediate}} complication is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which usually occurs within 24 h. Those with significant lower airway involvement may develop bacterial infection. Importantly, victims suffering body surface burn and smoke inhalation are the most susceptible. Thermal injury combined with inhalation injury compromises pulmonary function, producing microvascular hyperpermeability {{that leads to a}} significant increase in lung lymph flow and pulmonary edema. The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 left many people with impaired lung function. A study of firefighters and EMS workers enrolled in the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, whose lung function was tested prior to 9/11, documented a steep decline in lung function in the first year after 9/11. A new study that includes a thousand additional workers shows that the declines have persisted over time. Prior to 9/11, 3% of firefighters had below-normal lung function, one year after 9/11 nearly 19% did, and six years later it stabilized at 13%. Ten to 14 days after acute exposure to some agents (e.g. ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury), some patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans progressing to ARDS. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia can ensue when <b>granulation</b> <b>tissue</b> accumulates in the terminal airways and alveolar ducts during the body's reparative process.

This study investigated the in vivo expression profile and levels of mCD 14 in healthy and diseased gingival tissues. Methods: Gingival biopsies were obtained from 24 patients with chronic periodontitis, including 22 periodontal pocket tissues, 13 clinically healthy tissues, and 18 inflamed connective <b>tissues</b> (i. e., <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues).</b> Gingival biopsies from seven periodontally healthy subjects were used as controls. mCD 14 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: mCD 14 was detected in 21 of 22 periodontal pocket tissues and all other categories of tissues. The mCD 14 -positive cells were mainly confined to the gingival epithelium-connective tissue interface.

Here, we examined the roles of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) receptor (EP) signaling in enhancement of lymphangiogenesis in wound healing processes. The hole-punch was made in the ears of male C 57 BL/ 6 mice using a metal ear punch. Healing process and lymphangiogenesis together with macrophage recruitment were analyzed in EP knockout mice. Lymphangiogenesis was up-regulated in the <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> at the margins of punched-hole wounds in mouse ears, and this increase was accompanied by increased expression levels of COX- 2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase- 1. Administration of celecoxib, a COX- 2 inhibitor, suppressed lymphangiogenesis in the <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> and reduced the induction of the pro-lymphangiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -C and VEGF-D. Topical applications of selective EP receptor agonists enhanced the expressions of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor- 1 and VEGF receptor- 3. The wound-healing processes and recruitment of CD 11 b-positive macrophages, which produced VEGF-C and VEGF-D, were suppressed under COX- 2 inhibition. Mice lacking either EP 3 or EP 4 exhibited reduced wound-healing, lymphangiogenesis and recruitment of M 2 macrophages, compared with wild type mice. Proliferation of cultured human lymphatic endothelial cells was not detected under PGE 2 stimulation. Lymphangiogenesis and recruitment of M 2 macrophages that produced VEGF-C/D were suppressed in mice treated with a COX- 2 inhibitor or lacking either EP 3 or EP 4 during wound healing.

In both the graft and the donor sites, wound contraction and crust formation were not found throughout the study, although the skin of hairless dogs lagged considerably behind that of other haired dogs in wound healing. At 2 weeks after the skin grafting, histologically, the epidermis of the grafts showed thickening and irregular hyperplasia with prominent rete ridges, suggesting a relatively high rate of cell proliferation and/or differentiation. In the dermis, the formation of <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> was found, and neovascularization was obscure. At 4 weeks after skin grating, the epidermis remained thick and hair follicles with well-developed sebaceous glands were observed in some portions. In the donor sites, at 2 weeks after the treatment with hydrocolloid dressing, there was reepithelialization arising from the wound margin. In the dermis, dense <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> containing many fibroblasts and collagen fibers were formed. At 4 weeks after the treatment, the regenerated skin exhibited a remarkable thickening of the epidermis, especially the granular layer, and well-developed rete ridges. These findings revealed that the treatment with the hydrocolloid dressing was a valuable measure in accelerating graft take and wound healing in the donor sites of hairless dogs...|$|R
40|$|Lacerated wound most {{commonly}} occurs due to road traffic accidents. Such lacerated wound when ignored gets infected due to low immunity & many other factors. Infected wounds requires surgical debridement to maintain good healing process. Such procedure is very painful & patient gets afraid of surgical debridement. In this way patient keeps away himself from proper treatment. In such cases non surgical procedure {{should be used}} which are similarly effective to surgical procedure hence this attempt is tried to make by Ksharaplota in the present study. Ksharaplota is used with dressing on alternate day for 10 days. After each sitting, observations were recorded. After 10 days healthy <b>granulation</b> <b>tissues</b> & wound contraction occurred. Hence Ksharaplota is useful as non surgical parameter which similarly effective to surgical parameter...|$|R
