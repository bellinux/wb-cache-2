5|$|Born in Burntwood, Staffordshire, Sutton {{performed}} well at school, but withdrew his applications to university in 2012 after his terminal prognosis for colorectal cancer. His father had fought the disease twice, {{and both were}} predisposed to it through Lynch syndrome. Sutton had struggled to get a diagnosis as <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not believe that colorectal cancer could occur in a teenager.|$|E
5|$|Mengele {{and other}} SS <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not treat inmates, but {{supervised}} {{the activities of}} inmate doctors forced {{to work in the}} camp medical service. Mengele made weekly visits to the hospital barracks and sent to the gas chambers any prisoners who had not recovered after two weeks in bed. He was {{also a member of the}} team of doctors responsible for supervising the administration of Zyklon B, the cyanide-based pesticide that was used to kill people in the gas chambers at Birkenau. He served in this capacity at the gas chambers located in crematoria IV and V.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June {{the court}} acquitted nine medics and {{downgraded}} sentences against nine others. Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not appeal their sentences of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the verdict is final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they could still be pardoned by the king.|$|E

5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|About {{the same}} time as his gubernatorial {{campaign}} began, Blackburn appeared before the Kentucky General Assembly to advocate measures to protect the state against disease outbreaks, including the creation of a state board of health and the construction of quarantine centers in the state's border towns. To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for the state board of health, which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that yellow fever had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, but many of the state's <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not believe yellow fever could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the Jackson Purchase region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn's advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{in early}} 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with tuberculosis, {{and had to}} leave his {{position}} at Princeton. He then returned to Worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery. His <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not expect him to live. He spent time outside in the fresh air, walked for exercise and gradually improved.|$|E

25|$|During this pandemic, the {{scientific}} community varied in its beliefs {{about the causes of}} cholera. In France doctors believed cholera was associated with the poverty of certain communities or poor environment. Russians believed the disease was contagious, although <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not understand how it spread. The United States believed that cholera was brought by recent immigrants, specifically the Irish, and epidemiologists understand they were carrying disease from British ports. Lastly, some British thought the disease might rise from divine intervention.|$|E
25|$|On 17 February 1943 he took {{command of}} 183rd Infantry Brigade forming part of 61st Infantry Division, a Second-Line Territorial Army {{formation}} also deployed {{in a home}} defence role. At one point during these years of training, Stanier lost an eye when a soldier dropped a primed grenade by mistake. Luckily, the <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not downgrade him medically, because he was selected for {{a key role in}} the forthcoming Normandy landings. He was promoted to colonel on 31 December 1943.|$|E
25|$|In {{his last}} game, the {{aforementioned}} playoff victory over Cincinnati in January 1991, Jackson suffered a dislocated hip following a tackle. In the film You Don't Know Bo, Jackson claimed {{that after he}} discovered the injury, he physically popped his hip back into the socket {{and in the process}} damaged the blood vessels supplying blood to the area. While <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not find proof that Jackson physically reset his hip, they did discover that there was a fracture of one of Jackson's hip bones.|$|E

25|$|Neurological {{problems}} following tick bites {{were recognized}} {{starting in the}} 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström {{was the first to}} propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.|$|E
25|$|In the Crimean War against Russia, Nightingale was {{appointed}} to oversee the introduction of female nurses into the military hospitals in Turkey, after criticisms in the British press. In November 1854, Nightingale arrived at the barrack hospital near Constantinople, with a party of 38 nurses. Initially the <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not want the nurses there and {{did not ask for}} their help, but within ten days fresh casualties arrived from the Battle of Inkermann and the nurses were fully stretched. When Nightingale returned from the Crimean War in August 1856, she hid herself away from the public's attention. For her contribution to Army statistics and comparative hospital statistics in 1860, Nightingale became the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the Statistical Society.|$|E
25|$|Genie quickly began {{growing and}} putting on weight and {{steadily}} became more confident in her movements, and by December she had good eye–hand coordination and was much better at focusing her eyes. She rapidly developed a sense of possession, hoarding objects to which she took a liking for reasons <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not know, and became extremely upset if someone touched or moved anything she collected. She took all kinds of items but particularly sought colorful plastic objects, which doctors speculated was due to these having been the items she had access to as a child, {{and she did not}} seem to care whether they were toys or ordinary containers but especially sought out beach pails. During {{the first few months of}} her stay, giving her one of these objects could bring her out of a tantrum.|$|E

25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her. When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not initially know how to treat it. Instead, they were waiting {{to see how it}} progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. When she left the hospital {{for the first time in}} a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a need to explain to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in her legs, and if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. The last time she was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory. Perales earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy, which she earned from the Universidad de Zaragoza where she was a student from 1996 to 1999.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} her 77th year, Coretta began {{experiencing}} health problems. Her husband's former secretary, Dora McDonald, assisted her part-time in this period. Hospitalized in April 2005, a {{month after}} speaking in Selma at the 40th anniversary of the Selma Voting Rights Movement, she was diagnosed with a heart condition and was discharged on her 78th and final birthday. Later, she suffered several small strokes. On August 16, 2005, she was hospitalized after suffering a stroke and a mild heart attack. Initially, she was unable to speak or move her right side. King's daughter Bernice reported that she had been able to move her leg on Sunday, August 21 while her other daughter and oldest child Yolanda asserted that the family expected her to fully recover. She was released from Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta on September 22, 2005, after regaining some of her speech and continued physiotherapy at home. Due to continuing health problems, Mrs. King cancelled a number of speaking and traveling engagements throughout the remainder of 2005. On January 14, 2006, Coretta made her last public appearance in Atlanta at a dinner honoring her husband's memory. On January 26, 2006, King checked into a rehabilitation center in Rosarito Beach, Mexico under a different name. <b>Doctors</b> <b>did</b> not learn her real identity until her medical records arrived the next day, and did not begin treatment due to her condition.|$|E
500|$|At the Regimental Aid Post, Waddy {{found that}} the <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not rate his chances {{particularly}} highly; the 156 Battalion's war diary even recorded that [...] "B Company commander was fatally wounded". He was taken next to a Field Ambulance post {{and from there to}} the Tafelburg hotel in Oosterbeek, now being used as a Main Dressing Station. [...] Here he was operated on in the hotel's billiard room where Major Guy Rigby Jones used the billiard table to perform surgery. [...] A day later he was moved to a house opposite as the number of casualties increased. Because the aid stations were in {{the front lines of the}} Oosterbeek perimeter, they came under constant fire and he was wounded twice more. A mortar round shell fragment lodged in his left foot, and a later hit caused splinter injuries to his face and shoulder. [...] On another occasion, as the battle seesawed around the aid post, Germans occupied his building. A British sniper shot a German rifleman, prompting a German sergeant to lecture the British about shooting at a Red Cross house. [...] When the house caught fire he was taken outside and driven to a collection point from where German medics took him to Apeldoorn.|$|E

2500|$|Weidman faced Gegard Mousasi at UFC 210. At 3:13 in {{the second}} round, Mousasi kneed Weidman twice in the head while Weidman had his hands near the ground. The referee stopped the fight because {{he thought that the}} second of these strikes was illegal. Weidman was allowed to recover, but after {{watching}} the replay the officials concluded the strike was legal. The <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not allow Weidman to continue and a TKO victory was granted to Mousasi.|$|E
2500|$|The {{population}} of New Orleans and other settlements in south Louisiana suffered from epidemics of yellow fever, malaria, cholera, and smallpox, {{beginning in the}} late 18th century and periodically throughout the 19th century. <b>Doctors</b> <b>did</b> not understand how the diseases were transmitted; primitive sanitation and lack of a public water system contributed to public health problems, as did the highly transient {{population of}} sailors and immigrants. The city successfully suppressed a final outbreak of yellow fever in 1905. (See below, 20th century.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{essay was}} favourably {{reviewed}} in The Saturday Review, but an editorial against the essay appeared in The Spectator. From there {{it proved to}} be influential, and other writers came out in support of such views: Lionel Tollemache wrote in favour of euthanasia, as did Annie Besant, the essayist and reformer who later became involved with the National Secular Society, considering it a duty to society to [...] "die voluntarily and painlessly" [...] when one reaches the point of becoming a 'burden'. Popular Science analyzed the issue in May 1873, assessing both sides of the argument. Kemp notes that at the time, medical <b>doctors</b> <b>did</b> not participate in the discussion; it was [...] "essentially a philosophical enterprise... tied inextricably to a number of objections to the Christian doctrine of the sanctity of human life".|$|E
