5|$|Sir Archibald Geikie (1835–1924) was {{the first}} to {{recognise}} that there had been multiple glaciations, and his 1863 paper On the glacial <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> Scotland was a landmark in the emergent theories of glaciation. He became Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom in 1888 and was also well known for his work on volcanism.|$|E
5|$|The geology of {{the borough}} is unremarkable; the bedrock is mainly {{composed}} of sand with patches of clay {{to the east}} and west, and superficial deposits (<b>drift)</b> <b>of</b> sand and gravel cover the entire area. The extraction of sand and gravel for construction purposes is carried out in the borough and the opening of more sites is planned.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of other}} species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds. There is a constant <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> invertebrates washed downstream by the current, and these animals, and bits of debris, accumulate in the nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats.|$|E

5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small and severely fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E

5|$|Mauna Loa has {{probably}} been erupting for at least 700,000years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which {{has been responsible for}} the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years. The slow <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific Plate will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the hotspot within 500,000 to one million years from now, at which point it will become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> the polar ice when, in 1884, he read the theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current, flowing from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E
5|$|The <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> the Antarctic {{exploration}} vessel SY Aurora was {{an ordeal}} which lasted 312days, during the Ross Sea chapter of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. It {{began when the}} ship broke loose from its anchorage in McMurdo Sound in May 1915, during a gale. Caught in heavy pack ice and unable to manoeuvre, Aurora, with eighteen men aboard, was carried into the open waters of the Ross Sea and Southern Ocean, leaving ten men stranded ashore with meagre provisions.|$|E

3000|$|The {{reported}} literature {{reveals that}} <b>drifting</b> <b>of</b> vacancies has been highly nonlinear near the boundary interfaces. This {{is attributed to}} the nanoscale phenomena by which even a small voltage can produce large electric field across the device. This large electric field further generates nonlinear <b>drifting</b> <b>of</b> vacancies near the boundary interfaces [19]. Another problem with linear <b>drift</b> model <b>of</b> memristor is that, the state variable ‘w’ never reaches to zero physical length which indicates that the oxygen vacancies are absent in the devices [20]. The boundary problem can be minimized by adopting window function f(x). In general, the window function can be multiplied to state equation of memristor which is given as, [...]...|$|R
5|$|The {{mouth of}} the river {{has not always been}} at Littlehampton. Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at Lancing some ten miles to the east before {{entering}} the sea. This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> the tides, pushing the Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and Ferring at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.|$|E
5|$|There {{remained}} {{the men of}} the Ross Sea Party, who were stranded at Cape Evans in McMurdo Sound, after Aurora had been blown from its anchorage and driven out to sea, unable to return. The ship, after a <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> many months, had returned to New Zealand. Shackleton travelled there to join Aurora, and sailed with her to the rescue of the Ross Sea party. This group, despite many hardships, had carried out its depot-laying mission to the full, but three lives had been lost, including that of its commander, Aeneas Mackintosh.|$|E
5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E

5|$|The {{small and}} {{isolated}} {{nature of the}} site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to be generally damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, {{which means that the}} land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments. In the future it is hoped that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.|$|E
