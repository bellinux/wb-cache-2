40|$|Aerospace {{structural}} components {{made from}} polymer matrix composites (PMCs) offer numerous advantages. Their high stiffness and high strength combined with low densities enable lower fuel consumption coupled with higher payloads. As a result, PMCs provide an important economic advantage over typical metallic airframes. Textile reinforcements for PMCs {{are made by}} assembling reinforcement fibres, typically carbon. Then, the textile reinforcements are typically cut into smaller pieces, stacked, draped and assembled into a dry assembly called a preform, the shape of which generally approaches that of the PMC part to be made. This manufacturing process is labour intensive and expensive. Novel thick, net-shape, <b>drapable,</b> high vf textile reinforcements used toward manufacturing aerospace PMCs are being developed at the University of Ottawa. The technology enables the manufacturing of flat, <b>drapable</b> multilayered near net-shape preforms. The bending and in-plane shear behaviours of such novel thick reinforcement textiles was investigated to understand and define the behaviour of such thick fabric reinforcements when formed into required shapes. A bending apparatus was developed for investigating the bending behaviour of these novel thick reinforcement fabrics and an articulated frame shear rig was used for investigating the in-plane shear behaviour. A non-destructive inspection method using infrared imaging was used for investigating and identifying flaws and defects in these thick, dry textile reinforcements, aiming at increasing the quality and reproducibility of the final PMC parts made from these reinforcements...|$|E
40|$|Net-shape weft {{knitting}} {{is used to}} produce preforms for complex shape composite parts, {{as illustrated by the}} wheel wells of the Sunrise all-composite electric vehicle. An integrated design for the manufacturing methodology links mechanical performance to cloth and stitch design. The use of <b>drapable</b> net-shape fabrics with tailored fiber reinforcement produced on automated knitting machines allows for a significant reduction in preform manufacturing costs. Net-shape two-dimensional knitted fabrics for the wheel wells are achieved by a combination of shaping techniques: holding, narrowing, widening, and binding off. An interlock stitch is chosen to guarantee sufficient mechanical performance and to protect the brittle knitting yam. The mechanical properties of the composites are studied, and the strength in the weak warp direction where only looped fibers are present is optimized by choosing a sufficiently large loop size. In the weft direction, lay-in yarns are tucked in to increase production speed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thin diamond {{membranes}} and free-standing {{sheets are}} of interest {{for a variety of}} potential applications. This article describes the film nucleation, microwave plasma-assisted chemical-vapor-deposition synthesis, and subsequent processing steps required to make free-standing strong and flexible diamond foils of several cm 2. Films are initially deposited on silicon wafers as ultrananocyrstalline, nanocrystalline, or microcrystalline diamond by varying selected deposition parameters including gas composition, nucleation, power, substrate temperature, and pressure. Subsequently the diamond is separated from the original substrate and applied either to new substrates or to frames. Diamond membranes and sheets with thickness between 1 and 3 Âµm have been fabricated from each of these film types. The sheets are <b>drapable</b> and can be applied to curved surfaces and wrapped around cylinders. Properties of the films including optical transmission, Young's modulus and fracture strength are described. Several examples of foils and associated frames and substrates are given...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} the development and construction of a weight-optimized hybrid material from <b>drapable</b> material (resilient reinforcement preferably made of metallic knitted and/or woven structures) and Aluminum foam for energy absorption. Focus is the application as explosion protection element for buildings. Both structures aluminum foam and knitted/woven metallic structures show low weight related to their volume. Because of their inner structure they are predestined for the use case "energy absorption". During the project, a new composite material made of steel cover sheets, metal wire structures and metal foam has been developed, that is capable to reduce the destructive force of a blast (explosion pressure wave). Depending at the requirements the sandwich panels can be directly fixed or temporarily connected to the building to protect ist structure. Given corresponding application solutions have been developed. The high potential of the hybrid material has been proved within the scope of the joint research project (project number: KF 2039731 AG 3) funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy following a decision of the German Federal Parliament. The project consortium consisted of the Saxon Textile Research Institute e. V. (STFI), the Drahtweberei Pausa, SMK Ingenieure GmbH & Co. KG and the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology (IWU). It will be concluded in August 2016...|$|E
40|$|Preforms and {{composites}} {{manufactured by}} novel flax/polypropylene cowrap spinning method Jinhua Jiang 1, 2 and Nanliang Chen 1, 2 In the past decade, natural fiber composites with thermoplastic matrices have been embraced by many composite manufactures for its properties such as lightweight and low cost. Reinforced cowrap spinning yarns and thermoplastics offer {{a potential for}} low-cost manufacturing of complex-shaped and good, <b>drapable</b> composite parts, due to reduced impregnation times and resin flow distance during processing. In this article, the cowrap spinning yarns were produced by cowrap spinning method with flax and polypropylene (PP) and then woven to fabric preforms. The natural flax fibers were twistless in yarns and preforms, and PP served as a carrier for flax and prevented damage to flax fibers during processing, and became the polymer matrix in the final composites. To get an even distribution of fibers and thermo-plastic resins in preforms and different flax fiber content, the main spinning parameters (hollow spindle twist and hollow spindle rotational speed) were analyzed and optimized. Besides fabric structure, the parameters affecting the mechanical properties of flax/PP preforms and composites were investigated. The fabric density, fabric structure (including plain, twill, and basket weave), and yarn tensile orientation (at 0, 90, and 45) had a great influence on the tensile strength and elongation of preforms. Different pretreatments on flax/PP were investigated, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of thermoplastic composites showed improved wettability of impregnation and good adhesion and bonding interface between flax fiber and PP matrix in composites...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} wearable antennas {{that are}} useful for body-centric communication systems. Novel wearable printed monopoles with flexible neoprene substrates and <b>drapable</b> conductive elements have been designed, synthesized and measured {{with respect to their}} on-body performance. Starting with a comprehensive literature review of wearable antennas this work contains an introduction to wearable antenna designs, flexible materials for wearable antenna fabrication, human body models and the impacts of the human body on the efficiency of small wearable antennas. Definitions of material effective and total conductivity, the calculations of antenna Q and mutual couplings between antennas and the human body using the Method of Moment (MoM) are presented. Four types of flexible printed monopoles have been designed and measured. They are two single band monopoles for ISM (433. 05 434. 79 MHz) service, one multiband monopole for GSM 900 (890 960 MHz), DCS (1710 1880 MHz), PCS (1850 1990 MHz), UMTS (1920 2170 MHz), and WLAN 2. 4 GHz (2400 - 2484 MHz) frequency bands and a UWB band antenna (3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz) respectively. Effects of the ground plane dimensions on printed monopoles are illustrated first by changing the dimensions thereof and subsequently by adding wing structures.

40|$|A {{part of our}} {{traditional}} culture, local clothing is style of clothing that reflects, from past to present, the cultures of the societies, out of todayâs fashion. Such local pieces of clothing as bindallÄ±, peÅtemal, holta, salta and Ã¼Ã§ etek are in constant change and are forgotten in time because of the industrial development and modern life style. Called Ã¼Ã§ etek as it is composed of three pieces of skirt, this local clothing has been a special piece, both in ancient times and today, {{that is the most}} common, the most accepted in Turkish women clothing. It is necessary to detect, introduce, and carry to the future the pieces of clothing that {{are on the verge of}} disappearing. Being a piece of local clothing in Serinhisar District, Denizli, Ã¼Ã§ etek is worn in wedding ceremonies and kept in boxes. In Serinhisar District, women wear Åalvar, out of the fabric of Ã¼Ã§ etek knotted in wrist and waist, underneath Ã¼Ã§ etek, and they wear, inside Ã¼Ã§ etek, loose, <b>drapable</b> gÃ¶ynek made of satin or tulle (crimped fabric). Woven belt is wrapped around the waist of Ã¼Ã§ etek, tel kÄ±rma veil covers the head, and wool sock is worn on the feet and in this way traditional local clothing style is formed. During the interviews conducted with local women, Ã¼Ã§ eteks used in the past and used today were found. In terms of sewing properties, technical drawings of Ã¼Ã§ eteks were performed, and the properties of colour, pattern, fabric, shape, model and ornament are examined and they were recorded by photographs. Out of the 21 Ã¼Ã§ etek samples found, it was concluded that 6 of them can be archived and the details were mentioned in the article. ...|$|E
40|$|To use {{graphite}} polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{material on}} highly curved surfaces {{requires that the}} material be <b>drapable</b> and easily conformable to the surface. This paper presents the mechanical property characterization and impact resistance results for laminates made from two types of graphite/PEEK materials that will conform to a curved surface. These laminates were made from two different material forms. These forms are: (1) a fabric where each yarn is a co-mingled Celion G 30 - 500 3 K graphite fiber and PEEK thermoplastic fiber; and (2) an interleaved material of Celion G 30 - 500 3 K graphite fabric interleaved with PEEK thermoplastic film. The experimental results from the fabric laminates are compared with results for laminates made from AS 4 /PEEK unidirectional tape. The {{results indicate that the}} tension and compression moduli for quasi-isotropic and orthotropic laminates made from fabric materials are at least 79 percent of the modulus of equivalent laminates made from tape material. The strength of fabric material laminates is at least 80 percent of laminates made from tape material. The evaluation of fabric material for shear stiffness indicates that a tape material laminate could be replaced by a fabric material laminate and still maintain 89 percent of the shear stiffness of the tape material laminate. The notched quasi-isotropic compression panel failure strength is 42 to 46 percent of the unnotched quasi-isotropic laminate strength. Damage area after impact with 20 ft-lbs of impact energy is larger for the co-mingled panels than for the interleaved panels. The inerleaved panels have less damage than panels made from tape material. Residual compression strength of quasi-isotropic panels after impact of 20 ft-lbs of energy varies between 33 percent of the undamaged quasi-isotropic material strength for the tape material and 38 percent of the undamaged quasi-isotropic material strength for the co-mingled fabric material...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aid of}} {{the optical}} sensor system, the user is able to monitor the draping process online or to {{evaluate}} it using stored data. Using these data, it was demonstrated that the draping behavior of consolidated and non-consolidated fabrics differed from each other. The consolidated fabric reacts similarly to a non-drapable material because the stresses are horizon-tally and vertically degraded rather than along the fiber direction, as occurs with the non-consolidated fabric. Due to the gliding direction along the fibers, the latter material behaves as pre-dicted in theory. This provides us with the predictability of the draping behavior. Also, the data suggest the higher drapability, which is unambiguous given because of the low shear strength. On the basis of this fact, the non-consolidated fabric should be used in subsequent test runs. The data additionally show that the draping processes differ from one test run to another despite the identical process configuration. The non-consolidated fabric has on average the lowest gliding be-havior, but the larger variation over all six test runs. This suggests that during the draping process, particularly the easily <b>drapable</b> materials have different effects which cannot be foreseen. In the following studies, the sensor data should be used to optimize the draping quality in the sense of deviation from the real to theoretically determined fiber angles and wrinkle formation of the cut-piece positioned in the tooling. For this purpose, a large number of test runs have to be carried out in which the suction intensity of the suction units will be varied and this configuration will be eval-uated by means of the fiber angle and boundary curve sensor data. The goal will be to develop an optimal draping strategy, which can be documented on the one hand {{with the help of the}} sensory data and on the other hand it can help to counteract draping deviations of the actual to the optimal gliding behavior. For this, it will be necessary to intervene online in the draping process. For such an active draping mechanism, a control system must be developed which is capable of influencing the holding forces of the suction units by varying the volumetric flow. If the system now detects an actual sliding vector deviating from the target, the system can intervene. It can reinforce the holding force in the area correspondingly if a deviating gliding behavior has taken place or reduce the holding force if it prevents a required gliding...|$|E
