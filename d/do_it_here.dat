500|$|Because Scheyer's {{talent was}} obvious {{by the time}} he was set to start high school, many people {{encouraged}} his parents to move so he could attend a high school with a powerhouse basketball program. [...] The move was recommended so that he would have a greater chance of success. Scheyer shrugged off the suggestion, telling his parents: [...] "We'll just <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here.</b> We'll build the success at Glenbrook North." [...] His father said: [...] "I get chills thinking about it. [...] That wasn't my vision. [...] It wasn't Laury's. It wasn't his coaches'. [...] That was Jon's vision, and it never occurred to him that anything else would happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Marvel Comics {{editor-in-chief}} Joe Quesada felt dissolving the Peter Parker and Mary Jane {{marriage and}} returning Spider-Man to his roots {{was necessary to}} preserve the longevity of the character for the next 20 or 30 years. Quesada said he and other previous editors-in-chief had long been seeking an opportunity to begin a new methodology in which to tell Spider-Man stories, but had not found a reasonable way to do so. Quesada said, [...] "It's very easy to un-marry a character, or fix something like that: you just do a huge universal retcon, and say a few events in history didn't happen. But that's really {{not the way we}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here</b> at Marvel." [...] Quesada found an opportunity to address this in the events of the 2007 Civil War mini-series, which resulted in the unmasking of Spider-Man's identity to the public. Quesada knew J. Michael Straczynski was planning to end his run as a Marvel writer, so he personally approached Straczynski to propose [...] "One More Day" [...] as his final project.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here</b> so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you." [...] He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} big bushman, [...] "we're {{going to get}} that man if we have to pull down Cedar Range or Clavering's place before we <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here's</b> his trail. That one was made by Quilter's horse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well; I {{have told}} you I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>here</b> {{hundreds}} of thousands of times. What do I say? I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> millions and billions of times. I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> so often, and through such vast expanses of time, that when <b>it</b> was really <b>done,</b> <b>it</b> seemed not worth the <b>doing,</b> <b>it</b> was <b>done</b> so soon.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lodloe; [...] "I wish {{very much}} {{to speak to you}} in regard to him, and I cannot <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here</b> where we may be {{interrupted}} at any moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now these men," [...] {{thought the}} Woggle-Bug, [...] "must get money for {{shoveling}} all that earth, else they wouldn't <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here</b> is {{my chance to}} win the charming vision of beauty in the shop window!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I am sorry," [...] he exclaimed; [...] "but {{you know}} I didn't mean to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here,</b> Tompkins, don't sit {{there like a}} fool, but come and help me move him and get his leg straight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I don't {{want any}} words about <b>it.</b> <b>Here,</b> take your money," [...] said the young man. [...] "As long as I said I'd <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> I'll <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here's</b> your half a dollar." [...] He put it, with the bank-note, into Lemuel's hand, and rose briskly. [...] "You stay here, Jimmy, till I come back. I won't be gone a minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. With Mr. Farfrae. O Michael! I am already his wife. We {{were married}} {{this week at}} Port-Bredy. There were reasons against our <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>here.</b> Mr. Grower was a witness because he {{happened}} to be at Port-Bredy at the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' {{returned}} Jonas; 'if anything can. Now, supposing I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>here,</b> I should <b>do</b> <b>it</b> cheap, I know, and easy, {{without bothering}} her about it; which I'd much rather not <b>do,</b> for <b>it's</b> {{just in a}} woman's way to take it into her head, {{if you talk to}} her about such things, that she's going to die directly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; you’ve got an {{unpleasant}} habit of snuffling," [...] said the doctor; [...] "it sometimes. I worries me meant {{to speak to}} you about it before. You mustn’t <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here.</b> If you want to snuffle, go and snuffle on deck." ...|$|E
6000|$|HORNBLOWER. Not by {{you because}} ye've got {{no need to}} <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here</b> ye are, quite content on what your fathers made for ye. Ye've no ambitions; and ye want other people to have none. How d'ye think your fathers got your land? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s {{nothing to}} do with us," [...] {{interrupted}} the skipper, impatiently. [...] "I don’t mind Sam turning cart-wheels all day if it amuses him, but they mustn’t <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here,</b> that’s all. It’s no good standing there sulking, Sam; I can’t have it." ...|$|E
60|$|It is stylish to pin a {{piece of}} ribbon on your coat the same colour as your chum wears in her hair. Mary Martha Cowan saw them <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> in town and started us <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>here.</b> I always wear Kitty's ribbon and Kitty wears mine, but the Story Girl thinks it is silly.|$|R
50|$|In this, men are {{basically}} contradicting themselves {{because they say}} women cannot do an activity and want {{to stop them from}} <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here</b> Mill suggests that men {{are basically}} admitting that women are capable of doing the activity, but that men do not want them to do so.|$|R
3000|$|By {{looking at}} the results, it is {{revealed}} that between the two tasks, grammaring gave the lower mean value for the four factors on day one. In spite of the low statistical values, some learners in the interview corroborated that they liked grammaring and they enjoyed <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here</b> {{is a part of}} the interview: [...]...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{in return}} for these concessions, I am willing to take {{anything}} in reason, and I think we may consider the business settled and the ausgleich ausgegloschen at last for ten solid years, and we will sign the papers in blank, and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here</b> and now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} four hundred men {{would not be}} able to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here</b> as they did at Brill. There was no Spanish {{garrison}} there, and here they have a regiment; and though the Spaniards seem to have the hearts of devils rather than men, they can fight." ...|$|E
60|$|Next {{to obtain}} was a stock of ammunition,—an easy matter, though I had {{to enter the}} {{steerage}} companion-way to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here</b> the hunters stored the ammunition-boxes they carried in the boats, and here, but {{a few feet from}} their noisy revels, I took possession of two boxes.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{will let}} me go, will you not, father? I cannot leave our young master, and should pine away, were I obliged to stop {{here to work}} a gondola; while he may be wanting my help, for Messer Francisco is sure to get into adventures and dangers.

6000|$|... "Queen Victoria set {{the fashion}} in England, {{and we might}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here.</b> Wouldn't it be fun to have a wheel in the parlor at home, and really use it; not keep it tied up with blue ribbons, as the other girls do!" [...] cried Lotty, charmed with the new idea.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is the way}} we <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>here.</b> No time fooled away; nobody straggling {{in after}} the curtain's up. Wishing is quicker work than travelling. A quarter of a second ago these folks were {{millions}} of miles from here. When they heard the last signal, {{all they had to do}} was to wish, and here they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most {{men when}} they want {{something}} done," [...] he remarked, [...] "have a vile way of getting the wrong person to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Here</b> have I been wasting my flowers on this bovine public--whole clusters every week {{to those who have}} no sense of smell and no eye for form and colour. What they want is ensilage--a coarse fare suited to ruminants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look {{as long as}} you like," [...] Huish {{was going}} on. [...] "You don't see any green in my eye! I ain't afryde of Attwater, I ain't afryde of you, and I ain't afryde of words.

60|$|CRICHTON (acquiescing). Yes, my lord, {{that was}} how it all came about quite {{naturally}} in England. We had nothing to <b>do</b> with <b>it</b> there, and we shall have as little to <b>do</b> with <b>it</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{of course}} your writing {{could not be}} trusted to a printer. Now {{what you should do}} is this: employ that Drane girl to copy your manuscript.
