5|$|For {{people who}} are {{unwilling or unable to}} take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> symptoms for more than a year.|$|E

5|$|No player {{along the}} lane may enter the key until the shot is released; the player {{shooting}} the free throw, and anyone {{on top of}} the key, should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim. If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> more shots remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player is in the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.|$|E
5|$|The worm {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E

5|$|Both {{independent}} and dependent colony foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns {{have been recorded}} with M. pilosula queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically {{related to each other}} in comparison to other nests further away. Independent colony foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in nuptial flight in areas far from their home colony, showing that dependent colony foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> suitable areas to find a nest or independent colony foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try and return to their home nest after nuptial flight, but they may end up in another nest near the nest they originally came from. In multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same colony to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a colony can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A colony with less than 100 workers is not considered a mature colony. M. dispar colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, M. nigrocincta have over 1,000, M. pyriformis have from 200 to over 1,400 and M. gulosa have nearly 1,600. A colony can last for a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be a sign of a colony's impending demise.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{begin to}} settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep {{continuously}} but rouse themselves {{several times during the}} night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E
