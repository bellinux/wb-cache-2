2500|$|A {{complete}} {{explanation of the}} H2 sorption mechanism in MOFs was achieved by statistical averaging in the grand canonical ensemble, exploring {{a wide range of}} pressures and temperatures. Later work [...] revealed a pore <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> as important in both COFs and MOFs.|$|E
5000|$|But by {{the early}} 1930s the Duofold’s design was viewed by the {{manufacturer}} as rather outmoded. Parker launched its replacement, the Vacumatic, in 1933, and the Duofold line was moved to second tier, even though it followed closely the Vacumatic's design with slimmer profile, streamlined look and vacumatic <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Duofolds remained popular in Europe, being produced well into the 1960s in varying sizes and shades, and were revived in the 1980s as Parker's flagship offering once more. In 1988 (to celebrate the company's centennial), Parker launched the Duofold Centennial series of Pens (Fountain Pens, Rollerballs and Pencils). Later, they introduced the Duofold International line with models that also evoked the classic Duofold design, though smaller than the Centennial. There are also differences in the ink feeding systems, changing from their Button <b>Filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> to a cartridge/converter system.|$|E
50|$|The Vacumatic {{featured}} {{a brand new}} <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> which took 5 years to develop {{at a cost of}} $125,000. Parker boasted the model to be the first self-filler without a sac which, while not entirely true, the <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> was still a great innovation.By using a diaphragm rather than a sac, the whole barrel {{can be used as a}} reservoir. The principle workings are essentially like that of the earlier button fillers like the Duofold as the depression of the plunger pushed on the rubber sac and forced out the air (creating a vacuum) and when the rubber regained its natural form the ink got sucked into the pen to replace the air. The difference was that the previous button was replaced with a fat (approximately 4 mm) plunger that was used to operate the diaphragm. The plunger could be locked in a down position with a twist of the thumbAnd is referred to as the Lock-Down Fill, or Twist-Fill.|$|E
50|$|Several other <b>filling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were {{introduced}} to compete, such as the coin-filler (where a coin or 'medallion' was supplied along with the pen), match-filler (using a matchstick) and a 'blow-filler' which unsurprisingly required the pen owner to blow into the barrel to depress the internal sac.|$|R
40|$|As superscalar {{processors}} {{become increasingly}} wide, {{it is inevitable}} that the large set of instructions to be fetched every cycle will span multiple noncontiguous basic blocks. The mechanism to fetch, align, and pass this set of instructions down the pipeline must do so as efficiently as possible. The concept of trace cache has emerged as the most promising technique to meet this high-bandwidth, low-latency fetch requirement. A new fill unit scheme, the Sliding Window <b>Fill</b> <b>Mechanism,</b> is proposed as a method to efficiently populate the trace cache. This method exploits trace continuity and identifies probable start regions to improve trace cache hit rate. Simulation yields a 7 % average hit rate increase over the Rotenberg <b>fill</b> <b>mechanism.</b> When combined with branch promotion, trace cache hit rates experienced a 19 % average increase along with a 17 % average improvement in fetch bandwidth...|$|R

Water and tomato paste were respectively used as analogues for the Newtonian liquid aluminum and the non-Newtonian semi-solid aluminum. The transparent die was installed on an industrial casting press and filling was filmed with a high-speed camera. Differences between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are presented and discussed. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: N...|$|R
50|$|Demonstrator pens were {{originally}} furnished by manufacturers to dealers, {{so that the}} features of their products could be shown to potential buyers. The first demonstrators had openings cut in their barrels, and usually, their caps. These would typically allow direct viewing of the <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the section-inner cap junction, respectively. Cutaway demonstrators were usually not fully functional pens, and many were furnished without nibs or with nonfunctional dummy nibs.|$|E
50|$|The first {{transparent}} demonstrator pens {{were probably}} Parker's Bakelite-barreled eyedropper-fillers, which were soon made a regular production model. Most transparent demonstrators, however, postdate the general adoption of celluloid for fountain pen manufacture. Parker and Sheaffer both made fully transparent versions of their best-selling Duofold and Balance {{models in the}} early 1930s. Other demonstrators were only partially transparent, the transparency highlighting the pen's special features. Examples include the transparent-barreled Parker Vacuum Filler demonstrators (showing the <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism)</b> and the Parker 51 demonstrators with transparent hoods (showing the collector).|$|E
50|$|While {{the carbon}} {{nanotubes}} are non-polar and therefore relatively hydrophobic, water spontaneously fills them at ~8-10% humidity. The understood <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{depends on the}} solvent’s polarity, ion concentration, and the van der Waals forces between {{the water and the}} CNT. When water in the interior of the CNT can have a lower chemical potential than it would in the bulk, it fills the CNT. Even non-polar materials are polarizable. This polarizability allows for van der Waals forces between the water and the membrane walls, attracting the water molecules into the CNT.|$|E

50|$|The 1920s saw rapid {{development}} of the Conway Stewart product line. Pens of several different types of <b>filling</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> materials and sizes were offered for sale. The business model proved successful for Conway Stewart and its market share increased {{at the expense of}} other established manufacturers. As a result, Conway Stewart had outgrown its initial premises and in 1927 the company relocated to a larger facility which would serve as its home for the next two decades.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reservoirs}} of {{the earliest}} fountain pens were mostly filled by eyedropper. This was a cumbersome and potentially messy process, {{which led to the}} commercial development of alternative methods that quickly dominated the industry. However, newer, more convenient <b>filling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have never entirely displaced [...] "eyedropper-filling" [...] pens in the marketplace, and they remain widely manufactured today. For some the simplicity of the mechanism, coupled with the large volume of ink it can encapsulate, compensates for the inconvenience of ink transfer.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fountain}} pen is a nib pen that, unlike its predecessor, the dip pen, contains an internal reservoir of liquid ink. The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits it on paper via {{a combination of}} gravity and capillary action. Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via {{the use of a}} Pasteur pipette (eyedropper) or syringe, or via an internal <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> which creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|Redundant {{bladders}} may be inadvertently filled, {{either by}} unintended {{action of the}} diver, or by malfunction of the <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and if the failure is not recognized and dealt with promptly, this {{may result in a}} runaway uncontrolled ascent, with associated risk of decompression sickness. There is a risk that the diver will not recognise which bladder is full and attempt to dump from the wrong one. The risk can be reduced by ensuring that the filling mechanisms are clearly distinguishable by both feel and position, and not connecting a low pressure supply hose to the reserve until needed, so it is impossible to add gas by accident.|$|E
5000|$|Screw-mechanism piston-fillers {{were made}} {{as early as}} the 1820s, but the mechanism's modern {{popularity}} begins with the original Pelikan of 1929, based upon a Croatian patent. The basic idea is simple: turn a knob {{at the end of the}} pen, and a screw mechanism draws a piston up the barrel, sucking in ink. Thus they were easier to fill. This is also why this <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> is very popular in today's fountain pens. Some of the earlier models had to dedicate as much as half of the pen length to the mechanism.The advent of telescoping pistons has improved this; the Touchdown Filler was introduced by Sheaffer in 1949. It was advertised as an [...] "Exclusive Pneumatic Down-stroke Filler." ...|$|E
40|$|Techniques such as out-of-order {{issue and}} {{speculative}} execution aggressively exploit instruction level parallelism in modem superscalar processor architectures. The {{front end of}} such pipelined machines is concerned with providing a stream of schedulable instructions at a bandwidth that meets or exceeds the rate of instructions being issued and executed. As superscalar machines become increasingly wide, {{it is inevitable that}} the large set of instructions to be fetched every cycle will span multiple noncontiguous basic blocks. The mechanism to fetch, align, and pass this set of instructions down the pipeline must do so as efficiendy as possible, occupying a minimal number of pipeline cycles. The concept of trace cache has emerged as the most promising technique to meet this high-bandwidth, low-latency fetch requirement. This thesis presents the design, simulation and analysis of a microarchitecture simulator extension that incorporates trace cache. A new fill unit scheme, the Sliding Window <b>Fill</b> <b>Mechanism</b> is proposed. This method exploits trace continuity and identifies probable start regions to improve trace cache hit rate. A 7 % hit rate increase was observed over the Rotenberg <b>fill</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Combined with branch promotion, trace cache hit rates experienced a 19 % average increase along with a 17 % average rise in fetch bandwidth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Trace caching {{provides}} a highbandwidth instruction fetch mechanism for more effectively supplying a large execution core with {{a sufficient number}} of instructions. However, access time tradeoffs put a limit on how effective a large trace cache can be at increasing performance. With the addition of a smaller, more associative Frequently Used Trace Cache (FUTC) that employs a more judicious <b>fill</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on the usage frequency of trace cache lines, some of this access time can be hidden, yielding performance gains over a traditional monolithic trace cache. ...|$|R
50|$|CO2 guns, {{like other}} {{pneumatic}} guns using compressed air, offer power for repeated shots in a compact package {{without the need}} for complex cocking or <b>filling</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The ability to store power for repeated shots also means that repeating arms are possible. There are many replica revolvers and semi-automatic pistols on the market that use CO2 power. These guns are popular for training, as the guns and ammunition are inexpensive, relatively safe to use, and no specialized facilities are needed for safety. In addition, they can be purchased and owned in areas where firearms possession is either strictly controlled or banned outright. Most CO2 powered guns are relatively inexpensive, and there are a few precision target guns available that use CO2.|$|R
5000|$|Most pens today {{use either}} a piston filler, squeeze-bar filler or cartridge. Many pens are also {{compatible}} with a converter, {{which has the}} same fitting as the pen's cartridge and has a <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a reservoir attached to it. This enables a pen to either fill from cartridges, or from a bottle of ink. The {{most common type of}} converters are piston-style, but many other varieties may be found today.Piston-style converters generally have a transparent round tubular ink reservoir. Fountain pen inks feature differing surface tensions that can cause an ink to adhere or [...] "stick" [...] against the inside of the reservoir. Common solutions for this problem are adding a small (rust-proof) ink agitating object like a 316 or 904L stainless steel or zirconium dioxide bearing ball, spring or hollow tube in the tubular reservoir to mechanically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Adding a very small amount of surfactant like Triton X-100 used in Kodak Photo-Flo 200 wetting agent to the ink will chemically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. However ink might react adversely to adding a surfactant.|$|E
30|$|Size effect. The above {{derivation}} for capillary filling speed {{applies to}} large channels. For nanoscale holes, the <b>filling</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is much more}} complicated. For example, the surface energy can differ significantly from macro-scale surface when the liquid pillar diameter is no longer orders larger than the range of van de Waals force, and the meniscus may be ‘pinned’ due to the abrupt change of surface topography or charges. In addition, at nanoscale, highly viscous fluid usually behaves like non-Newtonian fluid with much higher effective viscosity.

50|$|Silicone-based {{lubricants}} {{are often}} used by consumers in applications where other common consumer lubricants, such as petroleum jelly, would damage certain products, such as latex rubber condoms and gaskets on dry-suits. It {{can be used to}} lubricate fountain pen <b>filling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and threads. It is used to seal and preserve O-rings in flashlights, plumbing, waterproof watches, and air rifles. Silicone grease is widely used to lubricate threads of water submersible flashlights used for diving and spearfishing. This grease improves water resistance of the flashlights and protects threads from wearing out. Silicone grease is used with waterproof devices as it has a very thick body and doesn't dissolve in water, as most spirits and other liquids would. Silicone-based lubricants are also commonly used for remote control hobbies, or for the insulation of CPU sockets when overclocking at very low temperatures.|$|R

The resulting rGO–geopolymeric composites are easy to manufacture and exhibit excellent mechanical properties. Geopolymers with graphene oxide (GO) concentrations of 0. 00, 0. 10, 0. 35 and 0. 50 % by weight were fabricated. The functional groups, morphology, void <b>filling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and mechanical properties of the composites were determined. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra revealed that the alkaline solution reduced the hydroxyl/carbonyl groups of GO by deoxygenation and/or dehydration.

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs indicated that rGO altered the morphology of geopolymers from a porous nature to a substantially pore filled morphology with increased mechanical properties.

40|$|Powder flow {{appears in}} many {{industrial}} processes, including pharmaceuticals, food, detergents etc. Understanding the parameters affecting powder flow {{is necessary for}} rational product and process design. This research examines powder-air interactions for three powder handling systems: bin discharge, linear shoe-die system and rotary paddle feeder. As a starting point the flow behaviour of powders was characterised using established procedures to provide basic set of properties for assessing flowability. Powder permeability {{and the influence of}} small levels of compaction on permeability were determined. The influence of differential pressure on flow initiation from arching state was examined for powders discharging from bins. A dimensional model was developed to predict the differential pressure required to initiate powder flow as a function of orifice diameter and height of the powder above the exit. The mass flow rate of the powders were measured under a range of differential pressures. A dimensional model was developed to predict the mass flow rate as a function of differential pressure and exit diameter. The effect of processing parameters on the mass of the powder delivered into the die in linear shoe-die systems under the gravity and suction <b>fill</b> <b>mechanism</b> were investigated. The system was accommodated with differential pressure transducers and the evolution of the pressure inside during the process was monitored. Dimensional models were developed to predict the mass delivered into the die as a function of powder differential pressure developed during gravity and suction fill, shoe velocity and the velocity of the punch in the die. The influence of paddle rotational speed, exit diameter and differential pressure on the mass flow rate of powders in rotary feeding system was examined. This research identified the dimensionless groups relevant for the understanding of the flow of fine and cohesive powders under differential air pressure conditions. The dimensional models developed account for air pressure effects for 1) flow initiation and 2) flow rate during bin discharge, 3) gravity and 4) suction <b>fill</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in linear shoe-die filling systems. These models can be used to aid the design of powder flow processes where air pressure effects are influential...|$|R

In this paper, {{we focus on the}} end-to-end performance of a multi-ring architecture in which metropolitan access networks (MANs) are interconnected by a metropolitan core network. These rings are synchronized and can be interconnected transparently through single access nodes (Hub node) or multiple access nodes. A multi ring architecture consisting of two slotted MAN rings connected by a ring-based slotted metro core will be simulated. The major problem in this architecture is how to resolve the synchronization shift between rings while assuring the traffic routed efficiently from the metro access to the metro core networks. To ensure this efficiency, we use some optical packet <b>filling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as Aggregation Mechanism, CUM (CoS-Upgrade Mechanism), DCUM (Dynamic CoS-Upgrade Mechanism).

The simulations advance on previous work, {{in which the}} carbon nanotubes were treated as fixed atomistic entities, by considering the carbon nanotubes as fully-flexible. The molten salts are described using two potential models, which vary in the relative energetic stability of two key bulk crystal structures. Small diameter carbon nanotubes are found to favour relatively low symmetry "ladder" and "hinged" structures, which can both be considered as formed from sections of square net sheet, in contrast to cylindrical geometries favoured when filling fixed carbon tubes. The small diameter tubes are also found to favour structures based on folding square, rather than hexagonal, nets.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of gas adsorption isotherms into pore size distributions generally relies upon {{the assumption of}} thermodynamically independent pores. Hence, pore-pore cooperative adsorption effects, which might result in a significantly skewed pore size distribution, are neglected. In this work, cooperative adsorption effects in water adsorption on a real, amorphous, mesoporous silica material have been studied using magnetic resonance imaging (M RI) and pulsed-gradient stimulated-echo (PGSE) NMR techniques. Evidence for advanced adsorption can be seen directly using relaxation time weighted M RI. The number and spatial distributions of pixels containing pores of different sizes filled with condensate have been analyzed. The spatial distribution of filled pores {{has been found to}} be highly nonrandom. Pixels containing the largest pores present in the material have been observed to fill in conjunction with pixels containing much smaller pores. POSE NMR has confirmed the spatially extensive nature of the adsorbed ganglia. Thus, long-range (>= 40 mu m) cooperative adsorption effects, between larger pores associated with smaller pores, occur within mesoporous materials.
