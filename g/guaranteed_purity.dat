50|$|Argon can be {{purchased}} for use with the ICP-MS in either a refrigerated liquid or a gas form. However {{it is important to}} note that whichever form of argon purchased, it should have a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>purity</b> of 99.9% Argon at a minimum. It is important to determine which type of argon will be best suited for the specific situation. Liquid argon is typically cheaper and can be stored in a greater quantity as opposed to the gas form, which is more expensive and takes up more tank space. If the instrument is in an environment where it gets infrequent use, then buying argon in the gas state will be most appropriate as it will be more than enough to suit smaller run times and gas in the cylinder will remain stable for longer periods of time, whereas liquid argon will suffer loss to the environment due to venting of the tank when stored over extended time frames. However, if the ICP-MS is to be used routinely and is on and running for eight or more hours each day for several days a week, then going with liquid argon will be the most suitable. If there are to be multiple ICP-MS instruments running for long periods of time, then it will most likely be beneficial for the laboratory to install a bulk or micro bulk argon tank which will be maintained by a gas supply company, thus eliminating the need to change out tanks frequently as well as minimizing loss of argon that is left over in each used tank as well as down time for tank changeover.|$|E

40|$|Four-zone {{simulated}} {{moving bed}} (SMB) processes {{have been used}} widely for isolating two pure products from two-component mixtures under ideal (high-efficiency) conditions. In many such cases, the uptake of solutes on the sorbent is described by a linear distribution coefficient. But many systems require the separation {{of more than two}} components, are operated under nonideal (low-efficiency) conditions, or have nonlinear uptake. In light of these challenges, generalized design strategies were investigated here for splitting multicomponent mixtures. ^ The “standing wave” analysis for binary mixtures [76] was extended in this study to achieve any specified split of a mixture containing three or more components under nonideal conditions. Aspects of multicomponent fractionation and gradient were isolated and studied systematically. A four-component mixture of glucose, xylose, acetic acid, and sulfuric acid was chosen as an example to illustrate strategies for continuous multicomponent fractionation in a nonideal, linear system. This multicomponent fractionation strategy was validated on a laboratory-scale, low-pressure SMB system for the separation of three amino acids. These approaches point the way to a design procedure for SMB fractionation of a multicomponent, nonlinear, nonideal system with thermal gradients. Rate model simulations confirm that the standing wave design <b>guarantees</b> high <b>purity</b> and high yield for these separations. ...|$|R

In addition, {{there has been}} a growing trend towards larger and larger doses of pDNA utilized in human trials. The growing demand on pDNA manufacture leads to pressure to make more in less time. A key intervention has been the use of monoliths as stationary phases in liquid chromatography. Monolithic stationary phases offer fast separation to pDNA owing to their large pore size, making pDNA in the size range from 100 nm to over 300 nm easily accessible. However, the convective transport mechanism of monoliths does not <b>guarantee</b> plasmid <b>purity.</b> The recovery of pure pDNA hinges on a proper balance in the properties of the adsorbent phase, the mobile phase and the feedstock. The effects of pH and ionic strength of binding buffer, temperature of feedstock, active group density and the pore size of the stationary phase were considered as avenues to improve the recovery and purity of pDNA using a methacrylate-based monolithic adsorbent and Escherichia coli DH 5 α-pUC 19 clarified lysate as feedstock. pDNA recovery was found to be critically dependent on the pH and ionic strength of the mobile phase. Up to a maximum of approx. 92 % recovery was obtained under optimum conditions of pH and ionic strength. Increasing the feedstock temperature to 80 °C increased the purity of pDNA owing to the extra thermal stability associated with pDNA over contaminants such as proteins. Results from toxicological studies of the plasmid samples using endotoxin standard (E. coli 0. 55 :B 5 lipopolysaccharide) show that endotoxin level decreases with increasing salt concentration. It was obvious that large quantities of pure pDNA can be obtained with minimal extra effort simply by optimizing process parameters and conditions for pDNA purification...|$|R

Prior to the purification of sup 9 sup 9 Mo, the formation and stability of the Mo-SCN complex in different conditions were studied. The spectrophotometric studies showed the optimum conditions to obtain a stable complex: KI + Na sub 2 SO sub 3 solution was the more effective reducing agent; when in 6 M sulfuric medium the complexation was faster and 6 M potassium thiocyanate (complexing agent) guaranteed that all reduced molybdenum was complexed.

Maximizing yield while maintaining required purity is paramount to reducing purification costs, but this goal is difficult to achieve when the product and its impurities are very similar.

This research develops a simulated moving bed chromatography (SMB) process for purifying {{an important}} antibiotic, Clarithromycin (6 -o-methyl erythromycin), from a similar impurity, 6, 11 -o-methyl erythromycin, using a systematic design approach. First, appropriate adsorbent and mobile phase combinations (adsorption systems) are found from preliminary experiments. A series of single-column chromatography experiments are then used to estimate the adsorption and mass transfer parameters. ^ Second, a design method for four-zone SMB processes that have non-linear adsorption isotherms and significant mass transfer effects was developed in this research. This method provides the highest throughput and the lowest solvent consumption for the isocratic four-zone SMB process. Rate model simulations confirm that the design method can <b>guarantee</b> high <b>purity</b> and yield. It is demonstrated that this design method {{can be applied to}} both Langmuir and Bi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm behavior. Because most real adsorption systems have these properties, this {{is an important}} development.

The non-linear, non-ideal design equations developed for four-zone SMB processes are modified to determine optimal operating conditions for the five-zone SMB process. This process is tested using a series of lab-scale SMB experiments. These lab-scale SMB experiments are also used to validate the design method and intrinsic parameters. ^ These intrinsic parameters are used to develop plant-scale designs of a four-zone SMB process and a five-zone SMB process using the most promising adsorptions systems. From these plant-scale designs, cost estimations are used to determine the most cost-efficient process for removal of 6, 11.

Due to the complex multicolumn arrangement, the design and optimization of this process is not a trivial task. The concept is often applied to achieve high purity outlet streams. Based on the assumption that the phase equilibria are established there is a powerful concept available to evaluate the feasibility of the process for highly efficient columns. However, in practice often lower purities are acceptable and cheaper columns can be applied. Rather than performing a complete optimization study, in such cases it is attractive to have in early development stages information available purpose of this paper to present a novel apporach to address this feasibility question based on discrete optimization, which permits the derivation of global infeasibility statements in conjunction with local feasible solutions. In order to achieve this, a mixed-integer linear program is constructed in such a way that its solution set contains all feasible solutions of the underlying non-linear optimization model. If the mixed-integer linear relaxation is infeasible, then it is guaranteed that the nonlinear model has no solution. In addition, an optimal solution of the mixed-integer linear relaxation can provide a feasible solution or a useful starting point for local optimization tools. Our approach for tackling the feasibility question is presented using capacity and separation factors for the separation of mixtures of fructose-dextran T 9 and fructose-raffinose. A conventional 4 zone True Moving Bed (TMB) model is considered in conjunction with technically meaningful restrictions on the operating parameters. The apporach allows to prove lower bounds on the number of plates necessary to separate the mixtures for a specified purity requirement (e. g. 90 or 98 percent).

40|$|Aromatherapy is the {{therapeutic}} use of essential oils to cure, mitigate, or prevent diseases, infections, and indispositions mainly by inhalation, {{but also by}} the skin (Buchbauer et al., 1993; Lee et al., 2012). In recent years there has been increasing attention to screening plants to study the biological activities of their essential oils from the chemical and pharmacological points of view. Essential oils are complex mixtures made up of many compounds whose contents can be influenced by several factors. Each of these constituents contributes to the beneficial or adverse effects of these oils. Therefore, a deep knowledge of the essential oil composition is necessary for their therapeutic application (Lahlou, 2004). The presence, yield, and composition of secondary metabolites in plants, and specifically in essential oils, can be affected in a number of ways, from their formation in the plant to their isolation. Several of the factors of influence have been studied, in particular for commercially important crops, to optimize the cultivation conditions and time of harvest and to obtain higher yields of high-quality essential oils. The factors that determine the chemical variability and yield of essential oils include (1) physiological variations, (2) environmental conditions, (3) geographic variations, (4) genetic factors and evolution, and (5) political and social conditions (Figueiredo et al., 2008). The quality of plant raw materials can also be influenced by human adulterations due to dishonesty or unscrupulous operators. Probable errors could be accidental botanical substitution or intentional botanical substitution. The variability in the content and concentrations of the constituents of plant material, along with the range of extraction techniques and processing steps used by different manufacturers, results in marked variability in the content and quality of commercially available herbal products. Thus, the quality control of essential oils is necessary to ensure the genuineness of the product, the shelf life, and the storage conditions (Bonaccorsi et al., 1999). In the specific case of essential oils used for aromatherapy, the quality control is an important issue because it <b>guarantees</b> <b>purity,</b> safety, and efficacy. There is a specific term used in this context, therapeutic grade, {{but it is not a}} label from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); it is only a market certification. Recently, European Medicinal Agency published “Reflection Paper on Quality of Essential Oils as Active Substances in Herbal Medicinal Products/Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products,” which discusses the importance of and the way to gain quality for essential oils used as active pharmaceutical ingredients or herbal medicinal products. The conclusion, however, is that there is a need for specific guidance, because the current guidance does not fully address the question of essential oils (EMA/HMCP/ 84789 / 2013). Essential oils are complex mixtures that act directly on the gustatory and olfactory receptors in the mouth and nose, leading to taste and aroma responses. Interacting with the human senses, essential oils have applications in food, preservatives, medicines, symbolic articles in religious and social ceremonies, and remedies to modify behavior. In most cases, essential oils gain widespread acceptance as multifunctional agents due to their strong stimulation of the human gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) senses. Based on histories of use of selected plants and plant products that strongly impact the senses, it is not unexpected that society would bestow powers to heal, cure diseases, and spur desirable emotions in the effort to improve the human condition, often with only a limited understanding or acknowledgment of the toxic effects associated with high doses of these plant products. The natural origin of these products and their long history of use by humans have, in part, mitigated concerns as to whether these products work or are safe under conditions of intended use. The adverse effects resulting from the use of these products are often unknown. In the absence of information concerning efficacy and safety, recommendations for the quantity and quality of natural product to be consumed remain ambiguous. However, when the intended use is as a flavor or fragrance that is subject to governmental regulation, effective and safe levels of use are defined by fundamental biological limits and careful risk assessment. The safety control of an essential oil is performed in the context of all available data for groups of known constituents and the group of unknown constituents, and any potential interactions that may occur by the essential oil when used in combination with other essential oils, or other natural substances. Adams and Taylor proposed in 2010 a chemically based approach to the safety evaluation of an essential oil. The approach depends on a quantitative analysis of the chemical constituents in the essential oil. The chemical constituents are assigned to well-defined congeneric groups that are established based on biochemical and toxicologic information, and this is evaluated in the context of intake of the congeneric group resulting from consumption (by olfactory or gustative sense) of the essential oil. The overall objective in safety of essential oils is the knowledge of their chemical composition (Adams and Taylor, 2010). Sometimes, during the extraction processes, well-known contaminants of synthetic or artificial origin (e. g., plasticizers, chemicals used for solvent stabilization, and butylated hydroxytoluene) are identified as constituents of essential oils and considered to be native plant metabolites. The importance of this problem should be considered since such compounds are still repeatedly being reported as natural products (Radulovic and Blagojevic, 2012). Radulovic investigated some of the most common semivolatile contaminants that could originate from the solvents used during the isolation procedures and analyses of essential oils (Radulovic and Blagojevic, 2012) ...|$|R
5000|$|... (3) The ideal, {{to which}} the Christian should conform and towards which he should strive with all his powers both natural and supernatural, is Jesus Christ. His whole life should be so {{penetrated}} by Christ that he becomes Christian in the full {{sense of the word}} ("until Christ be formed in you"; Galatians 4:19). That Christ is the supreme model and pattern of the Christian life follows from Scripture, e. g. from John, xiii, 15, and I Peter, ii, 21, where imitation of Christ is directly recommended, and from John, viii, 12, where Christ is called [...] "the light of the world". Cf. also Rom., viii, 29, Gal., ii, 20, Phil., iii, 8, and Heb., i, 3, where the Apostle extols the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ, for whom he has suffered the loss of all things, counting them but as dung, that he may gain Christ. Of the numerous testimonies of the Fathers we only quote St. Augustine: [...] "Finis ergo noster perfectio nostra esse debet; perfectio nostra Christus" [...] (P. L., XXXVI, 628; cf. also [...] "In Psalm.", 26, 2, in P. L., XXXVI, 662). In Christ there is no shadow, nothing one-sided. His Divinity <b>guarantees</b> the <b>purity</b> of the model; His humanity, by which He became similar to us, makes the model attractive. But this picture of Christ, unmarred by addition or omission, is to be found only in the Catholic Church and, owing to her indefectibility, will always continue there in its ideal state. For the same reason, the Church alone can give us the guarantee that the ideal of the Christian life will always remain pure and unadulterated, and will not be identified with one particular state or with a subordinate virtue (cf. Zahn, l. c., p. 124). An unprejudiced examination proves that the ideal of Catholic life has been preserved in all its purity through the centuries and that the Church has never failed to correct the false touches with which individuals might have sought to disfigure its unstained beauty. The individual features and the fresh colours for outlining the living picture of Christ are derived from the sources of Revelation and the doctrinal decisions of the Church. These tell us about the internal sanctity of Christ (John 1:14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:9; etc.). His life overflowing with grace, of whose fulness we have all received (John 1:16), His life of prayer (Mark 1:21, 35; 3:1; Luke 5:16; 6:12; 9:18; etc.), His devotion to His heavenly Father (Matthew 11:26; John 4:34; 5:30; 8:26, 29), His intercourse with men (Matthew 9:10; cf. 1 Corinthians 9:22), His spirit of unselfishness and sacrifice, His patience and meekness, and, finally, His asceticism as revealed in his fastings (Matthew 4:2; 6:18).|$|R
40|$|Frequency up-conversion is an {{integral}} part of the (sub) mm wave integrated radar system that is currently developed at the TUDelft in the context of the MEMPIS program. The proposed up-converter IC allows the necessary signal modulation for the radar to be generated at a relative low frequency, after up-conversion to W-band takes place. In our case, the FMCW (frequency modulated continuous wave) principle is used for the actual radar operation. This up-conversion, based on analogue signal multiplication, reduces the source signal bandwidth requirement by the amount of its multiplication factor. The purpose of this work is to explore the possibility of implementing a wideband high-order frequency up-converter which suits the needs of our radar system namely, like high conversion gain, spur suppression, improved noise performance, as well as limited DC power consumption. In our system, the up-converter converts an input signal from X and Ku-band (around 10 GHz) to W-band (around 94 GHz). The up-converted signal is used to drive both the transmitter antenna and the receiver mixer LO port. The whole circuit includes a multiply by 8 chain and necessary gain blocks on W-band. Study of the frequency multiplication process has resulted in a carefully planned frequency allocation, as well as, power leveling for each sub-circuit. A wideband frequency doubler capable of high conversion gain and low unwanted spur generation is designed. In the multiply by 8 chain, optimum operation of the frequency doubler, as well as, on chip filtering are performed to <b>guarantee</b> the spectrum <b>purity</b> of the output signal over wide bandwidth. Two W-band medium power amplifiers are optimized for flat gain frequency response. The multiply by 8 chain provides an output signal from 80 GHz to 112 GHz, with an in-band conversion gain ranging from 13. 2 dB to 16. 6 dB. The suppression of unwanted spurs is better than - 40 dB. The antenna driver amplifier delivers more than 3 dBm output power with 3 dB in-band gain variation. The LO driver amplifier delivers more than 150 mV peak voltage swing at mixer LO port with less than 2 dB in-band gain variation.

40|$|Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and {{explosives}} (CBRNE) terrorist threats put {{law enforcement and}} soldiers at risk {{both at home and}} abroad. Law enforcement and soldiers must be provided with tools and knowledge to stay ahead of the capabilities of terrorists. Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine (HMTD) is a homemade explosive easily synthesized from hexamine, citric acid, and hydrogen peroxide. Although HMTD is very sensitive and prone to stability problems, it has a history of terrorists use, such as in the London bombing of 2005. Because law enforcement personnel must handle this material with no <b>guarantee</b> of <b>purity</b> nor indication of additives, for the sake of safety, knowledge of the stability and reactivity of HMTD was expanded in order to make handling safer. Differential scanning calorimetry was utilized to screen the compatibility of HMTD with various additives. It was found that water and weak acids, such as citric acid, destabilize HMTD. Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was employed to characterize both headspace gases (e. g. trimethylamine and dimethylformamide) and condensed phase decomposition products. Monitoring the decomposition of HMTD at room temperature and with gentle heating (60 °C) under various levels of humidity proved that humidity {{plays a major role in}} the kinetics of HMTD decomposition. Liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry was helpful for identification of condensed phase decomposition products and monitoring isotopic labeling studies. Through a labeling study with equimolar 15 N and 14 N hexamine during the synthesis of HMTD, it was found that hexamine dissociates before the formation of HMTD. ^ There is currently a need for specialized pyrotechnic materials to combat the threat of biological weapons. Materials have been characterized and will be chosen based on their potential to produce heat and iodine to kill spore-forming bacteria (e. g. anthrax). One formulation, already proven to kill anthrax simulants, is diiodine pentoxide with aluminum; however, it suffers from poor stability and storage problems. The heat and iodine output from this mixture and candidate replacement mixtures were measured with bomb calorimetry and extraction and analysis of iodine by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Of the mixtures analyzed, calcium iodate and aluminum was found to be the highest producer of iodine gas. The heat output of this mixture and others can be increased by adding more fuel, with the cost of some iodine produced. Products of combustion were analyzed by thermal analysis, XPS, XRD, and LC/MS. Evidence was collected supporting the formation of metal iodides and metal oxides. One key reaction explaining the loss of iodine with increase in aluminum content is the reaction between aluminum and iodine, which forms aluminum triiodide. ^ As seen in multiple cases, including the Boston Marathon bombing, improvised explosives may be as simple as a fuel/oxidizer (FOX) mixture initiated by a hot wire. The knowledge of which materials or compositions are explosive is incomplete, and tests for explosivity are currently conducted at specific scales. For example, ammonium nitrate is classified as an oxidizer because it does not explode at the pound scale, but can become explosive at a larger scale or with a fuel added. Herein, a bomb calorimeter with a pressure transducer has been studied for its use as a small scale metric (2 g) for predicting whether fuel/oxidizer mixtures will be explosive at larger scales. These results have been compared with calculated and measured detonation velocities, and measured air blast pressures. A positive correlation was observed between heat of burning and detonation velocity, and between heat of burning and air blast TNT equivalence. ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of MAFF/Defra project OF 0157. Genetically {{modified}} (GM) crops cannot be released into the environment and used as food, feed, medicines or industrial processing before they have passed through a rigorous and internationally recognised regulatory process designed to protect human and animal health, and the environment. The UK body that oversees standards in organic farming, the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards (UKROFS), has ruled that genetically modified (GM) crops have no {{role to play in}} organic farming systems. They, therefore, have concerns about the possibility and consequences of the mixing of GM crops with organic crops. The two main sources of mixing are through pollen and seed. Pollen from GM crops may pollinate an organic crop. Seed from a GM crop, or plants established from them, may become mixed with organic crops or their products. Minimising genetic mixing is an important feature of the production of all high quality seed samples of plant varieties supplied to farmers. Extensive experience has been obtained over many decades in the production of high purity seed samples. Crop isolation distances, and crop rotational and management practices are laid down to achieve this. These procedures for the production of seed of high genetic purity could be used for the production of organic crops. No system for the field production of seed can <b>guarantee</b> absolute genetic <b>purity</b> of seed samples. Very rarely long distance pollination or seed transfer is possible, so any criteria for organic crop production will need to recognise this. There has always been the possibility of hybridisation and seed mixing between organic crops and non-organic crops. Organic farming systems acknowledge the possibility of spray or fertiliser drift from non-organic farming systems, and procedures are established to minimise this. In practice, detecting the presence of certain types of GM material in organic crops, especially quantification, is likely to be difficult. Some seed used by organic farmers are currently obtained from abroad. After January 2001, or a modified deadline thereafter, UK organic farmers will be required to sow seed produced organically. There is little or no organic seed produced in the UK at present, so it has to be obtained from abroad. Seed obtained from outside the UK or the European Union, may have different seed production criteria. This may make it difficult to guarantee that it is absolutely free from any GM material. Organic farmers and/or GM crop producers will need to ensure that their crops are isolated from one another by an appropriate distance or barrier to reduce pollen transfer if the crop flowers. To reduce seed mixing, shared equipment will need to be cleaned and an appropriate period of time allowed before organic crops are grown on land previously used for GM crops. Responsibility for isolation will need to be decided before appropriate measures can be implemented. The report highlights the need for acceptable levels of the presence of GM material in organic crops and measures identified to achieve this...|$|R
40|$|Certification - just {{obey the}} rules! Cue: For some crops, buyers are only really {{interested}} in organic produce. For example medicinal herbs. Nobody wants to make medicines from herbs that might be contaminated with pesticides or chemical fertilizers. So medicinal herb growers {{must be able to}} prove that their crops are pure, and the best way is to get organic certification. But how easy is it to become a certified organic farmer? Many small farmers may be discouraged by fears of the high costs and complex rules they would need to follow. Maggy Frayne disagrees. As a grower of medicinal herbs in South Africa, she has had to obtain certification for her land and her processing system. But, as she told Lesibana Mantshiu, getting certification was not impossibly difficult, and there are ways of reducing the cost. IN:		?We have a 40 hectare farm ? OUT:		? cut the costs down. ? DUR?N	 2 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Maggy Frayne with some advice for farmers who are thinking about organic certification. Transcript Frayne	We have a 40 hectare farm, which is in an irrigation system north of Brits. This farm was basically a wrecked farm, because it had been used for tobacco farming, where they use a lot of chemicals. We wanted to grow medicinal herbs and {{in order to do that}} successfully the herbs have to be grown organically, free of pesticides, free of herbicides, free of chemicals. So we set about, for three years, converting the land and getting rid of the chemical residues that were in the soil. We planted things like sunnhemp and cowpea, crops that would feed the soil, and eventually our soil was satisfactorily tested to be free of any chemicals. Mantshiu	Now Maggy, describe how you get organic certification. Frayne	In this country there are five different companies that can certify any farmer or organisation as organic. They all prescribe to the regulations which have been set by IFOAM, which is the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. If you want to be organically certified, you have to get a copy of the standards, and you have to work within those rules. The standards for organic certification are very clear to understand. You may only do certain things. You may not put certain things into your soil, and if you just live within those rules it is very easy to be organic. Mantshiu	Now lastly Maggy, what benefits has this process brought you? Frayne	In the field that we farm in, in medicinal herbs, our customers ask that our herbs are certified organic, because it is a <b>guarantee</b> of their <b>purity.</b> I know, because I was selling herbs before I was certified organic, that it was easier to sell them afterwards, when they were certified organic. But you must remember that certification is expensive, it can cost 5000 Rand, and it is an annual fee. You have to be inspected, and so you have got to allow for that money. But that is not the end of the world, because the certification bodies will allow groups of farmers to come together and be certified with one number, and that will cut the costs down. End of track.
