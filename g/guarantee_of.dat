5|$|Several English {{players have}} started their careers at Arsenal under Wenger, such as Ashley Cole, David Bentley and Matthew Upson, and many {{continue}} to build careers at the club, namely Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere. Wenger commented that an advantage of building his team around British players was the <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> stability.|$|E
5|$|Abovian saw in {{strengthening}} of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands. However; when Abovian wrote the novel he was already disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, particularly {{with the implementation of}} Polozhenie (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced the political power of the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the Armenian Oblast in 1840. In the novel, elements of romanticism and realism are interlaced while the narration is supplanted by lyrical retreats.|$|E
5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as part of what he termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E
5000|$|In {{their most}} {{accomplished}} form, <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> Origin are issued electronically for a controlled {{quantity of electricity}} generation (1 GO per MWh), traded and redeemed (i.e. used) by suppliers as evidence to their customers {{of the quality of}} the delivered electricity. Generation from renewable energy sources is the most sought-after attribute. A new development concerns <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> origin for cogeneration heat plants (or CHP).

5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, and that a 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E
5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure {{and led to a}} decline in the size and effectiveness of the armed forces during the 1930s. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|During the Sarajevo Crisis in 1914, German diplomats offered Turkey an anti-Russian {{alliance}} and territorial gains in Caucasia, north-west Iran and Trans-Caspia. The pro-British faction {{in the cabinet}} was isolated due to the British ambassador taking leave until 18 August. As the crisis deepened in Europe, Ottoman policy was to obtain a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> territorial integrity and potential advantages, unaware that the British might enter a European war. On 30 July 1914, {{two days after the}} outbreak of the war in Europe, the Ottoman leaders agreed to form a secret Ottoman-German Alliance against Russia, although it did not require them to undertake military action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> Origin {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the Eugene Green Energy Standard or EKOenergy labelling scheme. Both provide consumers with more information about their power (transparency). However, Eugene and EKOenergy go further by requiring additionality. Besides, Eugene and EKOenergy are private initiatives whereas <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> origin arise from European regulations.|$|R

5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|June 28, 2012: In {{the case}} of United States v. Alvarez, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005's criminalization of the making of false claims of having been awarded a {{military}} medal, decoration, or badge was an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment's <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> free speech. The case involved an elected official in California, Xavier Alvarez, who had falsely stated at a public meeting {{that he had been}} awarded the Medal of Honor, even though he had never served in any branch of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{argued that}} he had conquered the city by force. Abu Ubaidah {{maintained}} the city had capitulated, through the peace agreement between him and Thomas. The corps commanders discussed the situation, and reportedly told Khalid that the peace agreement must be honored. Their rationale had logic: if other Byzantines in Syria heard that the Muslims had given a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> safety to a surrendered city and then had slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city would ever surrender to the Muslims. This would make the task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid, though not happy, agreed to honor the peace agreement.|$|E

Macrinus fled to Italy, disguised as a courier, but was intercepted near Chalcedon and executed in Cappadocia. His son Diadumenian, sent as a friendly hostage to the Parthian court as a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> peace between the states, was captured at Zeugma and also put to death.|$|E
5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were {{an important step}} in protection of minorities and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Kentucky's citizens believed {{the state should}} be a mediator between the North and South. On December 9, 1860, Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin {{sent a letter to}} the other slave state governors, suggesting that they come to an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, a division of common territories at the 37th parallel, a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> free use of the Mississippi River, and a Southern veto over slave legislation. Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure the concessions. Because of the escalating pace of events, neither conference was held.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Pahang Civil War the following year saw Abu Bakar befriending Tun Mutahir, whom he provided support for his war efforts. Abu Bakar married Mutahir's daughter in 1860 during a visit in Pahang, and the following year he signed a treaty of friendship, alliance and a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> mutual support with Mutahir in 1861. Meanwhile, Temenggong Ibrahim was already suffering from a prolonged period of ill health, and a bout of high fever resulted in his death on 31 January 1862.|$|E

The next morning, after 19 hours, the hostages were released, even though only the third demand had been met. Prisoners did, however, {{have an opportunity to}} communicate with the press during the siege, as the riot was a live media event with television helicopters filming from overhead.|$|E
