Based on a survey of 12 European countries, it was concluded that an increase in carbon and fuel prices of approximately ten percent would result in a short-run increase in electrical power prices of roughly eight percent. This would suggest that a lowering cap on carbon emissions will likely lead to an increase in the costs of alternative power sources.

The first is the upper boundary that is represented by an engine’s maximum torque at a given speed. The second boundary is 30 percent of maximum torque. Only operation above this boundary is included in the NTE control area.

We identify two new strategic effects, namely the relative efficiency effect, and the competition softening effect, that affect the incentive for green R&D. Under an abatement tax, R&D incentives increase whenever the new technology is non-drastic, and the demand function is either approximately linear, or not too elastic.

5000|$|An <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> {{and permit}} trading {{system is a}} {{quantity}} instrument because it fixes the overall emission level (quantity) and allows the price to vary. Uncertainty in future supply and demand conditions (market volatility) coupled with a fixed number of pollution permits creates an uncertainty in the future price of pollution permits, and the industry must accordingly bear the cost of adapting to these volatile market conditions. The burden of a volatile market thus lies with the industry rather than the controlling agency, which is generally more efficient. However, under volatile market conditions, {{the ability of the}} controlling agency to alter the caps will translate into an ability to pick [...] "winners and losers" [...] and thus presents an opportunity for corruption.|$|E
50|$|A third option, {{known as}} a safety valve, is a hybrid of the price and {{quantity}} instruments. The system is essentially an <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> and permit trading system but the maximum (or minimum) permit price is capped. Emitters have the choice of either obtaining permits in the marketplace or buying them from the government at a specified trigger price (which could be adjusted over time). The system is sometimes recommended {{as a way of}} overcoming the fundamental disadvantages of both systems by giving governments the flexibility to adjust the system as new information comes to light. It can be shown that by setting the trigger price high enough, or the number of permits low enough, the safety valve can be used to mimic either a pure quantity or pure price mechanism.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between {{cap and trade}} and cap and dividend that ultimately define each of them. A cap is placed on carbon emissions and green house gas (GHG) emissions in both policies. Based on the caps there are carbon emission permits that give the companies the ability to produce more carbon emissions then the cap would permit. These permits are auctioned off to different companies. In the cap and trade system only a set amount are auctioned off and the rest are given away for free. In the cap and dividend system all the permits are auctioned off. In both systems the cost of buying the permits will increase {{the price of the}} product made by the companies; oil, electric, and products that make carbon emissions. The thought process behind this is to dissuade the purchase of mass quantities of these products i.e. less carbon/GHG emissions. While the cap and trade system uses the high prices to control the amount of carbon emissions they do not provide a good incentive to limit carbon <b>emission.</b> <b>Cap</b> and dividend uses the dividends to reward the people that conserve the most. This will benefit the poor the most because of their living situations and this is found to be a problem with lots of people critiquing the policy.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} optimal {{management}} of emission permit markets when banking but not borrowing of permits is allowed. The regulator maximizes expected social welfare through an optimal allocation rule in an infinite horizon setting. The policy is second-best as the <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> is set before the {{uncertainty about the}} current state of the economy is resolved. In this setting, the role of banking is to decrease the regulator's risk as it generates an endogenous price floor in the permit markets. We show that the regulator's optimal policy adjusts the emissions cap irrespective of the existing number of permits in the bank, with the implication that the regulator neutralizes the effect of the existing bank on future permit prices. We derive the optimality conditions for the second-best <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> with banking and solve the model analytically in the case of IID shocks. Our results show that the discount factor together with the slopes of the marginal damages and benefits determine the welfare gains from allowing baking of permits. Finally, to address {{the current state of}} the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and guide the design of future permit markets, we solve the model numerically with persistent shock process and show that the optimal <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> is positively correlated with business cycles, meaning that during downturns the regulator should tighten the cap.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{introduction}} to “Dual track approach”, a comprehensive architecture for a climate regime beyond 2012, after the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} firm-level innovation in carbon-abatement technologies on optimal cap-and-trade schemes with and without price controls. We characterize optimal cap-and-trade regulation with a price cap and a price floor, and {{compare it to the}} special cases of pure taxation and a simple <b>emissions</b> <b>cap.</b> Innovation shifts the tradeoff between price- and quantity-based instruments towards quantity-based emissions trading schemes. More specifically, an increase in innovation effectiveness lowers the optimal <b>emissions</b> <b>cap,</b> and leads to relaxed price controls unless the slope of the marginal environmental damage curve is small. Because of the decrease in the <b>emissions</b> <b>cap,</b> innovation in abatement technologies can lead to a higher expected carbon price, so as to provide sufficient incentives for private R&D investments.

40|$|We study {{production}} capacity utilization and emission permit utilization {{in a model}} where firms jointly produce a valued good and an environmental bad, pollution. Firms are ex ante identical but experience random productivity shocks after factor employment. A regulator imposes a cap-and-trade policy to control pollution emissions. Trade in emission permits entails transactions costs which follow two specifications: constant per unit trading costs or fixed trading costs. Under constant per unit trading costs, the equilibrium outcome depends only on the total unit trading costs; the incidence of costs borne by buyers and sellers does not matter. Under fixed costs, both buyers 2 ̆ 7 and sellers 2 ̆ 7 costs matter. Under proportional costs permit trade always occurs, with either full or partial market clearing, {{as long as the}} total trading costs are below the permit trade surplus. With fixed costs, trade is either partial or non-existent. The implication is that firms fully utilize their {{production capacity}} for a range of proportional trading costs; capacity is never fully utilized under fixed costs. Under proportional costs, trade is impeded most, even with small costs, when the <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> is either relatively high or low. There exists a non-monotonic relationship between the aggregate emissions cap and a lower bound for trading costs that obstruct or preclude trade. Under fixed costs, a similar relationship between <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> and the cost threshold that precludes trade holds only if the output variance is exogenously fixed. Otherwise, the higher the <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> the higher is this cost threshold. In contrast to proportional costs where capacity utilization decreases with productivity variance, the result is the opposite under fixed costs...|$|E

Two carbon emission regulatory policies are investigated, the tax or carbon credit and the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>cap.</b> Computational experiments are performed to analyze the trade-offs between {{the total cost of}} the supply chain, the carbon emission quantity, and both carbon emission regulatory policies.

40|$|To {{achieve the}} {{emission}} reduction target in 2020, China plans {{to establish a}} nationwide carbon trading market during 2016 – 2019. It is therefore an important but difficult task for policymakers to set emission allowances and allocate them among entities.

Based on China’s emission-abatement target, this paper examines the optimal investment and analyzes its implementation in different allocation rules. A new model is developed to formulate enterprises’ emission reduction pathways and the cost-minimization problem with the <b>emission</b> <b>cap.</b> The results show that the magnitude of enterprises’ emission reduction is positively related to their innovation potential; neither auctioning nor being free of charge can make enterprise’s individual emission-abatement investment in accordance with the optimal level; enterprise’s individual emission-abatement investment is sensitive to efficiency, budget cap, and environmental benefit.

40|$|We model climate {{negotiations}} as a two-stage game. In {{the first}} stage of the game, players have to agree on a global <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> (GEC). In the second stage, they non-cooperatively choose either their emission level or their emission quota, depending on whether emission trading is allowed, under the cap that potentially binds them together. A three heterogenous player quadratic game serves as a base for the analysis. In this framework, when the cap is non-binding, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium. When the <b>emission</b> <b>cap</b> is binding, among all the coupled constraints Nash equilibria, we select a normalized equilibrium by solving a variational inequality, which has a unique solution. In both scenarios – with and without emission trading – we show that there exists a non- empty range of values for which setting a binding cap improves all players’ payoff. It also appears that for some values of the cap, all players get a higher payoff under the GEC system alone than under the international cap and trade (ITC) system alone. Thus, the introduction of a GEC outperforms the ITC system both in terms of emission reduction and of payoff gains...|$|E
