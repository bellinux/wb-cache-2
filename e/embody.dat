5|$|Once a {{proclamation}} {{had been}} issued ordering the Army Reserve {{to be called}} out for permanent service, the Crown was legally permitted to order the Army Council to issue directions to <b>embody</b> {{all or part of}} the Territorial Force.

If Parliament was not sitting at the time of the proclamation, it was to resume its session within ten days.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I present industry-level indices of <b>embodied</b> R&D that {{are meant to}} capture the extent of {{research}} and development applied to the capital goods in which an industry invests. Compiling and adjusting data from various National Science Foundation and Commerce Department sources, I construct industry-level, time-series measures of these indices and investigate their properties. The data indicate that the overall growth in <b>embodied</b> R&D over the last three decades is nearly entirely due to increased R&D done on capital goods rather than changes in the asset composition of capital. The measures of <b>embodied</b> R&D are compared to rates of <b>embodied</b> technological change estimated using plant-level manufacturing data. The level of <b>embodied</b> R&D is found to be positively and significantly related to the estimated rates of <b>embodied</b> technological change, but its growth rate is not. Likewise, the level rather than the growth rate of <b>embodied</b> R&D is shown to have a positive and significant effect on productivity growth as measured by the Solow Residual. This suggests that the constructed measures of <b>embodied</b> R&D are proportional to true <b>embodied</b> technological change.

By breaking down the analysis of <b>embodied</b> energy consumption into different categories (i. e. materials, transportation and construction), it is shown that, in both tunnels, materials dominate approximately 63 % of the total <b>embodied</b> energy, as steel has the highest <b>embodied</b> energy intensity among all construction materials. Tunnels require direct energy-intensive construction, as transportation and construction can collectively account for as much as 37 % of the total <b>embodied</b> energy.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to argue the case for <b>embodied</b> ways of knowing in arts {{research}}. Recognition of <b>embodied</b> ways of knowing and <b>embodied</b> research has been relatively recent. For too long, arts research had been marginalized in academia, particularly performing arts, due in part to the somatophobia of Western academic cultures. While grounded in dance research myself, I argue that <b>embodied</b> engagement is crucial for performing arts and arts research in general. It is through rigorous and reflective practice that theoretical knowledges and lived experiences can be <b>embodied,</b> made meaningful, and thus contribute to the generation of new understandings. I contend that such <b>embodied</b> knowledge is then available to artists and researchers for subsequent expression and aesthetic communication via a wide range of mediums and interdisciplinary practices. I discuss <b>embodied</b> ways of knowing and suggest some guidelines for undertaking <b>embodied</b> research. I conclude by emphasizing the continuing relevance of performing arts in expressing individual human <b>embodied</b> experience in an increasingly virtual, self-destructive and global world...|$|R

Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil.
