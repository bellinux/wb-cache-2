5|$|After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, {{many people}} {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended <b>disinfecting</b> private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding. Many people {{took advantage of the}} flood victims, including fraudulent contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified.|$|E
5|$|Not all ticks in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long-feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, <b>disinfecting</b> the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and <b>disinfecting</b> near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E
50|$|UVGI {{is often}} used to <b>disinfect</b> {{equipment}} such as safety goggles, instruments, pipettors, and other devices. Lab personnel also <b>disinfect</b> glassware and plasticware this way. Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to <b>disinfect</b> surfaces inside biological safety cabinets ("hoods") between uses.|$|R

25|$|Multipurpose {{solutions}} {{are the most}} common method for rinsing, <b>disinfecting,</b> cleaning, and storing soft lenses. In 2002, concerns were raised that multipurpose {{solutions are}} not effective at <b>disinfecting</b> Acanthamoeba from the lens. In May 2007, one brand of multipurpose solution was recalled due to a cluster of Acanthamoeba infections. Since then, studies showed that multipurpose solutions are ineffective against Acanthamoebae. The latest multipurpose solutions also contain ingredients that improve the surface wetability and comfort of silicone hydrogel lenses.|$|E
25|$|A {{disinfector}} {{works on}} the side as a secretary for three call girls. While <b>disinfecting,</b> he receives a call, but the caller hangs up. While walking on the sidewalk, a payphone rings, but the caller also hangs up. He calls one of the business cards which propositions a date and pays a pimp. He discovers that the women {{is one of the}} call girls called Naomi who he had a crush on. Instead of having sex with her, he opens his <b>disinfecting</b> bag, causing her to leave. He receives a call for Naomi and cleans the handset instead.|$|E

50|$|The term {{sanitizer}} {{has been}} used to define substances that both clean and <b>disinfect.</b> More recently this term has been applied to alcohol-based products that <b>disinfect</b> the hands (alcohol hand sanitizers). Alcohol hand sanitizers however are not considered to be effective on soiled hands.|$|R
25|$|Lens care varies {{depending}} on material and wear schedule. Daily disposables are discarded after a single use and thus require no cleaning. Other lenses need regular cleaning and <b>disinfecting</b> to prevent surface coating and infections.|$|E
25|$|Preventive {{measures}} include avoiding {{direct contact}} with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, <b>disinfecting</b> contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene.

25|$|On 8 August, Jamnagar {{reported}} 269 millimetres (10inches) of {{rain and}} fresh flooding was reported in Gujarat. By the next day, nine people had been killed and more than 400 villages were cut off. By 10 August, more than 22,000 people were displaced and health workers were <b>disinfecting</b> the worst-hit areas.|$|E
5000|$|Potassium {{permanganate}} (KMnO4) is a purplish-black {{crystalline powder}} that colours everything it touches, through a strong oxidising action. This includes staining [...] "stainless" [...] steel, which somehow limits its use {{and makes it}} necessary to use plastic or glass containers. It is used to <b>disinfect</b> aquariums and is also widely used in community swimming pools to <b>disinfect</b> ones feet before entering the pool. Typically, a large shallow basin of KMnO4/water solution is kept near the pool ladder. Participants are required to step in the basin and then go into the pool. Additionally, it is widely used to <b>disinfect</b> community water ponds and wells in tropical countries, {{as well as to}} <b>disinfect</b> the mouth before pulling out teeth. It can be applied to wounds in dilute solution.|$|R

25|$|Recommendations {{to prevent}} {{spread of the}} virus among humans include using {{standard}} infection control, which includes frequent washing of hands {{with soap and water}} or with alcohol-based hand sanitizers, especially after being out in public. Chance of transmission is also reduced by <b>disinfecting</b> household surfaces, which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution.|$|E
25|$|Eaton et al. advises that, when {{controlling}} {{an outbreak}} of SeV, <b>disinfecting</b> the laboratory environment and vaccinating the breeders, as well as eliminating infected animals and screening incoming animals, should clear the problem very quickly. Imported animals should be vaccinated with SeV and placed in quarantine, while, in the laboratory environment, breeding programs should be discontinued, and the non-breeding adults isolated for two months.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{contracting}} 'P. aeruginosa {{can be reduced}} by avoiding pools, hot tubs, and other bodies of standing water; regularly <b>disinfecting</b> and/or replacing equipment that regularly encounters moisture (such as contact lens equipment and solutions); and washing one's hands often (which is protective against many other pathogens as well). However, even the best hygiene practices cannot totally protect an individual against P. aeruginosa, given how common 'P. aeruginosa is in the environment.|$|E

40|$|A {{bacteriological}} {{study was}} carried out on the first Leisure Centre swimming pools in the United Kingdom to be <b>disinfected</b> with ozone/chlorine. Results suggested that a free chlorine concentration of approximately 0. 8 mg/l was necessary to maintain the pools in a bacteriologically satisfactory condition. This amount of free chlorine {{was similar to that}} required when the pool was <b>disinfected</b> with chlorine alone. However, the associated amount of combined chlorine was much lower when disinfection was by ozone/chlorine and this gave more acceptable bathing conditions. Implications for the manamgement of pools <b>disinfected</b> by this method are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aleurone layers {{isolated}} from half-seeds of Himalaya barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Himalaya) <b>disinfected</b> in hypochlorite solutions containing 1. 0 % available chlorine synthesized significantly less α-amylase {{in response to}} gibberellic acid than layers derived from half-seeds <b>disinfected</b> in 0. 1 % hypochlorite. This effect of hypochlorite involved neither a differential decrease in the synthesis of group A or B α-amylase isozymes nor a general decrease in α-amylase synthesis attributable to fewer viable aleurone cells in layers from half-seeds <b>disinfected</b> with 1 % hypochlorite. Our results emphasize the need to evaluate the potential effects of routine disinfection procedures used in physiological and biochemical studies...|$|R
25|$|Historically {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{was used for}} <b>disinfecting</b> wounds, partly because of its low cost and prompt availability compared to other antiseptics. It is now thought to slow healing and lead to scarring because it destroys newly formed skin cells. Only a very low concentration of H2O2 can induce healing, and only if not repeatedly applied. Surgical use can lead to gas embolism formation. Despite this it is still used for wound treatment in many developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Organic {{chemicals}} {{are widely used}} as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, <b>disinfecting,</b> cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products. Fuels {{are made up of}} organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds during usage, and, to some degree, when they are stored. Testing emissions from building materials used indoors has become increasingly common for floor coverings, paints, and many other important indoor building materials and finishes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people in}} low-income {{communities}} cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead. Ash or soil {{may be more}} effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap. Evidence quality is poor. One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it. Like soap, ash is also a <b>disinfecting</b> agent (alkaline). WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.|$|E

25|$|Common {{hospital}} disinfectants are ineffective against C. difficile spores and, in fact, may promote spore formation, however, disinfectants {{containing a}} 10:1 ratio {{of water to}} bleach effectively kill the spores. Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) systems used to sterilize a patient room post-discharge {{have been shown to}} reduce infection rates and to reduce risk of infection to subsequent patients. The incidence of CDI was reduced by 53% or 42% through use of HPV. Ultraviolet cleaning devices and housekeeping staff especially dedicated to <b>disinfecting</b> the rooms of patients infected with C. difficile after discharge may be effective.|$|E
25|$|They {{travel to}} a nearby Mexican lunar colony, finding it covered in cobwebs and the colonists dead, entombed in similar webbing. The Doctor {{confirms}} the colony's readings that the moon has gained over one billion tons of additional mass. They are attacked by a spider-like creature that kills Lundvik's crew, but the <b>disinfecting</b> spray Courtney brought kills the creature; the Doctor compares it to germs, and wants to study it further. After seeing Courtney safe to the TARDIS, they investigate a crevasse where thousands of the spider-like creature wait, {{and the presence of}} amniotic fluid nearby. The Doctor surprises Clara and Lundvik by diving into the crevasse, promising to meet them later.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses {{are often}} {{categorized}} by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because {{they do not}} have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or <b>disinfecting</b> is not needed, leading to improved compliance.|$|E
