Union soldiers accidentally found {{a copy of}} Lee's orders dividing his army, wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp. They delivered the order to McClellan's headquarters in Frederick on September 13. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, [...] "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I {{will be willing to}} go home." [...] He telegraphed President Lincoln: [...] "I have the whole rebel force in front of me, but I am confident, and no time shall be lost. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, and that he will be severely punished for it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency. ...

2500|$|The Army of the Potomac reached Frederick, Maryland, on September 13. There, Cpl. Barton Mitchell of the 27th Indiana Infantry {{discovered}} a mislaid {{copy of the}} detailed campaign plans of Lee's armySpecial Order 191wrapped around three cigars. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically, thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, [...] "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I {{will be willing to}} go home."

2500|$|Imperial {{and provincial}} {{government}} bureaucracies attempted to Germanise the state's national minorities situated near {{the borders of}} the empire: the Danes in the North, the Francophones in the West and Poles in the East. As minister president of Prussia and as imperial chancellor, Bismarck [...] "sorted people into their linguistic [...] ‘tribes’", however, he pursued a policy of hostility in particular toward the Poles, which was an expedient rooted in Prussian history. [...] "He never had a Pole among his peasants" [...] working the Bismarckian estates; it was the educated Polish bourgeoisie and revolutionaries he denounced from personal experience, and [...] "because of them he disliked intellectuals in politics." [...] Bismarck’s antagonism is revealed in a private letter to his sister in 1861: [...] "Hammer the Poles until they despair of living [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sympathy in the world for their situation, but if we want to exist {{we have no choice but}} to wipe them out: wolves are only what God made them, but we shoot them all the same when we can get at them." [...] Later that year, the public Bismarck modified his belligerence and wrote to Prussia’s foreign minister: [...] "Every success of the Polish national movement is a defeat for Prussia, we cannot carry on the fight against this element according to the rules of civil justice, but only in accordance with the rules of war." [...] With Polish nationalism the ever-present menace, Bismarck preferred expulsion rather than Germanisation.|$|E

We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E
