40|$|Abstract. An inverse {{method for}} the {{characterisation}} of the <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of materials has been studied. The method {{is based on}} spherical indentation test data and numerical analysis of the indentation process, enabling to find a characteristic stress-strain curve. This method will be appropriate for <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> study, mainly on surface hardened materials, when the standard methods cannot be applied. In this work, the method was applied to annealed and quenched steels, with homogeneous properties over the cross section. The obtained results are in good agreement with those obtained from the standard tensile tests. However, if the material does not follow a linear hardening law, the elastoplastic characteristics determined by the inverse method {{will depend on the}} indentation depth. For these cases a method for the evaluation of the actual behaviour law has been improved...|$|E

This paper presents a wavelet Galerkin method for the numerical solution of such a class of problems, extensively studied and solved in the past by means of more traditional approaches.

3000|$|The {{identification}} procedure consists in minimizing E_rc {{with respect to}} its two arguments u_n^c and B_n^s. The method {{can be applied to}} any behaviour for which an expression of the secant tensor B_n^s is available. Consequently, it can be used on reversible behaviours (linear and non-linear elasticity) or irreversible behaviours (viscoelasticity, elastoplasticity [...]...). When dealing with irreversible behaviours, it is necessary to take the loading history into account. In the case of elastoplasticity, this amounts to separate elastic loading steps from plastic ones. The method was numerically implemented to deal with <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviours</b> and monotonic loadings. The consistency between the numerical implementation and the main hypotheses underlying the description of plastic flow (e.g. existence of a yield stress, isochoric plastic strain, normality rule) is ensured from the formulation, thus minimizing the set of parameters to identify.|$|R

Since the method proposed in [24] is based on Airy functions, the approach is limited to simple geometries and regular meshes. This limitation is here removed and any geometry can be addressed. Moreover, the initial work [24] was limited to <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviours</b> with a linear hardening. For sake of simplicity, the present paper also focuses on linear hardening but it is now straightforward to deal with any kinematic hardening law. The last improvement presented here concerns {{the identification of the}} yield stress and of the hardening modulus. The formulation was modified in order to allow the simultaneous identification of the two plastic parameters: the initial requirement of a plastic zone whose size remains constant on two successive load steps is no more needed.|$|R

Shear walls have very high inplane stiffness and strength, which can be used to simultaneously resist large horizontal loads and support gravity loads, making them quite advantageous in many structural engineering applications. There are lots of literatures available to design and analyse the shear wall. However, the decision about the location of shear wall in multistorey building is not much discussed in any literatures. In this paper, therefore, main focus is to determine the solution for shear wall location in multistorey building based on its both elastic and <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviours.</b> An earthquake load is calculated and applied to a building of fifteen stories located in zone IV. Elastic and elastoplastic analyses were performed using both STAAD Pro 2004 and SAP V 10. 0. 5 (2000) software packages.

40|$|The Paderno d’Adda {{bridge is}} a {{beautiful}} iron viaduct built in 1889 by the Società Nazionale delle Officine di Savigliano (SNOS), in response to needs from rapidly-growing industrial activities in Lombardia {{towards the end of}} 1800. Specifically, within the expansion of the local railway network, it became necessary to acquire an elevated crossing on the river Adda, North-East from Milano. The remarkable structural concept elaborated for the bridge by designer Jules Röthlisberger (1851 - 1911), head of the SNOS Technical Office since 1885, was that of raising a stiff but slender symmetric doubly built-in parabolic arch among the two banks of Paderno d’Adda (right bank) and Calusco d’Adda (left bank), of about 150 m of horizontal span and 37. 5 m of vertical rise, supporting then, together with vertical truncated pyramidal piers, a straight upper box continuous beam on nine bearings of 266 m of length. The present research study has been developed in the direction of modelling the global non-linear <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the bridge. Reference is still made so far to the characteristics at design stage; the hypothesis of perfect <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> with unlimited ductility of all the structural members has been assumed.

The stress calculations were performed using analytical methods and FEA. They applied the TCD and linear-elastic material behaviour. They concluded that the homogeneity of stress distributions in the adhesive layer {{has an influence on}} the quality of the lifetime predictions. Frequently, when dealing with joints that present stress peaks, such as single-lap joints, it is possible to reach local stress levels that might cause a plastic response of the material, despite nominal stresses being within the elastic range. The effect of plasticity was already included in early closed formulations from Hart Smith [14] and Crocombe [15]. The consideration of <b>elastoplastic</b> material <b>behaviour</b> can influence calculations in several ways, for example stress peak relief as demonstrated by Hua [16]. Ward [17] gave an extensive review of the yield behaviour of polymers, highlighting the dependence on the hydrostatic component of the stress, in contrast to other materials such as metals. Xu [18] performed FEA calculations using hydrostatic stress dependent <b>elastoplastic</b> material <b>behaviour</b> (Drucker–Prager) to model double lap joints under quasi-static loads.

40|$|Metal {{additive}} manufacturing techniques have been increasingly attracting {{the interest of}} the aerospace and biomedical industry. A particular focus has been on high value and complexity parts and components, as there the advantages offered by {{additive manufacturing}} are very significant for the design and production organisations. Various additive manufacturing techniques have been tested and utilized over the past years, with laser-based technology being among the preferred solutions – e. g. selective laser melting / sintering (SLM / SLS). Fatigue qualification, as one of the primary design challenges to meet, imposes the need for extensive material testing. Moreover, this need is amplified by the fact that currently there is very limited in-service experience and understanding of the distinct mechanical behaviour of additively manufactured metallic materials. To this end, material modelling can serve as a mediator, nevertheless research particular to additively manufactured metals is also quite limited. This work attempts to identify the cyclic <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> characteristics of SLM manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. A set of uniaxial stress and strain controlled mechanical tests have been conducted on as-built SLM coupons. Phenomena critical for engineering applications and interrelated to fatigue performance (mean stress relaxation, ratcheting) have been examined under the prism of constitutive modeling. Cyclic plasticity models have been successfully employed to simulate the test results.

The rock material parameters were derived from triaxial compression tests. The results show that the difference in mud- pressure predictions between elasticity and plasticity depends strongly on the employed failure criteria. The difference between elasticity and plasticity becomes more pronounced with a criterion which allows the material near the borehole wall to reach a critical plastic strain determined from the calibration tests. In such a case differences from 45 % to 80 % were encountered.

40|$|Underground gas {{injection}} has attracted remarkable attention {{for natural gas}} storage and carbon dioxide (CO 2) geologic sequestration applications. Injection of natural gas into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs {{is the most popular}} storage method. CO 2 geologic sequestration plays a vital role in alleviating global warming and climate change issues related to the significant release of CO 2 as one of the major greenhouse gases produced from the combustion of fossil fuels. The injection of gas into underground geologic formations builds up the fluid pore pressure, which changes the effective stress, i. e. the stress applied to the rock skeleton. The deformation due to change of stresses could result in various geomechanics related issues across the reservoir interval and over/under burden rocks such as fault or fracture reactivation, collapse of casings, wellbore instabilities and ground uplift. To simulate injection of gas into porous formations and investigate subsequent stress induced events finite element (FE) modelling has been used in the past. This numerical method is suitable for continuum media, similar to porous formations considered for injections. In this study a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element program was developed for simulations of {{gas injection}} into a porous medium. Both isotropic linear elastic and elasto-plastic behaviours (including von Mises, Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager yield criteria) were assumed for geomaterials. The program applies isoparametric formulation using 3 D 8 -noded hexahedron elements and supports different types of loading including those due to body (gravity) force and tractions on outer boundary. The effective stress concept and Biot's theory were integrated in the fundamental formulations in order to account for the gas injection modelling. The developed code was applied to model some typical elastic examples for which analytical solutions exist: this allowed validation of the program. Thereafter several simulations of porous formations carried out to study the injection induced stress and displacements within the injection zone and surrounding formations with horizontal and curved structures. The results indicated the change in the state of stress regime due to injection and its variation at different locations in a non-horizontal structure. The results of elasto-plastic models were also validated against some simple cases with known responses. The model then applied to simulate the development of plastic zone around a porous formation due to gas injection. The results of sensitivity analysis showed how the plastic zone expands when the formation exhibits less strength properties, i. e. cohesion. The 3 D FE program was finally applied to study a real case in which injection into a sandstone formation was studied. The stress and displacements before and after injection were estimated considering both isotropic linear elastic and <b>elastoplastic</b> <b>behaviours</b> for the formation. This allowed estimation of ground uplift and the development of the plastic zone around the injection area...|$|R

40|$|A {{cohesive}} zone model (CZM) {{has been used}} in conjunction with both elastic and <b>elastoplastic</b> continuum <b>behaviour</b> to predict the response of a mixed mode flexure and three different lap shear joints, all manufactured with the same adhesive. It was found that, for a specific dissipated CZM energy (Gamma(0)) there was a range of CZM tripping tractions (sigma(u)) that gave a fairly constant failure load. A value of sigma(u) below this range gave rise to global damage throughout the bonded region before any crack propagation initiated. A value above this range gave rise to a discontinuous process zone, which resulted in failure loads that were strongly dependent on sigma(u). A discontinuous process zone gives rise to mesh dependent results. The CZM parameters used in the predictions were determined from the experimental fracture mechanics specimen test data. When damage initiated, a deviation from the linear load-displacement curve was observed. The value for sigma(u) was determined by identifying the magnitude that gave rise to the experimentally observed deviation. The CZM energy (Gamma(0)) was then obtained by correlating the simulated load-crack length response with corresponding experimental data. The R-curve behaviour seen with increasing crack length was successfully simulated when adhesive plasticity was included in the constitutive model of the adhesive layer. This was also seen to enhance the prediction of the lap shear specimens. Excellent correlation was found between the experimental and predicted joint strengths...|$|R
40|$|To {{properly}} {{simulate the}} propagation of an existing crack, we need to model how fast and in what direction it grows. A Generalized Crack Driving Force (GCDF), based {{on the concept of}} material forces cf. [1], is used to formulate a framework for crack propagation models. This framework can be used to formulate different crack propagation strategies: Explicit Proportional Extension (EPE), Implicit Proportional Extension (IPE) and Maximum Parallel Release Rate (MPRR), cf. [2]. Here, it is shown that all three strategies produce quantitatively good results compared with experiments, for the case of a three point bending test with an eccentric edge crack and internal holes [3]. In railway applications, highly complex loading cases arise in the wheel–rail interface, due to a moving contact load. For this particular loading case it is observed that the perpendicular component of the GCDF is highly dependent on the chosen parameters of the numerical algorithm. Hence, it is concluded that only the MPRR method remains applicable as it is only dependent on the parallel component of the GCDF and therefore more robust. Furthermore, the high loads in the wheel-rail interface result in large plastic deformation whereby the fracture resistance of the material becomes anisotropic [4]. Based on the MPRR method, {{the propagation of}} a single head check crack in a piece of rail, under realistic Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) loading conditions, is simulated by the use of a 2 D FE model incorporating <b>elastoplastic</b> material <b>behaviour.</b> Finally, results from the simulations are presented and qualitatively compared to field observations...|$|R

The experiments conducted by the authors have proven that structural defects of shifted structural elements cause localization of deformations in the zone of defects, whereas the average temperature of the steel surface in the zone of defects may go up by several dozens of degrees and predetermine initiation and development of the seat of destruction in the place exposed to shear forces.
