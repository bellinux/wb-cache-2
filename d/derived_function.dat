Using the extra element theorem, a circuit element (such as a resistor) can be removed from a circuit and the desired driving point or transfer function found. By removing the element that most complicates the circuit (such as an element that creates feedback), the desired function can be easier to obtain. Next two correctional factors must be found and combined with the previously <b>derived</b> <b>function</b> to find the exact expression.|$|E

40|$|XML is {{becoming}} the standard for document description in a B 2 B setting, and XML Schema is gaining wide acceptance as the schema language to define the structure of these documents. Business documents such as those currently found in B 2 B applications, frequently comprise derived elements, i. e. elements whose content can be calculated through a <b>deriving</b> <b>function</b> that examines the content of other elements. Based on this observation, this work advocates incorporating the notion of derived elements in XML Schema. Despite its wide presence, the notion of derived elements is not yet supported in XML Schema. To this end two issues are addressed: (1) the implicitness of current approaches to <b>deriving</b> <b>function</b> support for XML documents, and (2) the externality of some deriving data which participate in the <b>deriving</b> <b>function.</b> These aspects are respectively tackled both (1) by moving the derivation semantics to the document schema, and (2) by proposing an attachment where the deriving elements are recorded. These ideas have been realized by extending a JAXP-compliant XML parser. Now, this parser can be configured to become ‘‘derivation aware’’. That is, the schemata is now enriched with <b>deriving</b> <b>functions.</b> At parsing time, these functions are interpreted, and the returned values become {{the content of the}} associated derived elements...|$|R

Therefore, many researchers in mathematics education are looking for several ways to improve the quality of learning. The purpose of this paper is to investigate an overview of specific difficulties based on the graph of <b>derived</b> <b>function,</b> another words, how students find the connections between the graph of <b>derived</b> <b>function</b> and the some properties of the original function. The subjects were 102 high school students in grade 11. The study was conducted during the fall semester in two calculus classes. The data of the research has been collected from 5 diagnostic the graph of <b>derived</b> <b>function</b> involved the chance in slope, decreasing, increasing, a local maximum, a local minimum, the point of inflection. The questionnaires were designed to assess how well the students had learned procedures the connections between the graph of <b>derived</b> <b>function</b> and the some properties of original function. Each student was asked explain how you arrived at your answers. While working on the answers of the students, not only the accuracy of the students’ answers was examined but also the methods were being analysed even if they were incorrect. The results indicated that the students find it difficult to make connections between the graph of <b>derived</b> <b>function</b> and the original function. Usually, they were to interpret the graph of <b>derived</b> <b>function</b> as the graph of function.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the procedure for}} an analytical derivation of the drop probability function for the Random Early Detection queue management mechanism. The procedure {{is based on a}} model of the TCP window system and the establishment for a criterion for system stability with methods of control theory. The term stability refers to the oscillation amplitude of the steady state queue size. The outcome is a polynomial function of the queue size, which can be approximated with a power function of the queue size. Besides the goal of achieving low oscillations for the whole load range, this <b>derived</b> <b>function</b> shows yet other advantages. There are no parameters to adjust, which extends the applicability of RED {{to a wide range of}} load situations applying the <b>derived</b> <b>function.</b> Additionally, the under-utilization at low loads, as often experienced with the original RED function, is avoided automatically. Simulations show clear evidence that the <b>derived</b> <b>function</b> outperforms the original linear RED function...|$|E
40|$|Structures with {{governing}} equations having identical inertial terms but somewhat differing stiffness terms can be termed flexurally analogous. An {{example of such}} a structure includes an axially loaded non-uniform beam and an unloaded uniform beam, for which an exact solution exists. We find that there exist shared eigenpairs (frequency and mode shapes) for a particular mode between such structures. Non-uniform beams with uniform axial loads, gravity loaded beams and rotating beams are considered and shared eigenpairs with uniform beams are found. In general, the <b>derived</b> flexural stiffness <b>functions</b> (FSF's) for the non-uniform beams required for the existence of shared eigenpair have internal singularities, but some of the singularities can be removed by an appropriate selection of integration constants using the theory of limits. The <b>derived</b> <b>functions</b> yield an insight into the relationship between the axial load and flexural stiffness of axially loaded beam structures. The <b>derived</b> <b>functions</b> can serve as benchmark solutions for numerical methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The paper studies the dynamic contact angles effect on capillary and viscous forces of liquid bridges, calculation results indicate that its effects on capillary force are significant; however, it has little effect on viscous force.
