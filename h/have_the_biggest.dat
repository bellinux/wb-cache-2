5|$|Raymond {{posted a}} team-high 27 goals and 62 points as a rookie, {{including}} six game winning goals. Following his first junior season, Raymond was {{recruited by the}} Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Having earned an athletic scholarship, he had the choice of playing one more season with Camrose or to make the jump to the college ranks. He consulted with Kodiaks head coach Boris Rybalka and was challenged to improve at the Junior A level before moving to Minnesota-Duluth. As a result, Raymond remained in Camrose, signing a letter of intent in November 2004 to join the Minnesota-Duluth the following year for the 2005–06 season. Several other National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) schools had recruited Raymond as well, including the University of Denver, Western Michigan University and the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. He chose the Bulldogs because he knew that, with 11 seniors leaving their team the following season, he would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> role with that club.|$|E

25|$|Advanced economies {{account for}} the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most {{important}} region in 2010, followed by North America $1.409 trillion and Asia $1.161 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in premium income during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the world's population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace. The country expected to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> impact on the insurance share distribution across the world is China. According to Sam Radwan of ENHANCE International LLC, low premium penetration (insurance premium as a % of GDP), an ageing population and the largest car market in terms of new sales, premium growth has averaged 15–20% in the past five years, and China {{is expected to be the}} largest insurance market in the next decade or two.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{secondary}} market {{is unlikely to}} have followed {{the growth of the}} primary market since 2007 seeing as game companies have become better at monetizing on their games with microtransactions and many popular games such as World of Warcraft are sporting increased measures against player to player real money trading. Also hampering the turnover growth are the extreme price drops that has followed the increased competition from businesses in mainland China targeting the global secondary market. Furthermore, the global decline in consumption that followed the financial crisis of 2007–2008 would have affected {{the secondary}} market negatively as well. Post 2007 secondary market growth is likely localized to emerging markets such as Russia, eastern Europe, South America, and South East Asia - all of which are relatively inaccessible to international merchants due to payment systems, advertisement channels and language barrier. For example, South Korea is estimated to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> share of the global real money trading market and it has there become an officially acknowledged and taxable part of the economy. In western countries the secondary market remains a black market with little to no social acceptance or official acknowledgement.|$|E

[...] The director was confirmed to be looking into the finer details of the production, along with the screenplay. Though initially rumored that Karan Malhotra's Shuddhi was to be the film adaptation of the book, it was a different film. In September 2013, Johar announced that Malhotra would be directing The Immortals of Meluha, but only after the release of Shuddhi. Tripathi also revealed during Jaipur Literature Festival that an unnamed Hollywood producer bought the rights for an American version of the film. This led to speculation in the media whether Johar would indeed helm the film or the release would be an American production. In January 2015, Tripathi confirmed that the film adaptation was on-going and would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> budget of any film series. Malhotra started adapting the story into a film script, with Tripathi acting as creative consultant and reviewer.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer was really good at, and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E
