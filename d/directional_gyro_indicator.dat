In case of vacuum-driven instruments failure (i.e. <b>directional</b> <b>gyro,</b> attitude <b>indicator)</b> the rollout to new heading is timed: let's say the aircraft is flying 060 degrees heading and it needs to fly new heading 360. The turn will be 60 degrees. Since the standard rate turn is 360 degrees in 120 seconds, the plane will need 20-second standard rate turn to the left.|$|R

50|$|The heading {{indicator}} (also called an HI) is a flight instrument {{used in an}} aircraft to inform the pilot of the aircraft's heading. It is sometimes referred to by its older names, the <b>directional</b> <b>gyro</b> or DG, and also (UK usage) direction indicator or DI.|$|R
25|$|The heading <b>indicator</b> or <b>directional</b> <b>gyro</b> has an axis of {{rotation}} that is set horizontally, pointing north. Unlike a magnetic compass, it does not seek north.

40|$|In 1817, F. Bohnenberger {{presented}} an apparatus {{consisting of a}} fast spinning rotor with cardanic suspension. His invention {{formed the basis for}} L. Foucault’s epochal studies on gyroscopic sensors {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. The development of instruments like the artificial horizon and the <b>directional</b> <b>gyro</b> is a direct result of this work. Later on, gyro technology led also to stabilized platforms forming the early variants of inertial navigation systems. Foucault’s initial intention of using Bohnenberger’s invention as a sensor was the provision of a device offering an inertial direction reference for surveying and navigation. Due to technical limitations, a gyro is, however, suitable for such a task during only a limited period of time. To enable a long-term usage, additional, complementary measurements are required. An artificial horizon therefore includes levelling sensors, and a <b>directional</b> <b>gyro</b> is typically coupled with a magnetic compass. On the other hand, the main feature of integrated navigation systems is the fusion of data from dis-similar signal sources. Thus, artificial horizons and <b>directional</b> <b>gyros</b> represent elementary forms of such systems. Modern integrated navigation systems of high performance consist of the combination of inertial strapdown systems (being the successor of stabilized platforms) and GPS receivers. In photogrammetry, they have become an essential tool for direct georeferencing. Nevertheless, their system structure is still traceable to the early gyro instruments mentioned.

50|$|The heading {{indicator}} (also {{known as the}} <b>directional</b> <b>gyro,</b> or DG) displays the aircraft's heading with respect to magnetic north when set with a compass. Bearing friction causes drift errors from precession, which must be periodically corrected by calibrating the instrument to the magnetic compass. In many advanced aircraft (including almost all jet aircraft), the {{heading indicator}} {{is replaced by a}} horizontal situation indicator (HSI) which provides the same heading information, but also assists with navigation.|$|R
50|$|Since the gyrocompass's north-seeking {{function}} {{depends on}} the rotation around the axis of the Earth that causes torque-induced gyroscopic precession, it will not orient itself correctly to true north if it is moved very fast in an east to west direction, thus negating the Earth's rotation. However, aircraft commonly use heading <b>indicators</b> or <b>directional</b> <b>gyros,</b> which are not gyrocompasses and do not align themselves to north via precession, but are periodically aligned manually to magnetic north.|$|R

50|$|A gyroscope, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with gyrocompass, is a spinning wheel mounted on a set of gimbals so that its axis is free to orient itself in any way. When it is spun up to speed with its axis pointing in some direction, due to the law of conservation of angular momentum, such a wheel will normally maintain its original orientation to a fixed point in outer space (not to a fixed point on Earth). Since our planet rotates, it appears to a stationary observer on Earth that a gyroscope's axis is completing a full rotation once every 24 hours. Such a rotating gyroscope is used for navigation in some cases, for example on aircraft, where it is known as heading <b>indicator</b> or <b>directional</b> <b>gyro,</b> but cannot ordinarily be used for long-term marine navigation. The crucial additional ingredient needed to turn a gyroscope into a gyrocompass, so it would automatically position to true north, is some mechanism that results in an application of torque whenever the compass's axis is not pointing north.|$|R

5000|$|BTR-50PU (mashina upravleniya) (1959) - Unarmed command vehicle. It {{carries a}} crew of 10 and has an armored roof with oval hatches and four whip antennas. Most of the BTR-50PUs have two {{projecting}} bays {{on the front of}} the vehicle (the respective NATO codes are: BTR-50PU(1) and BTR-50PU(2)). The two bays are the same shape, unlike in the OT-62 TOPAS, which is otherwise very similar in appearance. The vehicle has ten seats, of which four are for the commander and his staff, four are for the radio operators and two are for the vehicle's commander and driver. The staff compartment has a collapsible table, a second small table for the commander, two hammocks and three ladders. An emergency escape hatch is provided in the floor of the vehicle and the vehicle has thermal insulation. Specialized equipment consists of KN-2 and KP-2 navigation devices; an AB-1-P/30 1 kW generator (located on the rear engine deck); R-105, R-105U and R-113 VHF radios; a R-112 HF transceiver, a R-311 HF receiver; a collapsible 11 m mast antenna for the R-105U; a light 10 m telescopic mast for the R-112; a R-403BM relay-set; R-120 intercom and a P-193A 10-line field telephone switchboard with six TAI-43 field telephones and four cable reels, each with 600 m of two-wire cable. The navigation system includes a <b>gyro</b> course <b>indicator</b> and course plotter (the former indicates the vehicle's course, the latter plots it on a rectangular co-ordinate system).

5000|$|The heading {{indicator}} works using a gyroscope, tied by an erection mechanism to the aircraft yawing plane, i. e. the plane {{defined by the}} longitudinal and the lateral axis of the aircraft. As such, any configuration of the aircraft yawing plane that does not match the local Earth horizontal results in an indication error. The {{heading indicator}} is arranged such that the gyro axis is used to drive the display, which consists of a circular compass card calibrated in degrees. The gyroscope is spun either electrically, or using filtered air flow from a suction pump (sometimes a pressure pump in high altitude aircraft) driven from the aircraft's engine. Because the Earth rotates (ω, 15° per hour, apparent drift), and because of small accumulated errors caused by imperfect balancing of the <b>gyro,</b> the heading <b>indicator</b> will drift over time (real drift), and must be reset using a magnetic compass periodically. [...] The apparent drift is predicted by ω sin Latitude and will thus be greatest over the poles. To counter for the effect of Earth rate drift a latitude nut can be set (on the ground only) which induces a (hopefully equal and opposite) real wander in the gyroscope. Otherwise {{it would be necessary}} to manually realign the direction indicator once each ten to fifteen minutes during routine in-flight checks. Failure to do this is a common source of navigation errors among new pilots. Another sort of apparent drift exists in the form of transport wander, caused by the aircraft movement and the convergence of the meridian lines towards the poles. It equals the course change along a great circle (orthodrome) flight path.|$|R
40|$|This Volume {{records the}} {{activities}} of the PICR User Cost Surveys Group which conducted a large vehicle operating cost survey in Central, Western and Southern Brazil during the period 1975 to 1981. The Group was responsible for the collection and analysis of vehicle maintenance parts and labor costs, tire costs, depreciation and interest charges, and drivers' salaries. In addition, fuel consumption and speed data were collected, the latter when easily available, to serve as consistency checks on the equations derived from experimental data. The Group was also responsible for collecting data on surface roughness, as well as vertical and horizontal geometry characteristics of the routes of those operators registered in the survey. The primary data collection phase ran from 1975 to 1979. and 26 staff members were employed, comprising 14 field workers, 8 clerical assistants and 4 supervisors. More than two years was spent in developing and testing appropriate methodologies, documentation and data p. rocessing systems for the collection, checking,. storage and analysis of both operating cost and highway characteristic data. Contact was made with over 300 companies and more than 2500 vehicles were regis tered for survey membership. Operating cost data were then collected on_ a regular basis from company records. Many difficulties had to be overcome during this period. A number of companies only had records of a few cost components and, where possible, assistance was givento provide the necessary documentation and training to collect missing items. Some companies dropped out of the survey and data collection in others was discontinued because the route characteristics of their vehicles were found to be redundant {{to the needs of the}} PICR. Finally, data on over 1600 vehicles derived from 132 companies were available in for preliminary analysis. 1979 Highway characteristics were collected using two specially instrumented vehicles. Roughness was measured with a Maysmeter and calibration maintained through a GM Profilometer and Quarter-Car~Simulator which generated a se~ies of profile~ for a calibration course of highway sections established near Brasflia. Vertical geometry w~s measured using a linear accelerometer connected to a panel scale capable of recording grade changes + of - 1 % + to - 12 %. Horizontal measurements were taken from a standard aircraft <b>directional</b> <b>gyro</b> compass, mounted in the survey vehicles. Over 85, 000 km of roughness and geometry data were collected after measuring more than 36, 000 km of operators' routes. After. editing, these data had then to be combined with the vehicle operating cost data so that a single file comprising both dependent and independent variables could be made available for analy~is. The second PICR Phase covered the period 1980 to 1981. The staff was reduced to 5, who were principally engaged in conducting more detailed analyses. The statistical methods employed were rationalized into distinct groups of techniques and advanced econometric procedures employed. An important technique which provided a number of the equations reported herein was the generalized least squares estimation of the error ~omponent model. The latter considers. the company specific error term and the vehicle specific error term which jointly form the components of the unknown random error term consider~d by ordinary least squares techniques. This is one of the first reported application of error components analysis in the field of transportation stu - dies. All the different techniques are detailed in the analysis pro - cedures section of this Volume. The analyst was able to run a selec - tion of these techniques simultaneously on any data set. This made comp~rison of the results and the choice of recommended equations an easier task. Vehicle operating cost information presented for analysis cover the full range of vehicles operating on Brazilian highways. These are grouped into cars_. utility vehicles, buses, medium trucks and heavy articulated vehicles for analysis purposes. The results of the anal - yses of fuel consumption, oil and grease consumption, maintenance parts and labor, tire consumption, depreciation and interest charges and vehicle speed are presented. All five vehicles classes are used in the analyses except for speed which is restricted to cars and buses, and tire costs which are analysed by tire size. The equations recommended in this Volume concentrate on estimating roughness, vehicle age, vehicle characteristics (where appropriate) and geometry effects only when these appear unambiguous. A substantial amount of time was spent estimating the effect of geometry on the various operating cost items and details on the progress made are given in both main text and selected appendices. It is clear that more time is needed to resolve th~ issue. Further small analyses,. together with the findings of the operating cost study in India, presently being analysed, may result in the emergence of a more coherent pattern of the geometry effect on user costs. The PICR User Survey data are the most comprehensive collec~ ed to date and are important both to Brazil, where out-of-date cost tables are widely used and the international research community~ where they. complement the Kenya. Caribbean and India studies. The PICR survey data covers a spectrum of vehicle types and appears to be the only study with a full range of truck classes. The data have now passed through several phases of analysis and the results presented in this Volume. together with the relevant technical memoranda, can be regarded as an interim final form. They are now ready for extensive evaluation in a variety of economic exercises. When they have passed these tests they can be viewed as being in final form for the period ending December 31, 1981. Comparistins are made between total operating costs predict - ed from the various equations recommended in this Volume and prevail - ing transport service rates and tariffs. The results are encouraring and give confidence to the view that the recommended equations will provide better predictions of vehicle operating costs than anything currently used in Brazil. It is recommended that a user cost manual be prepared to allow the results of the PICR survey to be widely disseminated.
