5|$|Clarke held a big {{advantage}} in the campaign as he {{was supported by the}} Métis who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> someone to locally represent them in the Legislature since the territory was formed in 1870. Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote. His resounding win would make him the first elected member to sit on the Northwest Territories council.|$|E
5|$|The crater was {{discovered}} by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} this was the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> {{someone to}} turn into a martyr for the Nazi cause. His first attempt was with Albert Leo Schlageter, a member of the Freikorps and a saboteur who was caught {{attempting}} to blow up a train in the Ruhr region while it was under occupation by French troops in retaliation Germany's not making its schedule of reparation payments. Schlageter was executed by the French, and his gravesite later became a Nazi shrine. There were also the 16 Nazis who had died during the Beer Hall Putsch, and would have a memorial built for them in Munich which was required to be saluted when passing by, and who were honored with a public ceremony every year when the Putsch was remembered.|$|E
5|$|Mathews {{began her}} career in 1990 as an {{associate}} at the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Company. In 1992 Mathews joined Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and led the economic team for the president-elect. Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped set up the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as Staff Director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for healthcare reform. Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs. When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before a Senate Committee during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's garbage {{and the fate of}} the documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E
5|$|The group goes to IBF {{in search}} for a cure, but starts showing signs of Tief Blau. An {{exception}} is Tsugumi, as the Cure virus has made her immune; the group injects themselves with her antibodies. They get contact with the surface, and a rescue pod is sent down, but is only able {{to stay for a}} short period of time. Tsugumi disappears to find Chami, who has gone missing; Takeshi chases after her, and saves Sora's data onto a disk, to save her memories. Returning to IBF, they have missed the rescue vessel. They find a submarine and escape, but its batteries die; Takeshi exits it, giving it enough buoyancy to save Tsugumi, while he dies on the ocean floor. Coco dies in IBF, as she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> Pipi, and the rescue team could not find her.|$|E

25|$|The 1990s {{ushered in}} a new era. For several years the Department of Defense <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> leaner, and smarter {{cost-saving}} ways to do business.

Americans expected a peace dividend—a reduction in defense spending. Downsizing became the key word, but Brooks AFB continued to grow.|$|E

25|$|Up to 200 {{missiles}} were launched against Iran between 1987 and 1988, killing some 2,000 people. Teheran, Qom and Isfahan became the usual targets. Their poor accuracy, while mostly ineffective {{to conduct a}} major strategic campaign, made of them basically weapons of terror, forcing thousands of refugees out of the main Iranian cities. This exchange of ballistic missiles was indeed known as 'the war of the cities'. The full-scale campaign lasted from 29 February 1988 until April 20, when a truce was agreed by both sides. Iraq, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> some kind of compromise gesture from Iran, is largely viewed as the 'winner' by some authors.|$|E

25|$|Although Weinstone {{had been}} removed from America to break up an {{incipient}} factional war, he continued to campaign for the position of party leader. In the spring of 1933 he obtained the final test of strength he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> {{in the form of a}} dozen meetings of the Comintern's Anglo-American Secretariat in Moscow spread out over 29 days. Throughout April Browder and Weinstone leveled charges and counter-charges against one another, examining the Communist Party's activities in the United States in fine detail. Despite significant criticism of certain of his actions, Browder emerged from the Moscow sessions in a firm position of authority. Weinstone, accepting defeat at last, remained in Moscow as the CPUSA's CI Rep until 1934.|$|E
25|$|MEG signals {{were first}} {{measured}} by University of Illinois physicist David Cohen in 1968, before {{the availability of}} the SQUID, using a copper induction coil as the detector. To reduce the magnetic background noise, the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room. The coil detector was barely sensitive enough, resulting in poor, noisy MEG measurements that were difficult to use. Later, Cohen built a better shielded room at MIT, and used one of the first SQUID detectors, just developed by James E. Zimmerman, a researcher at Ford Motor Company, to again measure MEG signals. This time the signals were almost as clear as those of EEG. This stimulated the interest of physicists who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> uses of SQUIDs. Subsequent to this, various types of spontaneous and evoked MEGs began to be measured.|$|E
25|$|The Orwells {{spent some}} time in the North East, near Carlton, County Durham, dealing with matters in the {{adoption}} of a boy whom they named Richard Horatio Blair. By September 1944 they had set up home in Islington, at 27b Canonbury Square. Baby Richard joined them there, and Eileen gave up her work at the Ministry of Food to look after her family. Secker & Warburg had agreed to publish Animal Farm, planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to become a war correspondent for the Observer. Orwell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the opportunity throughout the war, but his failed medical reports prevented him from being allowed anywhere near action. He went to Paris after the liberation of France and to Cologne once it had been occupied by the Allies.|$|E
