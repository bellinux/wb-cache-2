40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} in <b>electrocardiology</b> is to extract physical properties of cardiac tissues from measured information on electrical activity of the heart. Mathematically, this is an inverse problem for reconstructing coefficients in <b>electrocardiology</b> models from partial knowledge of the solutions of the models. In this work, we consider such parameter extraction problems for two well-studied <b>electrocardiology</b> models: the bidomain model and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. We propose a systematic reconstruction method based on the Born approximation of the original nonlinear inverse problem. We describe a two-step procedure {{that allows us to}} reconstruct not only perturbations of the unknowns, but also the backgrounds around which the linearization is performed. We show some numerical simulations under various conditions to demonstrate the performance of our method. We also introduce a parameterization strategy using eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator {{to reduce the number of}} unknowns in the parameter extraction problem. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the inverse}} problem en <b>electrocardiology,</b> {{the goal is}} to recover {{electrophysiological}} activity in the heart without measuring directly on its surface (without using catheter interventions). Note that today the inverse computation is frequently used by solving the quasi-static model. This model doesnt take into account the heart dynamic in time and may result in considerable errors in the reconstruction of the solution on the heart. In this paper, a 3 D numerical inverse problem constrained by the bidomain equations in <b>electrocardiology</b> is investigated. The state equations consisting in a coupled reaction-diffusion system modelling the propagation of the intracelullar and extracellular electrical potentials, and ionic currents, are extended to further consider the effect of an external bathing medium. Thus, we demonstrate that the novel concept of applying electrophysiological data might be useful to improve noninvasive reconstruction of electrical heart activity. Finally, we present numerical experiments representing the effect of the heart dynamic on the inverse solutions...|$|E

40|$|Robust Generalised Cross-Validation was {{proposed}} {{recently as a}} method for determining near optimal regularisation parameters in inverse problems. It was introduced to overcome {{a problem with the}} regular Generalised Cross-Validation method in which the function that is minimised to obtain the regularisation parameter often has a broad, flat minimum, resulting in a poor estimate for the parameter. The robust method defines a new function to be minimised which has a narrower minimum, but at the expense of introducing a new parameter called the robustness parameter. In this study, the Robust Generalised Cross-Validation method is applied to the inverse problem of <b>electrocardiology.</b> It is demonstrated that, for realistic situations, the robustness parameter can be set to zero. With this choice of robustness parameter, it is shown that the robust method is able to obtain estimates of the regularisation parameter in the inverse problem of <b>electrocardiology</b> that are comparable to, or better than, many of the standard methods that are applied to this inverse problem.
