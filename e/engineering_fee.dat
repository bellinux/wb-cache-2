40|$|Appraisal {{and design}} of {{small-scale}} hydro power plants requires a knowledge of hydraulics, hydrology, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering, and basic economics. Further, small hydro is site specific in nature and marginal from an economic view point. Methods of appraisal and design are required therefore that will keep <b>engineering</b> <b>fees</b> to a minimum and yet still achieve a reliable evaluation of scheme potential and economics. In this context it should be appreciated that small hydro is not large hydro scaled down, and that small hydro needs its own experts (Ref. 1). This thesis considers techniques for appraisal of small hydropower schemes, the selection and specification of scheme components, their costing and economic evaluation. These appraisal techniques are subsequently applied to regional assessment of small-scale hydro-electric potential in the U. K, and to the development and application of {{a new type of}} ultra low-head hydropower generator called the Salford Transverse oscillator (STO). Although this work is predominately concerned with assessment of scheme potential in the U.

40|$|Virtual reality {{applications}} such as architectural walkthroughs require a powerful graphics hardware to achieve interactive frame rates of rendering. Usual rendering algorithms like z-buffer or BSP-tree often spend significant time processing portions of model that are currently invisible to an observer. To describe restrictions in visibility, the visibility information can be precomputed and used to dramatically reduce amount of data to be processed during rendering. The model of a virtual environment is divided into cells using an algorithm of spatial subdivision. The spatial subdivision is represented by a graph structure. For each cell the cell-tocell and cell-to-frustum visibility information is determined and stored in a tree data structure within that cell. However, widely used languages for description of model geometry, such as VRML, do not offer resources to describe the scene subdivision and to store the explicit visibility information along with the geometry.

It is indicated that the proper amount of the bond should equal to the reclamation cost. There are two approaches to calculate reclamation cost. One is based on ecosystem service value. The other is based on reclamation fee. The former is difficult to operate in practice for the result derived by this method has much difference from the payment ability of the mining enterprises. By comparison, it is easy to operate in practice to calculate reclamation cost through the calculation of the total sum of <b>engineering</b> reclamation <b>fee,</b> biological reclamation fee and other reclamation fee.

50|$|For a contractor, soft {{costs are}} {{essentially}} construction costs incurred {{that are not}} labor and materials. Delay in Start Up insurance coverage and soft costs are not the same. Some soft costs may be incurred in the repair of a covered loss before the anticipated completion date is reached. These can be architect <b>fees</b> or <b>engineering</b> <b>fees</b> incurred to repair loss or damage to the insured property. Only those indirect costs that are above {{what would have been}} incurred up to the anticipated completion date but continue after such date due to the insured delay are soft costs that are covered by delay in completion or delay in start up coverage. Soft cost is a contractor accounting term for their expenses that are not associated with a particular construction task. Their construction trailer, water delivery, book keepers, etc. are all soft costs that continue on after the original anticipated completion date is reached, if the project is delayed. Only if the delay was caused by an insured loss would the insurance pick these expenses up, and only if the policy includes delay in start up coverage. Any repair costs which are not labor or materials and are indemnified to complete the repair of property loss should not be reported under delay in completion and there is no delay in completion until the anticipated date of completion is reached, and the project is not finished. Not all indirect costs are time related expenses that continue after the original date of completion. Those soft costs (indirect costs) which are continuing fixed expenses that continue because the project is delayed by an insured loss are soft costs that should be included with the delay in start up values. A soft cost to a contractor, such as his administration costs, can be a hard cost to the owner because what the contractor invoices the owner is the owner's direct cost. If the owner employs engineers to overlook construction as the project is executed, this will be a continuing expense during repair if the repair is done after the original completion date and would be reported in the delay in completion values. If the engineer cost was a one time charge for a design, he may need to be consulted in order for the loss to be repaired. This expense does not occur because of a delay, but is incurred to repair property damage and hence {{should be included in the}} construction costs if the intention is for that expense to be covered in the indemnification depending on policy wording. If the project is insured to the extent of the reported values, and that value was left out to compute the premium, the company may decline that cost in the indemnification.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Only 8 % of all {{engineering}} {{faculty are}} women. Far less women in academia {{are in an}} engineering leadership or administrative role such as department chair, associate dean, dean, provost, and chancellor or president. The Women in Engineering Leadership Institute (WELI) {{was one of the}} programs funded by the National Science Foundations ADVANCE program to help advance women in academia in engineering and science to higher leadership and administrative roles. WELI successfully held three Leadership Institutes for engineering faculty women funded by their grant. The women selected to participate were tenured and held either the rank of associate or full professor. These women were then at a place in their career where they were potential administrators. Although the NSF funding was almost gone after three Institute Conferences and a Summit, the WELI leaders determined that there were many more potential women academic leaders in engineering that could benefit from the Institute. Therefore, in partnership with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and the Henry Luce Foundation, the WELI leaders were able to conduct a fourth Institute intertwined with the 2005 National SWE Conference. A major difference from the previous WELI conferences was that there was no funding available to pay for the travel, lodging, and the conference <b>fees.</b> <b>Engineering</b> Deans wer...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a brand new standard for the design of frame structures of pultruded Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) shapes, with an emphasis on the gaps in knowledge towards the mandatory design information for bolted connections. Structural <b>engineering</b> designers facing <b>fee</b> competition and unrealistic deadlines seek design methods that are simple to use and on the ‘safe’ side. They often have little knowledge of exactly ‘how safe’ their designs are, and with too little time to find out they will confidently follow a code of practice when working with a traditional structural material. Structural shapes of FRP have been available since the 1970 s and, for this non-traditional material, designers have had to rely on information from the pultruders, since there is no code of practice to follow. Because this is an obstacle to market growth a project commenced in 2007 to write an American Society of Civil Engineers standard. As part of a team of ‘code writers’ the author works on the design guidance for a chapter on bolted connections. By way of a critical evaluation of what we know, and don’t know, the team has gained insight into where new academic research is required to cope with deficiencies in our knowledge and understanding. This paper lists twenty questions that require our attention and it provides advice on how they should be tackled to ensure that the research is not useless; ‘useless’ in the sense that results cannot be used for the basis of preparing design guidance...|$|R
40|$|This senior {{design project}} {{involves}} {{the design of}} an artificial wetland, {{in the form of}} a fresh water pond, which will incorporate a drainage system designed to direct stormwater runoff into the pond itself. The pond will serve as a display area for various fauna maintained by the Scott Arboretum of Swarthmore College, as a subject of study for the biology and engineering departments as well as a recreational area for visitors and students of the college. Although the design of this pond incorporates diversion of storm runoff, its primary purpose is not that of a stormwater runoff control structure, but one which will incorporate runoff control as a functional aspect of its primarily aesthetic purpose. A system of three inlets linked to the pond by a series of culverts delivers runoff into the pond in addition to surface runoff. Although several maps of the campus were available, part of this project was an exercise in learning some fundamental surveying techniques. In order to map the site area, a planetable survey was performed and differential leveling was performed in order to obtain topographic information. The computer software package Quick TR- 55 by Haestad Methods was used to estimate runnoff for the watershed. For determining the hydro graphs and peak discharges for the watershed, TR- 55 methods were used. The Pond- 2 computer program by Haestad Methods was used in combination with the hydrographs produced with Quick TR- 55 to design the pond volume based on a 24 -hour rainfall for a storm of a 100 year return frequency. From the modeling using the Pond- 2 program the size of the pond was determined to be 75, 400 cubic feet. The design volume of the pond from volumetric calculations was determined to be 76, 428 cubic feet. A cost estimate of the final design was performed and the projected cost for the project including <b>engineering</b> and contingency <b>fees</b> was determined to be 52, 567. Although the purpose of the project does not include the actual implementation of the final design, this design proposal could be used in the future by Swarthmore college.
