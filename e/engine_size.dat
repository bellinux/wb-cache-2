5|$|Grand Prix – This mode has {{the player}} race against 7 (or 6) teams, which are {{controlled}} by the computer, {{in a series of}} predetermined courses. The player can choose to race using 3 different <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> classes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. A fourth unlockable class, Mirror Mode, allows the player to race through a mirrored version of the tracks using the 150cc <b>engine</b> <b>size.</b> Since all karts go faster when using higher engine sizes, the 4 classes serve as difficulty levels. There are 16 tracks, divided into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star and Special. A 5th cup has the player race in every track called the All-Cup Tour. The tour always starts with Luigi Circuit and ends with Rainbow Road, but the remaining tracks show up in random order. Every race is three laps long except for Baby Park and Wario Colosseum, which have 7 and 2, respectively. After all the human players cross the finish line, the positions of the computer-controlled teams are immediately locked in and they are given points based on those eight positions, ranging from 0 to 10. At the end of the cup, there will be an award ceremony for the 3 teams, where they will get a trophy ranging from bronze to gold. No matter which position they earned after each race, everyone will move on because of these new rules.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, a {{state-owned}} contractor for the Chinese space program, {{announced that}} it had completed a first ignition test on a new LOX methane rocket engine. No <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> was provided.|$|E

25|$|Because {{vehicles}} {{less than}} 5 years old {{are outside the}} budget of many people in 2014 the rules were 'devolved' {{it was decided that}} cars of any age would be allowed on the Rally but they must be removed from Mongolia after the event. Without the import restrictions the <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> limit has reverted to 1000cc.|$|E
25|$|When Ducati re-joined MotoGP in , MotoGP {{had changed}} its rules to allow {{four-stroke}} 990cc engines to race. At the time Ducati was the fastest bike. In , MotoGP reduced the <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> to , and Ducati {{continued to be}} the fastest with a bike that was markedly quicker than its rivals as was displayed by Casey Stoner on tracks with long straights.|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, Royal Enfield Motors {{announced}} it is establishing its North American headquarters and a dealership in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, {{with the intention}} to offer three bikes, the Bullet 500, Classic 500 and Continental GT 535 Cafe Racer as they feel this <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> represents an underserved market. The dealership will be Royal Enfield's first company-owned store in the U.S., according to Rod Copes, president of Royal Enfield North America. The company wants to establish about 100 dealerships in American cities starting with Milwaukee.|$|E

25|$|Tyre changes {{returned}} to Formula One in 2006. Each driver {{is limited to}} 14 sets of tyres per race weekend. This consists of seven sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of wet-weather tyres and three sets of extreme-weather tyres. The thinking behind {{this is that the}} reduced <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> will offset any performance gain. The number of constructors who were supplied tyres by Michelin was down from seven to six while Bridgestone increased from three to five. Michelin announced they would withdraw from the championship after the 2006 season.|$|E
25|$|The Lympne Light Aircraft Trials {{were held}} to {{encourage}} the development of practical light aircraft for private ownership, with a strong but not exclusive emphasis on fuel economy. They were held in 1923, 1924 and 1926. Each year saw different restrictions on <b>engine</b> <b>size,</b> framed initially in terms of capacity and then weight. The Daily Mail newspaper provided cash prizes throughout though the initiating donation came from the Duke of Sutherland. The Air Ministry were prize givers in the 1924 event. The trials were held at Lympne in Kent, England.|$|E
25|$|Cars {{registered}} in the UK after 2001 qualified for free road tax because of their low CO2 emissions (2000 registered cars would be taxed on the lower rate of the old system based on <b>engine</b> <b>size).</b> As a hybrid, the Insight did also qualify for an exemption from the London Congestion Charge. However, in December 2010 this changed such that hybrids no longer gained automatic exception, instead cars emitting less than 100g/km CO2 and meeting the January 2005 Euro 4 emissions standard. The Insight being homologated as a 2000 vehicle, and hence not Euro 4 compliant, meant it no longer meets the criteria.|$|E

50|$|The Fred Wood {{designed}} Whitwood monocar used OEC duplex steering, retractable outriggers, and tandem bucket seats, and {{was offered}} with <b>engine</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from 250-996 cc between 1933 and 1935.|$|R
25|$|There have {{traditionally}} been several races at each event for various classes of motorcycles, based on <b>engine</b> <b>size,</b> and one class for sidecars. Classes for 50 cc, 80cc, 125cc, 250cc, 350cc, and 500cc solo machines have existed at some time, and 350cc and 500cc sidecars. Up through the 1950s {{and most of the}} 1960s, four-stroke engines dominated all classes. In part this was due to rules, which allowed a multiplicity of cylinders (meaning smaller pistons, producing higher revs) and a multiplicity of gears (giving narrower power bands, affording higher states of tune). In the 1960s, two-stroke engines began to take root in the smaller classes.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, many {{national}} motor clubs {{banded together to}} form the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (AIACR). In 1922 the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) was empowered on behalf of AIACR to regulate Grand Prix racing {{and other forms of}} international racing. Since the inception of Grand Prix racing, competitions had been run in accordance with a strict formula based on <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> and vehicle weight. These regulations were virtually abandoned in 1928 with an era known as Formula Libre when race organisers decided to run their events with almost no limitations. From 1927 to 1934, the number of races considered to have Grand Prix status exploded, jumping from five events in 1927, to nine events in 1929, to eighteen in 1934 (the peak year before World War II).|$|E
25|$|The car {{did not win}} as many races as hoped as it was bumped up a class due to <b>engine</b> <b>size.</b> Being a 3.0-liter, it {{was forced}} to run with more weight whereas more powerful, and lighter but {{slightly}} smaller capacity Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500s {{did not have the}} same issue. By its debut in 1989 the lack of power and heavy weight meant that the Turbo A was already outperformed by many much more competitive cars such as the BMW M3 (E30) from a lower division and their chances of success further reduced by the introduction of the Nissan Skyline GTR (R32) For the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC) in 1989, Toyota would in 1991 switch to racing the Corolla Levins instead in the lower category while many privateer soildered on with the Supra until Group A racing's final demise in 1993.|$|E
50|$|Manufactured in Germany between 1924 and 1928, the Agon {{featured}} {{a wide range}} of <b>engine</b> <b>sizes</b> from 173cc up to 996cc, from engine manufacturers such as Paque, Bradshaw and JAP.|$|R

50|$|The Zündapp Bella is a {{motor scooter}} {{manufactured}} by motorcycle manufacturer Zündapp from 1953 to 1964. Approximately 130,000 Bella scooters were sold, with <b>engine</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from 150 cc to 200 cc.|$|R
25|$|The German Wehrmacht is {{somewhat}} {{more advanced than}} historically, with a fully mechanized supply train. The Waffen-SS units facing the Draka Citizen Airborne unit the novel centers around are also in possession of numerous 'hybrid' armoured vehicles made from German and captured Soviet parts, {{but they are still}} no match for the Draka army. The Draka citizen soldiers, female as well as male, are honed killing machines, each equal to several of their enemy on the battlefield. The Draka also have superb weaponry, including 14,000 Hond III tanks with armor, <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> and gun caliber approaching those of modern MBTs, and powerful air force which includes high-performance single and twin piston engine fighters, airborne early warning systems mounted on dirigibles and a twin-engine armored ground attack aircraft. By 1944, all sides are widely using nerve gas, jet- and rocket-powered fighter aircraft and ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|The even stricter {{emissions}} standards {{which were}} to be introduced in 1975 {{as part of a}} staggered program of cleaning the air proved problematic for kei car manufacturers. This was particularly hard for Daihatsu and Suzuki, which focused on two-stroke engines. Tiny Suzuki was worse off, with the company's entire production consisting of two-stroke kei cars. Daihatsu, though, had both the engineering backing and powerful connections of their large owner, Toyota, to aid them in meeting the new requirements. All manufacturers of kei cars were clamoring for relaxing the dimension conditions, claiming that the emissions standards could not be met with a functional 360-cc engine (though Subaru's SEEC-T-equipped Rex proved it possible). In the end, the Japanese legislature relented, increasing the overall length and width restrictions by 200mm and 100mm, respectively. <b>Engine</b> <b>size</b> was increased to 550cc, taking effect from January 1, 1976. The new standards were announced on 26 August 1975, leaving very little time for manufacturers to update their offerings.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008, the Russian {{government}} introduced protectionist measures, worth $5billion, {{to improve}} {{the situation in the}} industry. This included $2billion of bailouts for troubled companies and $3billion of credits for buyers of Russian cars. Prime minister Vladimir Putin described the move as vital in order to save jobs. The tariffs for imported foreign cars and trucks were increased to a minimum of 50% and go up to 100%. The tariffs are linked to the <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> of the vehicle. The increased duties led to protests in Russian cities, most notably in Vladivostok, where the importation of Japanese cars is an important sector of the city's economy. To compensate for the losses of the Vladivostok businesses, Prime Minister Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It was planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.|$|E

Snowmobiles are capable of moving across steep hillsides without sliding down-slope if the rider transfers their weight towards the uphill side, a process called side-hilling.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 81 cars were entered for the event, across eight classes based on <b>engine</b> <b>sizes,</b> ranging from up to 750cc to over 8.0 litre. Of these 59 cars practised, 54 {{qualified}} to race.|$|R
25|$|An {{oscillating}} {{engine was}} {{a type of}} direct-acting engine {{that was designed to}} achieve further reductions in <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term oscillating. Steam was supplied and exhausted through the trunnions. The oscillating motion of the cylinder was usually used to line up ports in the trunnions to direct the steam feed and exhaust to the cylinder at the correct times. However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the timing to be varied to enable expansive working. (As, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen.) This compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|E
25|$|Races in {{this period}} were heavily nationalistic affairs, with a few {{countries}} setting up races of their own, but no formal championship tying them together. The rules varied {{from country to country}} and race to race, and typically centered on maximum (not minimum) weights in an effort to limit power by limiting <b>engine</b> <b>size</b> indirectly (10–15L engines were quite common, usually with no more than four cylinders, and producing less than 50hp). The cars all had mechanics on board as well as the driver, and no one was allowed to work on the cars during the race except for these two. A key factor to Renault winning this first Grand Prix was held to be the detachable wheel rims (developed by Michelin), which allowed tire changes to occur without having to lever the tire and tube off and back on the rim. Given the state of the roads, such repairs were frequent.|$|E
25|$|In March 2001, {{he led the}} cyclist {{portion of}} Oxfam Community Aid Abroad's Walk Against Want Victoria Park Fundraiser. He gave a {{presentation}} {{on the importance of}} planning for cyclists at the PIA 2003 National Congress. In November 2003, he took part in the cycling City to Surf, which fundraised for people in NSW with multiple sclerosis. In February 2004, he launched the new Central Sydney Bicycle map, which shares information on the easiest ways to cycle around Sydney. In May 2005, as part of the Greenhouse Advisory Panel, he advocated for car registration fees to link with <b>engine</b> <b>size,</b> to help people focus on their greenhouse impact and environmental footprint. He agrees with Danish urban planner's blueprint for a better Sydney, commenting in 2007 that pedestrian access should be improved in the heart of Sydney, including marked lanes for cyclists. He had made similar cycle lane commentary in April 2003 for an article about what he would institute if he were City of Sydney's Lord Mayor. For the first day of hosting breakfast for ABC 702, he cycled 4 kilometres to work for his 5:30am shift. He is often spotted around Sydney, pedalling or wearing his bike helmet and cycling clothes.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, NHRA {{continued}} the expansion, increasing to 34 classes in Stock Eliminator and 12 in Super Stock, and also allowing larger <b>engine</b> <b>sizes</b> except in SS/A and SS/AA, which retained the 427 cubic inch limit.|$|R
