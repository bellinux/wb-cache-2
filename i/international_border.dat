To be with her in New York City, Rothenberg journeyed to Canada, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia; traveling from there to Toronto, he lived for a while at Wycliffe College, where he worked briefly as a construction laborer. On 19 November 1948, he crossed the <b>international</b> <b>border</b> into the United States at Buffalo, with $12.00 in his pocket. In 1951, he volunteered for the United States Army, transferred to the Air Force, and served in the Korean War until 1955.

The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an <b>international</b> <b>border.</b> There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

Of these, only the Milk River crosses the <b>international</b> <b>border</b> twice, leaving and then re-entering the United States. Two rivers, the Colorado and the Rio Grande, begin in the United States and flow into or form a border with Mexico. In addition, the drainage basins of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers extend into Canada, and the basin of the Gila River extends into Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Thunderstorm {{activity}} {{near the}} eye soon decreased in coverage, and Lidia began a weakening trend. Because of two troughs, {{one over the}} northern Gulf of California and another over the Southwestern United States, the weakening system began to re-curve northeast. Heading towards mainland Mexico, the hurricane weakened significantly a day after its peak, in which Lidia was only a mid-level Category2 hurricane. Continuing to weaken, Lidia made landfall in Sinaloa at 1800UTC on September13. Shortly after landfall, Hurricane Lidia then accelerated northeastward and then east-northeastward. It weakened to a depression just after crossing the <b>international</b> <b>border</b> with Texas. Tropical Depression Lidia dissipated near Austin on September14. The remnants of the cyclone were absorbed by a cold front.|$|E
5|$|Today, the <b>international</b> <b>border</b> {{is firmly}} {{established}} and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
5|$|As Brazil {{had been}} pacified {{after the end}} of the last {{rebellion}} (the Praieira revolt), Brazil's government turned its attention to the growing tensions with its neighbor to the south, the Argentine Confederation. Paulino Soares, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, decided to forge alliances with Uruguay and Paraguay, nations which also saw a threat in the ambitions of Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation. An army commanded by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. More than a year had passed since Honório Hermeto returned from Pernambuco, when he was named by Paulino Soares as special minister plenipotentiary in the Plata region. On 12 October 1851, Honório Hermeto and an Uruguayan envoy signed a treaty in Rio de Janeiro setting the <b>international</b> <b>border</b> between Brazil and Uruguay. The agreement required Uruguay to abandon some claims to disputed areas in exchange for Brazilian aid in the war against Argentina.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} found that <b>international</b> <b>borders</b> {{represent}} large barriers to trade. But how do <b>international</b> <b>borders</b> compare to domestic border barriers? We investigate <b>international</b> and domestic <b>border</b> barriers in a unified framework. We consider a data set of exports from individual US states to foreign countries and combine it with trade flows between and within US states. After controlling for distance and country size, we estimate that relative to state-to-state trade, crossing an individual US state’s domestic border appears to entail a larger trade barrier than crossing the <b>international</b> US <b>border.</b> Due to the absence of governmental impediments to trade within the United States, this result is surprising. We interpret it as highlighting the concentration of economic activity and trade flows at the local level...|$|R
