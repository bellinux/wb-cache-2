6000|$|It {{sounded very}} pleasant, I {{was obliged to}} admit. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the lady-society already," [...] I added. [...] "One of them came in the same {{carriage}} with me" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By gum! You're right. There ain't {{one of them}} settin' down. 'Pears to me <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them redskins. There's Pipe, sure enough, and Kotoxen. By gum! If there ain't Shingiss; he was {{friendly}} once." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Mason took {{occasion}} once {{to question}} me on what <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> my answers, in especial those relating {{to my knowledge}} of the Bible, surprised him. Others made him sad.|$|R
6000|$|... "I told Miss Emily Moseley, I believe, last evening, that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the name," [...] {{replied the}} gentleman evasively; then pausing a moment, {{he added with}} great emphasis, [...] "there is a {{circumstance}} connected with one of that name, I shall ever remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why!" [...] exclaimed the old negro. [...] "You ain't neber read no hist'ry books. <b>I</b> <b>knows</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> de gentlemen wid Mister Moultrie. Dey ain't no soldiers. Some is fine gentlemen, to be suah, but it's jist foolishness {{to fight}} dat fleet an' army. Marse Gen'l Lee hisself, he done sesso. I heerd him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, after a pause, [...] "I can't {{say that}} I {{have heard of}} them; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the forest was sold, not long ago, and they might have come from Colmar without coming this way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} could stay, and then we could talk over my picture. If only one single picture's a success, it draws {{attention}} to all the others. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> my work is good, if only people could see. And you needn't have been so rude about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have found}} {{out that there is}} {{certainly}} a plot of some sort being got up, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> those concerned in it, but I could hear nothing that went on. Still, I have succeeded better than I expected, and I am well satisfied with the night's work." ...|$|E
5000|$|Richard Maibaum {{had just}} served {{four years in}} the army. He {{returned}} to Paramount, where he had been a screenwriter, and became a producer. He was assigned the job of writing and producing O.S.S. [...] "Every studio in Hollywood was racing to come out with the first OSS film," [...] says Maibaum. [...] "When I was in Washington <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the OSS people so I had a head start on the subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Joan and Lady Maud wrung {{their hands}} in frantic terror. Sybil very pale said [...] "Let me go down; <b>I</b> may <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was almost}} a {{freshman}} when you came up to keep your M.A. term; and as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the men you knew, you kindly, as I well remember, gave me the benefit of it. As John Coleridge's cousin and the acquaintance of John Keate, Cumin, Palmer, and dear James Eiddell, <b>I</b> came to <b>know</b> men whom otherwise I could not have known, and of these how many there still are that I have thought of and cared for ever since! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is {{something}} hazy about your friend Davis's writings. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his publications, and sympathise {{to a very}} considerable extent with him. But I can't be sure that I always understand him: that school has a language of its own, and I am not so far initiated as to follow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} was trying to pick up Americanisms from you; he's always doing it. I keep him away from Americans as much as I can: but he will get at them on the cars and at the hotels. He's always asking them such ridiculous questions, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them just talk {{nonsense}} to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just remember, this ain't settled yet!" [...] {{cried the}} hotel-keeper, to Dave and Roger. [...] "I'm {{going to look}} into it a bit deeper before I make a move, that's all. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> you done it, and I'll have you in prison for it yet, see if I don't!" [...] And he shook his head grimly; and then the covered wagon was turned around, and the three men drove off in the {{direction}} of Oakdale.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the same}} time, Tillery was in rehearsals for the play [...] "Letters From a New England Negro", and the {{producer}} {{sent her a}} cassette tape containing traditional black folk songs obtained from the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution. Of that recording, Tillery said [...] "Even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the songs {{and the sound of}} the music was familiar, I didn't realize there was a source for this…. I loved the music. I felt like I had been reborn".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mean {{to shoot}} him," [...] Rolfe declared. [...] "But he may get shot, for all <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these slaves he's made desperate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're half doin' it now," [...] said 'Manda Grier, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> rooms--two <b>of</b> 'em--where {{we could}} get along first rate, and not cost us much more 'n half what it does here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{know more}} than most women now," [...] {{continued}} Cynthia, triumphantly. [...] "I'm going {{to be such a}} help to you soon--very soon. I've read a lot of history, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution by heart. I know why old Timothy Prescott fought in the Revolution--it was to get rid of kings, wasn't it, and to let the people have a chance? The people can always be trusted to do what is right, can't they, Uncle Jethro?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I am {{not going}} to turn robber, Luka. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the runaways do turn robbers, and murder peasants and travellers. You know some {{of the men in the}} prison boasted of what they had done, but that is not our way. We are honest men though we have been shut up in prison. I am willing to pay for what I want as long as I have money, after that we shall see about it. If these people won't sell we shall find others that will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{did a lot}} for {{her when}} you put me on her trail," [...] {{declared}} Josie, with conviction. [...] "I've a hunch I shall win. I've wired Daddy O'Gorman all about the case, {{but he says he}} can't advise me. In other words, he's watching to see whether I make good or cave in, and I just dare not fail. So keep your courage, Mary Louise, and muster all the confidence you are able to repose in me. I may not know all the tricks of the sleuths, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them. And now I'm off to interview more cabmen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} in the King's cages at Oodeypore, and it is in my stomach that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> little <b>of</b> Man. Very many men would kill thrice in a night for the sake of that one big red stone alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why do {{you talk}} to me about scruples? I wanted money, and I gave powder in exchange. How could <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> your wretched men were going to be blown up? Scruples! Pah!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right, Luke. We'll {{have to put}} {{all such}} {{pictures}} down as freaks of the artist's imagination. But <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>know</b> why <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them are put out--to draw the young fellows into the army and navy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I don't {{know about}} that,' said Mrs. Hackit, {{who had always}} the courage of her opinion, 'but <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> our labourers and stockingers as used never to come to church, come to the cottage, and that's better than never hearing {{anything}} good from week's end to week's end. And there's that Track Society's as Mr. Barton has begun--I've seen more o' the poor people with going tracking, than all the time I've lived in the parish before. And there'd need be something done among 'em; for the drinking at them Benefit Clubs is shameful. There's hardly a steady man or steady woman either, but what's a dissenter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Indian signs--the signs {{they make}} with their hands, and by signal-fires {{at night and}} columns of smoke by day. Buffalo Bill {{taught me how to}} drag wounded {{soldiers}} out of the line of fire with my teeth; and I've done it, too; at least I've dragged HIM out of the battle when he was wounded. And not just once, but twice. Yes, I know a lot of things. I remember forms, and gaits, and faces; and you can't disguise a person that's done me a kindness so that I won't know him thereafter wherever I find him. I know the art of searching for a trail, and I know the stale track from the fresh. I can keep a trail all by myself, with Buffalo Bill asleep in the saddle; ask him--he will tell you so. Many a time, when he has ridden all night, he has said to me at dawn, [...] "Take the watch, Boy; if the trail freshens, call me." [...] Then he goes to sleep. He knows he can trust me, because I have a reputation. A scout horse that has a reputation does not play with it.|$|E
6000|$|That great, comely {{building}} of warm, red brick in Fisherton Street, set well {{back so that}} you can see it as a whole, behind its cedar and beech-trees--how familiar it is to the villagers! In numberless humble homes, in hundreds of villages of the Plain, and all over the surrounding country, the [...] "Infirmary" [...] is a name of the deepest meaning, and a place of many gad and tender and beautiful associations. I heard it spoken of in a manner which surprised me at first, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the London poor and am accustomed to their attitude towards the metropolitan hospitals. The Londoner uses them very freely; they have come to be as necessary to him as the grocer's shop and the public-house, but for all the benefits he receives from them he has no faintest sense of gratitude, and it is my experience that if you speak to him of this he is roused to anger and demands, [...] "What are they for?" [...] So far is he from having any thankful thoughts for all that has been given him for nothing and done for him and for his, if he has anything to say at all on the matter it is to find fault with the hospitals and cast blame on them for not having healed him more quickly or thoroughly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Which is like monkey's allowance, I suppose," [...] {{said the}} traveller, [...] "more kicks than halfpence.--Well--at least I am not {{young enough to}} quarrel with boys for bullying. I'll {{convince}} you, however, Mr. Mowbray, that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> more <b>of</b> your affairs than what you give me credit for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{could not}} think where all the water came from, to keep the brook running so fast all the time. But now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> it has been coming all the time from this bog. Does it all come from bogs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I have earned the reward. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where your son is, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some,</b> at least, <b>of</b> {{those who are}} holding him." ...|$|R
60|$|Clemens had {{appointed}} himself, {{with the}} architect's connivance, a luxurious study over the library {{in his new}} house, but as his children grew older this study, with its carved and cushioned arm-chairs, was given over to them for a school-room, {{and he took the}} room above his stable, which had been intended for his coachman. There we used to talk together, when we were not walking and talking together, until he discovered that he could make a more commodious use of the billiard-room {{at the top of his}} house, for the purposes of literature and friendship. It was pretty cold up there in the early spring and late fall weather with which I chiefly associate the place, but by lighting up all the gas- burners and kindling a reluctant fire on the hearth we could keep it well above freezing. Clemens could also push the balls about, and, without rivalry from me, who could no more play billiards than smoke, could win endless games of pool, while he carried points of argument against imaginable differers in opinion. Here he wrote many of his tales and sketches, and for anything <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his books. I particularly remember his reading me here his first rough sketch of Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven, with the real name of the captain, whom I knew already from his many stories about him.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} frankly," [...] said the Major, [...] "I have my suspicions--I suppose--mind, I only suppose--that in our friend Clavering's a life--who, {{between you and}} me, Captain Strong, we must own about as loose a fish as any in my acquaintance--there are, no doubt, some queer secrets and stories which he {{would not like to}} have known: none of us would. And very likely this fellow, who calls himself Altamont, knows some story against Clavering, and has some hold on him, and gets money out of him on the {{strength}} of his information. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the best men of the best families in England who are paying through the nose in that way. But their private affairs are no business of mine, Mr. Strong; and it is not to be supposed that because I go and dine with a man, I pry into his secrets, or am answerable for all his past life. And so with our friend Clavering, I am most interested for his wife's sake, and her daughter's, who is a most charming creature: and when her ladyship asked me, I looked into her affairs, and tried to set them straight; and shall do so again, you understand, {{to the best of my}} humble power and ability, if I can make myself useful. And if I am called upon--you understand, if I am called upon--and--by the way, this Mr. Altamont, Mr. Strong? How is this Mr. Altamont? I believe you are acquainted with him. Is he in town?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know my sheep.' Surely some of {{the words}} which I have just spoken may help to explain that to you. 'I know my sheep.' Not merely, I know who are my sheep, and who are not. Of course, the Lord does that. We might have guessed that for ourselves. What comfort is there in that? No, he does not say merely, 'I know WHO my sheep are; but I know WHAT my sheep are. I know them; their inmost hearts. I know their sins and their follies: but I know, too, their longing after good. I know their temptations, their excuses, their natural weaknesses, their infirmities, which they brought into the world with them. I know their inmost hearts for good and for evil. True, I think {{some of the}}m often miserable, and poor, and blind, when they fancy {{themselves}} strong, and wise, and rich in grace, and having need of nothing. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them, too, to be longing after what is good, to be hungering and thirsting after righteousness, when they can see nothing but their own sin and weakness, and are utterly ashamed and tired of themselves, and are ready to lie down in despair, and give up all struggling after God. I know their weakness--and of me it is written, 'I will carry the lambs in mine arms.' Those who are innocent and inexperienced in the ways of this world, I will see that they are not led into temptation; and I will gently lead those that are with young: those who are weary with the burden of their own thoughts, those who are yearning and labouring after some higher, better, more free, more orderly, more useful life; those who long to find out the truth, and to speak it, and give birth to the noble thoughts and the good plans which they have conceived: I have inspired their good desires, and I will bring them to good effect; I will gently lead them,' says the Lord, 'for I know them better than they know themselves.' ...|$|E
50|$|As a law {{enforcement}} officer, Cooper confiscated large amounts of illegal narcotics and drug money. Cooper began to notice that people arrested for possession of marijuana were nonviolent and cooperative, in contrast to people intoxicated on alcohol who “… would fight and scream and act crazy.” He also noted being deeply affected by the emotional trauma he witnessed while participating in home narcotics raids with other officers attired in raid gear and “more guns than we would ever need.” Cooper also stated, “We’re sending the kids {{to the department of}} human services, we’re sending the parents to jail over marijuana. Well, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these people and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> they weren’t gangsters. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> they were nonviolent people.” He quit {{law enforcement}} soon after.|$|R
6000|$|If I {{dropped in}} upon {{him in the}} {{afternoon}} I was apt to find him reading the old French poets, or the plays of Calderon, or the 'Divina Commedia', which he magnanimously supposed me much better acquainted with than I was because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>some</b> passages <b>of</b> it by heart. One day I came in quoting ...|$|R
5000|$|He continued: [...] "I {{was part}} and parcel of the {{administration}} during the Asiwaju Bola Tinubu era and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the problems of the state lie.
