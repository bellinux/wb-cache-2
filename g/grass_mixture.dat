The increase in population densities mainly concerned microbivores such as Panagrolaimus, Paraphelenchus, Aphelenchus and Aphelenchoides (950 - 1779 x 10 3 ind. m- 2) followed by omnivores + predators (178 - 296 x 10 3 ind. m- 2), while increase in plant parasite populations was slower (105 - 140 x 10 3 ind. m- 2). The development of nematode assemblages suggests a great role of accumulation of above-ground as well as below-ground litter supporting microflora and microbial feeding fauna in initial stages of meadow restoration.

Phytoremediation by plants and their associated microorganisms is a cost-effective strategy to degrade soil contaminants. In boreal regions the cool climate limits the efficiency of phytoremediation. The planting of oil-tolerant perennial crops, especially legumes, in oil-contaminated soil holds promise for great economic benefits for bioenergy and bio-fertilizer production while accelerating the oil degradation process. We established a multi-year field experiment to study the ecological and agronomic feasibility of phytoremediation by a legume (fodder galega) and a grass (smooth brome) in a boreal climate. In 40 months, soil oil content decreased by 73 %– 92 %, depending on the crop type. The oil degradation followed first-order kinetics with the reduction rates decreasing as follows: bare fallow > galega–brome <b>grass</b> <b>mixture</b> > brome grass > galega. Surprisingly, the presence of oil enhanced crop dry matter and nitrogen yield, particularly in the fourth year.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the influence of beef feedlot manure, tillage and legume <b>grass</b> <b>mixtures</b> on changes in soil quality and nutrient components. The study was initiated in 2006 on an eroded site near Akron, Colorado, on a Norka-Colby very-fine sandy loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic, Aridic, Argiustolls). Tillage treatments were no-tillage, shallow tillage (sweeps operations with V-blade) and deep tillage (DT; moldboard plow operations). In one set of plots, DT was implemented biannually (DT- 2); and in another set the DT was done once at the initiation of the experiment in 2006. Amendments consisted of beef manure and urea (46 - 0 - 0), N fertilizer. Both amendments were added at low and high rates. A control treatment, with no fertilizer or manure added, was included with no-tillage and shallow tillage only. Six years of manure addition and tillage significantly altered soil chemical properties compared with fertilizer and <b>grass</b> legume <b>mixtures.</b> Across all the tillage treatments, at the 0 - 30 cm depth, soil pH from 2006 to 2012, was reduced 1. 8 fold with high-manure compared with high-fertilizer treatment. Soil EC, Na, and SAR increased by 2. 7 fold while soil P increase by 3. 5 fold with high-manure treatment compared with low-manure from 2006 to 2012 across all the tillage treatments at the surface 0 - 30 cm. Soil organic carbon associated with high-manure was 71 % higher than low-manure and 230 % higher than high-fertilizer treatments in the 0 - 60 cm depth. Similar patterns were observed with soil total N. Overall, manure amendments greatly improved the soil nutrient status on this eroded site. However, the legume <b>grass</b> <b>mixtures</b> showed little effect on improving soils chemical properties. The micronutrients supplied by manure improved the soil nutrient status compared with inorganic fertilizer, the grass, and the grass-legume treatments.

Five common grass species which are abundantly available in the area were selected, from which several composite <b>grass</b> <b>mixtures</b> were prepared containing all the five species in varying proportions (from 0. 05 to 0. 35). The n-alkane profile and n-alkane isotopic ratio (13 C/ 12 C) of each grass species and composite <b>grass</b> <b>mixtures</b> were determined by gas chromatography/combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The botanical composition of the composite mixtures was estimated using the n-alkane profile and n-alkane 13 C/ 12 C-ratio of individual species using least squares optimization and linear programming procedures and compared to the actual botanical mixture composition. Three alternative scenarios (inclusion of an additional 0, 5, or 10 of species in addition to those that made up the mixes) and two options where additional botanical species were included were simulated. There was close alignment between estimated and measured botanical compositions with significant relationships (P < 0. 001). The percentage contribution of the species in the simulated pasture mixtures was accurately estimated when the five species making up the grass mixes were used as the only inputs in the calculation. However, when additional botanical species were introduced, the accuracy declined with a significant increase (P = 0. 003) in the mean square error of the prediction. The type of species in the extra inputs did not influence the results. In all scenarios, the combined use of n-alkanes and their d 13 C values improved the linear relationship and reduced (P = 0. 002) the mean square error between estimated and measured botanical compositions. The best fit equation (R 2 = 0. 996, P < 0. 001) was obtained when n-alkanes and their d 13 Cvalues were used together and no extra species was included as input in the calculation.
