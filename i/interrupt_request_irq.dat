50|$|Each {{interrupt}} {{has its own}} interrupt handler. The {{number of}} hardware interrupts {{is limited by the}} number of <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> (<b>IRQ)</b> lines to the processor, but there may be hundreds of different software interrupts. Interrupts are a commonly used technique for computer multitasking, especially in real-time computing. Such a system is said to be interrupt-driven.|$|E
50|$|A {{straightforward}} method of implementing a network driver is {{to interrupt the}} kernel by issuing an <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> (<b>IRQ)</b> for each and every incoming packet. However, servicing IRQs is costly in terms of processor resources and time. Therefore, the straightforward implementation can be very inefficient in high-speed networks, constantly interrupting the kernel with the thousands of packets per second. Overall performance of the system as well as network throughput can suffer as a result.|$|E
50|$|External {{interrupts}} are {{triggered by}} falling/rising edges or high/low potential at the interrupt port, {{leading to an}} <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> (<b>IRQ)</b> in the controller. Hardware interrupts are divided into maskable interrupts and non-maskable interrupts (NMI). The triggering of maskable interrupts can be stopped in some time-critical functions. If an interrupt is called, the current instruction pointer (IP) is saved on the stack, and the stack pointer (SP) is decremented. The address of the interrupt service routine (ISR) is read from the interrupt vector table and loaded to the IP register, and the ISR is executed as a consequence.|$|E

50|$|Fast <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Requests</b> (FIQs) are a {{specialized}} type of <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Request,</b> a standard technique used in computer CPUs {{to deal with}} events which need to be processed as they occur such as receiving data from a network card, or keyboard or mouse actions. FIQs are specific to the ARM CPU architecture, which supports two types of interrupts; FIQs for fast, low latency interrupt handling and <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Requests</b> (<b>IRQs),</b> for more general interrupts.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the above}} code fragment, the MPU will halt upon {{execution}} of [...] {{and go into}} a very low power consumption state. Despite <b>interrupt</b> <b>requests</b> (<b>IRQ)</b> having been disabled prior to the [...] instruction, the MPU will respond to any hardware interrupt while waiting. Upon receipt of an interrupt, the MPU will [...] "awaken" [...] in one clock cycle and resume execution at the instruction immediately following [...] Hence interrupt latency will be very short (70 nanoseconds at 14 megahertz), resulting in the most rapid response possible to an external event.|$|R
5000|$|Hardware {{interrupts}} {{are used}} by devices to communicate that they require attention from the operating system. [...] Internally, hardware interrupts are implemented using electronic alerting signals that are sent to the processor from an external device, which is either {{a part of the}} computer itself, such as a disk controller, or an external peripheral. For example, pressing a key on the keyboard or moving the mouse triggers hardware interrupts that cause the processor to read the keystroke or mouse position. Unlike the software type (described below), hardware interrupts are asynchronous and can occur in the middle of instruction execution, requiring additional care in programming. The act of initiating a hardware interrupt is referred to as an <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> (<b>IRQ).</b>|$|E
30|$|The 3 D {{graphics}} SoC provides two interrupt {{signals that}} represent the GE and RE, respectively, shown {{at the bottom of}} Figure 4. When the interrupt service routine (ISR) in the device driver receives the GE IRQ, this function will pull down the GE <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> (<b>IRQ),</b> and start the RE to continue the operation immediately.|$|E
50|$|In a computer, an <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> (or <b>IRQ)</b> is a {{hardware}} signal {{sent to the}} processor that temporarily stops a running program and allows a special program, an interrupt handler, to run instead. Hardware interrupts are used to handle events such as receiving data from a modem or network card, key presses, or mouse movements.|$|R
50|$|In early IBM-compatible {{personal}} computers, an IRQ {{conflict is}} a once common hardware error, received when two devices {{were trying to}} use the same <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> (or <b>IRQ)</b> to signal an interrupt to the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC). The PIC expects <b>interrupt</b> <b>requests</b> from only one device per line, thus more than one device sending IRQ signals along the same line will generally cause an IRQ conflict that can freeze a computer.|$|R
40|$|The Real-Time Interferometer Control Systems Testbed (RICST) timing {{board is}} a VersaModule Eurocard (VME) -based board that can {{generate}} up to 16 simultaneous, phase-locked timing signals {{at a rate}} defined by the user. It can also generate all seven VME <b>interrupt</b> <b>requests</b> (<b>IRQs).</b> The RICST timing board is suitable mainly for robotic, aerospace, and real-time applications. Several circuit boards on the market are capable of generating periodic IRQs. Most are associated with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and Inter Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) time-code generators, whereas this board uses either an internal VME clock or an externally generated clock signal to synchronize multiple components of the system. The primary advantage of this board {{is that there is}} no discernible jitter in the output clock waveforms because the signals are divided down from a high-frequency clock signal instead of being phase-locked from a lower frequency. The primary disadvantage to this board, relative to other periodic-IRQ-generating boards, is that it is more difficult to synchronize the system to wall clock time...|$|R
50|$|Within a micro {{instruction}} execution cycle, the CPU {{as well as}} an input / output controller is connected to an external 16 kByte huge random access memory device (RAM). Via the input-output controller device, communication with virtual input and output devices is supported by Direct Memory Access mode (DMA), Inter-Integrated Circuit Connection (I2C), and <b>Interrupt</b> <b>request</b> functionality (<b>IRQ).</b> A output port, a display, a timer, an event trigger, a digital-analog converter, a keyboard and data input / output channel is provided as virtual IC device for explaining didactically the communication with external devices.|$|R
50|$|An <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Request</b> Level (IRQL) is a {{hardware}} independent means with which Windows prioritizes interrupts {{that come from}} the system's processors. On processor architectures which Windows runs on, hardware generates signals which are sent to an interrupt controller. The interrupt controller sends an <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> (or <b>IRQ)</b> to the CPU with a certain priority level, and the CPU sets a mask which causes any other interrupts with a lower priority {{to be put into}} a pending state, until the CPU releases control back to the interrupt controller. If a signal comes in at a higher priority, then the current interrupt will be put into a pending state, the CPU sets the interrupt mask to the priority and places any interrupts with a lower priority into a pending state until the CPU finishes handling the new, higher priority interrupt.|$|R

50|$|The main signal pins on an 8259 are as follows: eight <b>{{interrupt}}</b> input <b>request</b> lines named IRQ0 through IRQ7, an <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> {{output line}} named INTR, interrupt acknowledgment line named INTA, D0 through D7 for communicating the interrupt level or vector offset. Other connections include CAS0 through CAS2 for cascading between 8259s.|$|R

50|$|On the PC, the BIOS (and thus also DOS) {{traditionally}} maps {{the master}} 8259 <b>interrupt</b> <b>requests</b> (IRQ0-IRQ7) to <b>interrupt</b> vector offset 8 (INT08-INT0F) and the slave 8259 (in PC/AT and later) <b>interrupt</b> <b>requests</b> (IRQ8-IRQ15) to <b>interrupt</b> vector offset 112 (INT70-INT77). This was done despite the first 32 (INT00-INT1F) interrupt vectors being reserved by the processor for internal exceptions (this was ignored {{for the design}} of the PC for some reason). Because of the reserved vectors for exceptions most other operating systems map (at least the master) 8259 IRQs (if used on a platform) to another interrupt vector base offset.|$|R
50|$|PICs {{typically}} {{have a common}} set of registers: <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Request</b> Register (IRR), In-Service Register (ISR), Interrupt Mask Register (IMR). The IRR specifies which interrupts are pending acknowledgement, and is typically a symbolic register which can not be directly accessed. The ISR register specifies which interrupts have been acknowledged, but are still waiting for an End Of Interrupt (EOI). The IMR specifies which interrupts are to be ignored and not acknowledged. A simple register schema such as this allows up to two distinct <b>interrupt</b> <b>requests</b> to be outstanding at one time, one waiting for acknowledgement, and one waiting for EOI.|$|R

50|$|VME also decodes {{all seven}} of the 68000's {{interrupt}} levels onto a 7-pin interrupt bus. The interrupt scheme is one of prioritized vectored <b>interrupts.</b> The <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> lines (IRQ1 - IRQ7) prioritize interrupts. An interrupting module asserts one of the <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> lines. Any module on the bus may potentially handleany interrupt. When an interrupt handling module recognizes an <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> at a priority it handles, it arbitrates for the bus in the usual fashion described above. It then performs a read of the interrupt vector by driving the binary version of the IRQ line it handles (e.g. if IRQ5 is being handled, then binary 101) onto the address bus. It also asserts the IACK line, along with the appropriate data transfer strobes for {{the width of the}} status/ID being read. Again, LWORD*, DS0* and DS1* allow status/ID read cycles to be 8, 16, or 32 bit wide transfers but most existing hardware interrupters use 8 bit status/IDs. The interrupter responds by transferring a status/ID on the data bus to describe the interrupt. The interrupt handling module (usually a CPU) will usually use this status/ID number to identify and run the appropriate software interrupt service routine.|$|R
5000|$|... 3. INTR (<b>Interrupt</b> <b>request)</b> - It is an output that <b>requests</b> an <b>interrupt.</b> The INTR pin {{becomes a}} logic 1 when the STB input returns to a logic 1, and is cleared when {{the data are}} input from the port by the microprocessor.|$|R

5000|$|When the Caps Lock key is {{repeatedly}} pressed approx. 10 times, the Caps Lock LED {{turning on}} and off each time indicates the CPU is correctly reading the CIAs. If the Caps Lock LED sticks on or off, the CPU is not servicing CIA <b>interrupt</b> <b>requests.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{hardware}} interrupt system supports a 4-bit interrupt priority input, which {{needed to be}} higher than the priority level stored in the status register (bits 12-15) in order for the <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> to be served. In addition, the /LOAD input provides a non-maskable interrupt facility with a dedicated vector.|$|R
50|$|The {{interrupt}} {{priority level}} (IPL) {{is a part of}} the current system interrupt state, which indicates the <b>interrupt</b> <b>requests</b> that will currently be accepted. The IPL may be indicated in hardware by the registers in a Programmable Interrupt Controller, or in software by a bitmask or integer value.|$|R
5000|$|Level-triggered {{interrupt}} {{is favored}} by some {{because it is}} easy to share the <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> line without losing the interrupts, when multiple shared devices interrupt at the same time. Upon detecting assertion of the interrupt line, the CPU must search through the devices sharing the <b>interrupt</b> <b>request</b> line until one who triggered the interrupt is detected. After servicing this device, the CPU may recheck the interrupt line status to determine whether any other devices also needs service. If the line is now de-asserted, the CPU avoids checking the remaining devices on the line. Since some devices interrupt more frequently than others, and other device interrupts are particularly expensive, a careful ordering of device checks is employed to increase efficiency. The original PCI standard mandated level-triggered interrupts because of this advantage of sharing interrupts.|$|R
