5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the chapel was {{extensively}} restored {{with the assistance}} of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a Fellow, was put back in place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel. The Chaplain is Rev Dr Robert Tobin and the Senior Organ Scholar for 2010-11 was Edwin Lock. At that time David Maw was appointed Director of Chapel Music.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat has {{two large}} and {{remarkable}} churches from the Middle Ages. St. Faith's Church {{is the oldest}} and {{a prime example of}} Romanesque architecture. Its design is related to similar buildings both in the Rhine region and in Lorraine. It was built {{during the second half of}} the 12th century to replace an earlier building. The church was renovated in the 19th century and a medieval death mask was found <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>work.</b> It is often attributed to Hildegard of Eguisheim, founder of the church, and is now displayed in a crypt.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the Royal Mail built a mail {{conveyor}} {{at the northern}} end of the station, with significant aesthetic impact. This was out of use for many years following the transfer of Royal Mail's activities to the West of England Mail Centre at Filton and the opening of the short-lived Railnet Hub next to Bristol Parkway station in May 2000. It was finally dismantled in stages and removed between October and December 2014. In 1990/91, £2 million was spent by InterCity on a renovation of the main train shed and another £7 million on restoring some of the older areas of the station, including the refurbishment of the subway and construction of new retail outlets. The shorter of the two 1935 platform islands had been used only for parcels traffic since the 1960s but was temporarily brought back into passenger use <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>work.</b> It was fully restored for passenger use in 2001.|$|E
25|$|The first-built {{section of}} the M5, from Junctions 4 to 8, was widened to provide six lanes (three lanes in each direction) in the early 1990s. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> the {{northbound}} Strensham services was rebuilt further away from the new junction. Junctions 7 and 8 were also remodelled into a roundabout junction.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur's {{later work}} on {{diseases}} included work on chicken cholera. He received cultures from Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint, and cultivated them in chicken broth. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> {{a culture of}} the responsible bacteria had spoiled and failed to induce the disease in some chickens he was infecting with the disease. Upon reusing these healthy chickens, Pasteur discovered he could not infect them, even with fresh bacteria; the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become immune to the disease, though they had caused only mild symptoms.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} {{original}} bells, two 14th-century and one 17th-century; {{there was a}} fourth bell which had disappeared. For many years the ancient wooden bell frame had been unsafe for ringing, although the tenor bell could be tolled. In 1984 the tower was strengthened to hold a new metal bell frame and the three old bells were re-hung and augmented to a ring of six {{by the addition of}} three lighter bells. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> one of the old bells (now the 5th) which was cracked was repaired by welding.|$|E
25|$|After a year spent laid up, Centurion began a Great Repair at Woolwich in December 1784, {{which was}} {{completed}} in December 1787. She returned to active service in February 1789, as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Philip Affleck, with William Otway as her captain. Otway sailed her to Jamaica in May 1789, returning to Britain in August 1792, where she underwent another repair and refit, this time at Chatham. She was recommissioned <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> in November 1792, under Captain Samuel Osborn.

25|$|Since 15 August 1914 the Fort de Loncin {{has been}} treated as a war grave and place of remembrance. Of the more than 300 dead, the {{majority}} remain buried in the wreckage. The remains that have been recovered from the fort have been re-interred in a crypt {{at the head of}} the fort. The continuing presence of unexploded munitions was judged by the Belgian army in 2003 to be a potential hazard. In October 2007, after a project of mine and explosives clearance, 2,500 shells, representing 142 tons of munitions, were extracted. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> 25 bodies were discovered, of which four were identified.

25|$|Milstein {{was born}} in Bahía Blanca, Argentina. His parents were Máxima (Vapniarsky) and Lázaro Milstein, a Jewish Ukrainian immigrant. He {{graduated}} from the University of Buenos Aires and obtained a PhD under Professor Stoppani (Professor of Biochemistry). In 1956 he received an award from the Sociedad Bioquímica Argentina {{for his work on}} kinetic studies with the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the British Council, he joined the Biochemistry Department at the University of Cambridge at Darwin College to work for a PhD under Malcolm Dixon on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> he collaborated with Frederick Sanger whose group he joined with a short-term Medical Research Council appointment.|$|E
25|$|Scholarly {{research}} on these vases started {{especially in the}} 19th century. Since this time the suspicion has intensified that these vases have a Greek rather than an Etruscan origin. Especially a Panathenaic prize amphora found by Edward Dodwell in 1819 in Athens provided evidence. The first to present a proof was Gustav Kramer in his work Styl und Herkunft der bemalten griechischen Tongefäße (1837). However it took several years for this insight to be generally accepted. Eduard Gerhard published an article entitled Rapporto Volcente in the Annali dell’Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica in which he systematically investigated the vases; {{he was the first}} scholar to do so. Toward this end in 1830 he studied vases found in Tarquinia, comparing them, for example, with vases found in Attica and Aegina. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> he identified 31 painter and potter signatures. Previously, only the potter Taleides was known.|$|E
25|$|The wreck {{is rapidly}} {{disintegrating}} due to natural rusting. The dive boats {{that rely on}} the wreck for their livelihood are also tearing the wreck apart by mooring the boats to weak parts of the wreck, leading to parts of the wreck collapsing. For this reason, in December 2007 the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA) a non-governmental organisation installed 32 permanent mooring buoys and drilled holes in the wreck to allow trapped air to escape. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> the vessel was closed off to recreational diving. However, as of 2009, none of these moorings remain as the blocks themselves were too light (resulting in ships dragging them), and the lines connecting the moorings to the wreck were too long (meaning with the strong currents in the area, people would find it impossible to transfer from the mooring to the actual wreck). As a result, all boats now moor off directly to the wreck again.|$|E

25|$|The Columbia River {{was reached}} on 22 March 1811, but its {{dangerous}} bar posed a major problem. Thorn sent five {{men in a}} boat to attempt to locate the channel, but the rough surf capsized the vessel and its crew was lost. Two days later another attempt by an additional small boat also sank. Of the five crew members, which included two Hawaiian Kanakas, only an American and a Hawaiian survived. In total eight men died attempting to find a safe route past the Columbia Bar. Finally, on March 24, the Tonquin crossed into the Columbia’s estuary and laid anchor in Baker’s Bay. The personnel then proceeded fifteen miles up the river to present-day Astoria, Oregon, where they spent two months laboring to establish Fort Astoria. Some trade goods and other materials that composed the cargo were transferred to the new trading post. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> small transactions with curious Chinookan Clatsop people occurred.|$|E
25|$|<b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> {{half the}} Tudor palace was {{replaced}} and Henry VIII's state rooms and private apartments were both lost; the new wings around the Fountain Court contained new state apartments and private rooms, one {{set for the}} King {{and one for the}} Queen. Each suite of state rooms was accessed by a state staircase. The royal suites were of completely equal value in order to reflect William and Mary's unique status as joint sovereigns. The King's Apartments face south over the Privy Garden, the Queen's east over the Fountain Garden. The suites are linked by a gallery running the length of the east façade, another reference to Versailles, where the King and Queen's apartments are linked by the Galerie des Glaces. However, at Hampton Court the linking gallery is of more modest proportions and decoration. The King's staircase was decorated with frescos by Antonio Verrio and delicate ironwork by Jean Tijou. Other artists commissioned to decorate the rooms included Grinling Gibbons, Sir James Thornhill and Jacques Rousseau; furnishings were designed by Daniel Marot.|$|E
25|$|The land {{on which}} Lord's was built was {{originally}} near a duck pond on a hill in St. John's Wood. It was leased by Thomas Lord following a request from George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea to find a location where cricket could be played in relative privacy. Lord's was built around the slope and was enclosed by stands. In the 21st century, there were calls for the slope to be levelled {{as a result of}} the advent of drop-in pitches. Smaller ridges in the pitch had previously been removed by surveyors. However, the Marylebone Cricket Club rejected these calls stating that removal of the slope would require rebuilding of Lord's and would mean that the ground would be unable to host Test cricket for 5 years as the new pitch would need time to mature after the levelling. In 2002, the Lord's outfield was replaced and drainage installed. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> several small deviations in the pitch were removed, but the slope remained. During the 2012 Summer Olympics, when Lord's hosted the Archery tournament, there were suggestions that the slope would affect the archers. However, British archer Alison Williamson rejected this, stating that the slope was barely noticeable.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Moscow, Lissitzky {{attended}} the Polytechnic Institute of Riga, which had been evacuated to Moscow because of the war, and worked for the architectural firms of Boris Velikovsky and Roman Klein. [...] <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>work,</b> he took an active and passionate interest in Jewish culture which, after {{the downfall of the}} openly antisemitic Tsarist regime, was experiencing a renaissance. The new Provisional Government repealed a decree that prohibited the printing of Hebrew letters and that barred Jews from citizenship. Thus Lissitzky soon devoted himself to Jewish art, exhibiting works by local Jewish artists, traveling to Mahilyow to study the traditional architecture and ornaments of old synagogues, and illustrating many Yiddish children's books. These books were Lissitzky's first major foray in book design, a field that he would greatly innovate during his career.|$|E
