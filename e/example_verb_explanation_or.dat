40|$|This {{research}} {{examined in}} 26 undergraduate students a form ofinstructional control of certain emergent relations definitional of thestimulus-equivalence relationship. The subjects read 2 pages thatexplained a paper-and-pencil match-to-sample procedure, and thenwent on to solve 11 more pages of matching-to-sample problems.

50|$|A lexical rule is {{in a form}} of {{syntactic}} rule used within many {{theories of}} natural language syntax. These rules alter the argument structures of lexical items (for <b>example</b> <b>verbs</b> and declensions) in order to alter their combinatory properties.|$|R

5000|$|...Suffixes {{appear at}} the ends of words. There are {{numerous}} suffixes in Sesotho serving varied functions. For <b>example,</b> <b>verbs</b> may be derived from other verbs through the employment of several verbal suffixes. Diminutives, augmentatives, and locatives may all be derived from nouns through the use of several suffixes. Most suffixes, except the noun locative suffix and verb inflexional suffixes, are derivational and create new stems.|$|R

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the unaccusative/unergative {{split in}} intransitive verbs {{can be characterized}} semantically. Unaccusative verbs tend to express a telic and dynamic change of state or location, while unergative verbs tend to express an agentive activity (not involving directed movement). While these properties define the [...] "core" [...] classes of unaccusatives and unergatives, there are intermediate classes of verbs whose status is less clear (for <b>example,</b> <b>verbs</b> of existence, appearance, or continuation, verbs denoting uncontrolled processes, or motion verbs).|$|R
5000|$|The terms verb framing and {{satellite}} framing are {{not restricted to}} Romance and Germanic languages, respectively. Many languages can be {{assigned to one of}} the two systems. For <b>example,</b> <b>verb</b> framing is used in Turkish, Hebrew and Arabic. (In the latter, dakhala rākiḍan means [...] "he entered running", with the perfect form dakhala meaning [...] "he entered" [...] and the participle rākiḍan meaning [...] "running".) Satellite framing is common in Greek. Some languages use both strategies.|$|R
