5|$|Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} minor traces of Punic-Phoenician and Romano-Italian influence, the Delian mosaics {{generally}} {{conform to the}} major trends found in Hellenistic art. The same wealthy patrons who commissioned paintings and sculptures at Delos may have also been involved in hiring mosaic artists from abroad. Delian mosaics share certain characteristics with mosaics {{in other parts of}} the Greek world, such as Macedonian mosaics in Pella. They also share some attributes with Greek painting traditions and often employ a similar black-background technique found in red-figure pottery of the Classical period. Some of the styles and techniques used at Delos were later found in Roman art and mosaics, although contemporary Roman <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> Pompeii, for instance, reveal significant differences in the production and design of mosaics in the western versus eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E

5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E
5|$|As a teacher, Sudirman {{taught his}} {{students}} lessons on morality using <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> {{the lives of}} the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.|$|E
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> the Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while {{two have been}} left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, the Nehru Commission {{composing}} {{of representatives}} of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for dominion status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for {{religious and ethnic}} minorities, and limit {{the powers of the}} government. In 1931, the Indian National Congress (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> the constitution of the erstwhile USSR, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.|$|E
5|$|In {{defense of}} the text's authenticity, Ariel Shisha-Halevy, Professor of Linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading expert on Coptic language, {{concluded}} that the language itself offered no evidence of forgery. King also found <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> a new discovery in Egypt that has {{the same kind of}} grammar, showing that at least one unusual case is not unique. While some experts continue to disagree about the other case, King notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language.|$|E
5|$|In {{mapping the}} {{distribution}} of Mari Lwyd appearances, Cawte noted that it was principally a custom associated with Glamorgan, with two-thirds of instances falling within that county. The custom stretched east into the industrial valleys of Monmouthshire, with the most easterly account coming from Monmouth itself; this account {{is also one of}} the earliest. A number of examples were also found in Carmarthenshire, with a single example found in both Brecknockshire and Ceredigion. There is a single record of the custom being performed in North Wales, in an example from Wrexham, which Cawte believed was the result of a Glamorgan man bringing the custom with him as he moved north. Previously, Peate had cautioned that the comparative absence of recorded <b>examples</b> <b>from</b> Mid and North Wales was not proof that the Mari Lwyd custom had never been present in those areas.|$|E
