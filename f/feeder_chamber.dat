40|$|The Lac des Iles Complex {{contains}} the Roby, Twilight, and High-grade zones, {{which make up}} Canada’s only primary platinum-group element (PGE) ore deposit with a grade of 3 ppm Pd + Pt. The ores have remarkably high Pd/Pt ratios, averaging 7 in the Roby and Twilight zones and even higher, 14, in the High-grade zone. In contrast most PGE-dominated deposits have Pd/Pt ratios of 0. 5 to 3. The Lac des Iles ore zones occur within a small (2 ×y 3. 5 km) concentrically zoned mafic intrusion and are approximately 0. 5 km wide by 1 km long at surface. There are three major rock types present, gabbronorite, metagabbronorite, and chlorite-actinolite schist. The Roby and Twilight zones consist of magmatic breccia of gabbronorite or metagabbronorite, which contains pegmatoidal and varitextured patches. The gabbronorites have adcumulate textures and consist of deformed plagioclase and orthopyroxene with minor interstitial clinopyroxene, biotite, and hornblende. In the metagabbronorites the pyroxenes and hornblende {{have been replaced by}} actinolite and the plagioclase has been partly altered to sericite. In the most altered metagabbronorites the plagioclase has been replaced by chlorite. The High-grade zone occurs between the breccia of the Roby zone and the homogeneous East Gabbro. The main rock type is actinolite-chlorite ± talc schist. Three sulfide assemblages are present: (1) pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite ± pyrite; (2) pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite; and (3) chalcopyrite, pyrite, and millerite. Assemblage (1) is present in all rock types and shows equilibrium textures in the fresh rocks. Assemblages (2) and (3) are present only in the metagabbronorite and chlorite-actinolite schist and show disequilibrium textures. Pentlandite is an important host for Pd in assemblages (1) and (2), the other important hosts for Pd in these assemblages are Pd tellurides. In assemblage (3) the Pd is found {{in a wide variety of}} platinum-group minerals (PGM); Pd tellurides, Pd sulfides, Pd antinomides, and Pd arsenides. The PGM in assemblages (1) and (2) are found in association with the sulfides, while in assemblage (3) they are found as isolated grains. Whole-rock geochemistry shows that the most of the rocks no matter what their texture or degree of alteration have similar compositions. Most compositions fall on plagioclase-orthopyroxene tie lines. Mantle-normalized patterns show that the rare earth element (REE) and high field strength element (HFSE) concentrations are low (0. 8 − 2 times mantle) and similar. In this flat pattern there are positive Sr, Eu, Pb, and Sc anomalies. These observations are consistent with the rocks being plagioclase-orthopyroxene adcumulates. A small group of metagabbronorite and schist samples show MgO, CaO, and Cr enrichment, indicating the presence of some cumulate olivine, clinopyroxene, and/or chromite. The rocks no matter what their texture or degree of alteration have similar incompatible element ratios, indicating that they all are comagmatic. The low normative clinopyroxene concentrations and the low HFSE content of these rocks suggest that there is very little trapped liquid component present. This observation appears to be in contradiction to the field appearance of the magmatic breccia which indicates the matrix represents a frozen magma. We suggest that the magma chamber was being deformed at the time of intrusion and the fractionated liquid was squeezed out of both the matrix and fragments during this process. The formation of pegmatite and varitextured rocks could have occurred when the magma became fluid saturated and this fluid infiltrated the partially consolidated gabbronorite causing recrystallization. The composition of the varitextured and pegmatiodal rocks is similar to that of the other rocks and thus the fluid did not appreciably change the composition of the recrystallized rocks. Processes that have been considered for forming the ores include: collection by a sulfide liquid from a silicate magma; zone refining of the sulfides during repeated injections of magmas; and collection of the metals by deuteric or hydrothermal fluids. For samples from the Twilight and Roby zones there is a strong correlation between S, Cu, and PGE, indicating that sulfide minerals control the PGE and thus collection by a sulfide liquid could have occurred. However the high Pd/Pt ratio of the ores suggests that the sulfide liquid did not segregate from a primary mafic magma. Possibly, there was a <b>feeder</b> <b>chamber</b> to the Lac des Iles intrusion. The magma in the feeder system became saturated in sulfide liquid and this collected and crystallized in a structural trap between chambers. A fresh injection of S-undersaturated magma from the lower chamber partially melted the sulfides, enriching the magma in S, Cu, Pd, and Au. The Pd-enriched magma was then injected into the Lac des Iles chamber, mixed with the partially consolidated resident magma, and Pd-rich sulfides segregated from it. In the High-grade zone there appears to have been an additionally low temperature process that added Pd, Au, As, and Sb to these rocks. Possibly these elements were added by a fluid that exsolved from the magma in underlying magma chamber and which scavenged the elements from the sulfides formed at depth. The fluid was focussed in the shear zone between the East Gabbro and the Roby zone because most of the Lac des Iles intrusion had solidified at this point...|$|E
40|$|Field and U-Pb zircon geochronological {{studies in}} {{a suite of}} crosscutting, deformed, and metamorphosed basic dykes show that they were emplaced in a syndeformational {{environment}} between 1328 ± 2 and 1316. 5 ± 1. 6 Ma. Earlier dykes in the suite are granulitic, commonly folded along north-south axes or strongly rotated into north-south-trending shear zones. Later dykes are metamorphosed to amphibolite grade. These sometimes retain igneous porphyritic textures and occasionally crosscut the granulite dykes. The amphibolite dykes were emplaced in a less ductile crustal environment and a structural environment less dominated by shear deformation. Both granulitic {{and to a lesser}} extent amphibolite dykes show evidence of synshear emplacement. The episode of emplacement is broadly coeval with the injection of the mid-Proterozoic Nain Plutonic Suite (NPS) and suggests that the dykes were injected as a series of leaks from NPS <b>feeder</b> <b>chambers.</b> If so, the granulite dykes may represent leaks intruded near the culmination of NPS activity, whereas the amphibolite dykes were probably injected during the waning phase of tectono-thermal conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The giant {{plagioclase}} basalts (GPBs) with plagioclase phenocrysts {{that reach}} up to 3 cm in length are found near Ja-balpur {{in the northeastern}} part of the Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP). The thickness of the basalt flow (flow 6) that contains the GPBs is ~ 20 m. Plagioclase phenocysts (An 58 - An 64) in the GPBs display many features of magma mixing (e. g., resorption, reverse zoning). Of the nine flows in the Jabalpur section, the GPBs (flow 6) with lowest Mg#s (38 - 43) and MgO (4. 16 - 5. 08 wt%), Ni and Cr abundances are the most evolved compositions. In addition, these GPBs have highest abundances of incompatible elements (TiO 2, P 2 O 5, Nb, Zr, Sr and Ba). The GPBs are compositionally similar to the well-studied Mahabaleshwar lavas of the western DVP. This new occurrence of GPBs has implications for existence of local crustal magma <b>chambers,</b> <b>feeders</b> and vents in the northeastern part of the DVP...|$|R
40|$|The Voisey's Bay troctolite {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} members of the Nain Plutonic Suite (NPS), and hosts the Voisey's Bay Ni-Cu-Co deposits. This study {{involves}} detailed mineralogy, geochemistry and oxygen isotope chemistry of the Voisey's Bay Complex (VBC) <b>chamber,</b> <b>feeder</b> and marginal rocks to determine: (1) the geochemical-isotopic fingerprint of biotite in troctolite, and (2) the composition of chilled margins on troctolite as indicators of parental magma composition and of the role of contaminants within the VBI. There are variations in the Ni and F contents of biotite in <b>chamber</b> versus <b>feeder</b> rocks as determined via electron microprobe analysis. Oxygen isotope analyses of biotite separates indicate that δ¹⁸O ratios of biotite in the Western Deeps and Mushuau intrusions are enriched relative to the mantle water value of 5. 7 ‰, whereas ratios of biotite in the Eastern Deeps, Discovery Hill and Ovoid are depleted. Gabbronorite chilled margins are present in three settings within the VBI, and formed when hot magma quenched against country rock. Several chilled margins show evidence of country rock contamination, however, three chilled margin samples represent uncontaminted mafic magma parental to the VBI. The geochemical variations seen in biotite and chilled margins can be explained by a multiple-stage emplacement history that included at least two distinct mega-pulses of magma...|$|R
