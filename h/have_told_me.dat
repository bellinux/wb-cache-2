500|$|In 2011, {{readers of}} Rolling Stone {{magazine}} voted Starr as the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Journalist Robyn Flans, {{writing for the}} Percussive Arts Society, stated: [...] "I cannot {{count the number of}} drummers who <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that Ringo inspired their passion for drums". Drummer Steve Smith commented on Starr's musical contribution: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Harrison sings {{of how he}} values Dylan's friendship, {{together}} with [...] "the tales you <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> / From {{the things that you}} saw". For much of his career, Harrison repeatedly identified Dylan as one of his biggest musical influences, along with Ravi Shankar. To Inglis, these verse-two lines reflect the level of Harrison's respect for his work, since [...] "while millions of others may look to the Beatles for guidance, he looks to Dylan".|$|E
500|$|After he had cut Blakelock, Hill said, Silcott {{told him}} he was cool and asked what he had seen. Hill said he replied, [...] "Nothing," [...] and that Silcott said, [...] "Well, you can go." [...] He said the aim of the attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick. In 1991, he told Rose that, {{throughout}} the interview, the police were saying, [...] "Go on, admit it, you had a stab," [...] and [...] "It was Sticks, wasn't it?" [...] He said they threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks and said he would never see his family again. [...] "They could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was Prince Charles and I would have said it was him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Christian, {{touching}} the open Bible, [...] "God's book <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> It <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> more than that. It <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> there is forgiveness for {{the chief of}} sinners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I've heard lots about you!" [...] said Addie Barrow. [...] "Nellie <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> great, long {{stories about}} Tom's bravery, and Grace <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all about Sam's doings, {{and both of}} them <b>have</b> <b>told</b> about you, Dick----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{very little}} with him. I mean with Gaston. But it's not he that <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> most--it's Mme. de Brecourt.

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided {{the grieving}} process. He commented, [...] "you {{have to get}} back on the horse. You could easily let a decade go by and not do anything. I'm happy to have walked away with my life after the {{situation}} I was thrown into. But, I mean, what do you do? I'm a musician. I'm going to make music. What Dime would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that's what I did." [...] Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo made the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" [...] in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer. He denied making the comments and apologized, although Abbott requested Metal Hammer to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said. Abbott found the quote authentic and referred to him as the [...] "master of lies".|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] I begged. [...] "Oh, don't. Ray <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> his story. He {{has made}} me his confidant. He <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how unhappy he has been, and how he loves you. Oh, Lady Angela, what is there I can say? What can I do?" ...|$|R

500|$|In 2003, Zito {{started off}} with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 {{straight}} games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, [...] "I got the feeling he made it look pretty easy. When he {{has that kind of}} command, you can see what happens." [...] Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, [...] "If you'd <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny." [...] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E
500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E

500|$|The adult {{interest}} in the show is {{comparable to that of}} The Magic Roundabout, Tiny Toon Adventures, Rocko's Modern Life, Animaniacs, Dexters Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob SquarePants, Yo Gabba Gabba!, and Phineas and Ferb: older audiences appreciate jokes aimed at adult viewers and a sense of nostalgia for older cartoons and animated films. Many of the aforementioned shows had attracted college-aged fans who, when Friendship Is Magic was airing, would be raising children of their own. The show references works that older viewers would recognize, such as I Love Lucy, The Benny Hill Show, X-Men, , Diamond Dogs, The Big Lebowski, The Avengers, Star Wars, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Most of these fans are surprised by their fondness for the show. Shaun Scotellaro, operator of Equestria Daily, one of the main fan websites for the show, said, [...] "Honestly, if someone were to <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I'd be writing a pony blog seven months ago, I would have called them insane." [...] He commented that the spread among adults was accelerated by its presence in online gaming. Mike Fahey, an editor for the gaming website Kotaku, noted that the fandom was [...] "building friendships among a diverse group of people that otherwise might have just sat {{on either side of the}} Internet, flinging insults at each other". Dr. Patrick Edwards, who performed several [...] "Brony Studies" [...] to survey and analyze the fandom, observed that the brony fandom is unlike most other fandoms which [...] "aren't welcoming to people who are different", and promote the show's message of love and tolerance. [...] Further interest came from the furry community, which includes a large number of animation fans. One contributor to [...] "The Brony Study" [...] (below), Dr. Marsha Redden said that the adult fans are [...] "a reaction to the US having been engrossed in terrorism for past ten years" [...] in a manner similar to the Cold War, and are [...] "tired of being afraid, tired of angst and animosity"; the show and its fandom are outlets from those strifes. She compared the brony fandom to that of the bohemian and beatniks after World War II and of the hippies after the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, Amy Keating Rogers, one of the show's writers, believes that the fans have come to like Friendship Is Magic due to [...] "so much cynicism and negativity out there in so many [...] shows", while the show [...] "has such a positive message" [...] that counters this.|$|E
