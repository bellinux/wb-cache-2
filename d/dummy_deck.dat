2500|$|On 17 October 1949, {{the third}} prototype, VP422, made its maiden flight. Being {{representative}} of the subsequent production aircraft, VP422 incorporated a number of modifications {{as a result of}} the experiences gained from trials with the second prototype, these alterations included the fitting of a longer arrester hook when a number of [...] "bolters" [...] were experienced during the early <b>dummy</b> <b>deck</b> trials. After the longer hook was incorporated, this modification was carried though the remaining production runs. Other changes included the addition of fixtures for rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) and hard points plumbed for external drop tanks. On 22 November 1949, Hawker received an initial production contract for 151 aircraft, the aircraft also received the name Sea Hawk at this point. Throughout 1950, both VP413 and VP422 were used to conduct preliminary service trials.|$|E

40|$|Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong is {{the longest}} {{suspension}} bridge in the world carrying both highway and railway. It has two H-shape concrete towers, {{each of which is}} composed of two reinforced concrete legs and four deep transverse prestressed concrete beams. A series of wind tunnel tests have been performed to measure the aerodynamic coefficients of the tower legs and transverse beams in various arrangements. A 1 : 100 scaled 3 D rigid model of the full bridge tower assembled from various tower components has been constructed for different test cases. The aerodynamic coefficients of the lower and upper segments of the windward and leeward tower legs and those of the transverse beams at different levels, with and without the <b>dummy</b> bridge <b>deck</b> model, were measured as a function of yaw wind angle. The effects of wind interference among the tower components and the influence of the bridge deck on the tower aerodynamic coefficients were also investigated. The results achieved can be used as the pertinent data for the comparison of the computed and field-measured fully coupled buffeting responses of the entire bridge under yaw winds.

5000|$|The {{main part}} of the land (355 acres) was {{purchased}} in August 1941, after which building of the airfield and the marsh lane accommodation site commenced, it was commissioned on 1 April 1943 as HMS Dipper, principally as number 2 naval fighter school, on 11 September 1942, another 18 acres was acquired at the adjoining gibbs marsh area for an aircraft repair and maintenance site. The design and lay-out of the airfield was quite unique, having 5 runways, 2 of these being east west lay-out (07-25) both 1000 yards long, the northern runway incorporated a <b>dummy</b> <b>deck</b> landing strip, complete with under-ground arresting gear with four above ground arrestor wires, which was a duplicate of that installed on HMS Implacable for training of aircraft carrier landings, these mainly being carried out with the Seafire, a naval version of the spitfire with folding wings.The site also had its own cinema and stage hall ...|$|E
5000|$|March 1952 the {{airfield}} became inactive and was placed under care and maintenance, during 1953 Air whaling (now Bristow group) used the facilities for repairs to the whaling fleet of helicopters until moving out in June 1958.June 1957 {{it was finally}} closed as a naval establishment, from 1958-1960 the entire site was sold off. 27 June 1980 the BBC purchased the whole site and applied for planning permission to erect at {{the airfield}} a shortwave radio station consisting of 21 self-supporting towers holding aerial arrays and ancillary buildings on a 300-acre site. The station would transmit overseas radio services to Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and perhaps South America [...] the application failed and the BBC sold the land during January 1987 The airfield is also {{the home of the}} wessex strut, a general aviation club [...] formed in January 1977, which holds an annual fly in and other events their first fly-in was on 17 April 1977 and attracted 107 aircraft. As of today the only usable runway is the north 07-25 runway, extant with the concrete <b>dummy</b> <b>deck,</b> and the underground machinery chamber, it is also the home to a large number of light aviation enthusiasts aircraft as well as the Yakolevs aerobatic display team and the Dorset and Somerset air ambulance ...|$|E
50|$|New {{recruits}} {{into the}} Aircraft Handling branch initially complete basic training with other Naval recruits at HMS Raleigh in Cornwall for 10 weeks. Here they {{are trained in}} the basic skills required {{to serve in the}} British armed forces/Royal Navy. Upon successful completion of basic training all recruits into the Aircraft Handling branch then proceed to RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall; here they are instructed at the Royal Naval School of Flight Deck Operations (RNSFDO). The training at RNSFDO is around 6 months and covers the two key skills required of an Aircraft Handler. The first phase is fire fighting, which sees recruits learn aircraft crash rescue fire fighting skills, however new recruits also learn skills required for domestic fire fighting, the safe use and control of breathing apparatus, road traffic incidents and various other skills that would be required as would be for the civilian fire service. The second phase of training is Aircraft Handling which sees recruits learning the skills required for the safe movement, take off and landing of aircraft on board Royal Navy ships and at Royal Naval air stations. The training for this role is carried out on a full size mock up flight deck known as HMS Siskin (<b>Dummy</b> <b>Deck).</b> HMS Siskin is largely made up to replicate the Invicible class aircraft carrier but can also be adapted to the roles of smaller ships such as frigates and destroyers. New recruits are now also able to gain NVQ qualifications in fire fighting skills.|$|E
