50|$|On January 25, 2006, the {{government}} of Indonesia issued Presidential Instruction (Instruksi Presiden RI) No 1/2006 regarding “Provision and Utilisation of Biofuel as Alternative Fuel” as the legal framework for biofuels development in the country. Accordingly, 10% of bioethanol and biodiesel are allowed to blend with gasoline and diesel. To attract more investors, {{the government}} provides investment tax incentives through Government Regulation No. 62/2008, which has the following salient features: (i) 30% reduction of net income from the total investment, applied for 6 yrs, or 5% every year; (ii) expediting depreciation and amortization method; (iii) lower income tax (10%) compared to (15%) {{in the past for}} royalties earned by foreign tax payers; and (iv) a longer period of compensation of loss—more than 5 yrs but less than 10 years. To help small farmers, the Ministry of Finance issued Regulation No. 117/PMK.06/2006 or Credit for the Development of Bio-fuel Energy and Plantation Revitalization. This is a subsidized credit scheme for farmers involving several government owned banks—PT. BRI, PT. Bank Mandiri, PT. Bank Bukopin, PT. Bank Sumut, and BPD Sumbar. An <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> was also allocated. For example, the market rate for cassava is 18%, while for farmers it is only 9%. Likewise, the market rate for sugar cane where it is 18% but the rate charged to farmers is only 12%. During the initial period, there were only two biodiesel plants in Indonesia: PPKS in Medan and Eterindo in Gresik. At present, there are nine ethanol plants with a total production capacity of 133,632 kiloliters, and some of them began to produce as early as 2007 with oil palm plantation among others like PT Musimas with a capacity of 100,000 tons per year in North Sumatra and PT Prajona Nelayan with a capacity of 60,000 tons per year in Riau. Dumai, also in Riau, was identified by the Indonesian government as the largest biodiesel development center in Indonesia, considering its abundant supply of raw materials including, oil palm in this area, supported by the availability of port facilities and the existence of the largest biofuel processing plant (PT Wilmar Bioenergi with production capacity of 350,000 tons per day). As of 2009, Indonesia has 32 listed companies that are involved in the biofuels industry utilizing sugarcane, cassava, and coconut (according to a presentation delivered by the Directorate General of Electricity and Energy Utilization of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Republic of Indonesia in the 2nd Asia Biomass Energy workshop, Biofuels Database in East Asia held last December 8-10, 2009 in Kyoto, Japan). Of these 32 companies, nine of them are ethanol producers with a total production capacity of 133,632 kiloliters. Of nine of these companies, only two of them produce ethanol with specifications for fuel or bioethanol. These companies are PT Bukitmanikam Subur Persada in Lampung and PT Indo Acidama Chemical in Surabaya. Total production capacity of these companies reached 93,282 kiloliter per year. Due to Indonesia’s initiatives to increase the cultivation of natural resources in terms of biofuel production in coordination with ethanol producers, the country was able to rank No. 14 in the Ernst and Young’s Biofuels Indices in 2008.|$|E

Our goal is to illustrate the extent of both <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> and repayment burdens with respect to Thailand's Student Loans Fund (SLF), using methods pioneered in measurement terms by (Ziderman, 1999) and (Ziderman, 2003). Our critical innovation is to calculate repayment burdens for graduates with widely differing earnings, and we find that these generally are relatively low because the SLF is heavily subsidized. Even so, for graduates with very low income the burdens can be high.

Our analysis unveils a number of relevant policy lessons for the design of housing subsidy programs, namely: (a) Under fiscal neutrality (same government outlay), both subsidies have the same positive effect on the ability and willingness to repay. But, for such neutrality to hold, the percentage <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> must be larger than the downpayment subsidy, which is rare to happen in practice; (b) The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> raises the loan size a bank is willing to grant, but the downpayment subsidy does not, the reason being that the latter actually diminishes the need for bank financing for a given property value; (c) When targeting lower income households, the downpayment subsidy is superior to the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy,</b> as the former increases the loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, two key criteria for mortgage borrower eligibility. By the same token, the downpayment subsidy is more likely to have a stronger effect on low and medium value housing units; (d) Such progressivity comes at the cost of a higher probability of default, meaning that some trade-off between equity and financial stability may emerge; (e) Subsidies are likely to put upward pressure on housing prices. The downpayment subsidy has a direct effect (by injecting fiscal resources to cover part of the property price) and an indirect effect (by easing the access to the mortgage market); (f) The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> only has the latter effect; and (g) Compared to the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy,</b> the downpayment support promotes a less aggressive competition in the real estate market...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{interest}} rate credit subsidies on economic development in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, occupational choice and financial frictions. There are two financial frictions: a cost to intermediate loans and a limited liability problem which maps into the degree of enforcement of credit contracts in the economy. Occupational choice and firm size are determined endogenously by an agent’s type (ability and net wealth) and the credit market frictions. We then add a credit program in this economy that subsidizes the interest rate on loans. There is a fixed cost (which might be null) to apply for such loans {{in the form of}} bureaucracy and regulations.

With a broad-brush approach the subsidies for TICAL-type arrangements and for current debt levels turn out to be between 25 and 40 per cent, but are about zero for our suggested alternative ICLs. Using a better, more disaggregated, approach, subsidies for TICAL-type schemes are estimated to be about 30 - 55, and 3 and 18 per cent for our alternative ICLs. But with very large debts, the subsidies of all schemes are very high, implying that ICL are likely to be expensive until Thai graduate incomes rise.
