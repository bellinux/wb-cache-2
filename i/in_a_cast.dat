5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cast</b> part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to}} the standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Terry-Thomas {{began his}} stage career with an {{appearance}} in Piccadilly Hayride at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London; {{the show was}} a hit and he appeared in it from September 1946 until January 1948.

Prior to the season, Orr had injured his right knee during a charity game in Winnipeg during the summer requiring five weeks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cast.</b> In December, a Frank Mahovlich check caused a fracture of Orr's collar bone and a shoulder separation. Orr returned in January in time {{to play in the}} NHL All-Star Game, his first of eight appearances overall. Orr had to sit out five games afterwards due to soreness in his left knee. In February, he had to leave a game against Detroit after his left knee went stiff. He would receive the first of his many operations on the knee, repairing ligament and removing cartilage.

5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cast</b> presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E

50|$|The patternmaker or foundry {{engineer}} decides {{where the}} sprues, gating systems, and risers are placed {{with respect to}} the pattern. Where a hole is desired <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>casting,</b> <b>a</b> core may be used which defines a volume or location <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>casting</b> where metal will not flow into. Sometimes chills may be placed on a pattern surface prior to molding, which are then formed into the sand mould. Chills are heat sinks which enable localized rapid cooling. The rapid cooling may be desired to refine the grain structure or determine the freezing sequence of the molten metal which is poured into the mould. Because they are at a much cooler temperature, and often a different metal than what is being poured, they do not attach to the casting when the casting cools. The chills can then be reclaimed and reused.|$|R
