5000|$|During the 1995 NBA Playoffs, Drexler was ejected {{during a}} game between the Rockets and the Phoenix Suns by referee Jake O'Donnell, which {{allegedly}} stemmed from a personal feud between the two at the time. [...] This {{would turn out to}} be the last NBA game O'Donnell would referee, as he was not assigned any further games in the playoffs that year, and eventually retired a few months later. In 1996, on ESPN's NBA Today, O'Donnell commented, [...] "I wouldn't give Clyde Drexler much leeway because of the way he reacted with me all the time.

They may not get what you’re doing or care about what you’re doing, but there’s something, you sparked something in their heads. And that’s an exciting thing, to look into people’s eyes.

[...] The league also rescinded the standard $1,000 ejection fine to Drexler. [...] The NBA never formally announced the suspension of O'Donnell, but paid him for working the first three playoff rounds, {{although he did not}} work past the second round. [...] Both O'Donnell and the NBA have denied the impression that this incident led to O'Donnell being forced out of the league. [...] At the time, O'Donnell claimed there was no feud between him and Drexler, stating, [...] "I just don't take any crap from anyone, and he couldn't handle that. If he thinks it was personal, fine, but it wasn't from my standpoint."

40|$|The aim of my Master's degree {{thesis is}} {{to unify the}} total view of the {{question}} of euthanasia and assisted suicide with an emphasis on the criminal law. I am not trying to concluded if legalise euthanasia by the Czech law or not, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> like to outline the possibility of the legislation in the Czech law for the future, after providing the analysis of the countries where euthanasia has happened legal in the last few years. This thesis consists of the six chapters. At the beginning I am trying to give {{a detailed description of the}} substance of euthanasia and other related terms as assisted suicide, do not resuscitate and then I state usual forms and divisions of euthanasia. Then I deal with the history term in the world because for understanding and clarification this is necessary. The next chapter is already about euthanasia in Czech Republic, where this question has never been legalised but there were some efforts in some forms to do that. In this chapter I am concened with a legal qualification of killing on request and assisted suicide de lege lata and de lege ferenda. I also mention the opinions of the opponents and the protagonists {{of the question of}} euthanasia. The next chapter deals with a quality paliative care as one the arguments against euthanasia.

40|$|History of {{architecture}} as composition – History {{of architecture}} as disposition Is there a pertinent criticism? Historiography changes depending of the (unknown) field of thoughts where the historian or the art critic stays… In this paper <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>would</b> like {{to present a}} difference between -	a Historiography and Criticism in a history of architecture as com-position of figures resulting in architectural objects and -	a Historiography and Criticism of architecture as dis-position of matters resulting in a architectural operation. and suggest a question: which historiography or which criticism is pertinent ? and develop synthetically what are the results of not making clear in which type of Historiography and Criticism we are ? The synthesis of this statement, which I could develop in my full paper is here: Historiography can stay {{in a field of}} thoughts considering that the anthrope –the so called Human Being- is ‘a priori there’, is ‘finite’, is central to itself, is capable on his own judgments or is a Cartesian subject. But Science to-day contradicts this thoroughly. For Science the subject isn’t anymore the Cartesian subject. For Science the subject isn’t central to itself. For Science the subject is the crossing of the others… He is limited but in-finite. For Science the subject isn’t com-posed as a Cartesian subject but is dis-posed towards the Real. For the Cartesian Subject, the architectural space was finite made by a finite com-posed architecture in a mental world of de-finition: An architecture of com-position of figures, as a sort of concept of and in the Reality. For the Subject, as Science presents it today, the architectural space is in-finite made by a in-finite architecture in a mental world of in-finition: An architecture of dis-position of matters, as an operation on the Real. And this doesn’t mean that the subject changed of structure…. For Science it was already so in the past. So the question ‘Which criticism of architecture is pertinent?’ & ‘Which historiography is pertinent?’ is a real question. In fact there is a Story of criticism… To criticize architecture as a com-position of a finite object isn’t so pertinent anymore… To criticize architecture as a dis-position of matter(s) in an in-finite operation is the work which still has to be done. Both of this type of critics are the results of an ideology. -	An old one based on a believe making of the anthrope a Cartesian subject finite and a priori present who wants an architecture and an architectural space as objects. -	A new one based on a knowledge of the results of Science showing the Subject limited but in-finite and evolving as the crossing of the others, and living in an architecture and an architectural space which are operations. The synthesis of this was presented by Louis Kahn in a lightning statement: Purity lies in the incompletion. The full paper and the oral presentation will present of course great examples of both criticisms of historical buildings past and present. status: publishe...|$|E
