5|$|Annie sees Ethan and {{promises}} {{not to tell}} Naomi what she saw. They part ways for lunch, and Annie meets Silver (Jessica Stroup); however, Naomi pulls Annie away, explaining that Silver makes insulting YouTube videos about people. Naomi invites Annie to her birthday party, and they decide to go shopping together. Harry and guidance counselor Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) and Mr.Matthews meet with Naomi's parents, who feel that Naomi {{should not have to}} <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> assignments on time when she is planning her party. Before she leaves, Naomi's mother, Tracy (Christina Moore), reminds Harry that they dated in high school. Naomi receives a text message from her mother, telling her that she must complete the assignment that night. Annie remembers that she completed a similar assignment for her old school, and offers to give Naomi a copy for inspiration.|$|E
25|$|Clinton's {{final day}} as {{secretary}} was February 1, 2013, {{when she met}} with Obama to <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> letter of resignation and later gave farewell remarks {{in a meeting with}} employees at State Department headquarters.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the queen who wrote the letter is uncertain. She is called Dakhamunzu in the Hittite annuals, a possible transliteration of the Egyptian title Tahemetnesu (The King's Wife). Possible candidates are Nefertiti, Meritaten, and Ankhesenamun. Ankhesenamun seemed once likely since there were no candidates for the throne {{on the death of}} her husband, Tutankhamun, whereas Akhenaten had at least two legitimate successors. but this was based on a 27-year reign for the last 18th pharaoh Horemheb who is now accepted to have had a shorter reign of only 14 years. This makes the deceased Egyptian king appear to be Akhenaten instead rather than Tutankhamun. The phrase regarding marriage to 'one of my subjects' (translated by some as 'servants') is possibly a reference to the Grand Vizier Ay or a secondary member of the Egyptian royal family line. Since Nefertiti was depicted as powerful as her husband in official monuments smiting Egypt's enemies, she might be the Dakhamunzu in the Amarna correspondence as Nicholas Reeves believes. Ankhesenamun may have been pressured by Ay to marry him and legitimise his claim to the throne of Egypt (which she eventually did) This also might explain why she describes herself as 'afraid', especially considering the popular (but not widely accepted) theory that Ay had a <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> husband's death. A CT scan taken in 2005 shows that he had badly broken his leg shortly before his death, and that the leg had become infected. DNA analysis conducted in 2010 showed the presence of malaria in his system. It is believed that these two conditions, malaria and leiomyomata, combined, led to his death. However, Ankhesenamun was not as powerful as Nefertiti to be able to choose her spouse from a foreign state.|$|E

500|$|After its release, [...] "Sunday Morning" [...] {{received}} general acclaim {{from music}} critics. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard appreciated Gwen [...] "constantly gaining and losing the upper <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> romantic adventures". Thomas Bleach, writing for his self-titled blog, also enjoyed the track, calling the [...] "infectious chorus, fast pace and cheeky {{nature of the}} song appeal". A critic writing for The Diamondback favored the [...] "defiant" [...] sound of the track, while a reviewer from Punk News titled the song a [...] "gem", but predicted that [...] "on a weaker album, [...] would have made more of a splash." [...] Mike Boehm of the Los Angeles Times cited the song as an [...] "example of the band's improved craft" [...] and claimed that it [...] "help carry the album's thematic current" [...] of [...] "enthusiastic music". Similarly, Nicholas Jones of The Odyssey Online called it a [...] "standout track", due to it being [...] "lyrically clever".|$|E
500|$|Abra {{returns to}} Holby, and {{although}} Kyla initially rebukes his advances, they ultimately resume their relationship, moving in together. Abra makes a drunken proposal {{to her in}} episode [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] however laughs it off as a joke when she assumes he is not serious. Kyla is seen to develop an increasing dependence on alcohol as she grieves for her son. When Abra abruptly terminates their relationship {{in order to move}} back to Africa, this alcohol dependence continues and worsens. Kyla is devastated when Max applies for a Guardianship Order, and becomes negligent at work, leading to the deaths of two patients. Kyla admits she has become an alcoholic and agrees to begin attending AA meetings. Initially this goes well, and she is supported by new consultant Stuart McElroy who is also an alcoholic. [...] However, Kyla's confidence is damaged when Stuart violently attacks colleague Chrissie Williams, and she resorts to drinking once more. [...] She attempts to <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> notice, but Mark Williams persuades her to take a voluntary demotion to give her more time to deal with her problems.|$|E
500|$|Anderson's {{directing}} {{helped to}} energize the production, and {{the cast and}} crew worked more than usual to make sure that everything was in order for her. Production designer Corey Kaplan made sure that the episode featured a Buddhist temple at Anderson's request, and casting director Rick Millikan helped Anderson choose the appropriate actors and actresses. Millikan later said that he particularly enjoyed working with Anderson, because it was [...] "fun" [...] for him to watch her go through the casting process, which was entirely new to her. On set, Anderson's directing style was described as [...] "right on the money" [...] by Marc Shapiro in his book all things: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Volume 6. He later wrote that [...] "Anderson wielded a deft <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> directorial debut, prodding the actors to her will, making decisions on the fly, and handling the complex special effects sequences". Fans of the show later wrote to express their appreciation of Anderson's directing abilities. Anderson was also involved in post-production editing, during which she was forced to cut the final conversation scene between Scully and Daniel Waterston by 10minutes {{in order to meet the}} allotted episode length.|$|E

2500|$|Vandersloot {{became a}} {{basketball}} star at Kentwood High School in her hometown. Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either {{before or after}} the team's practice. He would later say, [...] "I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd put my <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' [...] " [...] She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble.|$|E
2500|$|Following an {{assassination}} attempt on her life in 1989, secret service agents advised her to leave South Africa. She resumed work for the Johannesburg newspaper from their London office. In London, Allan launched a new column for the newspaper titled Jani at large with the tag-line Jani Allan - reporting from London. After six weeks in London, Allan returned {{to work at the}} Johannesburg office. After a week back at work, Allan was asked to <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> resignation as she had [...] "become the story". Allan's tenure at the newspaper ended in September 1989. Allan's final piece published by the Sunday Times was an interview with Mandy Rice-Davies for the Jani at large column.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1998 book, Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human, Harold Bloom {{attacked}} the play on numerous occasions, calling it [...] "a howler", [...] "a poetic atrocity", [...] "an exploitative parody, with the inner purpose of destroying {{the ghost of}} Christopher Marlowe" [...] and [...] "a blowup, an explosion of rancid irony." [...] Bloom summates his views by declaring [...] "I can concede no intrinsic value to Titus Andronicus." [...] Citing the 1955 Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) production, directed by Peter Brook and starring Laurence Olivier, which is generally agreed to have provided {{the impetus for the}} 20th century revaluation of the play, Bloom said that the audience laughed several times in scenes which were supposed to be tragic, and he sees this as evidence for its failure as Tragedy. He particularly focuses his criticism on the line when Lavinia is told to carry Titus' severed <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mouth (3.1.281), arguing that no play which contains such a scene could possibly be serious. He thus concludes the best director to tackle the play would be Mel Brooks.|$|E
