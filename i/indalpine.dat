5000|$|While {{citalopram}} (Lundbeck) and zimelidine (Astra Pharmaceuticals) {{were developed}} in the early-1970s, it was Pharmuka's <b>indalpine</b> that was first to reach the market. Dr. Shopsin was recruited as consultant to Pharmuka throughout a research and development process {{that resulted in the}} marketing of <b>indalpine</b> in France and then worldwide, in 1982. The therapeutic success, positive public response and media attention in France relating to Upstène (<b>indalpine)</b> spread worldwide, and <b>indalpine</b> was designated as a [...] "blockbuster", setting a new record for the sale of any antidepressant up to that point in time. With FDA approval of Pharmuka's IND submission to conduct clinical studies with <b>indalpine</b> and viqueline, Dr. Shopsin carried out and published the first clinical trials with these drugs in depressed outpatients in the U.S. Astra's SSRI zimelidine was marketed within a year (1983), but the next crop of SSRI's didn't become commercially available until the 1986 marketing of fluvoxamine in Belgium by Duphar, followed by approval in the United States later that year. Lilly's fluoxetine (Prozac) was approved in the US in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, zimelidine {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} soon after its marketing in 1983 {{due to the}} emergence of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a serious neurological disease. With lingering concerns among some Common Market countries and activist groups about the potential of SSRIs to induce adverse effects, and the reported association between <b>indalpine</b> and hematological effects, which emerged in the aftermath of Pharmuka's take over by Rhône Poulenc, <b>indalpine</b> was abruptly taken off the market by Rhône Poulenc, to the surprise of others. Irish psychiatrist David Healy characterized <b>indalpine</b> as being [...] "born at the wrong time" [...] during a period when [...] "indalpine and psychiatry was under siege" [...] by different interest groups in some of the Common Market countries. In line with indalpine's fate, research and development was halted relating to the 2 other 4-alkyl-piperidine derivatives developed by Pharmuka, viqualine (a serotonin releasing agent) and pipequaline (a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator), both in different stages of development at the time.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aejaz_Ahmed/publication/270512329_Available_online_www_The_Importance_of_Six_Membered_Saturated_Nitrogen_Containing_Ring_in_Psychological_disorders/links/54acc5430cf21c47713a73a6.pdf ...|$|E
50|$|Alaproclate (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} GEA-654) {{is a drug}} that was being {{developed}} as an antidepressant by the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra AB (now AstraZeneca) in the 1970s. It acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and along with zimelidine and <b>indalpine,</b> {{was one of the}} first of its kind. Development was discontinued due to the observation of liver complications in rodent studies. In addition to its SSRI properties, alaproclate has been found to act as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, but does not have discriminative stimulus properties similar to phencyclidine.|$|E

50|$|Most {{antidepressants}} suppress REM sleep, {{in parallel}} with their alleviation of depressive symptoms (although suppression of REM sleep is not required for antidepressant effects). This includes TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline), TeCAs (e.g., mianserin, maprotiline), MAOIs (e.g., clorgiline, pargyline), and SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, zimelidine, <b>indalpine).</b> Trimipramine is unique {{in that it is}} an exception and produces antidepressant effects without compromising or otherwise affecting REM sleep. Even long-term treatment with trimipramine for up to 2 years has not been found to suppress REM sleep. In addition, trimipramine has been found to decrease nocturnal cortisol levels to normal and to normalize cortisol response in depressed patients; hence, it normalizes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, whereas imipramine and other antidepressants tend to increase nocturnal cortisol secretion.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Indalpine</b> (INN, BAN) (brand name Upstène; {{developmental}} {{code name}} LM-5008) is an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class drug that was briefly marketed. It {{was discovered in}} 1977 by the pharmacologists Le Fur and Uzan at Pharmuka, a small French pharmaceutical firm, who credit Baron Shopsin {{and his colleagues at}} NYU-Bellevue/NYU School of Medicine in New York with providing the basis for their work. They were particularly influenced by the series of [...] "synthesis inhibitor studies" [...] carried out by Shopsin's team during the early to mid-1970s, and in particular, the clinical report by Shopsin et al. (1976) relating to PCPA's rapid reversal of antidepressant response to tranylcypromine in depressed patients. This led {{to an understanding of the}} role of the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5HT) in the therapeutic effects of the available tricyclic and MAOI class antidepressants. The studies led to widespread recognition of a serotonin hypothesis of depression, contradicting theories that promoted the role of norepinephrine.|$|E
40|$|Drugs acting at 5 -HT receptors were {{evaluated}} on three animal models of anxiety. On the elevated X-maze test {{the majority of}} 5 -HT 1 agonists {{were found to be}} anxiogenic. However, ipsapirone was anxiolytic and buspirone and gepirone were inactive. The 5 -HT 2 agonist DOI and the 5 -HT 2 antagonist ritanserin were anxiolytic while ICI 169, 369, a 5 -HT 2 antagonist was inactive. All 5 -HT 3 antagonists tested were inactive in this test, while the indirect serotomimetics zimeldine and fenfluramine were anxiogenic. Neither beta-adrenoceptor agonists nor antagonists had reproducible effects on anxiety in this model. Combined beta- 1 /beta- 2 adrenoceptor antagonists reversed the anxiogenic effects of 8 -OH-DPAT while selective beta- 1 or beta- 2 antagonists did not. On the social interaction model the 5 -HT 1 agonists 8 -OH-DPAT, RU 24969 and 5 -MeODMT were anxiogenic and ipsapirone was anxiolytic. The 5 -HT 2 agonist DOI and the beta-adrenoceptor- and 5 -HT- antagonist pindolol were anxiolytic, while the 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 3 antagonists were inactive. In the marble burying test, the 5 -HT upake inhibitors zimeldine, fluvoxamine, <b>indalpine</b> and citalopram, the 5 -HT 1 B/ 5 -HT 1 C agonists mCPP and TFMPP and the 5 -HT 2 / 5 -HT 1 C agonist DOI reduced marble burying without affecting locomotor activity. 5 -HT 1 A agonists and the 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 3 antagonists were without effect. Lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus reversed the anxiogenic effects of 8 -OH-DPAT in the X-maze model. The implication of these results for the understanding of the pharmacology of 5 -HT in anxiety is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} historical {{prerequisites for}} designing antidepressants {{from a group}} of selective serotonin neuronal reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) : to determine a lower serotonin concentration in the different tissues of depressed patients; to establish a higher serotonin concentration in the treatment of depressed patients with tricyclic antidepressants, and to formulate the serotonergic theory of depression. It also provides a consecutive account of the history of clinical introduction of individual SSRI representatives, such as fluoxetine, zimelidine, fluvoxamine, <b>indalpine,</b> citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, and escitalopram. There are data from the history of studying the mechanism of SSRI action: from the theory of the importance of an increase in the concentration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft to the current understanding of complex successive intracellular rearrangements {{at the level of the}} postsynaptic neuron. The history of studying the efficacy of SSRIs in treating depression is considered in detail. Emphasis is laid on the reasons for a paradoxical difference in the evaluations of the efficiency of therapy with SSRIs versus other groups of antidepressants at different developmental stages of psychopharmacology. The role of marketing technologies in disseminating the data on the efficacy of this or that group of antidepressants is described. The practical significance of differences in individual SSRI representatives (the potency of serotonin uptake inhibition; the degree of selectivity and activity against the serotonergic system; the likelihood of an unfavorable pharmacokinetic interaction with other drugs; the half-life of elimination; the quickness of achieving a therapeutic dose) is analyzed. Whether it is possible and reasonable to differentially choose different SSRI representatives in the treatment of depressions at the present stage is discussed. The authors state their belief that researches should be continued to specify the place of SSRIs among other groups of current antidepressants for the treatment of depressions.   </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} underlying 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and/or dopamine release {{induced by}} (+) -amphetamine ((+) -Amph), 3, 4 -methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), p-chloroamphetamine (pCA) and (+) -fenfluramine ((+) -Fen) {{was investigated in}} rat brain superfused synaptosomes preloaded with the 3 H neurotransmitters. Their rank order of potency for [3 H]- 5 -HT-releasing activity {{was the same as}} for inhibition of 5 -HT uptake (pCA⩾MDMA⩾(+) -Fen>>(+) -Amph). Similarly, their rank order as [3 H]-dopamine releasers and dopamine uptake inhibitors was the same ((+) -Amph>>pCA=MDMA>>(+) -Fen). We also confirmed that the release induced by these compounds was prevented by selective transporter inhibitors (<b>indalpine</b> or nomifensine). [3 H]- 5 -HT and/or [3 H]-dopamine release induced by all these compounds was partially (31 – 80 %), but significantly Ca 2 +-dependent. Lack of extracellular Ca 2 + did not alter uptake mechanisms nor did it modify the carrier-dependent dopamine-induced [3 H]-dopamine release. (+) -Amph-induced [3 H]-dopamine release and pCA- and MDMA-induced [3 H]- 5 -HT release were significantly inhibited by ω-agatoxin-IVA, a specific blocker of P-type voltage-operated Ca 2 +-channels, similar to the previous results on (+) -Fen-induced [3 H]- 5 -HT release. Methiothepin inhibited the Ca 2 +-dependent component of (+) -Amph-induced [3 H]-dopamine release with high potency (70 [*]nM), as previously found with (+) -Fen-induced [3 H]- 5 -HT release. The inhibitory effect of methiothepin was not due to its effects as a transporter inhibitor or Ca 2 +-channel blocker and is unlikely to be due to its antagonist properties on 5 -HT 1 / 2, dopamine or any other extracellular receptor. These results indicate that the release induced by these compounds is both ‘carrier-mediated' and Ca 2 +-dependent (possibly exocytotic-like), with the specific carrier allowing the amphetamines to enter the synaptosome. The Ca 2 +-dependent release is mediated by Ca 2 +-influx (mainly through P-type Ca 2 +-channels), possibly triggered by the drug interacting with an unknown intracellular target, affected by methiothepin, common to both 5 -HT and dopamine synaptosomes...|$|E
