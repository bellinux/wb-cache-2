One method to remove solid particles from the secondary flow path is to use an inertial particle separa-tor because {{of its ability to}} incur minimal pressure losses in high flow rate applications. In this paper, an <b>inertial</b> <b>separator</b> is presented that is made up of an array of louvers followed by a static collector. The performance of two <b>inertial</b> <b>separator</b> configurations was measured in a unique test facility. Performance measurements included pressure loss and collection efficiency for a range of Reynolds numbers and sand sizes. To comple-ment the measurements, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional computational results are presented for comparison. Computational predictions of pressure loss agreed with measurements at high Reynolds numbers, whereas predictions of sand collection efficiency for a sand size range 0 – 200 lm agreed within 10 % of experimental measure-ments over the range of Reynolds numbers. Collection efficiency values were measured to be as high as 35 %, and pressure loss measurements were equivalent to less than 1 % pres-sure loss in an engine application.

The dust-laden gases venturi scrubber enter through the venturi and are accelerated to speeds between 12,000 and 36,000 ft/min (60.97-182.83 m/s). These high-gas velocities immediately atomize the coarse water spray, which is injected radially into the venturi throat, into fine droplets. High energy and extreme turbulence promote collision between water droplets and dust particulates in the throat.

This technology takes the advantages of both <b>inertial</b> and centrifugal <b>separators.</b> The <b>inertial</b> <b>separator</b> has short residence time but low separation efficiency, while the centrifugal separator has long residence time but high separation efficiency. The inertial separation is coupled with centrifugal separation, the separation efficiency is guaranteed by centrifugal separation, and the residence time is shortened by inertial separation. This technology features high separation efficiency, low pressure drop, compact structure and operation stability. Previous research results have shown that the residence time of oil gas in the separator is less than 0.5  s. At the same time, the separation efficiency is up to 99  %, while the pressure drop is only around 3  kPa, which is far less than the conventional rough vortex (6 – 8  kPa; Wang et al. 2016; Xia 2014).|$|R

Using the results of parametric studies a modified geometry configuration for the <b>inertial</b> gas-solid <b>separator</b> is achieved which shows considerable performance improvement {{in comparison with the}} original model. In this approach, the CAD model for the original geometry of the dust separator was generated and the turbulent flow field was solved using time-independent solver and Reynolds stress turbulence model.

The highly rotational flow pattern and its features are described by analyzing the different flow variables. The main contributors of the pressure loss production in the flow field are identified and the most effective geometry parameters are recognized in order to perform the parametric analysis. The modifications are implemented on the original geometry and flow simulation is performed for each new configuration with the same solution method as used for the original model. The flow field changes are evaluated by comparing the contours of flow variables and the generated pressure loss for each case are compared with original configuration.

Biomass pyrolysis has emerged as a very promising renewable alternative for fuel and chemical production. Previous work has shown that the most effective biomass pyrolysis processes require a careful control of temperature and residence times, and downer reactors appear to be the best technology to achieve such goals. Ongoing research at the Institute for Chemicals and Fuels from Alternative Resources (ICFAR) has {{led to the development of}} a new downer reactor design for the pyrolysis of biomass feedstock. However, this process requires a gas-solid separator that achieves a minimum spread of the gas residence time distribution – i. e., as near to plug flow as possible. As a result, a novel integrated gas-solid <b>inertial</b> <b>separator</b> has been designed for implementation in the downer reactor. This new separator combines both primary separation and solids stripping within the same device. This is intended to decrease the product vapor residence time and to reduce the severity of vapor overcracking compared to other fast separation methods. The gas-solid separation section of the new device features a uniflow configuration and a vertical, axial entry with either swirl vanes or a deflector cone. In the current study, various geometry configurations and operating conditions were tested for their effect on separation efficiency and pressure drop. A 70 mm-diameter separator was tested under cold flow modeling conditions using silica sand, glass beads or FCC catalyst particles as solid material. The sand, glass beads and FCC particles had Sauter mean diameters of 200 μm, 63 μm and 43 μm, respectively.

25|$|In 1989 Land Rover had {{launched}} the Discovery its Range Rover-based family 4×4 that quickly became Europe's top-selling 4×4. One {{of the key}} reasons for its success was its ground-breaking turbodiesel engine. The 200Tdi {{was one of the}} first mass-produced small-capacity (i.e., not a lorry engine) direct-injection diesels, with the attendant improvements in power and efficiency that system brings. Developed under the codename Gemini, the 200Tdi was planned from the start to be used on all Land Rover's products. For production reasons, it had to be machined on the existing machinery, so used the same block and crankshaft as the existing 2.5-litre diesel engines. It also used many ancillary parts used on the older engines. However, it was a true break with the past. An aluminium alloy cylinder head reduced weight and noise, a new Bosch injection system gave improved running characteristics and better starting performance. An intercooler boosted power and efficiency further. Lessons learnt from the Diesel Turbo were included, such as the fitment of an <b>inertial</b> <b>separator</b> in the breather system to remove oil before crankcase gases were returned to the air intake. Initially turbocharged and naturally aspirated diesel versions and a carburettor-fed petrol version were to be produced. The direct-injection system meant that only machining of the injector sockets was needed to allow the fitment of spark plugs. However, the performance and economy of the turbodiesel version was such that the other variants were not produced. The 200Tdi was launched in the Discovery in 1989. It was then fitted to the utility Land Rover (renamed the Defender) in late 1990. For this application the engine was slightly de-tuned and, whilst in the Discovery the 200Tdi used all-new components, packaging restraints in the Defender meant that the 200Tdi in this role shared many exterior parts (such as the timing belt system and case) with the Diesel Turbo. Most obviously the turbocharger was retained in the Diesel Turbo's high mounting position on top of the manifolds in the Defender, rather than being tucked under the manifolds in the original Discovery version. In 1992 the engine was fitted to the Range Rover. Although the older petrol and naturally aspirated diesel units were theoretically still available, the 200Tdi had better performance and economy than any of them, and so dominated the sales figures. It is still highly regarded by Land Rover enthusiasts and has established itself as a powerful and long-lived unit that with proper maintenance can exceed 300,000 miles of use. The engine's commonality with the older models makes it a popular choice for installation in older Land Rovers. This is done both in original form or with the turbo removed (when the engine becomes known to enthusiasts as a 200Di) in order to keep the power/torque output within the limits of a Series Land Rover's gearbox and for greater ease of conversion. The turbocharged version may also be installed with or without the intercooler.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} development of an efficient interactive design tool for aircraft engine sand separator systems. The development of such a tool was felt necessary {{to address the problem}} of sand ingestion in gas turbine engines; a vital concern for the aviation and gas-turbine based electricity generation industry communities operating in desert environments as it can seriously affect the operation, performance and life cycle of a turbine engine. The design tool makes use of state-of-the-art practical geometry design and analysis technique, namely the inverse airfoil design method for the design of specific profiles for engine air intakes. The sand separator design is achieved by giving a specific contour to the intake profile, such as a highly curved bend in the duct, so that the contaminants because of their inertial momentum are forced away from the central flow. Since the sand particles can rebound of the air intake walls and enter the engine, the method takes into account sand particle rebound or restitution characteristics in the design. The design is accomplished with the aid of optimization techniques in both the inverse aerodynamic design as well as in the sand separator system design. In addition, to facilitate the analysis and design in an interactive manner, a MATLAB GUI has been developed.
