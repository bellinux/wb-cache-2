50|$|For radial data sampling, the phase- and frequency-encoding {{gradients}} {{are replaced}} by two simultaneously applied frequency-encoding gradients that rotate the Fourier lines in data space. In either case, repetition times are as short as 2 to 10 milliseconds, so {{that the use of}} 64 to 256 repetitions results in image acquisition times of about 0.1 to 2.5 seconds for a two-dimensional image. Most recently, highly undersampled radial FLASH MRI acquisitions have been combined with an iterative image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion to achieve real-time MRI at a temporal resolution of 20 to 30 milliseconds for images with a spatial resolution of 1.5 to 2.0 millimeters. This method allows for a visualization of the beating heart in real time - without synchronization to the electrocardiogram and during <b>free</b> <b>breathing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Current methodologic {{projects}} {{focus on}} the use of iterative image reconstruction techniques for non-cartesian MRI (e.g., undersampled radial MRI) and parallel MRI that define the reconstruction process as a nonlinear inverse problem. Other developments address the possibility of real-time MRI in order to overcome the motion sensitivity of conventional MRI acquisitions and to monitor organ movements in real time. Most recent achievements in real-time MRI are based on FLASH techniques with highly undersampled radial data encodings. When combined with image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion, they allow for movies of the human heart with image acquisition times as short as 20 milliseconds, which correspond to MRI movies with 50 frames per second. Such real-time movies may continuously be recorded during <b>free</b> <b>breathing,</b> without ECG synchronization, and without motion artifacts.

50|$|BC {{attachment}} {{systems are}} generally intended {{to limit the}} shifting of the BC {{as a result of}} the lifting forces, including minimizing the tendency to slide towards the head when the diver is upright while the bladder is inflated. If the diver is wearing a weight belt, this will pull in the opposite direction to BC lift when the diver is upright, and can result in the diver sagging down in the jacket when floating at the surface. Solutions to this problem include the cummerbund (a broad adjustable waist band) and the crotch strap (a strap between the legs). The crotch strap, when adjusted correctly, is effective at preventing this shift, but may prevent the weight belt from falling clear of the diver if dropped in an emergency. Fitting the weight belt over the crotch strap after putting the BC on can be difficult. The cummerbund is an attempt to avoid this problem, as the weight belt can not be snagged on it in the same way, but the weight belt must then be worn either under the cummerbund, obstructing access to the buckle, or below the cummerbund. The effectiveness of a cummerbund depends on a waistline which is smaller than the circumference of the upper torso, and it may constrain <b>free</b> <b>breathing</b> if fitted too tightly.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of TRacking Only Navigator echo (TRON) for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of the liver at 3. 0 T. Materials and Methods: Ten volunteers underwent TRON, respiratory triggered, and <b>free</b> <b>breathing</b> DWI of the liver at 3. 0 Tesla (T). Scan times were measured. Image sharpness, degree of stair-step and stripe artifacts for the three methods were assessed by two observers. Results: Mean scan times of TRON and respiratory triggered DWI relative to <b>free</b> <b>breathing</b> DWI were 34 % and 145 % longer respectively. In four of eight comparisons (two observers, two b-values, two slice orientations), TRON DWI image sharpness was significantly better than <b>free</b> <b>breathing</b> DWI, but inferior to respiratory triggered DWI. In two of four comparisons (two observers, two b-values), degree of stair-step artifacts in TRON DWI was significantly lower than in respiratory triggered DWI. Degree of stripe artifacts between the three methods was not significantly different. Conclusion: DWI of the liver at 3. 0 T using TRON is feasible. Image sharpness in TRON DWI is superior to that in <b>free</b> <b>breathing</b> DWI. Although image sharpness of respiratory triggered DWI is still better, TRON DWI requires less scan time and reduces stair-step artifacts. J. Magn. Reson.

40|$|Abstract- Aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the degree of coupling among the cardiovascular variability series and the respiration in subjects susceptible to neurally mediated syncope, in comparison to normal subjects. 21 patients susceptible to syncope and 10 sex and age matched control subjects have been enrolled in the study. ECG, respiration activity, and arterial blood pressure were simultaneously recorded at rest (controlled and <b>free</b> <b>breathing)</b> and during 70 ° head-up TILT test (<b>free</b> <b>breathing).</b> The degree of non-linear coupling among heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV) and respiration has been quantified by means of a multivariate embedding-based approach. 11 patients developed syncope during the TILT test. The non-linear coupling among the cardiovascular variables and respiration turned out to be stronger during controlled breathing than during <b>free</b> <b>breathing,</b> both for TILT-positive and TILT-negative group. During late TILT phase, in the TILT-positive group, the non-linear coupling showed a significant increase.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} respiratory guidance system in 4 -dimensional computed tomography (4 DCT) based respiratory-gated radiation therapy (RGRT) by comparing respiratory signals and dosimetric analysis of treatment plans. Methods. The respiratory amplitude and period of the free, the audio device-guided, and the complex system-guided breathing were evaluated in eleven patients with lung or liver cancers. The dosimetric parameters were assessed by comparing <b>free</b> <b>breathing</b> CT plan and 4 DCT-based 30 – 70 % maximal intensity projection (MIP) plan. Results. The use of complex system-guided breathing showed significantly less variation in respiratory amplitude and period compared to the free or audio-guided breathing regarding the root mean square errors (RMSE) of full inspiration (P= 0. 031), full expiration (P= 0. 007), and period (P= 0. 007).
