25|$|We begin these {{examples}} {{with that of}} the <b>differential</b> <b>amplifier,</b> from which many of the other applications can be derived, including the inverting, non-inverting, and summing amplifier, the voltage follower, integrator, differentiator, and gyrator.|$|E
25|$|A {{non-inverting}} amplifier is {{a special}} case of the <b>differential</b> <b>amplifier</b> in which that circuit's inverting input V1 is grounded, and non-inverting input V2 is identified with Vin above, with R1 ≫ R2.|$|E

25|$|Blumlein {{may or may}} {{not have}} invented the long-tailed pair, but his name is on the first patent (1936). The long-tailed pair is a form of <b>differential</b> <b>amplifier</b> that has been popular since the days of the vacuum tube (valve).

25|$|The {{input signal}} is coupled through {{capacitor}} C1 {{to the base}} of transistor Q1. The capacitor allows the AC signal to pass, but blocks the DC bias voltage established by resistors R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a <b>differential</b> <b>amplifier</b> (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a long-tailed pair. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to Q2 via R7 and R8.|$|E

40|$|Blocking and {{desensitization}} {{are among}} the nonlinear effects that result when bipolar and MOSFET <b>differential</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are operating in a multisignal electromagnetic interference (EMI) environment. When a weak desired signal is processed along with a strong undesired interferer signal, the weak signal may experience a reduced gain; that is, desensitization. If the amplitude of the undesired signal is sufficiently large, the gain of the desired signal may drop to zero; that is, blocking. Using a Fourier-series model for the differential input-voltage/output-current characteristics, closed-form expressions for predicting the desensitization in bipolar and MOSFET <b>differential</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are presented. These expressions are valid {{over a wide range}} of desired and blocking interfering signals amplitude...|$|R
25|$|Input offset voltage: This voltage, {{which is}} what is {{required}} across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero. In the perfect amplifier, {{there would be no}} input offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the <b>differential</b> <b>amplifier</b> that constitutes the input stage of the vast majority of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.|$|E

In this work, the effect of process variations such as gate oxide thickness, implantation parameters, and channel length are systematically investigated on the device and analog circuit performance for all these technologies. The performance parameters of LAC and DH <b>differential</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and current mirror circuits are evaluated, using mixed-mode simulations, as a function of process induced mismatch. Our simulation results on <b>differential</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and current mirrors show that, an identical V, mismatch in CON, DH, and LAC devices results in a lower variation in the circuit parameters for LAC technologies. It is found that, for a specified circuit parameter variation, almost a 25 % higher V, mismatch is tolerable with LAC technologies as compared to the CON technologies...|$|R
2500|$|The {{negative}} feedback introduced by resistors RE {{can be seen}} in these parameters. For example, when used as an active load in a <b>differential</b> <b>amplifier,</b> I1 ≈ −I2, making the output impedance of the mirror approximately R22 -R21 ≈ 2 β rORE /(rπ + 2RE) compared to only rO without feedback (that is with RE = 0 Ω) [...] At the same time, the impedance on the reference side of the mirror is approximately [...] R11−R12 ≈ , only a moderate value, but still larger than rE with no feedback. In the <b>differential</b> <b>amplifier</b> application, a large output resistance increases the difference-mode gain, a good thing, and a small mirror input resistance is desirable to avoid Miller effect.|$|E

In analog EEG, the signal is then filtered (next paragraph), and the EEG signal is output as the deflection of pens as paper passes underneath. Most EEG systems these days, however, are digital, and the amplified signal is digitized via an analog-to-digital converter, after being passed through an anti-aliasing filter.
