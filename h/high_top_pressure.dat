40|$|A huge {{production}} of steel {{throughout the world}} requires sufficiently large {{production of}} hot metal. Inspite of alternative methods of iron making 94. 1 wt % iron is still being produced by blast furnace route only. Blast furnace technology has been developed step by step from primitive blast furnace to modern blast furnace from 14 th century till date. During last five decades several important technological changes have taken place to make blast furnace technology eco-friendly, energy efficient and cost effective, increasing its productivity significantly. A characteristic feature {{of the development of}} blast furnace technology during last two decades is the increase in its overall productivity to an average of approx. 2. 5 t/m 3 /day and reduce the coke consumption significantly. The objective of the paper is to discuss major technological developments in the blast furnace technology namely higher oxygen enrichment from about 21 to 30 %, lower hot blast temperature from about 1200 to 800 °C, pulverized coal injections within the tuyeres and raceway of the blast furnace upto 250 kg/THM, better burden distribution and the recent technology for the top charging devices and the technology improvement to create <b>high</b> <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> like Gimble top device. Further possible improvements in blast furnace technology are lower temperature blast enriched with high oxygen, probability of eliminating hot blast stoves and significant use of top ga...|$|E
30|$|Next to {{substrates}} {{that can}} be supplied through a liquid feed, many fermentations need substrates that are gaseous at fermentation conditions, i.e., oxygen in countless aerobic fermentations. If possible, air is used for oxygen supply, because it is cheap, and the off-gas is generally vented after a single pass through the bioreactor. However, when using air the driving force for oxygen transfer from gas to liquid phase can become too small to sustain a sufficiently high oxygen transfer rate (OTR). This can be overcome by operating at <b>higher</b> <b>top</b> <b>pressures</b> and/or increasing the oxygen mole fraction in the feed gas (van ’t Riet and Tramper 1991). The drawback of the first method is that a <b>higher</b> <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> leads to <b>higher</b> energy consumption, and of the second method that pure gases have to be purchased, or produced, which also introduces additional operational expenditures (OPEX).|$|R
30|$|The {{stretching}} of {{the cost}} curve of case 1 {{is related to the}} fact that a <b>higher</b> <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> increases the partial O 2 pressure, and therefore higher transfer rates from gas to liquid phase can be achieved. Therefore, case 1 can be used up to b =  1, when r_O_ 2 is at its maximal value, except for the range of the gap, and the limitation for case 1 at 1  bar is removed. Increasing the pressure even further (results not shown here) widens the gap. The end of the gap moves toward higher b values until the curves on the right-hand side of the gap are completely removed, and the start of the gap approaches b =  1 / 3.|$|R

40|$|The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was {{developed}} by NASA and launched aboard the Terra spacecraft on December 18, 1999 and Aqua spacecraft on May 4, 2002. A comprehensive set of remote sensing algorithms for the retrieval of cloud physical and optical properties have enabled over twelve years of continuous observations of cloud properties from Terra and over nine years from Aqua. The archived products from these algorithms include 1 km pixel-level (Level- 2) and global gridded Level- 3 products. In addition to an extensive cloud mask, products include cloud-top properties (temperature, pressure, effective emissivity), cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical and microphysical parameters (optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path), as well as derived statistics. Results include the latitudinal distribution of cloud optical and radiative properties for both liquid water and ice clouds, as well as latitudinal distributions of cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> and cloud <b>top</b> temperature. MODIS finds the cloud fraction, as derived by the cloud mask, is nearly identical {{during the day and}} night, with only modest diurnal variation. Globally, the cloud fraction derived by the MODIS cloud mask is approx. 67 %, with somewhat more clouds over land during the afternoon and less clouds over ocean in the afternoon, with very little difference in global cloud cover between Terra and Aqua. Overall, cloud fraction over land is approx. 55 %, with a distinctive seasonal cycle, whereas the ocean cloudiness is much higher, around 72 %, with much reduced seasonal variation. Cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature have distinct spatial and temporal patterns, and clearly reflect our understanding of the global cloud distribution. High clouds are especially prevalent over the northern hemisphere continents between 30 and 50. Aqua and Terra have comparable zonal cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressures,</b> with Aqua having somewhat <b>higher</b> clouds (cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressures</b> lower by 100 hPa) over land due to afternoon deep convection.

40|$|The Bischoff Blast Furnace Top Gas Process {{for high}} {{pressure}} blast furnaces {{is presented as}} an example of a modern gas treatment process in the iron and steel industry: the work potential of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>top</b> gas is utilized in a plant comprising a gas cleaning unit for dust removal and a turbine for converting the recoverable thermal energy into mechanical and electrical energy. The adjustable annular gap scrubber for separating fine dust also serves as an element for regulating the gas pressure at the blast furnace <b>top</b> so that <b>pressure</b> control by the turbine and its control gear is no longer necessary. Moreover, in the event of a turbine outage the annular gap scrubber can be used as a low noise, pressure-throttling element. The economic use of a turbine for recovering energy from top gas depends on many parameters, such as <b>top</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>top</b> gas rate, clean gas temperature, local cost of electric power, etc. A profitability analysis for a specific installation shows a remarkably short payback period. The process incorporates a new concept in blast air compression. Mechanical energy from the turbine is transferred directly to the axial flow compressor so that the prior conversion of energy via the power generating cycle is dispensed with. Coupled to the turbine is the compressor motor which, while rated to cover the full power requirement, uses about 40 % less electrical power from the power supply system. Finally, {{as an example of}} the future potential of this process, a new continuous steelmaking process is presented which employs a closed top converter. The gas, held under pressure during refining, is subsequently cleaned and expanded as the blast furnace process described above. This gas is cleaned without any entrainment of air to furnish a gaseous fuel of high calorific value. Since the steelmaking process is continuous, the gas is constantly available and can be fed into the distribution system without any intermediate storage...|$|R

The dataset also contains numerical weather prediction (NWP) variables calculated using mathematical models. In the dataset there are also observed cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> and cloud <b>top</b> height estimates from the more accurate instrument on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite.

40|$|The linear {{polarization}} of sunlight reflected by cloudy areas on Earth {{is sensitive to}} the cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> {{as a result of}} molecular scattering above the clouds. We consider the derivation of cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressures</b> using polarimetric data from satellites or aircraft. The inversion method used is based on adding/doubling calculations and a Newton-Raphson iteration scheme developed earlier to analyze the polarization of the planet Venus. A modification of the adding/doubling scheme is presented and used. This approach reduces the execution time for multiple scattering calculations with about an order of magnitude. Two different atmospheric models were used. The first model includes multiple scattering by a cloud layer of spherical water drops and a higher layer of molecules and spherical aerosol particles, whereas in the second model the reflection by the cloud layer is approximated by that of a Lambertian surface and the aerosols in the higher layer are ignored, thereby reducing the necessary computer time by about two orders of magnitude. Using simulated observations, the errors in derived cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressures</b> due to the approximations made in the second model are compared with those due to measurement errors. For a first application of our method to real measurements we used some photopolarimetric data obtained over the Atlantic Ocean by the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME). It is shown that for the data considered the second model leads to errors in derived cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressures</b> which are typically smaller than 80 mb. The measurement errors in the GOME polarization observations at about 355 and 490 nm lead to errors in derived cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressures</b> which are typically smaller than 100 and 200 mb, respectively, so that the second model is sufficiently accurate to derive cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressures</b> from these observations.

The results suggest that ISCCP overestimates the pressure of high-level clouds by up to 50 - 150 mbar, particularly at low latitudes. This {{is caused by the}} frequent presence of clouds with diffuse tops (greater than 50 % time when cloudy events are observed). The averaged vertical extent of the diffuse top is about 1. 5 km. At midlatitudes where the SAGE II and ISCCP cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> agree best, clouds with distinct tops reach a maximum relative proportion of the total level cloud amount (about 30 - 40 %), and diffuse-topped clouds are reduced to their minimum (30 - 40 %).

40|$|The OMI cloud {{pressure}} {{product is}} necessary for accounting for cloud effects on the mission- critical total ozone product. One of the OM 1 cloud pressure algorithms uses UV measurements to derive cloud pressures from the high frequency structure of top- of-atmosphere reflectance caused by rotational Raman scattering (RRS) in the atmosphere. RRS results in filling-in of Fraunhofer lines in the backscatter UV spectra (also known as the Ring effect). The magnitude of filling-in of the Fraunhofer lines is roughly proportional to {{the average number of}} solar photon scatterings in the atmosphere above the clouds. This property of RRS is used to deduce an effective cloud pressure. The cloud pressure algorithm retrieves the cloud pressure and cloud fraction using a concept of the Mixed Lambert Equivalent Reflectivity (MLER) also used for the TOMS-V 8 OM 1 total column ozone algorithm. Currently, this OMI total column ozone algorithm utilizes information about cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressures</b> from a climatology based on IR measurements. The IR-derived cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> is known to be lower than UV-derived cloud <b>top</b> <b>pressure</b> because UV radiation penetrates clouds deeper than IR radiation.
