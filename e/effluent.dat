5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus.

40|$|Abstract. The {{industrial}} <b>effluents</b> {{produced in}} petrochemical production contain kinds of pollutants and fluctuate wildly, also lead sewage plant to be impacted frequently. It is significant {{to develop a}} method that warms the <b>effluents</b> quality early, efficiently and accurately. As a result, it can make the biochemical devices run and manage smoothly. Based on the extreme sensitivity of Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) and Dehydrogenase Activity (DHA) to the abnormal <b>effluents</b> and toxicants, this study proposed a comprehensive assessment method of biodegradability and biotoxicity with Specific Oxygen Uptake Rate (SOUR) and Specific Dehydrogenase Activity (SDHA). And it also discussed the biodegradability and biotoxicity of the industrial <b>effluents</b> with different pH and toxicant by detecting OUR, SOUR and DHA. The results showed that, these three indexes were extremely sensitive and accurate to the <b>effluents</b> quality change. And the maximum concentrations of phenol, formaldehyde and carbinol that the microorganisms can allow in the industrial <b>effluents</b> were 350 mg/L, 70 mg/L and 170 mg/L. When the sewage plant was functioning normally, SOUR and SDHA fluctuations were 3. 0 ~ 7. 0 and 1. 0 ~ 4. 0 respectively. Therefore, they have important application value and prospect to early warming in the <b>effluents</b> quality...|$|R
