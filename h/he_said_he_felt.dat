Henson said he felt the type of humor being written for the show was tedious and unimaginative.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Copeland {{became a}} key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E

25|$|After his A-levels, {{he moved}} to his grandmother's flat in London – where <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> 'destined' to be – and got a job filling graves in Willesden Cemetery, {{although}} {{most of his time}} was spent reading and writing while sitting on gravestones. In a clip later made famous by YouTube, an eighteen-year-old Doherty can be seen in an interview with MTV, {{on the day of the}} release of Oasis' Be Here Now album. He attended Queen Mary, a college of the University of London, to study English literature, but left the course after his first year. After leaving university, he moved into a London flat with friend and fellow musician Carl Barât, who had been a classmate of Doherty's older sister at Brunel University.|$|E
25|$|Four months later, Duke {{was sentenced}} to 15 months in prison, and he served the time in Big Spring, Texas. He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to {{cooperate}} with the Internal Revenue Service and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the United States federal court system and not his guilt. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.|$|E

Spielberg, who once referred to Kubrick as [...] "the greatest master I ever served", now with production underway, admitted, [...] "I felt like I was being coached by a ghost." [...] The film was released in June 2001. It contains a posthumous production credit for Stanley Kubrick {{at the beginning and}} the brief dedication [...] "For Stanley Kubrick" [...] at the end. [...] John Williams's score contains many allusions to pieces heard in other Kubrick films.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Los Alamos, Feynman [...] was put {{in charge}} of the group {{responsible}} for the theoretical work and calculations on the proposed uranium hydride bomb, which ultimately proved to be infeasible. He was sought out by physicist Niels Bohr for one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties. Perhaps because of this, Bohr never warmed to Feynman.|$|E
500|$|Starting in January 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. began {{receiving}} {{telephone calls}} and letters from angry fans {{who claimed to have}} paid their enrollment fees, but had not received the promised memorabilia. Upon investigation, Quintanilla, Jr. discovered Saldívar had embezzled more than $60,000 using forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques. Saldívar's brother, Armando Saldívar, supposedly contacted Gomez and [...] "made up a story" [...] that Saldívar was stealing money from the fan club. Gomez then contacted one of Selena's uncles by telephone; the uncle told Quintanilla, Jr. Armando said he was angry with Saldívar but did not want the reason to be made public; later <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> guilty for starting the rumor.

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to bolster series ratings, NBC repositioned reruns of the show to air on its sister network Bravo, during {{the weeks leading up}} to the season one finale on NBC. These episodes aired on a {{schedule}} of one hour every Friday and three hours every Saturday. Bravo is known to have an audience that is upscale and largely female, which is in line with the new strategy of NBC's then-President Kevin Reilly (now at FOX) for selling the show. When questioned about this strategy, he admitted to having regrets about initially marketing the show incorrectly, saying: “It’s been so clear to me that [...] the show ended up confusing people in terms of what [...] it was supposed to be". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the show is, at its core, a “women's show”, and his wish is that the marketing had reflected that to a greater extent.|$|E
500|$|Samo, {{who sang}} in [...] "Amor Prohibido", told the Ecuadoran {{newspaper}} El Telégrafo {{that he had}} always dreamed of recording a duet with Selena and that [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] {{was one of his}} favorite songs. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the [...] "presence of Selena" [...] as soon as he put his headphones on and began recording. Joey Guerra of the San Antonio Express-News believed that the lead single [...] "proved a solid preview for the album" [...] and that its [...] "wistful lyrics work nicely as a duet with Samo". Guerra described the song as a [...] "gentle pop-rock arrangement" [...] and felt that this arrangement might have been how it was intended. Nilan Lovelace of Reporter Magazine called the remix version of [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] an [...] "album favorite" [...] and believed it to be the type of music that Selena would be recording today.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman did not renew his New Yorker {{contract}} after 2003. [...] He later quipped that {{he regretted}} leaving when he did, {{as he could}} have left in protest when the magazine ran a pro-invasion of Iraq piece later in the year. [...] Spiegelman said his parting from The New Yorker {{was part of his}} general disappointment with [...] "the widespread conformism of the mass media in the Bush era". [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> like he was in [...] "internal exile" [...] following September 11 attacks as the US media had become [...] "conservative and timid" [...] and did not welcome the provocative art that he felt the need to create. [...] Nevertheless, Spiegelman asserted he left not over political differences, as had been widely reported, but because The New Yorker was not interested in doing serialized work, which he wanted to do with his next project.|$|E

500|$|As farms failed, {{many young}} people {{migrated}} from farms to Alberta's cities, where the situation was scarcely better. [...] As the unemployment rate rose, so did labour militancy. [...] December 1932 saw a [...] "hunger march", {{in which more than}} a thousand unemployed men and women attempted to hold a protest march to the Alberta legislature. [...] Brownlee requested the Edmonton city government to prohibit such a display. While he pronounced himself sympathetic to the workers' ordeal, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> such an event would create a volatile atmosphere that would breed radicalism and communism. [...] It was through this lens that he had viewed the 1932 founding of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). Though many UFA members supported this new party, which saw itself as a partnership between farmers and labourers, Brownlee considered it dangerously socialist. When the Hunger March-ers attempted to go ahead without government sanction and were brutally dispersed by Mounties and Edmonton city police, Brownlee took much of the blame.|$|E
500|$|On March 6, 2011, Daniels was {{the winner}} of an Oregon (Republican Party) straw poll.

On May 5, 2011, Daniels told an interviewer that he would announce [...] "within weeks" [...] his decision of whether or not to run for the Republican presidential nomination. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he was not prepared to debate on all the national issues, like foreign policy, and needed time to better understand the issues and put together formal positions.

He started the match against Hearts on 10 September, a 1–1 draw in which he played 65 minutes, received a standing ovation, and was the Scottish Express reporter's [...] "calm and creative" [...] man of the match. He made 14 appearances in the SPL, all starts, and scored once, with a curling shot from [...] after three minutes of the 3–2 home defeat against Motherwell. He also experienced his first senior sending-off; after his [...] "surging run" [...] and cross set up a second-minute goal for Jonny Hayes against Dundee United, he was yellow-carded for a tackle on Gary Mackay-Steven that caused a collision in which Davis's teammate Chris Hogg suffered serious knee damage. Another foul on Mackay-Steven in the 83rd minute earned Davis a second yellow card.|$|E

500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Massa thanked Whiting in the media; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> Whiting [...] "did {{an excellent job of}} managing the situation, making the right decisions as to when to start the race and when to bring in the Safety Car at the right moment". Schumacher, Petrov, Sutil and Buemi also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. Hamilton said he felt the length of time under safety-car conditions was not [...] "good for the spectators and it's not fun for the drivers". He additionally felt the track was dry enough for a normal restart. BBC commentator and former driver Martin Brundle said he felt the race should have started at an earlier time, while Button said he thought the event should have been stopped before visibility became poor. Nevertheless, the Grand Prix was awarded the Race Promoters Trophy at the FIA Gala Awards held in Monte Carlo in December 2010.|$|E
500|$|After denying to a {{reporter}} just {{a month before the}} election that he had a Crédit Mobilier connection, Wilson admitted involvement when he gave testimony before a Senate committee on February 13, 1873. [...] Wilson told members of the investigating committee that in December 1867 he had agreed to purchase $2,000 in Crédit Mobilier stock (20 shares) using Mrs. Wilson's money and in her name. [...] According to Wilson, his wife and he later had concerns about the propriety of the transaction and had never taken possession of the actual stock certificates, so Wilson asked Ames to cancel the transaction and Ames refunded the $2,000 purchase price to Wilson. [...] Wilson said he then returned $814 to Ames – $748 in dividends and $66 in interest that Mrs. Wilson had supposedly earned as profits, even though she had not taken physical possession of her shares. [...] Wilson further claimed that because Mrs. Wilson had refused to take these proceeds from Ames, Wilson took it upon himself to pay her $814 from his own funds to compensate her for the profit she would have made if she had kept the stock, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> obligated to do because his wife had originally agreed to purchase the stock on his recommendation, and had lost money by following his later recommendation to cancel the transaction.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{visited his}} {{aunt and uncle}} in Windsor on leave in May 1975, [...] "proudly wearing his uniform", {{journalist}} Tony Wanless writes. Turned out in the RLI's tartan green ceremonial dress and green beret, he was conspicuous walking along Ouellette Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares. Coincidentally, a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandmother along that very street at the same time, leading Edith's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement. The soldier remained oblivious, but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family. [...] "He had the uniform and looked a little different," [...] Richard told the Windsor Star a year later, [...] "but I never forgot his face." [...] Chaykoski's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused {{to leave the house}} alone. While staying with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time. Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada; in particular he said he [...] "didn't want it associated with his adopted country". He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured, the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital. However, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> great loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service.|$|E
