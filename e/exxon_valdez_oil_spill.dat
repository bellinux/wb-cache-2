By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals.

5|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} to degrade {{a variety of}} organic compounds is remarkable and {{has been used in}} waste processing and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> <b>spill.</b> These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.|$|E
5|$|The average {{lifespan}} of {{bald eagles}} {{in the wild}} is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears {{to be influenced by}} its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a cougar (Puma concolor) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.|$|E

40|$|Though {{humans have}} {{over a century}} of {{experience}} with catastrophic marine and terrestrial <b>oil</b> <b>spills,</b> response plans and cleanup techniques are still active areas of research and development. This work evaluated the oil degradation potential {{and changes in the}} microbial community following nutrient additions in polluted marine sediment and desert soil. Biostimulation experiments on Alaskan beach sediment still contaminated by the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> tanker <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> demonstrated that ambient air and hydrogen peroxide both serve as suitable sources of oxygen to stimulate aerobic microbial degradation of the oil. The addition of oxygen to the oil-contaminated sediment stimulated the growth of Proteobacteria, which made up 77 - 92 % of the population in the presence of ambient oxygen and 76 - 88 % with hydrogen peroxide. These experiments also revealed that sediment samples collected from a non-contaminated portion of the beach also contained a large fraction of microbial species that are known oil degraders. A phytoremediation experiment using mesquite trees in motor-oil-contaminated desert soil indicated that the use of compost as a soil amendment enhanced oil degradation, while biochar hindered degradation activity...|$|R

40|$|The 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) has damaged marine {{ecosystems}} and jeopardized endangered and commercial species under U.

Achieving mandated recovery goals depends on understanding both population trends and the demographic processes that drive those trends.

40|$|I'm {{pleased to}} be here as your keynote speaker from the utility industry. Today is fitting to discuss {{the role of an}} alternative/renewable energy {{resource}} such as geothermal. Three years ago today, the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> tanker <b>spilled</b> 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound, Alaska. This ecological catastrophe was another of those periodic jolts that underscores the importance of lessening our nation's dependence on oil and increasing the use of cost-effective, environmentally benign alternative/renewable energy sources. Alternative/renewables {{have come a long way}} since the first oil crisis in 1973. Today, they provide 9 percent of electric power used in the United States. That's nearly double the figure of just two years ago. And since 1985, one-third of a new capacity has come from geothermal, solar, wind and biomass facilities. Nevertheless, geothermal supplies only about three-tenths of a percent of the country's electric power, or roughly 2, 800 megawatts (MW). And most of that is in California. In fact, geothermal is California's second-largest source of renewable energy, supplying more than 5 percent of the power generated in the state. Today, I'd like to discuss the outlook for the geothermal industry, framing it within Southern California Edison's experience with geothermal and other alternative/renewable energy sources...|$|R

40|$|Major <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> from tankers often {{result in}} severe {{localized}} damage. After the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> grounded on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilling approximately eleven {{million gallons of}} oil, the federal government passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), establishing a federal scheme of <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> prevention, liability, contingency planning, and compensation. Although comprehensive, OPA also specifically allows states to determine their own liability schemes, and to enact other types of legislation. Washington State was {{the first state to}} enact stricter oil pollution prevention regulations than those contained in OPA. These regulations were challenged by the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (Intertanko) in the fall of 1996. The Western District federal court for Washington held the regulations constitutional. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit determined that a few of the challenged rules were unconstitutional because they were design and construction standards, not operational standards. Rhode Island enacted similar regulations, which became effective June 1, 1997, after an <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> fouled its coastline in 1996. This Comment discusses regulations relating to preventing catastrophic <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> from tankers as a result of collisions, groundings, or similar accidents. The primary objective of this Comment is to propose a method for states to enact design, construction, and manning requirements to help prevent <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> that would survive a federal preemption challenge. The proposed method is for states to enact the requirements as an alternative to unlimited liability. By voluntarily adopting the option, a tanker 2 ̆ 7 s potential liability {{in the event of a}} spill would be reduce and/or capped. The liability limit would be instituted once the vessel was found to be in compliance with the enacted requirements. Part Il of this Comment outlines tanker regulation in the United States since the grounding of the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez,</b> highlighting <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> prevention provisions and the state law savings clause under OPA. Part III discusses the actions that Washington has taken to help prevent tanker incidents since OPA was enacted. This includes a discussion of Washington 2 ̆ 7 s regulations and the Intertanko case.
