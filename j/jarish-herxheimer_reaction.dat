40|$|LETTERS Physicians {{should be}} alert for {{relapsing}} fever in travelers, and this diagnosis {{should be considered}} in febrile patients from disease-endemic regions. Diagnosis relies upon examination of stained blood smears. Where available, molecular methods are highly efficient to detect and identify bacterial species. Other tickborne infections (e. g., those with Rickettsia spp.) should also be considered in patients returning from diseaseendemic countries (8). The recommended treatment is doxycycline, although it can cause a <b>Jarish-Herxheimer</b> <b>reaction</b> in some patients...|$|E
40|$|A 25 -year-old male patient without {{significant}} personal or fam-ily medical history {{was admitted to}} the Dermatology Depart-ment suffering from primary syphilis. He was a heterosexual man and the infective sexual contact was approximately five weeks before hospitalization. He started the specific treatment with benzathine penicillin 2. 400. 000 IU followed by the dis-charge from the hospital, as he tolerated the first doses of peni-cillin very well, without <b>Jarish-Herxheimer</b> <b>reaction</b> following the initiation of the antibiotic. He received advice to continue the treatment with penicillin as an outpatient. After ten days the patient returned to the emergency department having an altered general condition, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, oliguria, generalized edema, and lumbar pain. During the medical examination we noticed pale skin, renal type generalized edema, dull pain radiating t...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-three gravidas with {{syphilis}} were monitored with hourly {{vital signs}} and examinations for 24 hours after treatment with benzathine penicillin G. Fifteen (45 %) {{of the subjects}} had a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, including all three, 12 of 20 (60 %), and none of ten of those with primary, secondary, and latent syphilis, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (73 %), uterine contractions (67 %), and decreased fetal movement (67 %). The signs or symptoms began 2 - 8 hours after treatment; fevers peaked at 6 - 12 hours post-therapy and the events usually abated by 16 - 24 hours after treatment. Uterine contractions and decreased fetal activity began concurrent with maternal fever in eight of ten women reporting contractions. Transient late decelerations were detected in three of 11 monitored patients. Three of the women with <b>Jarish-Herxheimer</b> <b>reactions</b> delivered infants with congenital syphilis, including one stillbirth, but none of those without a detectable reaction had fetal treatment failures. Prostaglandin F(2 Î±) and prostacyclin metabolites were elevated transiently in the one subject studied, suggesting their role in mediating the cardiovascular and uterine events in the post-treatment period. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction in pregnancy is similar in frequency, character, and intensity to that in nonpregnant adults, but gravidas may have increased uterine activity and transient alterations in fetal well-being. The pregnant patient with a severely affected fetus with congenital syphilis may experience preterm labor, preterm delivery, or fetal death {{in association with the}} Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction...|$|R
