5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War <b>I</b> <b>started.</b> <b>With</b> wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|E

However, he stated, [...] "I really can't imagine them having TWO drummers on stage, so Jeff will be doing the drumming duties on his own (which he does a great job), although I would love to finish what <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> the Oliva's so long ago.

[...] They played around 225 shows a year, anywhere there were tourists, [...] performing original songs and selling CDs. [...] Soon, he and his band were getting noticed by clubs. [...] "Before I knew it, people would line up on the street for our performances," [...] Benise said. [...] "It's been seven years since <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> the Spanish guitar. We started playing for tourists, then we began renting out theaters and building on that momentum." [...] Benise began promoting his own concerts at 2,000-seat theaters throughout the area.

2500|$|After the rock–dance sound which {{dominated}} {{her previous}} album Simply Deep, Rowland {{felt she was}} still struggling with finding her sound as solo artist, and instead of capitalizing off its international success, the singer and her management settled on [...] "a more urban approach" [...] with her second album. Commenting on her decision, Rowland later told MTV News, [...] "in general, I'm going in the urban, more R route. Of course, that's what <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> Destiny's Child, [...] my first solo album I did more of a pop-sounding record. So I {{wanted to go back}} to my roots and dibble and dabble with some beats." [...] Consequently, Columbia Records consulted a wider range of contemporary R and hip hop producers and artists such as Big Tank, Patrick [...] "J. Que" [...] Smith, Rockwilder, Rich Harrison, Rodney Jerkins, and Robin Thicke to work with Rowland on the album. Female rappers Remy Ma, Eve, and Shawnna also lent their voices to guest parts.|$|E

[...] Hooker's reply was cautious but friendly, saying that [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species.
