500|$|All {{copies of}} the {{original}} Appreciation were ordered destroyed in 1928 and before the [...] "Narrative" [...] had been published Dewar and his brother had already been barred access to the original. [...] However, he continued {{to have a major}} impact on the historiography of the Battle of Jutland by serving throughout the 1920s as Winston Churchill's naval consultant on submarine-warfare. [...] Churchill wrote an anti-Jellicoe tract in his World Crisis, Volume III which in large measure shared Dewar's views on tactics and even some diagrams. [...] Although Dewar would later become a supporter of the Labour Party, after Churchill was passed over for a cabinet position in 1931 Dewar wrote to him on 16 November, [...] "I am very sorry to see that you are not in the new Cabinet. [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> you would go to the Admiralty and do very necessary work for the Navy." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} Wonder Boys, Chabon discovered {{a box of}} comic books from his childhood; a reawakened interest in comics, coupled with memories of the [...] "lore" [...] his Brooklyn-born father {{had told him about}} [...] "the middle years of the twentieth century in America. ...the radio shows, politicians, movies, music, and athletes, and so forth, of that era," [...] inspired him to begin work on a new novel. In 2000, he published The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, an epic historical novel that charts 16 years in the lives of Sammy Clay and Joe Kavalier, two Jewish cousins who create a wildly popular series of comic books in the early 1940s, the years leading up to the entry of the U.S. into World War II. The novel received [...] "nearly unanimous praise" [...] and became a New York Times Best Seller, eventually winning the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Chabon reflected that, in writing Kavalier & Clay, [...] "I discovered strengths <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> that I possessed—the ability to pull off multiple points of view, historical settings, the passage of years—but which had never been tested before." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1929 Stravinsky and Monteux vied {{with each}} other to conduct the first orchestral {{gramophone}} recording of The Rite. While Stravinsky led L'Orchestre des Concerts Straram in a recording for the Columbia label, at the same time Monteux was recording it for the HMV label. Stokowski's version followed in 1930. Stravinsky made two more recordings, in 1940 and 1960. According to the critic Edward Greenfield, Stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but, Greenfield says, in the 1960 recording with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra the composer inspired a performance with [...] "extraordinary thrust and resilience". In conversations with Robert Craft, Stravinsky reviewed several recordings of The Rite made in the 1960s. He thought Herbert von Karajan's 1963 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, was good, but [...] "the performance is... too polished, a pet savage rather than a real one". Stravinsky thought that Pierre Boulez, with the Orchestre National de France (1963), was [...] "less good than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped...</b> very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations". He praised a 1962 recording by The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra [...] for making the music sound Russian, [...] "which is just right", but Stravinsky's concluding judgement was that none of these three performances was worth preserving.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> it would be. I mean, {{if you were}} going to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, it would have been nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{parliamentary}} party agreed {{on this issue}} 12–8, Hall resigned the leadership on 16 March 1972, stating that [...] "I cannot continue to lead a Party that will not follow; I cannot lead a Party which has lost its idealism and which has forgotten that its purpose for existence is to govern successfully {{for the welfare of}} all South Australians. Our Party is still deeply cleft by the persuasive influence of a number of its members in the Legislative Council." [...] Later in the speech, he said [...] "Over the last three years I have been subject to a great deal of disloyalty on a continuing basis ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> this afternoon to move a motion of no confidence in the Government; instead, I found out Party had moved a vote of no confidence in itself." [...] Premier Dunstan, with whom Hall had never had amiable relations, crossed {{the floor of the house}} and shook Hall's hand in a gesture of solidarity. Hall said he [...] "was knifed" [...] and said the conservatives' actions were [...] "a clear example of how deeply the wooden horses of the Legislative Council have entrenched themselves in the ranks of the Assembly membership". The LCL President Ian McLachlan put on a brave face, saying [...] "Mr Hall had some personal problems with the party, but these differences do not make a divided party" [...] but he was quoted the next day as saying that the proposal was mooted to gauge Hall's power. The obscure and low-key conservative Bruce Eastick was installed as the new leader, as some more prominent figures such as Millhouse were seen as too sympathetic to Hall. In the meantime, there was a strong reaction to Hall's departure among the public, and segments of the LCL, notably the youth wings, demonstrated against the events and made motions of objection. Hall had expected to become a normal backbencher, but the groundswell of support prompted a change of heart.|$|E

[...] From the autobiography's point of view, everything about them were successful except that [...] "the vested interests that hold sway over Congress prevented us from cutting spending nearly as much as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to, or as the country required."

2500|$|Ford's {{first film}} of 1950 was the offbeat {{military}} comedy When Willie Comes Marching Home, starring Dan Dailey and Corinne Calvet, with William Demarest, from Preston Sturges 'stock company', and early (uncredited) screen appearances by Alan Hale Jr. and Vera Miles. It {{was followed by}} Wagon Master, starring Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr, which is particularly noteworthy as the only Ford film since 1930 that he scripted himself. It was subsequently adapted into the long-running TV series Wagon Train (with Ward Bond reprising the title role until his sudden death in 1960). Although it did far smaller business than most of his other films in this period, Ford cited Wagon Master as his personal favorite out of all his films, telling Peter Bogdanovich that it [...] "came closest to what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to achieve".|$|E

In one, Woolas' agent, Joe Fitzpatrick, emailed Woolas and campaign adviser Steven Green, to say: [...] "Things are not going as well as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped...</b> {{we need to think}} about our first attack leaflet." [...] A reply from Fitzpatrick said: [...] "If we don't get the white vote angry he's gone." [...] Some have criticised these tactics in light of significant existing racial tensions in the area. The court hearing finished on 17 September 2010, with the judges reserving their judgement until 5 November 2010. On that day Woolas was found to have breached section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 in relation to three of the four statements complained about, and the judges ruled that his election was void. Phil Woolas applied for a judicial review into the ruling, stating that [...] "this election petition raised fundamental issues about the freedom to question and criticise politicians." [...] and that it [...] "will inevitably chill political speech". He succeeded in overturning the finding in respect of one of the three statements but the main findings of the election court judgment were upheld. A by-election on 13 January 2011 resulted in the election of Debbie Abrahams (Labour).|$|E
2500|$|By 1860, {{conditions}} at Pohick Church had deteriorated {{to such a}} state that {{it is unclear whether}} or not the building remained a consecrated house of worship {{at the dawn of the}} American Civil War. With its proximity to Washington, D.C., the building was quickly embroiled in the fighting that rocked Northern Virginia. although in that year a plan was formed by a clergyman from Fairfax, Reverend R. T. Brown, to return the building to active service, a plan which was quashed by the beginning of the conflict. The 2nd Michigan Volunteers, under the command of General Samuel P. Heintzelman, raided the church on November 12, 1861. Lieutenant Charles B. Haydon was outraged at the men's behavior, describing it thus: At 8 ½ A.M. we reached the church 12 miles out. Pohick Church is a brick building built in 1773. Gen. Washington contributed to building it & was a frequent attendant. It has a very ancient look & one would suppose that it might be sacred enough to be secure. I have long known that the Mich 2nd had no fear or reverence as a general thing for God or the places where he is worshiped but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> that the memory of Gen. Washington might protect almost anything with which it was associated. I believe our soldiers would have torn the church down in 2 days. They were all over it in less than 10 minutes tearing off the ornaments, splitting the woodwork and pews, knocking the brick to pieces & everything else they could get at. They wanted pieces to carry away [...] [...] [...] A more absolute set of vandals than our men can not be found on the face of the earth. As true as I am living I believe they would steal Washington's coffin if they could get to it. Private Robert Sneden visited the church in January 1862. He painted a watercolor of the encampents around the building and described its condition in his journal:We reached Pohick Church about 4 pm in a snow storm [...] [...] [...] It was a substantial two story brick structure with white marble, quoins and trimmings and old colonial gambrel roof [...] [...] [...] Here Washington attended service, with all the old first families of the time [...] [...] [...] He drove from Mount Vernon to church in his coach with four horses, tandem fashion as did the others. Now the church was in ruinous condition. Windows were all broken out, doors gone, pews nearly gone, being used for firewood by our pickets. The ceilings broken by the rain coming through the roof, walls discolored black by smoke, etc. The mahogany pulpit was half cut away and carried off for relics, while the cornerstones had been unearthed and the contents carried off. Washington had lain this stone in 1765 [...] and the soldiers who got it out must have found valuable relics. There was not much left for the relic hunters now even the sconces and door knobs and hinges were gone.Confederate General J. Johnston Pettigrew also recorded visiting Pohick Church in his wartime journal.|$|E
