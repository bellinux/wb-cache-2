Wohlers, Mario Citra, Mary Kawa, SRC, Inc., North Syracuse, NY. Glutaraldehyde is a colorless, oily liquid with a sharp, pungent odor. Other {{names for}} {{glutaraldehyde}} include pentanedial, <b>glutaral,</b> and 1, 5 -pentanedial, {{as well as}} a variety of other chemical and trade names. Glutaraldehyde is not stable in its pure form, so it is usually found in a solution mixed with water. Glutaraldehyde is used for industrial, laboratory, agricultural, and medical purposes, primarily for disinfecting and sterilization of surfaces and equipment. It may be found in medical facilities where it is used to disinfect equipment that cannot be subject to heat sterilization. It is also used in industrial cleaning supplies. The majority of the uses of glutaraldehyde are industrial as opposed to consumer applications. For example, it is used in oil and gas recovery, waste water treatment, as a pesticide and in fogging and cleaning of poultry houses, as a chemical intermediate in the production of various materials, in the paper industry, in x-ray processing, in embalming fluid, and for leather tanning. It may be used in select goods, such as paint and laundry detergent...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT – Context- The {{endoscopic}} procedure safety {{depends on the}} use of an adequately reprocessed device which quality is related to each of its operational steps. Objective- To characterize the reprocessing of endoscopes using glutaraldehyde in endoscopy services Methods- Study was conducted by observing the reprocessing of 60 endoscopes from 20 medical practices of the municipality of Goiânia, GO, central area of Brazil. Results- This study showed failure in all reprocessing steps. The pre-washing was performed in 24 (40. 0 %) of the endoscope. In the cleaning steps, was identify the improper use of enzymatic detergent, and in 27 (45. 0 %) cases, the brushing of internal channels was not performed. All 60 endoscopes were submitted to this disinfectant. However, for 33 (55. 0 %) of the cases the internal channels was not filled. The total immersion of endoscope in the glutaraldehyde was not performed in 39 (65. 0 %) cases. The recommended minimum total immersion time for exposure to 2 % glutaraldehyde solution was followed only for 12 (20. 0 %) endoscopes. There was no filter for water treatment used in the rinse of most endoscopes 54 (90. 0 %) and to dry the internal channels only 6 (10. 0 %) of them used compressed air. Adequate storing conditions were identified. Conclusion- Considering the particularities of the endoscope and its reprocessing, it is imperative to establish protocols to ensure the quality of the disinfection and the prevention of cross-contamination. HEADINGS- Endoscopes, gastrointestinal. Disinfection. Equipment contamination. <b>Glutaral...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, guar gum {{microspheres}} containing methotrexate (MTX) were prepared and characterized for local release of {{drug in the}} colon, which {{is a prerequisite for}} the effective treatment of colorectal cancer. Guar gum microspheres were prepared by the emulsification method using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. Surface morphological characteristics were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Particle size, shape, and surface morphology were significantly affected by guar gum concentration, <b>glutaral</b> dehyde concentration, emulsifier concentration (Span 80), stirring rate, stirring time, and operating temperature. MTX-loaded microspheres demonstrated high entrapment efficiency (75. 7 %). The in vitro drug release was investigated using a US Pharmacopeia paddle type (type II) dissolution rate test apparatus in different media (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], gastrointestinal fluid of different pH, and rat cecal content release medium), which was found to be affected by a change to the guar gum concentration and glutaraldehyde concentration. The drug release in PBS (pH 7. 4) and simulated gastric fluids followed a similar pattern and had a similar release rate, while a significant increase in percent cumulative drug release (91. 0 %) was observed in the medium containing rat cecal content. In in vivo studies, guar gum microspheres delivered most of their drug load (79. 0 %) to the colon, whereas plain drug suspensions could deliver only 23 % of their total dose to the target site. Guar gum microspheres showed adequate potential in achieving local release of drug in in vitro release studies, and this finding was further endorsed with in vivo studies...|$|E
