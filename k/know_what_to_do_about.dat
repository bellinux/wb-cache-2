500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times {{wrote that}} despite [...] "its shortcomings" [...] on {{political}} subjects, it [...] "succeeds brilliantly in {{telling the story}} of a man who falls in love with his best buddy's girlfriend and doesn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Tim Appelo of Seattle Weekly praised [...] "the marvelous acting, the sensitive, utterly realistic treatment of the young-love triangle," [...] adding: [...] "The Edukators is educational—not intellectually, but emotionally." [...] Washington Post critic Stephen Hunter praised the film's realism: [...] "The whole thing feels messy, painful, funny and believable, just like that hideous circus known as real life." [...] The Times Howard Swains wrote that it [...] "manages to combine political discourse, a love-triangle and a hostage plot, all without sacrificing its graceful humour." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Carina Chocano described it as a [...] "sweet, funny and gripping romantic adventure," [...] and [...] "The only accurate, ironic and poignant depiction of what it's like to be young and socially committed in the WTO era". Chocano choose it as one of the 13 best films released in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Nathan (Jimmy Bennett) and Amanda (Chloë Grace Moretz) are {{watching}} television after school at Nathan's house as their first [...] "middle school" [...] date. When {{they begin to}} kiss, his older brother Mikey (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) enters {{the living room and}} makes fun of them. Amanda then discovers she is menstruating and tries to hide it, and when Nathan sees blood on her pants, he panics and believes her to be bleeding to death, causing a debacle, which would later have Nathan and Mikey's father Steve (Patrick Warburton) and Amanda's father (Matt Walsh) involved. Amanda calls them out on their stupidity and feels embarrassed to know that she's getting her first period {{in front of them and}} they don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it. When she leaves with her father, Nathan yells that the process of keeping the lining of her internal organs intact by inserting his erect phallus into her vagina is much too complicated and Mikey agrees. Steve cheers them up by farting in front of them. As Mikey goes to the bathroom, Nathan and Steve watch a game on television, which has a very graphic Tampax commercial in which a girl gets eaten by a shark due to her menstruating.|$|E

2500|$|Letterman {{began his}} career as a radio talk show host on WNTS (AM) and on Indianapolis {{television}} station WLWI (which changed its call sign to WTHR in 1976) as an anchor and weatherman. He received some attention for his unpredictable on-air behavior, which included congratulating a tropical storm for being upgraded to a hurricane and predicting hail stones [...] "the size of canned hams." [...] He would also occasionally report the weather and the day's very high and low temps for fictitious cities ("Eight inches of snow in Bingree and surrounding areas") while on another occasion saying that a state border had been erased when a satellite map accidentally omitted the state border between Indiana and Ohio, attributing it to dirty political dealings. ("The higher-ups have removed the border between Indiana and Ohio making it one giant state. Personally, I'm against it. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it.") He also starred in a local kiddie show, made wisecracks as host of a late night TV show called [...] "Freeze-Dried Movies" [...] (he once acted out a scene from Godzilla using plastic dinosaurs), and hosted a talk show that aired early on Saturday mornings called Clover Power, in which he interviewed 4-H members about their projects.|$|E
