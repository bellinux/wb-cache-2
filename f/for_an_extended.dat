30|$|In {{virtue of}} {{preconditioning}} technology, we propose a preconditioning CQ algorithm <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extend</b> split feasibility problem (ESFP). Comparing with the others, the proposed algorithm can get faster convergence without considering {{to adjust the}} stepsize. The convergence is also established under mild conditions. Several extensions of the preconditioning CQ algorithm are presented. Moreover, we present an approximate variable preconditioner which does not compute the matrix inverse. Finally, some numerical experiments show the better behaviors of the proposed methods.|$|R

He {{found it difficult to}} work a non-sports-related job and never held a job <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> period of time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, among others as an extra for several movies, usually playing an American Indian chief in Westerns. He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman (bouncer), a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945. Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic during his later life.|$|E

The hurricane's storm surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E

5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system.

Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within {{four weeks of}} Iniki, while other areas were without power {{for up to three}} months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E
