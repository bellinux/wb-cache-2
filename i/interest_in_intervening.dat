25|$|The {{uprising}} was in {{full swing}} by April, managing to kill several figures at Constantin's court, including Ban Ghiorma Alexeanu and Clucer Cârstea Cornățeanu, as well as a former Vistier, George Karydis. By several accounts, Prince Constantin was his troops' hostage, pretending to endorse the massacres, but secretly asking for a Transylvanian intervention against the Seimeni. This view is partly contradicted by Xenopol, who notes that Constantin had a running dispute with the Transylvanian Prince, George II Rákóczi. The latter was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>intervening</b> against the Seimeni because he wanted Buicescul and his son to take over as puppet rulers of Wallachia. Rákóczi convened a Diet at his capital in Feyérvár (Bălgrad), asking for its permission to commence war in Wallachia. This began on April 13, with a southward march from Segesvár (Sighișoara) to Corona (Brașov), where Rákóczi gathered some 30,000 soldiers and 12 cannons. Faced with this emergency, the Seimeni took an oath from Constantin, who promised again to act as their sovereign. Led at the time by a Muslim, they welcomed Ottoman envoys, assuring them that theirs was not a revolt against the Empire. As Cazacu notes, the Ottoman overseers, in particular Siyavuş Pasha, wanted to join in the war on the Seimeni, but the main Ottoman army was still fearful of a war in the East.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In {{the absence}} of a {{specific}} treatment for dementia, the effective management of cognitive symptoms is a clinical priority. RECENT FINDINGS: Although some differences have been observed in the profile of cognitive complaints observed in subtypes of dementia, there is increasing recognition of common, interacting neurobiological causes suggesting the need to seek a common treatment applicable to all causes of cognitive deterioration. There also exists increasing <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>intervening</b> at the level of minor cognitive dysfunction by reducing risk factors for subclinical states. SUMMARY: Pharmacological treatment of cognitive disorder is beneficial but has only temporary benefit for a subgroup of patients. Pharmacogenetics may have an important future role to play in deciding which patients may best benefit from the treatment. Low side effect therapies such as cognitive therapy and acupuncture show some benefits but their utility in combination with pharmacotherapies remains to be demonstrated. Prevention of milder forms of cognitive disorder by controlling risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes may reduce rates of more severe cognitive degeneration. Persons with cognitive dysfunction are commonly excluded from making decisions about the implementation of cognition-enhancing treatments although they wish to do so...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} major {{statutory}} schemes implicate federal interests but do not provide for explicit authority for the United States to bring lawsuits for damages or to obtain injunctive relief. The patent statutes provide that the patentee may sue {{in the case of}} infringement, and court decisions have extended that right to certain licensees. Accordingly, the United States has participated in cases in which it is not a co-patentee or licensee only as an amicus. Yet the government arguably has an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>intervening</b> in or instituting, as a co-plaintiff, infringement cases involving certain patents. Recent scholarship has renewed attention on whether, and to what extent, the United States may broadly assert a cause of action that is implied from a statute or is based on an inherent, non-statutory authority. The Supreme Court’s current intolerance of rights implied from statutes in cases brought by private litigants means that the government must rely on a different theory in order to potentially succeed in asserting a cause of action. Because the United States has frequently argued that a unique standard for implying a right to sue from a statute should apply when the government is a plaintiff, this article focuses on the most-invoked decision, Wyandotte Transportation Company v. United States. It concludes that Wyandotte is a fragile cornerstone for actions beyond suits to recover pecuniary loss or remedy damage to government property. The article then turns to a little-understood but broad authority that is not dependent on implication from a statute but rather rests on sovereignty and the effectuation of important federal interests. It suggests that this power, which has been referenced in several Supreme Court decisions and argued in several contexts, should be examined anew as a basis for claims by the UnitedStates in cases involving patent infringement...|$|E

The literature of political economy suggests that severe economic crises, excessive foreign debts, and serious budget constraints will lead governments to adopt structural adjustment programs, including trade liberalization and the privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, economic crisis, government deficit, and international pressure caused the government to launch privatization since the late 1980 s. However, the reform of the public sector has occurred in quite different ways in the three countries. In the Philippines, privatization was vigorously pursued by Aquino and Ramos and most SOEs were sold without delay. The Philippines government also showed little <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>intervening</b> in the economy or in competing with private business. In contrast, the Indonesian government has not been willing to liberalize and privatize SOEs, despite strong reform pressure coming from the IMF. Many privatization cases have been delayed since 1999. In Taiwan, the government privatized many SOEs, but the state adopted strong regulatory role and remained in control of privatized SOEs. Similar to Indonesia, privatization in Taiwan after 2000 has been marked by delay and indecision. This dissertation shows that several social and cultural factors, such as ideology, economic nationalism, the culture of using SOEs as patronage tools, and ethnic politics, influence political leaders' perceptions toward the scope and methods of privatization. According to research on privatization, a government's will and capacity to reform, the power of stakeholders, and the characteristics of SOEs (e. g., size, sector, financial records) often affect the implementation of privatization. However, this dissertation finds that the most compelling factors that caused delays of privatization are institutional constraints. Evidence from the three countries suggests that privatization was delayed when a political system encountered autonomous local governments, intensive judicial reviews, or severe partisan rivalry caused either by a multiparty system or a divided government...|$|E

This study challenges this widely held understanding and examines the ways in which young women living on the urban street space in Accra, Ghana 2 ̆ 7 s capital city, produce and create life in this space. I draw on anthropological and sociological conceptualizations of agency and also of space, power, gender and youth to provide an account of these young women 2 ̆ 7 s lives. ^ Drawing on 20 months of ethnographic fieldwork, the study explores the question: How are young women producing life on the streets of Accra, Ghana 2 ̆ 7 s capital city? I begin the study on the premise that the urban space in which these young women find themselves is not some inert physical space and should be taken seriously as a unit of analysis. In investigating {{the ways in which they}} produce life on the street, I look critically at the street space — as a space of work, as a space of violence, as a space of motherhood and finally as a space of transition. Throughout the chapters, I show that the structure of the street space influences the ways in which young women act, and young women 2 ̆ 7 s actions are also based on present survival on the street and their narrations of their future. I show how through work, motherhood and violence these women actively work to create and produce life in spite of the constraints they face on a daily basis. ^ This study makes theoretical contributions to the way in which young women on the street are studied by providing a more complicated analysis of their lives, which is situated at the intersection of agency, power, space, gender and youth. An understanding of the complexity of young women 2 ̆ 7 s lives on the street provides stakeholders <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>intervening</b> <b>in</b> the lives of street girls a framework which offers insights for designing effective programs that will pay particular attention to these complex lives. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study in}} three parts: the first three {{chapters}} cover the creation of early Qing policies of administration and market regulation and the implementation of those policies in Chongqing during the era when it was still an imperial frontier. The middle two chapters detail the growth and expansion of nineteenth-century institutions of market governance and municipal administration during the era of Chongqing's rise as a major center of trade in the empire. The final three chapters document how merchants employed the court in addition to the other institutions outlined in previous chapters to resolve their disputes, and how these patterns changed over time. This study is, first and foremost, a reexamination of how central policies, local administrative conventions, and market practices combined to form a dynamic and sophisticated atmosphere for the conduct of exchange and the enforcement of economic agreements. Its major finding is that the Qing court of Chongqing relied upon several local administrative institutions - including collective responsibility units, merchant groups, and licensed brokerages - to monitor and intervene in market activity, and that the use of these institutions profoundly influenced the way that the court handled commercial disputes. From the middle of the eighteenth century, the Qing state chose not to invest in legal definitions of rights or obligations between individuals engaged in commerce, but rather to invest in administrative and legal means of supervising the local institutions that were given de facto responsibility over determining and enforcing commercial obligations outside of the court. The decision to govern markets indirectly reflected certain basic facts about the political economy of Qing China, and continued to determine the options available to the Qing state as its <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>intervening</b> in economic affairs increased over time. The end result of the development of eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century market institutions was that, when the Qing state did codify several laws about the market in the early twentieth century, the most important innovations it offered were not laws about individual economic interaction, but rather the composition and function of the groups by which merchants were managed. I argue that this long transition must be understood to appreciate how and why China's markets were managed differently in the twentieth - and now the twenty-first - century...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{international}} economic disputes have become ever more legalized, which in principle allows states to compartmentalize individual disputes from broader diplomatic relations. Nowhere {{is this more}} true than in the international investment regime, where private investors have been empowered to directly sue host states in international arbitration, {{rather than relying on}} their home states for diplomatic support. I challenge the standard narrative that investment protection has become "depoliticized", and reveal the persistent importance of informal commercial diplomacy in the settlement of investment disputes. I show that the US government continues to <b>intervene</b> diplomatically <b>in</b> disputes between American investors and developing country governments, despite the availability of institutional alternatives. Moreover, I argue such interventions are not primarily driven by pressure from private companies, but by government bureaucracies strategically pursuing their own interests, including advocating for investment climate reforms and demonstrating the value of commercial diplomacy to domestic constituencies. The empirical support for these claims proceeds in three stages. First, I use zero-inflated negative binomial regressions to demonstrate that American investors are more likely to file formal arbitration claims when they are less able to rely on diplomatic support, namely when the position of ambassador to the host state is temporarily vacant. Second, I provide a behind-the-scenes look at American investment protection policy using an original dataset of US diplomatic interventions in 256 investment disputes discussed in internal State Department cables released via WikiLeaks. Third, I use structured, focused comparisons in seven case studies of investment disputes to probe the particular drivers of US intervention, and show that diplomatic engagement is most likely in cases where the state itself has strong <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>intervening,</b> rather than when private pressure compels it to do so. This thesis makes important and original contributions both to the literature on the international investment regime â which to date has broadly ignored the role of commercial diplomacy in contemporary dispute settlement â and to broader debates on the legalization of international economic disputes and the strategies firms use to shield themselves from political risks. </p...|$|R
