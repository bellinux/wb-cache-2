50|$|My {{youthful}} exuberance cooled as I {{moved up}} the rungs of power. On Capitol Hill, <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> for a congressman who “misremembered” basic facts (Smith), such as the “Eisenhower assassination.” <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> for a senator who hid from his own staff (Abraham).|$|R
25|$|Nothing {{changed in}} my life since <b>I</b> <b>work</b> all the time. I've spent 30 years writing fiction. For the first 10 years, I worried about money and no one asked how much money I made. The second decade I spent money {{and no one was}} asking about that. And I've spent the last 10 years with {{everyone}} expecting to hear how I spend the money, which I will not do.|$|E
25|$|Business: {{two or more}} {{companies}} join forces in a joint venture or a consortium to <b>i)</b> <b>work</b> on a project (e.g. industrial or research project) which would be too heavy or too risky for a single entity, ii) join forces to have a stronger position on the market, iii) comply with specific regulation (e.g. in some emerging countries, foreigners can only invest {{in the form of}} partnerships with local entrepreneurs. In this case, the alliance may be structured in a process comparable to a Mergers & Acquisitions transaction.|$|E

The MBTA opened bid solicitations for Phase I construction elements, which represent preliminary work that can be done while the main project is in final design, in July 2012. The work includes the $15.3 million reconstruction of the two railroad bridges, as well as the $3 million demolition. Phase <b>I</b> <b>work</b> was to last until early 2015.|$|E

25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>work</b> at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E

500|$|The pilot episode {{aired in}} October rather than September, {{which was a}} month after new fall season shows {{normally}} premiered.

[...] I'm like [...] "I'm not a dick, I'm going to tell the truth." [...] I wrote it two years ago when I was writing and recording Teenage Dream, [...] it didn't feel right on the record.

500|$|Jovovich {{established}} a charitable foundation in 2005 to help Ukrainian children. At {{the time she}} referred to herself: [...] "I am a strong Ukrainian girl, that is why <b>I</b> <b>work</b> a lot". However, later, in an interview for the Ukrainian version of the Vogue magazine, Milla stated she doesn't actually consider herself Ukrainian. Expressing her disagreement with several newspapers that presented Jovovich as a [...] "Ukrainian actress", her mother Galina said, [...] "They may say whatever they want. My parents are Russian, from Tula. Milla is half Russian, half Montenegrin. But, I think, she considers herself of Russian descent".|$|E
500|$|Lucan left Brandt's {{in about}} 1960, {{shortly after he}} had won £26,000 playing chemin de fer. A {{colleague}} had been promoted before him, and he protested and then gave up his job, saying [...] "why should <b>I</b> <b>work</b> in a bank, when I can earn a year's money in one single night at the tables?" [...] He travelled to the United States, where he played golf, raced powerboats, and drove his Aston Martin around the West Coast. He also visited his elder sister Jane, and his former guardian, Marcia Tucker. On his return to England he moved out of his parents' home in StJohn's Wood and into a flat in Park Crescent.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{explained}} {{the process of}} recording an episode {{in an interview with}} Animerica Magazine; first, the script is translated from Japanese into English, it is then adapted to fit the lip flap (movement of the mouth). Taylor said that she is {{the only one in the}} recording booth when she works, as they record each voice separately throughout each episode. Taylor added that she is often the first one to record so she has to imagine how the previous line would be said. [...] "Luckily, <b>I</b> <b>work</b> with a great director who helps with the interpretation of the line, matching of the lip flap, and consistency of the voice," [...] she said.|$|E
500|$|As soon as Hemingway {{returned}} to Finca Vigía in Cuba, he {{began work on}} a book about the safari, wanting to write while it was still vivid in his memory. [...] He quickly wrote 10,000 words, despite his pain (eventually the manuscript grew to about 800 pages). In September 1954, Hemingway wrote in a letter, [...] "At present <b>I</b> <b>work</b> at about 1/2 the capacity I should but everything is better all the time." [...] However, three months later in late December he wrote in a letter: [...] "This has been sort of a rough year.... We call this 'black-ass' and one should never have it. [...] But I get tired of pain sometimes, even if that is an ignoble feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor met DeBorah Sharpe in 1977 {{during the}} {{production}} of The Wiz where she was the understudy for Dorothy. They married in 1980 and had a son, Adamah. In his spare time, Taylor often helped teach vulnerable young people {{through a variety of}} projects, including at the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey. He noted [...] "things have come out of the air for me...I'm grateful; that's why <b>I</b> <b>work</b> with kids. I've had a blessing in my career, to have gone as far as I've gone." [...] A 1995 piece in The Plain Dealer described Taylor as [...] "A jolly giant of a man, he looks like a natural force – a mountain, perhaps, who can tell great stories." [...] Taylor was a Christian.|$|E

500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] {{was written}} by Bill Wrubel and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Graces season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; [...] "I just love Megan. And so I said, 'Well, {{if you let me}} do it with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [...] It was fun. For me now, it's about who <b>I</b> <b>work</b> with." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan has {{described}} his filmmaking {{process as a}} combination of intuition and geometry. [...] "I draw a lot of diagrams when <b>I</b> <b>work.</b> I {{do a lot of}} thinking about etchings by Escher, for instance. That frees me, finding a mathematical model or a scientific model. I'll draw pictures and diagrams that illustrate the movement or the rhythm that I'm after." [...] Caltech physicist and Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne compared Nolan's [...] "deep" [...] intuition to scientists such as Albert Einstein, noting that the director intuitively grasped things non-scientists rarely understand. Upon his own decision-making of whether or not to start work on a project, the filmmaker has proclaimed a belief in the sincerity of his passion for something within the particular project in question as a basis for his selective thought.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{commenting on}} the success American Idiot brought the band, Sam Bayer, {{director}} of all of American Idiots music videos, stated [...] "The Billie Joe that <b>I</b> <b>work</b> with {{now is not the}} same guy that walked onto the American Idiot set a year ago. Now, he's a rock star. They were famous.They had done big stuff. But it's transcended that. [...] But he hasn't changed. And they haven't changed. They're three friends who love one another". Courtney Love also commented on the success of the band, stating [...] "Billie Joe looks absolutely beautiful. You know how when people get super A-list, their face gets prettier? I think it's perception. [...] It's something that happens in your subconscious". At the time of American Idiots release, the album was not sold in Wal-Mart due to its explicit content.|$|E
