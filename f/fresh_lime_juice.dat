40|$|MATRIX-ASSISTED CONCENTRATION AND MICROENCAPSULATION OF <b>LIME</b> <b>JUICE</b> Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2011 Graciela W. Padua, Adviser <b>Lime</b> <b>juice</b> {{is widely}} used in American and {{international}} cuisine for its characteristic flavor and high taste impact. It is mostly used as a flavoring agent {{but also as a}} preservative. <b>Lime</b> <b>juice</b> is not stable upon storage. Flavor deterioration is readily apparent. Thus, developing methods to preserve its flavor is an important goal. Dehydration {{is widely used}} as a food preservation method. Spray drying is the most common method used in the food industry to dry fruit juices and obtain powders. Spray drying yields free flowing powders; however, it does not maintain the original flavor. Thus, the goal of this work was to develop a process to render <b>lime</b> <b>juice</b> as a free flowing dry product with an authentic fruit flavor. The main objectives were (1) to investigate the potential of a novel matrix-assisted process to obtain a free flowing dry product; (2) to investigate the effectiveness of zein as an encapsulation matrix for citrus juice flavor components; (3) to characterize the microstructure of resulting dried juices; (4) to evaluate the sensory attributes of obtained dried juices. Results showed that the matrix-assisted process to concentrate and encapsulate <b>lime</b> <b>juice</b> yielded a free flowing dry product. Zein was found useful to effectively encapsulate <b>lime</b> <b>juice</b> components. The formation of encapsulated micro-clusters was observed by SEM and bright field microscopy. Sensory attributes of the matrix-assisted process were investigated by descriptive analysis and compared to commercially available samples. <b>Lime</b> <b>juice</b> obtained through the matrix-assisted process showed a higher intensity of <b>fresh</b> <b>lime</b> flavor compared to commercial samples. The matrix-assisted process was considered to produce a <b>lime</b> <b>juice</b> powder with better flavor characteristics than other dehydration processes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOutbreaks of the corallivorous crown-of-thorns seastar Acanthaster planci (COTS) {{represent}} one of {{the greatest}} disturbances to coral reef ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific, affecting not only coral reefs but also the coastal communities which rely on their resources. While injection approaches are increasingly used in an attempt to control COTS densities, most of them display severe drawbacks including logistical challenges, high residual environmental impacts or low cost-effectiveness. We tested a new alternative control method based upon acidic injections of cheap, 100 % natural products. We investigated the lethal doses, intra-and inter-specific disease transmission and immune responses of COTS when injected with <b>fresh</b> <b>lime</b> <b>juice</b> (extracted from local Citrus arantifolia) and white spirit vinegar. High COTS mortality was achieved with small volumes: 10 – 20 ml per seastar induced death in 89 %/ 97 % of injected specimens after an average 34. 3 h/ 29. 8 h for lime juice and vinegar respectively. Highest efficiency was reached for both solutions with double shots of (2 × 10 ml) in two different areas on the body: 100 % mortality occurred within 12 – 24 h, which is similar or faster compared with other current injection methods. Multiple immune measures suggested that death was very likely caused by pH stress from the acidic solutions rather than a bacterial infection. Contagion to either conspecifics or a variety of other reef species was not observed, even at COTS densities 15 times higher than the highest naturally reported. 10 to 20 l lime juice/vinegar could kill up to a thousand COTS at a cost of less than 0. 05 USD per specimen; no permits or special handling procedures are required. We conclude that injections of lime juice and vinegar offer great advantages when compared to current best practises and constitute a cheap and natural option for all reefs affected by COTS...|$|E
