40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare pulsed wave (PW) Doppler {{velocity}} measurements obtained from duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries with subjects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> and supine positions in an attempt to determine if this would influence the velocity criteria used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classification of the severity of internal carotid artery disease. Methods: Carotid duplex ultrasound examinations were performed on 42 volunteers with measurement of peak systolic velocities (PSV) and end diastolic velocities (EDV) using a Doppler angle of 60 u. The measurements were obtained from both the right and left extracranial carotid vessels <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> and supine positions. t-tests were used to compare the mean velocities obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> versus supine positions. Results: PSV and EDV measurements obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> position were lower than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supine position. Statistical analysis comparing <b>the</b> means <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> versus <b>the</b> supine position showed statistical significance at the p 50. 05 level for all measurements except the PSV of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Conclusions: Duplex ultrasound PW Doppler derived velocity criteria are used to classify the severity of stenosis, which in turn impacts on patient treatment options. The carotid duplex scan can be adequately performed on patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> position but velocities measured will be reduced and modification to the existing velocity criteria may be needed.
