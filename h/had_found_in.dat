5|$|Fabian Cancellara {{was born}} on 18 March 1981, in Wohlen bei Bern, Switzerland, to Italian parents. He {{discovered}} cycling {{at the age of}} 13 after falling in love with an old family bike that he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the garage and immediately gave up football to concentrate on cycling. In addition, Cancellara excelled at cross-country skiing during his youth.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Canadian Davidson Black {{identified}} two fossilized teeth he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Zhoukoudian near Beijing {{as belonging to}} an ancient human, and named his specimen Sinanthropus pekinensis, now better known as Peking Man. In December 1929, {{the first of several}} skullcaps was found on the same site, and it appeared similar but slightly larger than Java Man. Franz Weidenreich, who replaced Black in China after the latter's death in 1933, argued that Sinanthropus was also a transitional fossil between apes and humans, and was in fact so similar to Java's Pithecanthropus that they should both belong to the family Hominidae. Eugène Dubois categorically refused to entertain this possibility, dismissing Peking Man as a kind of Neanderthal, closer to humans than the Pithecanthropus, and insisting that Pithecanthropus belonged to its own family, the Pithecanthropoidae.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of that year Mendelssohn {{directed}} the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Düsseldorf, beginning with a performance of Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt prepared from the original score which he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> London. This precipitated a Handel revival in Germany, similar to the reawakened interest in J. S. Bach following his performance of the St Matthew Passion. Mendelssohn worked with dramatist Karl Immermann to improve local theatre standards, and made his first appearance as an opera conductor in Immermann's production of Mozart's Don Giovanni {{at the end of}} 1833, where he took umbrage at the audience's protests about the cost of tickets. His frustration at his everyday duties in Düsseldorf, and the city's provincialism, led him to resign his position at the end of 1834. He had offers from both Munich and Leipzig for important musical posts, and decided in 1835 to accept the latter.|$|E
5|$|The 1530, Herbarum Vivae Eicones of Brunfels {{contained}} the admired botanically accurate original woodcut colour illustrations of Hans Weiditz along with descriptions of 47 species new to science. Bock, in {{setting out to}} describe the plants of his native Germany, produced the New Kreuterbuch of 1539 describing the plants he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the woods and fields but without illustration; this was supplemented by a second edition in 1546 that contained 365 woodcuts. Bock was possibly the first to adopt a botanical classification in his herbal which also covered details of ecology and plant communities. In this, he was placing emphasis on botanical rather than medicinal characteristics, unlike the other German herbals and foreshadowing the modern Flora. De Historia Stirpium (1542 with a German version in 1843) of Fuchs was a later publication with 509 high quality woodcuts that again paid close attention to botanical detail: it included many plants introduced to Germany {{in the sixteenth century}} that were new to science. The work of Fuchs is regarded as being among the most accomplished of the Renaissance period.|$|E
5|$|Townshend {{wrote the}} song as a closing {{number of the}} Lifehouse project, and the lyrics criticise {{revolution}} and power. To symbolise the spiritual connection he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> music via the works of Meher Baba and Inayat Khan, he programmed a mixture of human traits into a synthesizer and used it as the main backing instrument throughout the song. The Who tried recording the song in New York in March 1971, but re-recorded a superior take at Stargroves the next month using the synthesizer from Townshend's original demo. Ultimately, Lifehouse as a project was abandoned in favour of Who's Next, a straightforward album, where it also became the closing track. It has been performed as {{a staple of the}} band's setlist since 1971, often as the set closer, and was the last song drummer Keith Moon played live with the band.|$|E

25|$|In 1891 Santiago Ramón y Cajal {{described}} slender horizontal bipolar cells he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> an histological {{preparation of}} the developing marginal zone of lagomorphs. These cells were then considered by Gustaf Retzius as homologous to the ones he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the marginal zone of human fetuses around mid-gestation in 1893 and 1894. He described those cells as having large, horizontal, sometimes vertically orientated somata located at {{some distance from the}} pia.|$|E
25|$|The {{first volume}} was issued in 11 parts, {{beginning}} in 1864. They {{were published in}} two volumes in 1869 and 1872.

25|$|Winnicott's {{theoretical}} elusiveness {{has been}} linked to his efforts to modify Kleinian views. But whereas from a Kleinian standpoint, his repudiation of the concepts of envy and the death instinct were a resistant retreat from the harsh realities she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> infant life, he has also been accused of being too close to Klein: of sharing in her regressive shift of focus away from the Oedipus complex to the pre-oedipal.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, the Court {{once again}} heard a {{securities}} dispute where arbitrability {{was the central}} question. In Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd a brokerage firm sought to compel a client to arbitrate state-law fraud claims as Southland had required; the client resisted citing the need to avoid needless bifurcation. The Court held unanimously that the strong pro-arbitration policy it <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the FAA in Moses Cone required that split.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the hearing}} {{there had been}} a spate of {{criticism}} of the South African Judiciary by Zuma supporters, amongst whom were some prominent legal minds, such as Paul Ngobeni. In that context, the irony was that this was the third time the South African Judiciary <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> his favour, including Zuma's acquittal of the rape charge brought against him. The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal the decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{incentive}} to give outward practical expression to her inward motive was inspired in Teresa by the Franciscan priest Saint Peter of Alcantara who became acquainted with her early in 1560, and became her spiritual guide and counselor. She now resolved {{to found a}} reformed Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Cloister of the Incarnation and others. Guimara de Ulloa, a woman of wealth and a friend, supplied the funds. Teresa worked for many years encouraging Spanish Jewish converts to follow Christianity.|$|E

The arrest occurred after his wife reported to police that she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> his Internet search engine history a series of chat room communications on Dark Fetish Net, a forum dedicated to sexual fetishes and fantasies involving torture, rape, murder and cannibalism. Valle had been chatting with another user about torturing and murdering her, as well as murdering and cannibalizing more than 100 other women.|$|E
25|$|His careful {{analysis}} of the urine of the two affected siblings led him to request many physicians near Oslo to test the urine of other affected patients. This led {{to the discovery of}} the same substance he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> eight other patients. He conducted tests and found reactions that gave rise to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid, which led him to conclude that the compound contained a benzene ring. Further testing showed the melting point to be the same as phenylpyruvic acid, which indicated that the substance was in the urine.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{achievements}} of 19th century archaeology was the development of stratigraphy. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new geological and paleontological work of scholars like William Smith, James Hutton and Charles Lyell. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of prehistorical and Bronze Age sites. In {{the third and fourth}} decades of the 19th century, archaeologists like Jacques Boucher de Perthes and Christian Jürgensen Thomsen began to put the artifacts they <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> chronological order.|$|E

25|$|Gracie {{boarded the}} Titanic at Southampton on April 10, 1912 and was {{assigned}} first-class cabin C51. He {{spent much of}} the voyage chaperoning various unaccompanied women, including Mrs. Helen Churchill Candee, Mrs. E.D. (Charlotte) Appleton, Mrs. R.C. (Malvina) Cornell, and Mrs. J.M. (Caroline) Brown. He also spent time reading books he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the first-class library, socializing with his friend J. Clinch Smith, and discussing the Civil War with Isidor Straus. He was known among the other first-class passengers as a tireless raconteur who had an inexhaustible supply of stories about Chickamauga and the Civil War in general.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 Woodard {{was elected}} councilman in Juniper Hills (Los Angeles County), California. In this {{capacity}} {{he proposed a}} sister city relationship with Nueva Germania, Paraguay. To advance his plan, Woodard travelled to the erstwhile vegetarian/feminist utopia and met with its municipal leadership. Following an initial visit, {{he chose not to}} pursue the relationship but <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the community an object of study for later writings. What particularly interests him are the proto-transhumanist ideas of speculative planner Richard Wagner and Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, who along with her husband Bernhard Förster founded and lived in the colony between 1886 and 1889.|$|E
25|$|Ten weeks later, a local woman {{turned in}} Froon's blue backpack, {{which she said}} she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> a rice paddy by a {{riverbank}} near her village of Alto Romero, in the Bocas del Toro region; {{she said she was}} sure it had not been there the day before. The backpack contained two pairs of sunglasses, $83 in cash, Froon's passport, a water bottle, Froon's camera, two bras, and the women's phonesall packed, dry, and in good condition. The women's phones showed that for some hours after the start of their hike someone had dialed 112 (the emergency number in the Netherlands) and 911 (the emergency number in Panama).|$|E
