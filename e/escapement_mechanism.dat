5|$|During the 11th {{century in}} the Song Dynasty, the Chinese astronomer, horologist and {{mechanical}} engineer Su Song created a water-driven astronomical clock for his clock tower of Kaifeng City. It incorporated an <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{as well as the}} earliest known endless power-transmitting chain drive, which drove the armillary sphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known clock with a water-powered <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which transferred {{rotational energy}} into intermittent motions, {{dates back to}} 3rd century in ancient Greece; Chinese engineers later invented clocks incorporating mercury-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century, followed by Iranian engineers inventing water clocks driven by gears and weights in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39inches) long {{to the center of the}} bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E
50|$|An Artuki by {{the name}} of Al-Jazari built five {{machines}} to pump water for the kings of the Turkish Artuqid dynasty and their palaces. Besides over 50 ingenious mechanical devices, Al-Jazari also developed and made innovations to segmental gears, mechanical controls, <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> clocks, robotics, and protocols for designing and manufacturing methods.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} liquid-driven escapement {{was described}} by the Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) in his technical treatise Pneumatics (chapter 31) {{as part of a}} washstand. A counterweighted spoon, supplied by a water tank, tips over in a basin when full, releasing a spherical piece of pumice in the process. Once the spoon has emptied, it is pulled up again by the counterweight, closing the door on the pumice by the tightening string. Remarkably, Philo's comment that [...] "its construction {{is similar to that of}} clocks" [...] indicates that such <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were already integrated in ancient water clocks.|$|R
50|$|The verge (or crown wheel) {{escapement}} is {{the earliest}} known type of mechanical <b>escapement,</b> the <b>mechanism</b> in a mechanical clock that controls its rate by allowing the gear train to advance at regular intervals or 'ticks'. Its origin is unknown. Verge escapements were used from the 14th century until the mid 19th century in clocks and pocketwatches. The name verge comes from the Latin virga, meaning stick or rod.|$|R
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E
5|$|In his writing, Su Song credited, as the {{predecessor}} of his working clock, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere of Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist. Su Song was also {{strongly influenced by}} the earlier armillary sphere created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> and used liquid mercury instead {{of water in the}} waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time). However, Su Song stated in his writing that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.|$|E
5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem {{from time to time}} during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E
40|$|<b>Escapement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{hold back}} {{a stream of}} parts driven either by {{mechanical}} or pneumatic means for a length of time and release a single part as required to an assembly station. They are used in most automatic multi-component assembly equipment. They occupy a significant design space and have dynamic characteristics of their own. This research aimed to develop a novel high speed <b>mechanism</b> for parts <b>escapement</b> that occupies less design space and contributes less to the dynamic activity of the structure. Several conceptual mechanisms were generated and evaluated. A compliant mechanism that amplifies the very small displacement of a piezo actuator was selected for detailed design. A proof of concept prototype was fabricated and tested. A piezo stack was used to bend a thin, spring steel, compliant beam. Its deflection was further amplified by attaching a comparatively rigid beam extension {{at the end of}} the compliant section. The mechanism escapes parts at 16 Hz using constrained layer damping on the beam to reduce vibrations. The concept is feasible to use on production machinery and provides advantages in terms of higher operating speeds and compactness. The concept could also be used where there is a requirement of high speed gating. i...|$|R
5000|$|The {{assemblies}} {{that control}} movement are also called [...] "mechanisms." [...] Mechanisms are generally classified as gears and gear trains, which includes belt drives and chain drives, {{cam and follower}} mechanisms, and linkages, though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages, indexing <b>mechanisms,</b> <b>escapements</b> and friction devices such as brakes and clutches.|$|R
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} incorporated several components {{adapted from}} existing devices, such as <b>escapement</b> (a <b>mechanism</b> governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers {{adapted from the}} piano. In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs {{which could have been}} avoided. The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular typebar orientation. A circular arrangement had been used more than 30years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.|$|R
5|$|Technology {{during the}} Tang period was built also upon the {{precedents}} of the past. Advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E
25|$|Villard de Honnecourt (fl. 13th century), a French {{engineer}} and architect who made sketches of mechanical {{devices such as}} automatons and perhaps drew {{a picture of an}} early <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> for clockworks.|$|E
50|$|Simon Willard's shelf clocks were weight-driven {{and some}} models had an {{extended}} {{base for the}} weight so they achieved a one-week running period. Also, they had a pinwheel <b>escapement.</b> Their strike <b>mechanism</b> was the rack and snail. The pendulum length could be adjusted {{through a hole in}} the clock face at the 12 o'clock position, so it was not necessary to open the case.|$|R
50|$|In horology, {{the anchor}} {{escapement}} {{is a type}} of escapement used in pendulum clocks. The <b>escapement</b> is a <b>mechanism</b> in a mechanical clock that maintains the swing of the pendulum by giving it a small push each swing, and allows the clock's wheels to advance a fixed amount with each swing, moving the clock's hands forward. The anchor escapement was so named because one of its principal parts is shaped vaguely like a ship's anchor.|$|R
5000|$|In early versions, {{the valves}} or plugs {{as they were}} then called, were {{operated}} manually by the plug man but the repetitive action demanded precise timing, making automatic action desirable. This was obtained {{by means of a}} plug tree which was a beam suspended vertically alongside the cylinder from a small arch head by crossed chains, its function being to open and close the valves automatically when the beam reached certain positions, by means of tappets and <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanisms</b> using weights. On the 1712 engine, the water feed pump was attached {{to the bottom of the}} plug tree, but later engines had the pump outside suspended from a separate small arch-head. There is a common legend that in 1713 a cock boy named Humphrey Potter, whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended, made the engine self-acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches (known as the [...] "potter cord"); however the plug tree device (the first form of valve gear) was very likely established practice before 1715, and is clearly depicted in the earliest known images of Newcomen engines by Henry Beighton (1717) (believed by Hulse to depict the 1714 Griff colliery engine) and by Thomas Barney (1719) (depicting the 1712 Dudley Castle engine). Because of the very heavy steam demands, the engine had to be periodically stopped and restarted, but even this process was automated by means of a buoy rising and falling in a vertical stand pipe fixed to the boiler (the first pressure gauge?). The buoy was attached to the scoggen, a weighted lever that worked a stop blocking the water injection valve shut until more steam had been raised.|$|R
25|$|Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio (c. 1330-1388) was a clockmaker from Padua, Italy who {{designed}} the astarium, an astronomical clock and planetarium that utilized the <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> that had been recently invented in Europe. He also attempted to describe {{the mechanics of the}} solar system with mathematical precision.|$|E
25|$|The first water clocks {{to employ}} complex {{segmental}} and epicyclic gearing was invented earlier by the Arab engineer Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia c. 1000. His water clocks were driven by water wheels, as {{was also the}} case for several Chinese water clocks in the 11th century. Comparable water clocks were built in Damascus and Fez. The latter (Dar al-Magana) remains until today and its mechanism has been reconstructed. The first European clock to employ these complex gears was the astronomical clock created by Giovanni de Dondi in c. 1365. Like the Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed an <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> which they employed in some of their water clocks. The <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> was {{in the form of}} a constant-head system, while heavy floats were used as weights.|$|E
25|$|Between 270 BCE and 500 CE, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers were {{developing}} more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity {{was aimed at}} regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang bells and gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe. The 3rd century BCE engineer Philo of Byzantium referred in his works to water clocks already fitted with an <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the earliest known of its kind.|$|E
25|$|Pendulums (unlike, for example, quartz crystals) have a {{low enough}} Q that the {{disturbance}} caused by the impulses to keep them moving is generally the limiting factor on their timekeeping accuracy. Therefore, {{the design of the}} <b>escapement,</b> the <b>mechanism</b> that provides these impulses, has a large effect on the accuracy of a clock pendulum. If the impulses given to the pendulum by the escapement each swing could be exactly identical, the response of the pendulum would be identical, and its period would be constant. However, this is not achievable; unavoidable random fluctuations in the force due to friction of the clock's pallets, lubrication variations, and changes in the torque provided by the clock's power source as it runs down, mean that the force of the impulse applied by the escapement varies.|$|R
50|$|An <b>escapement</b> is the <b>mechanism</b> in a {{mechanical}} timepiece {{that gives the}} balance wheel pushes to keep it moving back and forth, and releases the timepiece's gears to advance a fixed amount with each swing of the wheel, thus moving the hands forward at a steady rate. The pin pallet escapement {{is similar to the}} lever escapement, which is used in quality watches, except that the horizontal jewel pallets on the lever are replaced with vertical metal pins, and the shape of the escape wheel teeth is modified.|$|R
50|$|After much experimentation, Daniels had {{designed}} {{a new type}} of watch escapement by 1974. The mechanism, which was first unveiled in 1976 and patented in 1980, was called the coaxial escapement. Its design avoided the need to add oil to the <b>escapement</b> because the <b>mechanism</b> operated with very low friction. Traditional escapements had to use lubricants but this eventually caused problems with accuracy as oil thickened over time. But coaxial escapement used radial friction instead of sliding friction making lubricants unnecessary. Daniels' mechanism has since been described as the most important development in horology in the past 250 years.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} notable {{contributors}} {{to the field of}} Chinese science throughout the ages. One of the best examples would be Shen Kuo (1031–1095), a polymath scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the magnetic-needle compass used for navigation, discovered the concept of true north, improved the design of the astronomical gnomon, armillary sphere, sight tube, and clepsydra, and described the use of drydocks to repair boats. After observing the natural process of the inundation of silt and the find of marine fossils in the Taihang Mountains (hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation, or geomorphology. He also adopted a theory of gradual climate change in regions over time, after observing petrified bamboo found underground at Yan'an, Shaanxi province. If not for Shen Kuo's writing, the architectural works of Yu Hao would be little known, along with the inventor of movable type printing, Bi Sheng (990-1051). Shen's contemporary Su Song (1020–1101) was also a brilliant polymath, an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of botany, zoology, mineralogy, and metallurgy, and had erected a large astronomical clocktower in Kaifeng city in 1088. To operate the crowning armillary sphere, his clocktower featured an <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the world's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting chain drive.|$|E

50|$|An <b>escapement</b> is the <b>mechanism</b> in a {{mechanical}} clock {{that gives the}} pendulum precise impulses to keep it swinging, and allows the gear train to advance a set amount with each pendulum swing. The Riefler escapement was an improvement of the deadbeat escapement, the standard used in precision clocks. In the deadbeat, the force to keep the pendulum swinging is applied by {{the teeth of the}} escape wheel sliding alternately against two angled pallets on arms attached to the pendulum. Therefore, slight variations in the friction of the pallets and in the torque from the escape wheel are passed on to the pendulum, disturbing its motion.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Riefler <b>escapement,</b> Riefler clocks' <b>mechanism</b> had several other innovations which were responsible for their accuracy. They {{were one of the}} first clocks to use a pendulum rod made of the low thermal expansion alloy invar, to prevent the pendulum from changing length with temperature changes, causing error. The most accurate models were mounted in a low pressure tank to eliminate the effect of changes in atmospheric pressure on the pendulum. They were powered by a gravity remontoire, a small weight which was wound up by an electric motor every 30 seconds, to eliminate the effect of changes in drive force on the mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The Corpus Clock is {{a product}} of {{traditional}} mechanical clockmaking. It features the world's largest grasshopper <b>escapement,</b> a low-friction <b>mechanism</b> for converting pendulum motion into rotational motion {{while at the same time}} giving back to the pendulum the energy needed to maintain its swing. The grasshopper escapement was an invention of the renowned eighteenth-century clockmaker John Harrison, and Taylor intended the Corpus Clock to be a homage to Harrison's work. Since [...] "no one knows how a grasshopper escapement works", Taylor [...] "decided to turn the clock inside out" [...] so that the escapement, and the escape wheel it turns, would be his clock's defining feature.|$|R
500|$|Su Song was the {{engineer}} of a hydro-mechanical astronomical clock tower in medieval Kaifeng, which employed {{the use of}} an early <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> of Su's clock tower had been invented by Buddhist monk Yi Xing and government official Liang Lingzan in 725 AD to operate a water-powered armillary sphere, although Su's armillary sphere was the first to be provided with a mechanical clock drive. Su's clock tower also featured the oldest known endless power-transmitting chain drive, called the tian ti (天梯), or [...] "celestial ladder", as depicted in his horological treatise. The clock tower had 133 different clock jacks to indicate and sound the hours. Su Song's treatise about the clock tower, Xinyi Xiangfayao (新儀象法要), has survived since its written form in 1092 and official printed publication in 1094. The book has been analyzed by many historians, such as Joseph Needham. The clock itself, however, was dismantled by the invading Jurchen army in AD 1127, and although attempts were made to reassemble it, the tower was never successfully reinstated.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{instance of}} a liquid-driven escapement {{was described by}} the Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (fl. 3rd century) in his technical treatise Pneumatics (chapter 31) where he likens the <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a washstand automaton with those as employed in (water) clocks. Another early clock to use escapements was built during the 7th century in Chang'an, by Tantric monk and mathematician, Yi Xing, and government official Liang Lingzan. An astronomical instrument {{that served as a}} clock, it was discussed in a contemporary text as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{mechanical}} clocks, {{employing the}} verge <b>escapement</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around {{the start of}} the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656. [...] The invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.|$|E
5000|$|When {{building}} the Corpus Chronophage, Taylor {{found that the}} inertia issues presented by such a large grasshopper <b>escapement</b> made the <b>mechanism</b> unworkable. With reference to this problem, he has said, [...] "We had to turn a disaster into an advantage. Our efforts to prevent the amplitude of the pendulum from increasing led us {{to the idea of}} running both fast and slow and correcting them." [...] The final outcome was a mechanical clock that is assisted by mechanical controls and a periodic signal from the atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom). All of the Chronophage clocks use this method of telling time, which allows Taylor to explore the concept of relative time as theorised by Albert Einstein.|$|R
40|$|A {{pendulum}} is a {{rigid body}} suspended from a fixed point (hinge) which is offset {{with respect to}} the body’s center of mass. If all the mass is assumed to be concentrated at a point, we obtain the idealized simple pendulum. Pendulums have {{played an important role in}} the history of dynamics. Galileo identified the pendulum as the first example of synchronous motion, which led to the first successful clock developed by Huygens. This clock incorporated a feedback mechanism that injected energy into the oscillations (the <b>escapement,</b> a <b>mechanism</b> used in timepieces to control movement and to provide periodic energy impulses to a pendulum or balance) to compensate for friction loses. In addition to horology (the science of measuring time), pendulums have important applications in gravimetry (the measurement of the specific gravity) and inertial navigation. Simple Pendulum Consider a simple pendulum of mass m and length L. The equation of motion can be derived from the conservation of angular momentum about the hinge point, O, ¨ IOθ = −mgL sin θ.

40|$|For {{most of the}} Middle Ages, diurnal {{timekeeping}} {{depended on}} sundials, water-clocks, and occasionally flame-clocks. However, {{towards the end of}} the thirteenth century, the mechanical clock, weight driven and regulated by a verge <b>escapement</b> and foliot <b>mechanism,</b> was developed. The earliest mechanical clocks appeared in Northern Italy but rapidly spread throughout Europe. In Jacques le Goff s words, Henceforth the clock became the measure of all things. Early clocks were neither particularly accurate nor reliable, but the machine, because it was better than anything that had preceded it, acquired the reputation for perfect regularity and dependability. This paper seeks to show how the clock came to be regarded as a model and a reference point, invoked by writers in relation to the ordering of the universe, the nature of a well-regulated society, and as an image of proper moral behaviour. ...|$|R
