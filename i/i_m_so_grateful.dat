30|$|The present {{multiple}} optimal stopping {{problem is}} a simple theoretical model for migration of animals, migratory fishes in particular [16]. A single optimal stopping problem for analyzing animal migration between two habitats has been discussed in Yoshioka and Yaegashi [7] from a numerical viewpoint. Assume that there are M + 1 habitats, which are denoted H_ 0,H_ 1,...,H_M where H_ 0 is the initial habitat and H_M is the final habitat: {{the goal of the}} migration. The stochastic process Z_t represents the biomass of an animal population at the time t. The stopping time τ_i represents the time to move from H_i - 1 to H_i. The objective of the animal population is to choose the sequence of stopping times τ_i (1 < <b>i</b> < <b>M),</b> <b>so</b> that the sum of the cumulative profit gain in each habitat H_i (0 < <b>i</b> < <b>M</b> - 1) and the terminal wealth gained at the goal of migration H_M, namely the performance index J_τ in (2), is maximized.|$|R

His first Novel is ‘The Infiltration’ (‘Anuprabes’) was published by the financial assistance of Government of West Bengal in 1983. The back ground of this Novel is the Naxalite Movement in tea-garden area of Dooars in Bengal. The Novel highlights the insubstantiality ofNaxalite political theory. They worked in field to abolish the representative of state i. g. the polish-military-bureaucrat. Humanism was neglected by their party rules. Bharati alias Shubhra was planned to murder of a tea-garden manager named Abanish Maulik, who was an uncle of Bharati. Orphan Bharati took shelter after lost her parents as daughter in Abanish Maulik’s house. In the other hand, the husband of Shubhra, Upal also took shelter in this house for save his life from students politics. He was a class representative from Student Federation in College. He took membership of C. P. <b>I.</b> (<b>M.</b> L) for love of Bharati, not for party. Actually, Upal was C.
