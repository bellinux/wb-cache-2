500|$|After GeorgeV died, Mary {{continued}} {{wearing the}} crown (without its arches) as a queen mother, {{and so the}} Crown of Queen Elizabeth was made for Queen Elizabeth, the wife of GeorgeVI, to wear at their coronation in 1937. It is the only British crown to be made entirely of platinum, and was modelled on Queen Mary's Crown, but has four half-arches instead of eight. The crown is decorated with about 2,800 diamonds, most notably the Koh-i-Noor {{in the middle of}} the <b>front</b> <b>cross.</b> It also contains a replica of the [...] Lahore Diamond given to Queen Victoria by the East India Company in 1851, and a [...] diamond given to her by AbdülmecidI, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in 1856. The crown was laid on top of Elizabeth's coffin during her lying in state and at her funeral in 2002.|$|E
500|$|A {{much lighter}} crown is {{worn by the}} monarch {{when he or she}} leaves Westminster Abbey, and at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The current Imperial State Crown was made in 1937 for GeorgeVI and is a virtual copy of the one made in 1838 for Queen Victoria, which fell into a poor state of repair, and had been made using gems from its own predecessor, the State Crown of GeorgeI. In 1953, the crown was resized to fit Queen ElizabethII, and the arches were lowered by [...] to give it a more {{feminine}} appearance. It is made of gold, silver and platinum, and has four crosses pattée and fleurs-de-lis, with two arches surmounted by a monde and cross pattée. The crown is decorated with 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and 5 rubies. Among the largest stones are the [...] CullinanII diamond, also known as the Second Star of Africa, above which is the [...] Black Prince's Ruby (a spinel), set in the <b>front</b> <b>cross.</b> At the back of the crown is the [...] Stuart Sapphire, and in the top cross is StEdward's Sapphire, reputedly taken from the ring of Edward the Confessor when his body was reinterred at Westminster Abbey in 1163. Below the monde hang four pearls, three of which are often said to have belonged to Queen ElizabethI, but the association is almost certainly erroneous.|$|E

Although its main roof line is side-gable, there is a <b>front</b> <b>cross</b> gable projecting over the front facade which is supported by decoratively cut knee brackets. The front entry porch is supported by heavy turned pillars, and has an openwork frieze. The house was built by Lemuel Snow, a local carpenter, for his son.|$|E

The pressed engine/transaxle/suspension mounting member was detachable from the main body structure. 61 percent of the Dauphine's weight was carried by the rear wheels.|$|E

50|$|Awnings became common {{during the}} first half of the 19th century. At that time they {{consisted}} of timber or cast iron posts set along the sidewalk edge and linked by a <b>front</b> <b>cross</b> bar. To lend support to larger installations, angled rafters linked the <b>front</b> <b>cross</b> bar to the building facade. The upper end of the canvas was connected to the facade with nails, with grommets and hooks, or by lacing the canvas to a head rod bolted to the facade. The other (projecting) end of the canvas was draped over or laced to a front bar with the edge often hanging down to form a valance. On ornate examples, metal posts were adorned with filigree and the tops decorated with spear ends, balls or other embellishments. On overcast days or when rain did not threaten, the covering was often rolled up against the building facade; during the winter months proper maintenance called for the removal and storage of awnings. Photographs from the mid-19th century often show the bare framework, suggesting that the covering was extended only when necessary. Canvas duck was the predominant awning fabric, a strong, closely woven cotton cloth used for centuries to make tents and sails.|$|E
50|$|Although Formula Drift {{does not}} permit front-wheel drive cars, it does allow all-wheel drive cars to be {{converted}} to rear wheel drive, such as the Subaru WRX and Mitsubishi EVO. In the United States, the Scion tC is sold only in the FWD layout, but because it shares the same chassis as the AWD Toyota Avensis (sold only in the United Kingdom and Europe), it {{can be converted to}} a competition-ready RWD layout. This change sparked great debate between drifters in the series who felt that an original FWD vehicle should not be eligible due to the <b>front</b> <b>cross</b> member changes needed.|$|E

50|$|Beginning on January 16, {{a strong}} arctic cold <b>front</b> began <b>crossing</b> {{the state of}} Florida. Two days later, another cold <b>front</b> <b>crossed</b> Florida, while a strong arctic {{high-pressure}} system over the Mississippi River Valley also began pushing cold air into Florida. Simultaneously, an upper-level trough associated with the second cold front contained a band of clouds and precipitation. Between 8 and 9:30 am, snow flurries were reported in many areas across south Florida, including Miami. It was reported that people stopped their cars and emerged from their homes to see the snow in great numbers, many having never seen snow flurries in their lifetimes. That day the high only reached 47 F in Miami. The associated cold air began to subside on January 21.|$|R

50|$|The House at 49 Vinal Avenue in Somerville, Massachusetts is {{a stylish}} {{combination}} of Colonial Revival and Shingle styling. The 2.5 story wood frame {{house was built}} c. 1894.

The <b>front</b> <b>cross</b> gable is flanked by two hip roof dormers whose windows are flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature with wooden garlands and dentil molding.

Along the base are two strings of pearls. Originally, the upper string had 86 pearls and the lower 94, but they were changed to 81 and 88 in 1902. Instead of the heraldic fleurs-de-lis usually seen on British crowns, the diadem has four bouquets of roses, thistles and shamrocks, the floral symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland respectively, alternating with four crosses pattée {{around the top of}} its base.|$|E
