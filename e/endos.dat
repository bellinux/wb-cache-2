40|$|Background—Patients with nonischemic left {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy (LVCM) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) have complex 3 -dimensional substrate with variable {{involvement of the}} endocardium (<b>ENDO)</b> and epicardium (EPI). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether <b>ENDO</b> unipolar (UNI) mapping with a larger electric field of view could identify EPI low bipolar (BIP) voltage regions in patients with LVCM undergoing VT ablation. Methods and Results—The reference value for normal <b>ENDO</b> unipolar voltage was determined from 6 patients without structural heart disease. Consecutive patients undergoing VT ablation over an 8 -year period with detailed (100 points) LV <b>ENDO</b> and EPI mapping and normal LV <b>ENDO</b> BIP voltage were identified. From this cohort, we compared patients with structurally normal hearts and normal EPI BIP voltage (EPI, group 1) with patients with LVCM and low LV EPI BIP voltage regions present (EPI, group 2). Confluent regions of <b>ENDO</b> UNI and EPI BIP low voltage (2 cm 2) were measured. The normal signal amplitude was 8. 27 mV for LV <b>ENDO</b> UNI electrograms. Detailed LV ENDO-EPI maps in 5 EPI patients were compared with 11 EPI patients. Confluent <b>ENDO</b> UNI low-voltage regions were seen in 9 of 11 (82 %) of the EPI (group 2) patients compared with none of 5 EPI (group 1) patients (P 0. 001). In all 9 patients with <b>ENDO</b> UNI low voltage, the <b>ENDO</b> UNI low-voltage regions were directly opposite to an area of EPI BIP low voltage (61 % <b>ENDO</b> UNI-EPI BIP low-voltage area overlap). Conclusions—EPI arrhythmia substrate can be reliably identified in most patients with LVCM using <b>ENDO</b> UNI voltag...|$|R

50|$|Next, the {{introduction}} of N-acetylglucoseamine (GlcNAc) to the aldehyde tagged proteins via oxime formation was carried out through the treatment with aminooxy GlcNAc (AO-GlcNAc) (Fig. 3B). The conjugation was confirmed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and lectin blot with the GlcNAc-binding wheat germ agglutinin attached to AlexaFluor 647. Having successfully introduced GlcNAc, the monomer was extended with a glycan structure containing GlcNAc, mannose (Man) and galactose (Gal) (Fig. 3C). A mutant endoglycosidase <b>EndoS</b> (EndoS-D233Q) was utilised as it is highly speciﬁc for IgG Fc N-linked GlcNAc residues and does not elongate Asn-GlcNAc sites on other proteins or on denatured IgGs. Product formation was again monitored by LC-ESI-MS and lectin blot probing with the sialic acid-binding sambucus nigra agglutinin attached to ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate.|$|E
40|$|Enzymes {{that affect}} glycoproteins {{of the human}} immune system, and thereby {{modulate}} defense responses, are abundant among bacterial pathogens. Two endoglycosidases from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, <b>EndoS</b> and <b>EndoS</b> 2, have recently been shown to hydrolyze N-linked glycans of human IgG. However, detailed characterization and comparison of the hydrolyzing activities have not been performed. In the present study {{we set out to}} characterize the enzymes by comparing the activities of <b>EndoS</b> and <b>EndoS</b> 2 on a selection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cetuximab, adalimumab, panitumumab, and denosumab. By analyzing the glycans hydrolyzed by <b>EndoS</b> and <b>EndoS</b> 2 from the antibodies using MALDI-TOF, we found that both enzymes cleaved complex glycans, and that <b>EndoS</b> 2 hydrolyzed hybrid and oligomannose structures to a greater extent compared to <b>EndoS.</b> A comparison of UHPLC profiles of the glycan pool of cetuximab hydrolyzed with <b>EndoS</b> and <b>EndoS</b> 2 showed that <b>EndoS</b> 2 hydrolyzed hybrid and oligomannose glycans whereas these peaks were missing in the <b>EndoS</b> chromatogram. We utilized this difference in glycoform selectivity and developed a liquid chromatography separation method to quantify high-mannose content in the Fc fragments of the selected mAbs. We conclude that <b>EndoS</b> and <b>EndoS</b> 2 hydrolyze different glycoforms from the Fc-glycosylation site on therapeutic mAbs, and that this can be used for rapid quantification of high-mannose content...|$|E
