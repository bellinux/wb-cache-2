5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included <b>high-order</b> resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-Neptunian objects after several hundred million years. Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E

25|$|Addresses for PCI {{configuration}} space access are decoded specially. For these, the low-order address lines {{specify the}} offset {{of the desired}} PCI configuration register, and the <b>high-order</b> address lines are ignored. Instead, an additional address signal, the IDSEL input, must be high before a device may assert DEVSEL#. Each slot connects a different <b>high-order</b> address line to the IDSEL pin, and is selected using one-hot encoding on the upper address lines.|$|E

A high scorer on tough-mindedness in psychoticism would score low on tender-mindedness in agreeableness. Most {{of the differences between}} the taxonomies stem from the three factor model's emphasis on fewer <b>high-order</b> factors.|$|E
25|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{is commonly used}} to obtain the flow field with shock waves. Though shock waves are sharp discontinuities, in numerical solutions of fluid flow with discontinuities (shock wave, contact discontinuity or slip line), the shock wave can be smoothed out by low-order numerical method (due to numerical dissipation) or there are spurious oscillations near shock surface by <b>high-order</b> numerical method (due to Gibbs phenomena).|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of HTM are {{learning}} algorithms that can store, learn, infer and recall <b>high-order</b> sequences. Unlike most other machine learning methods, HTM learns time-based patterns in unlabeled data on a continuous basis. HTM is robust to noise and high capacity, meaning that it can learn multiple patterns simultaneously. When applied to computers, HTM is well suited for prediction, anomaly detection, classification and ultimately sensorimotor applications.|$|E
25|$|Prefix code: The first byte {{indicates}} {{the number of}} bytes in the sequence. Reading from a stream can instantaneously decode each individual fully received sequence, without first having to wait for either the first byte of a next sequence or an end-of-stream indication. The length of multi-byte sequences is easily determined by humans as it is simply the number of <b>high-order</b> 1s in the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream ends mid-sequence.|$|E

In December 2008, Metrolinx became the proponent of new EA that would simultaneously assess a combination of both the UP Express and GO Transit's Georgetown South expansion. The final Environmental Project Report was released on July 30, 2009.|$|E
25|$|There are two generic ideas how to {{visualize}} the Pareto front in <b>high-order</b> multi-objective decision problems (problems with more than two objectives). One of them, which is applicable {{in the case of}} a relatively small number of objective points that represent the Pareto front, is based on using the visualization techniques developed in statistics (various diagrams, etc. – see the corresponding subsection below). The second idea proposes the display of bi-objective cross-sections (slices) of the Pareto front. It was introduced by W.S. Meisel in 1973 who argued that such slices inform the decision maker on objective tradeoffs. The figures that display a series of bi-objective slices of the Pareto front for three-objective problems are known as the decision maps. They give a clear picture of tradeoffs between three criteria. Disadvantages of such an approach are related to two following facts. First, the computational procedures for constructing the bi-objective slices of the Pareto front are not stable since the Pareto front is usually not stable. Secondly, it is applicable in the case of only three objectives. In the 1980s, the idea W.S. Meisel of implemented in a different form – in the form of the Interactive Decision Maps (IDM) technique.|$|E

2500|$|To allow 64-bit addressing, {{a master}} {{will present the}} address over two {{consecutive}} cycles. [...] First, it sends the low-order address bits with a special [...] "dual-cycle address" [...] command on the C/BE#. [...] On the following cycle, it sends the <b>high-order</b> address bits and the actual command. [...] Dual-address cycles are forbidden if the <b>high-order</b> address bits are zero, so devices which do not support 64-bit addressing can simply not respond to dual cycle commands.|$|E

2500|$|Pure salvage {{claims are}} divided into [...] "high-order" [...] and [...] "low-order" [...] salvage. In <b>high-order</b> salvage, the salvor exposes himself and his crew {{to the risk of}} injury and loss or damage to his {{equipment}} in order to salvage the property that is in peril. Examples of <b>high-order</b> salvage are boarding a sinking ship in heavy weather, boarding a ship which is on fire, raising a ship, plane, or other sunken property, or towing a ship which is in the surf away from the shore. Low-order salvage occurs where the salvor is exposed to little or no personal risk. Examples of low-order salvage include towing another vessel in calm seas, supplying a vessel with fuel, or pulling a vessel off a sand bar. Salvors performing high order salvage receive substantially greater salvage award than those performing low order salvage.|$|E

2500|$|When {{accessing}} {{a memory}} address that {{requires more than}} 32 bits to represent, the address phase begins with this command and the low 32 bits of the address, followed by a second cycle with the actual command and the high 32 bits of the address. [...] PCI targets that do not support 64-bit addressing may simply treat this as another reserved command code and not respond to it. [...] This command code may only be used with a non-zero <b>high-order</b> address word; it is forbidden to use this cycle if not necessary.|$|E
2500|$|... 64-bit {{addressing}} is done using a two-stage address phase. [...] The initiator broadcasts the low 32 address bits, {{accompanied by}} a special [...] "dual address cycle" [...] command code. [...] Devices which do not support 64-bit addressing can simply not respond to that command code. [...] The next cycle, the initiator transmits the high 32 address bits, plus the real command code. [...] The transaction operates identically from that point on. [...] To ensure compatibility with 32-bit PCI devices, it is forbidden to use a dual address cycle if not necessary, i.e. if the <b>high-order</b> address bits are all zero.|$|E
2500|$|The 68000 has a 24-bit {{external}} {{address bus}} and two byte-select signals [...] "replaced" [...] A0. These 24 lines can therefore address 16 MB of physical memory with byte resolution. Address storage and computation uses 32 bits internally; however, the 8 <b>high-order</b> address bits are ignored due to the physical lack of device pins. This allows it to run software written for a logically flat 32-bit address space, while accessing only a 24-bit physical address space. [...] Motorola's intent with the internal 32-bit address space was forward compatibility, making it feasible to write 68000 software that would {{take full advantage of}} later 32-bit implementations of the 68000 instruction set.|$|E
2500|$|Previous {{research}} has shown REM sleep to reactivate cortical neural assemblies post-training on a serial reaction time task (SRT), in other words REM sleep replays the processing that occurred while one learnt an implicit task in the previous waking hours. However, control subjects did not complete a SRT task, thus researchers could not assume the reactivation of certain networks to {{be a result of}} the implicitly learned sequence/grammar as it could simply be due to elementary visuomotor processing which was obtained in both groups. [...] To answer this question the experiment was redone and another group was added who also took part in the SRT task. [...] They experienced no sequence to the SRT task (random group), [...] whereas the experimental group did experience a sequence (probabilistic group), although without conscious awareness. [...] Results of [...] PET scans indicate that bilateral cuneus were significantly more activated during SRT practice as well as post-training REM sleep in the Probabilistic group than the Random group. [...] In addition, this activation was significantly increased during REM sleep versus the SRT task. [...] This suggests that specific brain regions are specifically engaged in the post-processing of sequential information. [...] This is further supported by the fact that regional CBF (rCBF) during post-training REM sleep are modulated by the level of <b>high-order,</b> but not low-order learning obtained prior to sleep. [...] Therefore, brain regions that take part in a learning process are modulated by both the sequential structure of the learned material (increased activation in cuneus), and the amount of <b>high-order</b> learning (rCBF).|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s, Peter Goldreich, Frank Shu, and others applied density wave theory to the rings of Saturn. [...] Saturn's rings (particularly the A Ring) contain a great many spiral density waves and spiral bending waves excited by Lindblad {{resonances}} and vertical resonances (respectively) with Saturn's moons. [...] The physics are largely the same as with galaxies, though spiral waves in Saturn's rings are much more tightly wound (extending a few hundred kilometers at most) due to the very large central mass (Saturn itself) compared to {{the mass of the}} disk. [...] The Cassini mission has revealed very small density waves excited by the ring-moons Pan and Atlas and by <b>high-order</b> resonances with the larger moons, as well as waves whose form changes with time due to the varying orbits of Janus and Epimetheus.|$|E
2500|$|The attention-free {{hypothesis}} soon {{emerged to}} challenge early models. The initial {{basis for the}} attention-free hypothesis was the finding that in visual search, basic visual features of objects immediately and automatically pop out to the person doing the visual search. Further experiments seemed to support this: Potter (as cited by Evans & Treisman, 2005) showed that <b>high-order</b> representations can be accessed rapidly from natural scenes presented at rates of up to 10 per second. Additionally, Thorpe, Fize & Marlot (as cited by Evans & Treisman) discovered that humans and primates can categorize natural images (i.e. of animals in everyday indoor and outdoor scenes) rapidly and accurately even after brief exposures. [...] The basic idea in these studies is that exposure to each individual scene is too brief for attentional processes to occur, yet human beings are able to interpret and categorize these scenes.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{complication}} of IVF {{is the risk}} of multiple births. This {{is directly related to}} the practice of transferring multiple embryos at embryo transfer. Multiple births are related to increased risk of pregnancy loss, obstetrical complications, prematurity, and neonatal morbidity with the potential for long term damage. Strict limits on the number of embryos that may be transferred have been enacted in some countries (e.g. Britain, Belgium) to reduce the risk of <b>high-order</b> multiples (triplets or more), but are not universally followed or accepted. Spontaneous splitting of embryos in the womb after transfer can occur, but this is rare and would lead to identical twins.
