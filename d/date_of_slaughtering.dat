40|$|After the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, the European Union (EU) {{introduced}} mandatory {{and voluntary}} labelling for meat products {{to reduce the}} food safety concerns of consumers and to ensure a better distribution of liability among agents of the meat supply chain. The {{purpose of this article}} is to evaluate whether voluntary traceability labelling, introduced by Regulation 1760 | 2000, can be considered a useful instrument for both the producers and consumers of meat products. Attention is focused on the vertical coordination effects of introducing voluntary labelling along the beef chain and on the interest the Italian consumer shows in labelled information on meat products. Two surveys were conducted: one addressing Italian meat organizations that signed voluntary labelling agreements and the other a sample of 1, 025 Italian consumers. With regard to supply, the survey revealed that improved traceability led to a better redistribution of liability among the agents of the meat supply chain and to a strengthening of vertical agreements. Regarding the consumers, the results showed a notable consumer interest in the labelled information such as the meat origin and the information related to the system of cattle breeding, cattle feeding, and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>slaughtering.</b> © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.,...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effect of herd size on the sera-prevalence of {{antibodies}} against Salmonella enterica {{based on data from}} the nation-wide salmonella control program (Mousing et al. 1997) taking into account the effects <b>of</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>slaughter</b> (season) and geographical county of the herd. Since, there were multiple measurements from each herd, we needed to account for the dependence between samples from the same herd. This led us to construct a random-effects model which allowed interpretation {{of the size of the}} fixed effects in relation to the size of the variance of the random effects, that is to quantify {{the effect of}} the known variables (included as fixed effects) in relation to the variation in those not known (modelled as random effects). This means that the focus of the statistical modelling will be moved from significance testing of effects to estimation of effects and interpretation of the importance of these relative to each other and relative to the subject matter...|$|R
40|$|Traceability {{systems can}} provide {{detailed}} information about the origin, processing, transfer and distribution of a food item. The information reported on the labels {{can be considered as}} an instrument to improve consumer trust and perception of food safety and quality. However, if too much information is provided, information overloads may occur, causing consumers to spend too much time on information processing. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} which kind of information that consumers are really interested in. Based on three criteria, namely food safety, food quality and food trust, this study investigates consumer preferences for information on traceability systems used in Taiwan’s pork sector. Since there is interdependence among the three criteria. This study adopts a hybrid of Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method to conduct the multi-criteria evaluation. This study first extracts 17 attributes of traceability information from previous literature and then measures the relative weights (consumer preferences) of the attributes using a system of pairwise comparison. Results indicate that national certification, certification marks, retailer, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>slaughter</b> and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> packaging are attributes of traceability information that consumers are more concerned about when purchasing pork products. The findings of this research can be a reference for the government and related industries on how to strengthen the usefulness of the current pork traceability system...|$|R
40|$|Objective The growth, carcass {{and retail}} cut yield records on 1, 428 Hanwoo steers {{obtained}} through progeny testing were analyzed in this study, and their heritability and genetic {{relationships among the}} traits were estimated using animal models. Methods Two different models were compared in this study. Each model was fitted for different fixed class effects, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>slaughter</b> for carcass traits and batch of progeny test live measurement traits, and a choice of covariates (carcass weight in Model 1 or backfat thickness in Model 2) for carcass traits. Results The differences in body composition among individuals were deemed being unaffected by their age at slaughter, except for carcass weight and backfat thickness. Heritability estimates of body size measurements were 0. 21 to 0. 36. Heritability estimates of retail cut percentage were high (0. 56 from Model 1 and 0. 47 from Model 2). And the heritability estimates for loin muscle percentage were 0. 36 from Model 1 and 0. 42 from Model 2, which were high enough to consider direct selection on carcass cutability traits as effective. The genetic correlations between body size measurements and retail cut ratio (RCR) were close to zero. But, some negative genetic correlations were found with chest girths measured at yearling (Model 1) or at 24 months of age or with chest widths. Loin muscle ratio (LMR) was genetically negatively correlated with body weights or body size measurements, in general in Model 1. These relationships were low close to zero but positive in Model 2. Phenotypic correlation between cutability traits (RCR, LMR) and live body size measurements were moderate and negative in Model 1 while those in Model 2 were all close to zero. Conclusion Therefore, the body weights or linear body measurements {{at an earlier age}} {{may not be the most}} desirable selection traits for exploitation of correlated responses to improve loin muscle or lean meat yield...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{production}} and processing factors on tenderness, and colour of lamb meat produced from 7 locations {{as part of the}} Australian Sheep Industry CRC's Information Nucleus flock were investigated, using data from 2052 lambs slaughtered in 2007. At 24 h post-slaughter, samples of m. longissimus lumborum(LL) and m. semimembranosus (SM) were collected for measurement of intramuscular fat (IMF), myoglobin, iron and copper and fresh meat colour (L*, a*, b*) and pH at 24 h measured on the LL. pH and temperature measurements made pre-rigor were used to calculate the pH at 18 degrees C. Tenderness was measured by LL shear force at days 1 (SF 1) and 5 (SF 5) post-slaughter, the shear force difference (SF-diff) and SM compression and collagen concentration were determined. Retail colour stability was assessed using over-wrapped LL under simulated retail display for 3 days, according to the change in the oxymyoglobin/metmyoglobin ratio. All traits were affected by flock and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>slaughter</b> (P < 0. 001). After 4 days of ageing, 70 - 95 % of the LL samples from all flocks, except for one, had acceptable tenderness for consumers based on their shear force. Low IMF, high LL pH at 18 degrees C and high pH at 24 h increased SF 1 and SF 5 and also had an effect on SF-diff (P< 0. 001). The retail colour of 44. 8 % of the samples on day 3 of retail display were lower than acceptable. Retail colour was influenced by IMF, pH 18 and the concentration of iron and copper (P < 0. 001). In conclusion, breeding and management practices that increase muscle IMF levels and reduce ultimate pH values and processing practices that result in moderate rates of pH fall post-slaughter, improve the tenderness of lamb. Extension of retail colour stability may be antagonistic to traits associated with tenderness and nutritional traits, particularly IMF and mineral levels...|$|R
