5000|$|Consider two ellipsoids, {{each with}} a given shape and orientation, whose centers are on a line with given direction. We wish to {{determine}} the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centers</b> when the ellipsoids are in point contact externally. This distance of closest approach {{is a function of}} the shapes of the ellipsoids and their orientation. There is no analytic solution for this problem, since solving for the distance requires the solution of a sixth order polynomial equation. Here an algorithm is developed to determine this distance, based on the analytic results for the distance of closest approach of ellipses in 2D, which can be implemented numerically.

The continuations of sacred studies sufficed {{to bring about the}} Carolingian Renaissance. It was likewise a purely ecclesiastical culture which the Irish brought back to the continent in the sixth and seventh centuries. The chief aim of these Irish monks was to preserve and develop religious life. When the scattered items of information are examined, especially the hagiological indications, their importance is peculiarly diminished, for the teaching in question generally concerns Scripture or theology. Even Columbanus {{does not seem to have}} organized literary studies in his monasteries. The Irish monks had a personal culture which they did not make any effort to diffuse, owing to the great <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centers</b> of learning. Moreover, the disciples of the Irish were men enamoured of ascetic mortification, who shunned an evil world and sought a life of prayer and penance. For such minds, beauty of language and verbal rhythm were frivolous attractions. The material equipment of the Irish religious establishments in Gaul scarcely admitted any other study than that of the Scriptures. Generally these establishments were but a group of huts surrounding a small chapel.|$|E
