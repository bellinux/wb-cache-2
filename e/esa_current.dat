This paper regards the flight mechanics of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) phases used for the mission analysis and design of the Baseline and back-up scenarios of the mission. The EDL concept is based on a ballistic entry, followed by a descent under parachutes and inflatable devices (airbags) for landing. The mission analysis and design is driven by the flexibility in terms of landing site, arrival dates and the very stringent requirement in terms of landing accuracy. The challenging requirements currently imposed to the mission need innovative analysis and design techniques to support system design trade-offs to cope with the variability in entry conditions.

Alternatively, voluntary incentive mechanisms can be designed such that landowners view habitat as an asset and are willing participants in protecting habitat. The incentive mechanism best suited for conserving habitat in a given region depends on many factors, including government funding, land values, quantity and quality of habitat, and the region's developmental pressure. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Anemia {{is common}} among peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) patients, and most patients require erythropoiesisstimulating agents (ESA) {{to maintain their}} hemoglobin concentrations within current guideline recommendations. Darbepoetin alfa is an ESA with a 3 -fold longer half-life and greater in vivo biological activity than recombinant human erythropoietin, allowing less frequent dosing that may simplify anemia management in these patients, providing benefits to patients, care givers and health care providers. Clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa administered at extended dosing intervals. However, there are limited data on the management of anemia with ESAs in PD patients in routine clinical practice. The aim of this multicenter observational study in European and Australian dialysis patients was to evaluate darbepoetin alfa administered once every 2 weeks (Q 2 W) in routine clinical practice for 12 months. Methods: PD patients ≥ 18 years old and converting to treatment with darbepoetin alfa Q 2 W were eligible for enrollment regardless of previous or <b>current</b> <b>ESA</b> use.

The aim {{of this study was to}} find an explanation for this reduction in ESA requirement. Methods: This is a retrospective study on 18 stable HD patients. Comparable follow-up periods of 6 months with the two different ESA adjustment regimens were established and data on ESA dose, hemoglobin and known predictors of ESA response were collected. Results: With the new ESA administration regimen, a 22. 5 % drop in the total ESA dose was noted. The corresponding fall in the erythropoietin resistance index was 20. 0 %. Simultaneously, the dialysis dose and transferrin saturation increased significantly. However, in a multivariate linear regression model, changes in these factors did not significantly predict changes in ESA requirement. No relevant changes were noted in other erythropoiesis-modulating factors.

The challenge of nulling is making the null in the interferometric signal sufficiently deep to cancel the light from the bright star during the collection of light from its surrounding planets. The performance of the nulling is limited by the wavefront quality of the beams. The wavefront error can be reduced by filtering using a single mode fiber.

The two-dimensional (2 -D) tomographic retrieval approach is assumed to derive the atmospheric field of geophysical parameters. For each observation mode we have calculated the 2 -D distribution of the information load quantifier relative to the main MIPAS targets. The performance of the observation modes has been evaluated in terms of strength and spatial coverage of the information-load distribution along the full orbit. The indications of the information-load analysis has been validated with simulated retrievals based on the observational parameters of real orbits. In the simulation studies we have assessed the precision and the spatial (both horizontal and vertical) resolution of the retrieval products. The performance of the three observation modes has been compared for the MIPAS main products in both the UT/LS and the extended altitude range. This study shows that the two observation modes that were specifically designed for the UT/LS region are actually competitive with the third one, designed for the whole stratosphere, up to altitudes that far exceed the UT/LS.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that perioperative hemodynamic optimization has the ability to improve postoperative outcome in high-risk surgical patients. All of these studies aimed at optimizing cardiac output and/or oxygen delivery in the perioperative period. We conducted a survey with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the European Society of Anaesthesiology (<b>ESA)</b> to assess <b>current</b> hemodynamic management practices in patients undergoing high-risk surgery in Europe and in the United States. Methods A survey including 33 specific questions was emailed to 2, 500 randomly selected active members of the ASA and to active ESA members. Results Overall, 368 questionnaires were completed, 57. 1 % from ASA and 42. 9 % from ESA members. Cardiac output is monitored by only 34 % of ASA and ESA respondents (P = 0. 49) while central venous pressure is monitored by 73 % of ASA respondents and 84 % of ESA respondents (P < 0. 01). Specifically, the pulmonary artery catheter is being used much more frequently in the US than in Europe in the setup of high-risk surgery (85. 1 % vs. 55. 3 % respectively, P < 0. 001). Clinical experience, blood pressure, central venous pressure, and urine output are the most widely indicators of volume expansion. Finally, 86. 5 % of ASA respondents and 98. 1 % of ESA respondents believe that their current hemodynamic management could be improved.

40|$|Evolution of Life on Earth started 3. 5 Ga ago, when living {{conditions}} on Mars {{were similar to}} those on early Earth. Hence it is legitimate to assume that life emerged on Mars as well as on early Earth. <b>Current</b> <b>ESA</b> mission Mars Express determined water on Mars, fundamental requirement for life, and presence of CH 4 in the Martian atmosphere, which could be originated only from active volcanism or from biological sources. This finding implicates that microbial life could still exist on Mars. One possibility for survival of Martian primitive life might be subsurface lithoautotrophic ecosystems. Comparable environments exist in permafrost regions on Earth. Despite the unfavourable life conditions, permafrost is colonized by high numbers of viable microorganisms, including methanogenic archaea. The capability of these organisms to grow under lithoautotrophic conditions, whereby energy is gained by the oxidation of H 2 and CO 2 is the only carbon source under strictly anaerobic conditions, tolerance to low temperatures and long-term survival under extreme conditions of permafrost make methanogens to the most suitable keystone organism for the investigation of possible Martian life. Within the scope of DFG Priority Program Mars and the Terrestrial Planets we study the tolerances of methanogens under extreme life conditions of terrestrial or extraterrestrial permafrost (Mars simulation). The borders of growth influenced by desiccation, temperature extremes, radiation and high salt concentration were analyzed for the methanogenic archaea in pure cultures as well as in their natural environment of Siberian permafrost.

40|$|The ENVISAT {{validation}} programme for {{the atmospheric}} instruments MIPAS, SCIAMACHY and GOMOS {{is based on}} a number of balloon-borne, aircraft, satellite and ground-based correlative measurements. In particular the activities of validation scientists were coordinated by ESA within the ENVISAT Stratospheric Aircraft and Balloon Campaign or ESABC. As part of a series of similar papers on other species [this issue] and in parallel to the contribution of the individual validation teams, the present paper provides a synthesis of comparisons performed between MIPAS CH 4 and N 2 O profiles produced by the <b>current</b> <b>ESA</b> operational software (Instrument Processing Facility version 4. 61 or IPF v 4. 61, full resolution MIPAS data covering the period 9 July 2002 to 26 March 2004) and correlative measurements obtained from balloon and aircraft experiments as well as from satellite sensors or from ground-based instruments. In the middle stratosphere, no significant bias is observed between MIPAS and correlative measurements, and MIPAS is providing a very consistent and global picture of the distribution of CH 4 and N 2 O in this region. In average, the MIPAS CH 4 values show a small positive bias in the lower stratosphere of about 5 %. A similar situation is observed for N 2 O with a positive bias of 4 %. In the lower stratosphere/upper troposphere (UT/LS) the individual used MIPAS data version 4. 61 still exhibits some unphysical oscillations in individual CH 4 and N 2 O profiles caused by the processing algorithm (with almost no regularization). Taking these problems into account, the MIPAS CH 4 and N 2 O profiles are behaving as expected from the internal error estimation of IPF v 4. 61 and the estimated errors of the correlative measurements.

40|$|Navigation of deep-space probes is {{accomplished}} {{through a variety}} of different radio observables, namely Doppler, ranging and Delta-Differential One-Way Ranging (Delta-DOR). The particular mix of observations used for navigation mainly depends on the available on-board radio system, the mission phase and orbit determination requirements. The accuracy of <b>current</b> <b>ESA</b> and NASA tracking systems is at level of 0. 1 mais at 60 s integration time for Doppler, 1 to 5 m for ranging and 6 to 15 nrad for Delta-DOR measurements {{in a wide range of}} operational conditions. The ASTRA study, funded under ESA's General Studies Programme (GSP), addresses the ways to improve the end-to-end accuracy of Doppler, ranging and Delta-DOR systems by roughly a factor of 10. The target accuracies were set to 0. 01 mm/s at 60 s integration time for Doppler, 20 cm for ranging and 1 nrad for Delta-DOR. The companies and universities that took part in the study were the University of Rome Sapienza, ALMASpace, BAE Systems and Thales Alenia Space Italy. The analysis of an extensive data set of radio-metric observables and dedicated tests of the ground station allowed consolidating the error budget for each measurement technique. The radio-metric data set comprises X/X, X/Ka and Ka/Ka range and Doppler observables from the Cassini and Rosetta missions. It includes also measurements from the Advanced Media Calibration System (AMCS) developed by JPL for the radio science experiments of the Cassini mission. The error budget for the three radio-metric observables was consolidated by comparing the statistical properties of the data set with the expected error models. The analysis confirmed the contribution from some error sources, but revealed also some discrepancies and ultimately led to improved error models. The error budget reassessment provides adequate information for building guidelines and strategies to effectively improve the navigation accuracies of future deep space missions. We report both on updated error budget for radio-metric observables and the system configurations proposed for the upgrade of ESA's tracking and orbit determination systems...|$|R
40|$|Returning to the Moon {{has been}} {{advocated}} {{by a large}} number of international planetary scientists in order to answer several key scientific questions. The UK also has an active lunar science community keen to support (robotic) lunar exploration missions. However, for several years these interests have been eclipsed by the drive to Mars. Recently there is a renewed global interest in the Moon demonstrated by the Vision for Space Exploration in the USA, the evolving Global Exploration Partnership, and new lunar missions from Europe, Japan, China, India and the USA. The ESA Aurora programme may also broaden its focus to embrace the Moon as well as Mars—realizing that the risks associated with many of the major technical challenges that are faced by Mars missions could be reduced by relatively inexpensive and timely lunar technology tests. Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL) and Surrey Space Centre (SSC) have been preparing a ‘smallsat’ approach [Sweeting, M. N., Underwood, C. I., 2003. Small-satellite engineering and applications. In: Fortescue, P., Stark, J., Swinerd, G., (Eds.), Spacecraft Systems Engineering, third edition. Wiley, New York, pp. 581 – 612] to achieving a low-cost lunar mission for more than a decade—including various activities, such as the earlier LunarSat study funded by <b>ESA</b> and a <b>current</b> hardware contribution to the Chandrayaan- 1 mission. With the recent successes in GIOVE-A, TOPSAT and BEIJING- 1, 1 alongside participation in Aurora and Chandrayaan- 1, Surrey have developed capabilities for providing affordable engineering solutions to space exploration. Recently, SSTL/SSC was funded by the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) (now subsumed into the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council) to undertake a study on low-cost lunar mission concepts that could address key scientific questions. This paper presents some major results from this study [Phipps and Gao, 2006. Lunar mission options study.

40|$|Aerospace {{industry}} {{demands for}} significantly reduced development and operating costs. Reduction of structural weight at safe design is one avenue {{to achieve this}} objective. The running ESA (European Space Agency) study Probabilistic Aspects of Buckling Knock Down Factor acts on this route. It concentrates on thin-walled circular cylindrical CFRP shells subjected to axial compression. It {{is well known that}} such structures exhibit not only a high load carrying capacity but also are prone to buckling which is highly imperfection sensitive. Imperfections are defined as deviations from perfect parameters like shape, thickness, material properties and loading distributions, they can reduce the buckling load drastically compared to a perfect shell. In order to account for these imperfections the theoretical buckling load of a perfect cylinder must be multiplied, and therefore reduced, by a knock-down factor (the ratio of buckling loads of imperfect and perfect cylindrical shell). Thus the closer the knock-down factor reflects the effect of imperfections the better is the prediction of the real buckling load. In the still used NASA SP- 8007 design guideline from 1968 a lower bound curve for the knock-down factor is proposed. The factor depends on the slenderness (the ratio of radius and wall thickness) and decreases with increasing slenderness. This factor is rather conservative and the structural behaviour of composite material is not considered adequately. Advanced thin-walled cylindrical shell structures under compression are therefore penalized if the knock-down factor based on this early NASA report must be applied. The <b>current</b> <b>ESA</b> study started in May 2006 and will run for 18 months. Its main objective is to achieve a better buckling knock-down factor for unstiffened CFRP cylindrical shells and to validate the linear and non-linear buckling simulations by test results. The main results will comprise an experimental data base (material properties, measured thicknesses, full scale shape imperfections, load-shortening curves, strains, and deformations) obtained by testing of 10 nominally identical axially compressed CFRP cylindrical shells, sensitivity analyses using Monte-Carlo simulation, validation with tests and a design guideline for that type of structure with a less conservative knock-down factor than taken from NASA SP- 8007. All tasks of the ESA study are performed at the Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems of DLR Braunschweig, which has a rich body of experience in design, manufacturing, testing and analysis of shells prone to buckling. The paper outlines the objectives and expected results of the running ESA study and presents the results achieved so far...|$|R
40|$|ESA-ESRIN, the European Space Agency Centre for Earth Observation (EO), is {{the largest}} European EO data {{provider}} and operates as the reference European centre for EO payload data exploitation. EO Space Missions provide global coverage of the Earth across both space and time generating on a routine continuous basis huge amounts of data (from a variety of sensors) {{that need to be}} acquired, processed, elaborated, appraised and archived by dedicated systems. Long-term Preservation of these data and of the ability to discover, access and process them is a fundamental issue and a major challenge at programmatic, technological and operational levels. Moreover these data are essential for scientists needing broad series of data covering long time periods and from many sources. They are used for many types of investigations including ones of international importance such as the study of the Global Change and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) Program. Therefore it is of primary importance not only to guarantee easy accessibility of historical data but also to ensure users are able to understand and use them; in fact data interpretation can be even more complicated given the fact that scientists may not have (or may not have access to) the right knowledge to interpret these data correctly. To satisfy these requirements, the European Space Agency (ESA), in addition to other internal initiatives, is participating in several EU-funded projects such as CASPAR (Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific knowledge for Preservation, Access and Retrieval), which is building a framework to support the end-to-end preservation lifecycle for digital information, based on the OAIS reference model, with a strong focus on the preservation of the knowledge associated with data. In the CASPAR Project ESA plays the role of both user and infrastructure provider for one of the scientific testbeds, putting into effect dedicated scenarios with the aim of validating the CASPAR solutions in the Earth Science domain. The other testbeds are in the domains of Cultural Heritage and of Contemporary Performing Arts; together they provide a severe test of preservation tools and techniques. In the context of the <b>current</b> <b>ESA</b> overall strategies carried out in collaboration with European EO data owners/providers, entities and institutions which have the objective of guaranteeing long-term preservation of EO data and knowledge, this paper will focus on the ESA participation and contribution to the CASPAR Project, describing in detail the implementation of the ESA scientific testbed...|$|R
