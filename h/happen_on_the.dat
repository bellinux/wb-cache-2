In this episode, an associate of the Millennium Group—a secret society which believes the apocalypse will <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new year of 2000—resurrects the dead for use in bringing about the apocalypse. As a result, Mulder and Scully {{have to ask the}} help of criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), a man who has former experience with the shadowy group, for assistance.|$|E
5|$|With {{almost four}} years gone in his government's five-year term, in mid-1939 Mackenzie King {{considered}} an election and asked British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in early August if he thought anything was likely to <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> international scene. Chamberlain warned of unsettled conditions on the German—Polish border; Britain had promised to assist Polish independence {{in the event of}} war. Mackenzie King decided to wait to hold an election. On 1 September, Germany invaded Poland. Mackenzie King recalled Parliament into session beginning 7 September, and Canada declared war on Germany. Before adjourning on 13 September, Parliament passed legislation creating a Department of Munitions and Supply.|$|E

25|$|At the {{earliest}} stage, this basic principle {{applied only to}} the relation between longa and breve. Beginning with Franco of Cologne, the same pattern was also applied between breves and semibreves, and finally, with Philippe de Vitry's theory of the Ars nova, it was taken yet another level down, to the newly introduced minims. From that time onwards, imperfection and alteration could <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> level of breves and semibreves whenever the piece was in tempus perfectum, and it could happen between semibreves and minims if the piece was in prolatio maior. The divisions below the minim were invariably binary. Theorists developed an intricate set of precedence rules for {{when and how to}} apply imperfection, together with a complex terminology for its different types.|$|E

25|$|After King Alexander died without heirs, {{the general}} {{elections}} {{scheduled to be}} held on November 1, 1920 suddenly {{became the focus of}} a new conflict between the supporters of Venizelos and the Royalists. The anti-Venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government, which, due to the war, had stayed in power without elections since 1915. At the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in Asia Minor, without though presenting a clear plan as to how this would <b>happen.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary, Venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not seem to go anywhere. The majority of the Greek people were both war-weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the Venizelists, so opted for change. To the surprise of many, Venizelos won only 118 out of the total 369 seats. The crushing defeat obliged Venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country. To this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned.|$|E
25|$|Jack's {{old friend}} is J.J. Wickham, {{known as the}} 'Sea Ranger' due to his use of an old Russian submarine. After a lengthy {{explanation}} he takes Jack to the Second Vertex, arriving just as Wolf does. Switchblade attempts to sabotage the mission by dropping the Second pillar into the bottomless abyss beneath the Vertex before it is inlaid, dooming the world and depriving the Americans of its reward, 'Heat' (believed to be a limitless power-source). However, Jack swings across the pit at the last moment, catches the pillar, and manages to place it in the Vertex just before Switchblade drops himself and Jack into the abyss. Wickham and the Adamsons escape, with Horus diving into the abyss after Jack. Wolf leaves with the Second Pillar, leaving Alby, who was brought with them, alone at the Vertex. Zoe, Sky Monster, Lily and Wizard, on board the Halicarnassus on an airfield in Botswana, had been in phone contact with Jack to help him avoid the traps at the Vertex and see the whole thing <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> videophone. The surviving team members realize they must face the placing {{of the last four}} pillars and the arrival of the Dark Sun, three months away, without Jack.|$|E
25|$|German railway {{operator}} Deutsche Bahn {{at first}} limited {{the maximum speed}} of its trains to 200km/h (124mph), then all services on the domestic InterCity/InterCityExpress network {{as well as the}} local services in Northern and Western Germany were discontinued from 17:15 CET on 18 January onwards, as major main lines (Bremen-Hannover, Hamburg-Hanover, Bremen-Osnabrück) and many branch lines were affected by the storm. In an unprecedented move, Deutsche Bahn discontinued virtually all train services in Germany at 19:30 CET until further notice, with only very limited local services running on a per-line decision basis. Trains currently on the lines would stop at the next station and stay there, leaving passengers stranded all over Germany in the tens of thousands. Later, as the situation was worsening, trains were left open for those passengers unable to find a hotel to sleep in. In major affected stations, such as Münster and Hanover, air raid shelters in the stations were opened up for the night, with the Red Cross issuing blankets to stranded passengers. Train services were resumed on the morning of 19 January, but cancellations and delays continued during the weekend as 34,000kilometres (21,100mi) of track needed to be checked and cleared. The DB was faced by the massive challenge of getting its network into working order again after coming to a full stop during the night, the first such event ever to <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German railway network in peacetime. On 18 January, an InterCity train ran into a tree that had fallen onto the tracks between Elmshorn and Westerland. One of the locomotives was damaged, no casualties were reported. An InterCity train with 450 passengers on board was stuck near Diepholz and had to be evacuated, Duisburg Hauptbahnhof station was suffering from a power outage {{as the result of a}} grid failure.|$|E

500|$|Johnston's {{plan was}} to attack Grant's left, {{separate}} the Union army from its gunboat support and avenue of retreat on the Tennessee River, and drive it west into the swamps of Snake and Owl Creeks, where it could be destroyed. The attack on Grant was originally planned for April 4, but it was delayed forty-eight hours due to a heavy rain storm that turned roads into seas of mud, causing some units {{to get lost in}} the woods and others to grind to a halt faced with heavy traffic jams. [...] It ended up taking Johnston 3 days to move his army just 23 miles. This was a significant setback for the Confederate Army, as the originally scheduled attack would have commenced when Buell's Army of the Ohio was too far away to be of any aid to Grant. [...] Instead, it would <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 6th with Buell's army close at hand and able to re-enforce Grant on the second day. [...] Furthermore, the delay left the Confederate Army desperately short of rations. [...] They had issued their troops 5 days of rations just before leaving Corinth, but failure to properly conserve their food intake and the 2-day delay left most troops completely out rations by the time the battle commenced.|$|E
500|$|The script {{went through}} two {{drafting}} stages, {{with the main}} issue being the alien element rather than the Viking details. Shankar was pleased that the work he did on the Viking parts of the script went unchanged from the first draft to the screen, calling it his [...] "best experience" [...] as a writer. He also chose the first name that the Doctor would attempt to use, selecting Albert Schweitzer {{from a list of}} scientists and doctors because he thought the surname sounded funny. He expected that it would be cut or changed, based on his experience in writing humorous elements into scripts for The Next Generation. He wrote several lighthearted scenes into the script and was pleased when none of them were cut, saying that he was particularly proud of the exchange between the Doctor and Freya where she says [...] "Your people must value you highly", and the Doctor responds dryly, [...] "You would think so." [...] He submitted his final version of the script on February 2, 1995. Taylor later talked about the use of the holodeck as a plot device in this episode, saying that it allowed the series to show things that otherwise couldn't <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. She added that the plot in this episode [...] "transcended the idea of 'Oh, we're in trouble on the holodeck.'" ...|$|E
