5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. Partly because he was shy about performing in public, and partly because of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue <b>his</b> <b>literary</b> interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{willingness}} to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic {{with the publication of}} books such as Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of <b>his</b> <b>literary</b> work.|$|E

5|$|Champfleury was {{intimidated by}} her {{vitality}} and jealousy, and removed himself from her life. On his recommendation, she turned creative control of Balzac's unfinished novels Le Député d'Arcis and Les Petits Bourgeois to another writer, Charles Rabou. Rabou added extensively {{to them and}} published both books in 1854. To soothe the publisher, Hańska falsely claimed that Balzac had chosen Rabou as <b>his</b> <b>literary</b> successor.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of {{successful}} plays, Planché was never particularly wealthy, and he felt pressure from needing to support his grandchildren.

5|$|He pursued <b>his</b> <b>literary</b> {{goals by}} {{submitting}} {{poetry and prose}} to various newspapers and magazines, partly due to encouragement from Professor Thomas Cogswell Upham. He published nearly 40 minor poems between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825. About 24 of them {{were published in the}} short-lived Boston periodical The United States Literary Gazette. When Longfellow graduated from Bowdoin, he was ranked fourth in the class and had been elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He gave the student commencement address.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in {{the running of the}} newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on <b>his</b> <b>literary</b> work.
