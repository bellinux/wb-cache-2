5|$|Sviatoslav's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described very clearly by Leo the Deacon, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes. Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> head and his beard but wore a bushy mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{begins his}} investigations. Having ascertained {{the name of}} Miss Carnaby's {{previous}} employer, Lady Hartingfield who died a year before, he visits her niece who confirms Lady Hoggin's view of Miss Carnaby's lack of intellect but essential good qualities, looking after an invalid sister and being good with dogs, {{so much so that}} Lady Hartingfield left her Pekingese to her. Poirot interviews the park keeper who remembers the incident of the kidnap. He then investigates the address where the ransom money was sent to and finds it is a cheap hotel where letters are often left for non-residents. His third visit is to the wife of the man Hoggin met at his club who gives a very similar story to that told by Lady Hoggin as to the method of kidnap and ransom demand. His last visit is back to Sir Joseph to report on progress where he observes that Sir Joseph's relationship with <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> secretary is not exactly on a professional level.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1996, Sting's {{appearance}} {{started to}} change: he grew longer, darker hair, replacing <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> flattop haircut, {{and he often}} wore black tights with a multi-colored scorpion, although he occasionally wore his colorful ones and maintained his colorful face paint. Sting teamed with his old friend Luger, who had returned to WCW from WWF in September 1995, despite Luger's standing as a heel. The duo beat Harlem Heat for the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the January 22 edition of Nitro. The team often retained the championship {{as a result of}} Luger's cheating tactics, to which Sting remained oblivious. When Luger was temporarily unavailable for WCW Uncensored in March, Harlem Heat member Booker T teamed up with Sting to successfully prevent the title from changing hands. Sting and Booker T developed a mutual respect that showed itself when Sting and Luger granted Harlem Heat a rematch. During the Tag title run, Sting received a World title shot against The Giant at Slamboree in May, but lost after accidental interference from Luger. Harlem Heat eventually won the titles back on the June 24 edition of Nitro.|$|E

500|$|Gebhard {{was born}} in the Fürstenburg {{fortress}} of Heiligenberg, the second son of William, known as the younger, (6March 1518 – 17January 1566), Freiherr and Seneschal of Waldburg and an Imperial Councilor, and his wife, Johanna v. Fürstenberg [...] (1529–1589). His family was an old Swabian house and he was descended from the Jacobin line of the House: Jakob I Truchseß von Waldburg, also known as the Golden Knight (for <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> hair). The family owned extensive properties that bordered on the Abbey of Kempten and various Habsburg territories in present-day southwestern Bavaria; In 1429 and 1463, the three surviving sons of Johann II, Jakob, Everhard, and George, and their surviving sister Ursula, concluded a covenant of inheritance to protect the family property. In the future, they would occupy and own the property as one; the inheritance of the daughters could not exceed 4000 gulden. They guaranteed each other the right of first refusal on potential property sales.|$|E
500|$|When Storm {{became a}} {{professional}} singer, {{he changed his}} name to Rory Storm by deed poll, and changed the name of his family's home in Broadgreen to Stormsville. Storm was known for the extravagant clothes he wore and the cars he drove, once buying a pink Vauxhall Cresta for £800 in cash. A young man was once caught by a porter at Bootle railway station writing [...] "I love Rory" [...] over the walls, and when questioned, {{it turned out to be}} Storm himself. The Hurricanes wore matching suits on stage, but Storm sometimes wore a pink suit and pink tie, and during concerts he would walk over to the piano and comb <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> hair with an oversized comb. Their stage wear changed from sunglasses and palm tree-decorated shirts to red (and blue) suits. Storm also wore an Elvis-style gold lamé suit. When they first appeared at Butlins holiday camp Storm wore a turquoise suit with a gold lamé shirt, while the group wore fluorescent suits.|$|E
500|$|Hitler {{regarded}} northern Italians to {{be strongly}} Aryan but not southern Italians. He even admitted that The Ahnenerbe, an archaeological organization {{associated with the}} SS, asserted that archaeological evidence proved the presence of Nordic-Germanic peoples {{in the region of}} South Tyrol in the Neolithic era that it claimed proved the significance of ancient Nordic-Germanic influence on northern Italy. The NSDAP regime regarded the ancient Romans to have been largely a people of the Mediterranean race however they claimed that the Roman ruling classes were Nordic, descended from Aryan conquerors from the North; and that this Nordic Aryan minority was responsible for the rise of Roman civilization. The National Socialists viewed the downfall of the Roman Empire as being the result of the deterioration of the purity of the Nordic Aryan ruling class through its intermixing with the inferior Mediterranean types that led to the empire's decay. In addition, racial intermixing in the population in general was also blamed for Rome's downfall, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Due to the darker complexion of Mediterranean peoples, Hitler regarded them as having traces of Negroid blood and therefore did not have strong Nordic Aryan heritage and were thus inferior to those that had stronger Nordic heritage. Hitler held immense admiration for the Roman Empire and its legacy. Hitler praised post-Roman era achievements of northern Italians such as Sandro Botticelli, Michelangelo, Dante Alighieri, and Benito Mussolini. The Nazis ascribed the great achievements of post-Roman era northern Italians to the presence of Nordic racial heritage in such people who via their Nordic heritage had Germanic ancestors, such as NSDAP Foreign Affairs official Alfred Rosenberg recognizing Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci as exemplary Nordic men of history. German official Hermann Hartmann wrote that Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was clearly Nordic with deep Germanic roots because of <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> hair, blue eyes, and long face. The Nazis claimed that aside from biologically Nordic people that a Nordic soul could inhabit a non-Nordic body. Hitler emphasized the role of Germanic influence in Northern Italy, such as stating that the art of Northern Italy was [...] "nothing but pure German", and National Socialist scholars viewed that the Ladin and Friulian minorities of Northern Italy were racially, historically and culturally a part of the Germanic world. To put it bluntly, Hitler declared in private talks that the modern Reich should emulate the racial policy of the old Roman-Germanic Holy Empire, by annexing the Italian lands and especially Lombardy, whose population had well preserved their original Germanic Aryan character, unlike the lands of East Europe, with its racially alien population, scarcely marked by a Germanic contribution. According to him, German are more closely linked with the Italians than with any other people. Plans to incorporate northern Italy into the Greater Germanic Reich were influenced by the collapse of the fascist Italian government in 1943.|$|E

2500|$|Scherer began {{swimming}} {{when he was}} a {{child to}} help improve his respiratory problems. When he was 14, he participated in his first competitions and trained at the Doze de Agosto club. In 1992, he began to achieve national prominence, winning the 50-meter freestyle and 100-meter freestyle in the Brazil Trophy. That day, his friends created a nickname [...] "Xuxa", by which Scherer became widely known because <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> hair resembled that of a children's television presenter with the same name.|$|E
2500|$|After {{this initial}} success, Redford became {{concerned}} about <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> male stereotype image and turned down roles in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and The Graduate. [...] Redford found the niche {{he was looking}} for in George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), scripted by William Goldman, in which he was paired {{for the first time with}} Paul Newman. The film was a huge success and made him a major bankable star, cementing his screen image as an intelligent, reliable, sometimes sardonic good guy.|$|E
2500|$|The Modern Age Aquaman is born as Orin to Queen Atlanna and {{the mysterious}} wizard Atlan in the Atlantean city of Poseidonis. As a baby, he was {{abandoned}} on Mercy Reef (which is {{above sea level}} at low tide, causing exposure to air which would be fatal to Atlanteans) because of <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> hair, which was seen by the superstitious Atlanteans {{as a sign of}} a curse they called [...] "the Mark of Kordax." [...] The only individual who spoke up on Orin's behalf was Vulko, a scientist who had no patience for myth or superstition. While his pleas fell on deaf ears, Vulko would later become a close friend and advisor to the young Orin.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Walken {{played a}} James Bond villain, Max Zorin, in A View to a Kill, Roger Moore's last {{appearance}} as Bond. Walken dyed <b>his</b> hair <b>blond</b> to befit Zorin's origins as a Nazi experiment.|$|R

2500|$|Kitchener {{was worried}} that, {{although}} his moustache was bleached white by the sun, <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> hair refused to turn grey, {{making it harder}} for Egyptians to take him seriously. His appearance added to his mystique: his long legs made him appear taller, whilst a cast in his eye made people feel he was looking right through them. Kitchener, at 6'2", towered over most of his contemporaries. Sir Evelyn Baring, the de facto British ruler of Egypt, thought Kitchener “the most able (soldier) I have come across in my time”. In 1890, a War Office evaluation of Kitchener concluded: [...] "A good brigadier, very ambitious, not popular, but has of late greatly improved in tact and manner...a fine gallant soldier and good linguist and very successful in dealing with Orientals" [...]|$|E

2500|$|François' career {{continued}} to blossom {{under a new}} manager. In 1963 he followed the first success with another French adaptation of an American song, this time recording [...] "If I Had a Hammer" [...] and [...] "Walk Right In" [...] in French as [...] "Si j'avais un marteau" [...] and [...] "Marche Tout Droit". [...] François met Michel Bourdais who {{was working for the}} well-known French magazine Salut les Copains ("Hi Buddies"). He liked the rigour and the precision of Michel's drawings and asked him to draw his portrait. This drawing has remained very famous. Capitalizing on <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> good looks, he mimicked Elvis Presley's stage style as well as the slicked-back hair. Performing in sequined suits, François gave high-energy stage performances that had hordes of adoring teenage fans racing to the music shops to purchase his latest record or lining up to buy a ticket for his shows.|$|E
5000|$|His various nicknames {{include the}} {{frequently}} used [...] "bad boy of Singapore football" [...] for his disciplinary problems {{on and off}} the pitch, and also [...] "the blond bombshell" [...] in reference to <b>his</b> bleached <b>blond</b> hair.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Henley's [...] "maimed strength," [...] his impeded vigour, even <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> {{upstanding}} {{hair and}} [...] "beard all tangled," [...] his uncomplaining fortitude {{under the most}} cruel trials, and the candid freshness of his conversation on men and books, won Stevenson's heart.|$|E
60|$|At 9 {{o'clock in}} the evening one descended to the {{sidewalk}} whom Ulster County would have foresworn. Bright tan were his shoes; his hat the latest block. His light gray trousers were deeply creased; a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his elegant English walking coat. His collar might have graced a laundry window; <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> hair was trimmed close; the wisp of hay was gone.|$|E
60|$|The man startled, half {{lifted his}} rifle to the perpendicular, and looked up. There was {{something}} quick and catlike in his movements, and in <b>his</b> burned <b>blond</b> face a fighting eagerness. It was {{the face of}} a killer.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tulliver was {{speaking}} to <b>his</b> wife, a <b>blond,</b> comely woman in a fan-shaped cap.|$|R
50|$|Several {{members of}} the public were also interviewed, {{including}} a redheaded man who had taken to dying <b>his</b> hair <b>blond</b> to avoid abuse and another ginger who moved to the United States to avoid what he considered discrimination in the UK.|$|R
60|$|At her left, however, sat two {{men whose}} {{greetings}} were frank and manly, and whose table-manners betrayed a higher form of life. One {{of them was}} a tall man with a lean red face against which <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> mustache lay like a chalk-mark. He wore a corduroy jacket, cut in Norfolk style, and in the collar of his yellow shirt a green tie was loosely knotted. His hands were long and freckled, but were manifestly trained to polite usages.|$|E
6000|$|It {{appeared}} {{from what she}} {{went on to say that}} in the German, which began not long after midnight, there was a figure fancifully called the symphony, in which musical toys were distributed among the dancers in pairs; the possessor of a small pandean pipe, or tin horn, went about sounding it, till he found some lady similarly equipped, when he demanded her in the dance. In this way a tall mask, to whom a penny trumpet had fallen, was stalking to and fro among the waltzers, blowing the silly plaything with a disgusted air, when Lily, all unconscious of him, where she sat with her hand in that of her faithful princess, breathed a responsive note. The mask was instantly at her side, and she was whirling away in the waltz. She tried to make him out, but she had already danced with so many people that she was unable to decide whether she had seen this mask before. He was not disguised except by the little visor of black silk, coming down to the point of his nose; <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> whiskers escaped at either side, and <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> moustache swept beneath, like the whiskers and moustaches of fifty other officers present, and he did not speak. This was a permissible caprice of his, but if she were resolved to make him speak, this also was a permissible caprice. She made a whole turn of the room in studying up the Italian sentence with which she assailed him: [...] "Perdoni, Maschera; ma cosa ha detto? Non ho ben inteso." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{went out}} to dinner immediately, and as she walked beside Mart she felt the young athlete's eyes resting upon her face, and the {{knowledge}} of this troubled her unaccountably. Mrs. Congdon seated him opposite her at the table, and he continued to stare at her with the frankest curiosity. She returned his gaze at last with a certain defiance, but found no offence in his eyes, which were round as his face, and of a sincere, steady gray. He was smooth-shaven, and <b>his</b> <b>blond</b> hair was rather short. All these peculiarities appeared one by one in the intervals between her attentions to Mart and her study of the furnishings of the table, which was decorated with candles and flowers in a way quite new to her.|$|E
6000|$|And he was not. <b>His</b> long <b>blond</b> moustache, shaved beard, and clipped hair {{made a new}} man of him, and a very {{handsome}} man, too, in a large way. He was curiously embarrassed by Bert's prolonged scrutiny, and said jocosely: ...|$|R
50|$|Ralph Garman {{returned}} {{to host the}} second season as Derek Newcastle, dying <b>his</b> hair <b>blond</b> and wearing a fake beard, glasses, blue contact lenses and false teeth plus spoke with a British accent so {{he would not be}} recognized by the new contestants.|$|R
5000|$|Deyan (Dēyan) - [...] - bass - He has the {{appearance}} of a devil. A bit frivolous. <b>His</b> glowing <b>blond</b> hair is <b>his</b> trademark and he loves dressing up/being fashionable. Always criticizes the members' clothes. His aggressive performance is his strong point.|$|R
