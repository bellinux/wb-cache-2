500|$|An early {{version of}} the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as {{it seemed to be}} the most humorous choice.

500|$|Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{wrote that}} [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] {{sounds like a}} [...] "Tumblr-meme version" [...] of the singer's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together".

Malone from NME found no innovation in the track, writing, [...] "combined with earlier single 'Give Me All Your Luvin' it points to an uneasy mix for album MDNA." [...] Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times felt that Madonna would have been better re-releasing [...] "Music" [...] again as a single, instead of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". She added that [...] "There's something very attractive about a song this militaristic and precise, but in Madge's too-capable hands it's also suffocatingly professional." ...|$|E
