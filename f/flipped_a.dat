5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, remnant moisture from Rick enhanced a strong cold front over the Great Plains of the United States. Severe thunderstorms occurred over parts of the southern states, with at least three tornadoes touching down in Louisiana. Further north, the complex brought heavy rainfall to the northeast and parts of southern Canada. In Louisiana, the storm system spawned seven tornadoes, two of which were ranked as EF-1. One of these tornadoes damaged more than 10structures, destroyed a grain silo, <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> tractor trailer and left numerous residents without power. In all, the tornadoes left nearly $1million in losses and injured one person.|$|E
5|$|Game six was a Canadian 3–2 victory. There was no scoring {{during the}} first period. Lyapkin scored the first goal at 1:12 of the second period, but the Canadians' {{confidence}} did not waver. The Canadians caught the Soviets in a lapse and scored three goals in a one-and-a-half-minute span to take a 3–1 lead. Hull <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> rebound over Tretiak to tie the score after Gilbert had capitalized on a Soviet giveaway. Cournoyer scored on a set-up from behind the net by Berenson. Fifteen seconds later, Henderson scored {{what turned out to}} be the winning third goal on a thirty-foot slap shot. Yakushev scored late in the second on a power play to finish the scoring.|$|E
50|$|Events are collectively {{exhaustive}} if all {{the possibilities}} for outcomes are exhausted by those possible events, so {{at least one of}} those outcomes must occur. The probability {{that at least one of}} the events will occur is equal to one. For example, there are theoretically only two possibilities for <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> coin. <b>Flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail are collectively exhaustive events, and there is a probability of one of <b>flipping</b> either <b>a</b> head or a tail. Events can be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In the case of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> coin, <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail are also mutually exclusive events. Both outcomes cannot occur for a single trial (i.e., when <b>a</b> coin is <b>flipped</b> only once). The probability of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and the probability of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail can be added to yield a probability of 1: 1/2 + 1/2 =1.|$|R

5|$|Both the Dodgers and Braves {{finished}} the regularly scheduled 154-game season tied with records of 86–68, forcing a tie-breaker {{to decide the}} pennant winner. The two teams' managers <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> coin to decide home field advantage and Dodgers' manager Walt Alston won. The Dodgers opted to play {{the second and third}} (if necessary) games at home, choosing to play Game 1 in Milwaukee. The tie-breaker was scheduled for the 28th, 29th, and the 30th if necessary, which required moving the start of the World Series from September 30 to October 1. The Giants' falling out of the pennant race avoided a potentially disruptive situation involving their home field. Candlestick Park was under construction during the 1959 season and the Giants would not begin play there until 1960. However, Giants vice president Chub Feeney had said earlier in the season that if the Giants won the pennant they would play their World Series home games in Candlestick. Several potential problems were suggested with this move including a lack of seating, lack of toilet facilities, and insufficient access roads to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} the effect is due to quantum entanglement between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in the parallel one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace a faulty fuse after they <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that the parallel universe Alice died in a similar fashion due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to the parallel universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer to their children. Alice, who is childless, realizes Peter and Olivia are telling the truth; the connection is broken and the effects on the building ebb away.|$|E

5000|$|We can {{see from}} the above that, if one <b>flips</b> <b>a</b> fair coin 21 times, then the {{probability}} of 21 heads is 1 in 2,097,152.

25|$|In the Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretation, {{probability}} measures a “degree of belief.” Bayes’ theorem then {{links the}} degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence. For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is {{twice as likely to}} land heads than tails. If the coin is <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief may rise, fall or remain the same depending on the results.|$|E

In his interview, no mention is made of Jennings or Allsup being invited on the plane. Dion claims that he won the toss, but ultimately decided that since the $36 fare (equivalent to US$ in today's money) equaled the monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment, he could not justify the indulgence.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was born}} on November 30, 1964 in Des Moines, Iowa. She is the {{youngest}} of five children of former race car driver Richard [...] "Lefty" [...] Robinson, an amateur diesel truck racer who worked on cars in his home garage and promoted races in the Midwestern United States, and his wife Lois who competed in auto racing before she <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> car, and was asked by Lefty to stop racing. She {{grew up in a}} poor family. Lefty and Lois were also known for innovative ways of entertaining crowds at stock car races which garnered national recognition. Robinson was inspired by race car drivers A. J. Foyt, Sammy Swindell, and Steve Kinser in her teenage years, and found inspiration in woman driver Janet Guthrie by her early twenties, as she had more interest in NASCAR than open-wheel racing. She and her siblings were taught that they were allowed to do anything they wished and drove minibikes, motorcycles, and snowmobiles.|$|E

500|$|He was {{promoted}} to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association for the 1947 campaign when Indianapolis owner Frank McKinney bought controlling interest in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. [...] Allegedly, Bickford stayed {{as part of the}} Braves organization due to a flip of a coin at a local bar. An argument endured between McKinney, Braves president Lou Perini and Braves general manager John Quinn during spring training over the fate of the players in the organization, with McKinney wanting to move Indianapolis and all its players to the Pirates organization. [...] Via a gentleman's agreement, they decided to split the players with a flip of a coin. They <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> coin for the first selection, similar to a sports draft. [...] If the coin landed heads, the player was headed to the Pirates organization and if it landed tails they stayed in Braves organization. The coin landed on tails, and the Braves picked Bickford and took over his contract. Perini later recalled on why he selected Bickford. Brooklyn's general manager Branch Rickey had interest in the young right-hander, and Perini thought that [...] "if Bickford was good enough for Rickey, he was good enough for the Braves". Bickford played for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1947, where he had a 9–5 win-loss record with a 3.78 earned run average in 29 games, 14 of which were starts.|$|E
500|$|The Dodgers lost 10 {{of their}} final 13 games from September 16 to 30, while the Giants lost just 6 {{over the same}} span. However, with seven games {{remaining}} the Dodgers [...] were still ahead in the league by four games, and held a two-game lead with three left to play. [...] They [...] entered their final game with a one-game lead over the Giants, but fell 1–0 to the St. Louis Cardinals. Meanwhile, the Giants won 2–1 over the Houston Colt [...]45's, after an eighth-inning home run by Willie Mays. These results left the Dodgers and Giants tied in the league at 101–61, necessitating a tie-breaker to decide the NL pennant. The two teams had also played closely against one another {{during the regular season}} to this point, with each winning 9 of their 18 match-ups prior to the tie-breaker. Dodgers' manager Walt Alston and Giants' manager Alvin Dark could not agree on dates and sites for the tie-breaker, so they <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> coin to decide home field advantage. Alston won the flip, opting to play the first game in San Francisco and the remaining two games in Los Angeles. The Dodgers had been more successful at home in the season, holding a 53–28 (.654 winning percentage) record there while going 47–34 (.580) on the road. Alston had also won the flip for the 1959 tie-breaker, which the Dodgers had gone on to win, and had chosen the same format.|$|E

2500|$|In {{their last}} {{offensive}} drive, the Packers took over possession {{at their own}} 32-yard line with 4:50 left in regulation time. With the wind chill around [...] Starr led his team down the field, toward the south end zone. He began the drive with a double fake to his backs, but after no one was open downfield he <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> safety valve pass to running back Donny Anderson who gained six yards. Fullback Chuck Mercein then picked up seven on a sweep around right end, and went out of bounds to stop the clock. [...] Starr dropped straight back on first down and fired a 13-yard pass to Dowler over the middle. Cornell Green's tackle slammed the receiver's helmet off the icy turf, and Max McGee replaced Dowler.

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1921, Banting {{traveled}} to Toronto to explain his idea to J.J.R. Macleod, Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto, and asked Macleod if he could use his lab space to test the idea. Initially skeptical, Macleod eventually agreed and supplied Banting with ten test animals (dogs) and two medical students, Charles Best and Clark Noble, as lab assistants. Since Banting required only one lab assistant, Best and Noble <b>flipped</b> <b>a</b> coin to see which would assist Banting {{for the first half}} of the summer. Best won the coin toss and took the first shift. This may have proved unfortunate for Noble, Banting decided to keep Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and a large part of the credit for the discovery. Banting's method was to tie a ligature around the pancreatic duct; when examined several weeks later, the pancreatic digestive cells had died and been absorbed by the immune system, leaving thousands of islets. They then isolated an extract from these islets, producing what they called [...] "isletin" [...] (what we now know as insulin), and tested this extract on the dogs starting July 27. Banting and Best were then able to keep a pancreatectomized dog named Marjorie alive for the rest of the summer by injecting her with the crude extract they had prepared. Removal of the pancreas in test animals in essence mimics diabetes, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Marjorie was able to remain alive because the extracts, containing isletin, were able to lower her blood glucose levels.|$|E
