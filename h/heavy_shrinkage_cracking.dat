40|$|ASS'tRACT: Casts of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracks</b> {{found within}} {{sedimentary}} sequence are frequently cited as being diagnostic of depositional environments periodically subjected to subaerial exposure. The term <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracks,</b> however, encompasses a broad suite of sedimentary structures having various origins. <b>Shrinkage</b> <b>cracks</b> can form {{not only at}} the sediment-air interface by desiccation processes but also at the sediment-water interface or substratally by synaeresis processes. <b>Shrinkage</b> <b>cracks</b> are induced in muddy sediments by variations in the salinity of the depositing medium, sediment compaction, and temperature in the case of some desiccation mudcracks. Crack morphology is influenced by the interplay of numerous factors, such as sedimem composition, bed thickness, and bed surface configuration. Factors controlling desiccation mudcracks also include the rate of initial drying, total exposure time, depth of the groundwater table, and direction of surface drainage. Unfortunately, because of the complex interplay of these factors, no single feature of any <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> is necessarily useful in differentiating between a desiccation or synaeresis origin. Confidence in interpreting subaerial exposure from <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracks,</b> therefore, depends on finding other associated sedimentary structures diagnostic of exposure...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityThis {{research}} {{identifies the}} properties of cementitiously stabilized materials that significantly affect <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> in pavements with cementitiously stabilized layers. Methods for measuring these properties are recommended. The research approach consists of literature review, test procedure evaluation, and model development and calibration. Based on the test procedure evaluation, unconfined compressive strength, and indirect tensile strength and modulus tests are recommended. A suite of shrinkage-related tests is used to develop <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> models; these tests include free drying shrinkage (including ultimate drying shrinkage), coefficient of thermal expansion, coefficient of friction, and restrained <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> tests. Performance-related models are developed based on laboratory experiments, including strength and modulus growth models, and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> models. The strength growth models are developed based on extended testing at different curing times up to 360 days under standard curing conditions. Temperature and relative humidity {{are included in the}} growth models to assess indirect tensile strength and modulus values, which are critical to early-age <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> and are sensitive to early-age curing conditions. Restrained <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> tests are conducted on laboratory-scale beams. These results considering the effect of moisture gradient and drying shrinkage gradient along the depth of CSL are used to develop new mechanistic based <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> spacing and width models. It is found that neither the existing models nor the developed mechanistic based models can predict crack spacing and width in the field. Empirical <b>shrinkage</b> <b>crack</b> spacing and width models are developed based on dimensional analysis using field data.

Drying shrinkage is the major problem associated with <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking.</b> Although some studies on the drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> of concrete have been carried out, few research efforts have focused on unsaturated soil and cement soil. Even fewer studies consider the shrinkage stress distribution and evolution of the stress profile during drying and/or cement hydration in <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> modeling. Using two types of soil and two types of cement soil, this study investigates the soil and cement soil properties {{that are related to}} drying <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking.</b> These material properties, which are considered in this study to be dependent on pore relative humidity (RH) and/or cement hydration and, therefore, are neither uniform nor constant during drying and/or cement hydration, include the humidity isotherm, diffusion coefficient, soil water characteristic curve (SWCC), tensile strength, tensile stress-strain relationship, and shrinkage potential, etc. This study examines the effects of pore RH and/or cement hydration on these material properties. Models are developed herein to predict the evolution of these material properties during drying and/or cement hydration. By measuring the humidity isotherm and diffusion coefficient and using the finite element (FE) method, the evolution of the pore RH gradient within the soil or cement soil specimens during drying can be fully captured. A coefficient of moisture shrinkage is proposed to bridge the knowledge gap between pore RH and shrinkage potential, which is defined in this study as the maximum possible drying shrinkage of a material at a given pore RH when there is no restraint. Then, the pore RH and/or cement hydration-dependent tensile strength, tensile stress-strain relationship, and shrinkage potential within the specimens during drying and/or cement hydration can be fully understood using the models developed in this study.

The plastic behaviour of eight high strength concrete mixes was quantified and these mixes were then tested to assess their propensity towards plastic <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking,</b> using restrained ring tests. A review of the parameters associated with plastic <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> was carried out. The general view was that as the particle size in a cement matrix gets smaller, then the negative pore pressures developed are greater and hence shrinkage increases. This meant {{that the presence of}} secondary cementing materials, of very small diameter, such as microsilica, in high strength concretes would explain their apparent susceptibility to plastic <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking.</b> Eight high strength concrete mixes were tested in exposed and sealed conditions. It was found that when tested in sealed conditions none of the parameters measured presented itself as the sole driving force behind plastic shrinkage or plastic <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking.</b> Also, when cured in sealed conditions, none of the mixes tested in the restrained ring test apparatus cracked. When tested in exposed conditions, the presence of wind had little effect on the stress-strain relationship of the mixes tested. However the presence of wind seemed to cause negative pore pressures to develop earlier than in the sealed samples and increased free shrinkage by 3 to 40 times depending on the mix. The samples that exhibited the highest free shrinkage strains, in exposed conditions, were the mixes that cracked when tested in the restrained shrinkage rings. The mixes that cracked all contained microsilica and these mixes did not crack when the same mixes were tested without microsilica. Polypropylene fibres were found to reduce the cracked area of the samples that cracked.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to propose a model for predicting cracking age of concrete due to restrained shrinkage. Thisstudy focuses on analyzing shrinkage and expansion mechanisms in the expansive concrete to formulate a model that can beemployed to predict whether <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracking</b> occurs or not. In case of conventional (non-expansive) concrete, this modelcan be applied by neglecting the early expansion due to expansive additive. Parameters considered in this model are restrainedexpansion, free <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>cracking</b> strain that can be experimentally measured by experiment and tensile creep which isderived by back calculation. The model was verified by test results of expansive concrete mixtures as well as normal concretemixtures both with and without fly ash...|$|R
40|$|Gold ore {{refining}} residue is deposited as a slurry into residue storage {{areas where}} consolidation and drying takes place. Drying of the slurry involves significant loss of volume, which is expressed as consolidation, and shrinkage {{that results in}} vertical cracking. The cracks form an interconnected network that represents an opportunity for improving the surface drainage of the residue material that has low hydraulic conductivity, and low surface gradient and is therefore prone to waterlogging in the winter. A novel approach was trialed where a sandy ferruginous gravel substrate was applied to large <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracks</b> in gold residue to prevent their closure following rainfall and to maintain their structural integrity. It was hypothesised that such gravel application would preserve the role of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracks</b> in preferential flow of water and ions and perhaps enhance root growth. In this paper we report on two field experiments to {{examine the effect of}} gravel filling on soil properties and growth of the test species, Agropyron elongatum (Tall wheat grass), Triticosecale spp. (triticale) and Atriplex amnicola (saltbush). In a following paper, we report on the effects of gravel filling of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cracks</b> on Ca 2 + leaching from surface-incorporated gypsum...|$|R
