5|$|The {{complete}} {{history of}} Skåneland was not taught {{for a long}} time in schools in Skåneland, especially during periods with the <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> of revolt. Instead a Swedish-centric history was taught, and the Scanian history before 1658, for instance concerning the list of monarchs, was disregarded as a component of Danish history. In reaction, a movement began in the late 19th century to revive awareness of the history and culture of Skåneland. The renewed focus resulted in the publication of several books about Scanian history.|$|E
5|$|Urban sprawl, air {{and water}} pollution, noise, light pollution, {{and a range of}} habitat {{restricted}} by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals and other animals, but the most serious <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> to them is roadkill. About 50,000 vertebrates a year die on the park's roads when they are hit by a vehicle. The RMD has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the TMD, is highly dangerous to wildlife. Attempts in 2002 to convert it to a hiking trail failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Allenby's {{plan for}} 13 November {{was to turn}} the right flank of the Ottoman line on the coast despite {{aircraft}} and cavalry reconnaissances revealing a considerable Ottoman force further inland on the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's own right flank. He assigned the task of dealing with this <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> to the Australian Mounted Division, which was ordered to make as big a demonstration of their operations as possible. This would further focus Ottoman {{attention away from the}} coastal sector where the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would advance northwards to attempt to turn the Ottoman right flank assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre the following day.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{victory at}} Salamis ended the <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> to Greece, and Xerxes now {{returned}} to Asia {{with part of}} the army, leaving his general Mardonius to attempt to complete the conquest. Mardonius wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly, and the Athenians were thus {{able to return to}} their city, which had been burnt and razed by the Persians, for the winter. For the Athenians, and Themistocles personally, the winter would be a testing one. The Peloponnesians refused to countenance marching north of the Isthmus to fight the Persian army; the Athenians tried to shame them into doing so, with no success.|$|E

At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an <b>immediate</b> <b>threat,</b> and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, {{and could not be}} exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E

5|$|In 610, the Persian general, Shahrbaraz, was {{approaching}} Antioch, but the rebels of Africa posed a more <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> than the Persian front. Having secured control of Egypt, they proceeded to invade Syria and Cyprus while a large fleet under Heraclius the Younger set sail for Constantinople. Supporters from Sicily, Crete and Thessalonica were joining his campaign. The rebels reached Constantinople in October 610. The only forces available to Phocas {{to defend the}} city were the Excubitors of his bodyguard and the irregular forces of the Blues and Greens, the city's racing factions. Priscus, {{the commander of the}} Excubitors, chose the moment to reveal his allegiance to Heraclius the Younger. The Greens also changed sides in support of Heraclius the Younger and Constantinople fell to the Heraclii with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|In {{retaliation}} against Mansur's reneging {{on their}} deal, Salih attacked Aleppo and prevented movement {{into and out}} of the city. This caused severe hardship for its inhabitants and Mansur was unable to challenge the Kilab alone. He thus appealed for support from Basil II, warning him that the Bedouin uprising was bound to harm the Byzantine Empire. Basil II agreed and dispatched 1,000 Armenian soldiers to assist Mansur, but they were soon after withdrawn when Salih convinced Basil II of Mansur's treachery and promised the emperor of his goodwill toward him. Basil II may have actually withdrawn his men to avoid antagonizing the Kilab or, more importantly, the Kilab's Numayrid kinsmen and allies, who posed a more <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> to Byzantine territory. In any case, Mansur's position was further weakened as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} the 5th Army, {{operating}} {{north of the}} Bug and Narew rivers with its base of operations in the Modlin Fortress, started a limited counteroffensive {{with the aim of}} lessening the pressure on the Polish forces at Radzymin. Grossly outnumbered, the 5th Army could not break through the Russian lines, and got bogged down in intense fights along the Wkra river. However, although initially unsuccessful, the Polish attack prevented the Soviet 5th, 15th and 16th Armies from reinforcing the two divisions already committed to Radzymin. Only the 4th Red Army, the furthest from the battlefield, operating in the north along the East Prussian border and moving towards Toruń, kept advancing almost unopposed. This however did not pose an <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> to the defenders of Warsaw, as its advance was finally halted at the outskirts of Włocławek, and it was forced to start a hasty retreat eastwards.|$|E

5|$|Tadeusz Rejtan was {{a deputy}} in the Sejm (parliament) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1773, infamously {{known as the}} Partition Sejm. The Sejm convened to review {{the demands of the}} Commonwealth's three {{neighbours}} (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria) in order to legalize their territorial demands, known as the First Partition of Poland. The Sejm operated under duress, with the <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> of foreign forces present in the Commonwealth, and with a significant number of deputies either bribed or threatened by foreign diplomats. The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order through military intervention in the civil war (the War of Bar Confederation); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|The AIF's major {{units were}} raised between 1939 and 1941. The 6th Division formed during October and November 1939 and {{embarked}} for the Middle East in early 1940 to complete its training and to receive modern equipment after the British Government assured the Australian Government that Japan did not pose an <b>immediate</b> <b>threat.</b> The division {{was intended to}} join the British Expeditionary Force in France when its preparations were complete, but this did not eventuate as Axis forces conquered France before the division was ready. A further three AIF infantry divisions (the 7th Division, 8th Division and 9th Division) were raised {{in the first half}} of 1940, as well as a corps headquarters (ICorps) and numerous support and service units. All of these divisions and the majority of the support units deployed overseas during 1940 and 1941. An AIF armoured division (the 1st Armoured Division) was also raised in early 1941 but never left Australia.|$|E
5|$|The first Roman republican wars were wars of both {{expansion}} and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its {{territory in the}} region. Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either Latin towns and villages, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities, both those under Etruscan control and those that had cast off their Etruscan rulers. Rome defeated the Latin cities in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC, the Battle of Mons Algidus in 458 BC, the Battle of Corbione in 446 BC, the Battle of Aricia, and especially the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of Veii. By {{the end of this}} period, Rome had effectively completed the conquest of their immediate Etruscan and Latin neighbours, and also secured their position against the <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> posed by the nearby Apennine hill tribes.|$|E

5|$|With the <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> gone, Saumarez {{was able}} to direct his squadron's efforts to {{salvaging}} the battered and grounded Venerable. The calm sea and light winds aided this operation, and at 14:00, assisted by Thames and the boats of Caesar and Spencer, Venerable was once again afloat. Hood's ship was taken under tow by first Thames and then Spencer, the British squadron turning back towards Gibraltar at 18:00, the crew rigging a series of jury masts and sails to assist the process. By 08:00 on 14 July, Venerable was again able to sail independently, the squadron arriving at Gibraltar later that day. At Gibraltar the returning squadron was greeted with cheers and a 21-gun salute. Spencer, Audacious and Thames remained at sea off Cadiz to continue the blockade, which remained in place {{until the end of}} the French Revolutionary Wars in March 1802 at the Peace of Amiens.|$|E
5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires burn more than , {{and the vast majority of}} fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Bretagne was based in Toulon. At the time, Italy remained neutral, {{so there was no}} <b>immediate</b> <b>threat</b> to the Mediterranean Fleet. In December, Bretagne covered convoy traffic in the Atlantic. On 4 December, she and Provence, along with the cruisers Colbert, Dupleix, and Primauguet and several destroyers and submarines operated out of Dakar. Around the middle of the month, the task force began to return to the Mediterranean. After returning to Toulon, Bretagne underwent an extensive overhaul, which lasted until 3 March 1940. On 11 March, she left France carrying 1,820 boxes of gold bars from the French treasury along with the cruiser Algérie, which carried another 1,179 boxes. They arrived in Halifax on 10 April. On the return voyage, they escorted two American merchant ships carrying 82 aircraft bought by France and arrived at Toulon on 10 April. On 27 April, Bretagne and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria. Bretagne and Provence returned to Mers El Kébir on 18 May.|$|E
