5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in urban areas. Switzerland <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, {{from the beginning of the}} 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E

The Calgary–Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in Alberta {{and is one of}} Canada's four most urban regions. Many of Alberta's cities and towns have also experienced high rates of growth in recent history. From a population of 73,022 in 1901, Alberta has grown to 3,645,257 in 2011 and in the process <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> less than 1.5% of Canada's population to 10.9%.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{thermoelectric}} {{generation has}} come to lead a system that was dominated by hydropower: Hydropower plant capacity <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> 90 percent to only 30 percent. The reasons for this shift are twofold. First, hydroelectric development became more expensive when funding through interest-free loans for its development from International financial institutions was cut. Second, the lower risks and shorter maturity of thermal generation projects, as perceived by private investors, directed generation expansion towards the use of heavy fuel oil and medium speed diesels.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century saw {{much change}} in Alderney, from the {{building}} of the airport in the late 1930s to the death of the last speakers of the island's Auregnais language, a dialect of the Norman language.

E-commerce has become increasingly important, and the island hosts the domain name registry for both Bailiwicks and dozens of gambling website operators. Alderney has a full regulatory authority in operation.|$|E

Qantas <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> two fragile biplanes carrying two passengers and a pilot, to an Airbus A380 flying 450 people around the world. Qantas was founded in Winton, Queensland on 16 November 1920 as Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited by Paul McGinness, and Hudson Fysh. Fergus McMaster joined them as Chairman, as did Arthur Baird to take care of aircraft maintenance. McGinness left QANTAS for other interests in 1922, and Hudson Fysh remained with the company as General Manager & Managing Director. He retired as Sir Hudson Fysh KBE DFC, Chairman of QANTAS in 1966.|$|E

25|$|A more tragic {{character}} is Lawrence Talbot, played by Lon Chaney, Jr. in 1941's The Wolf Man. With Pierce's makeup more elaborate this time, the movie catapulted the werewolf into public consciousness. Sympathetic portrayals are few but notable, {{such as the}} comedic but tortured protagonist David Naughton in An American Werewolf in London, and a less anguished and more confident and charismatic Jack Nicholson in the 1994 film Wolf. Over time, the depiction of werewolves <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> fully malevolent to even heroic creatures, {{such as in the}} Underworld and Twilight series, as well as Blood Lad, Dance in the Vampire Bund, Rosario + Vampire, and various other movies, anime, manga, and comic books.|$|E

South China's success has seen the team climb in world club rankings to their new high of 145th, even surpassing other Mainland Chinese clubs which are widely considered to be of a better standard than clubs in Hong Kong. In recent years the South China has taken part in several pre-season exhibition matches with European clubs, with the most notable being a 2–0 win against the English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
25|$|The University of Hyderabad’s Study in India Programme (SIP) {{for foreign}} {{students}} {{began as a}} small experimental summer initiative where students from the University of Pittsburgh took nine credits over nine weeks {{in the summer of}} 1998. Since then, SIP has grown in leaps and bounds and <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> hosting eight students in its debut year to nearly 200 in the most recent academic year. The University Grants Commission (UGC), a governmental organisation in India tasked with determining and maintaining standards for university education, has hailed the Study in India Programme as a model initiative and has encouraged other universities in India to emulate the program’s approach. SIP’s strength is its flexibility and willing to innovate {{to meet the needs of}} universities and study abroad consortia. SIP has created specialised, tailor-made programs for partners such as Dartmouth College, Duke University and the Nordic Centre in India—a consortium of 15 Nordic universities. Students can apply on their own, through their home schools, or through study abroad consortia that are SIP partners.|$|E
