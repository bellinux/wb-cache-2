Genetic <b>epidemiology</b> <b>is</b> {{a branch of}} molecular epidemiology that explores the expression of genes and the interactions between genes and environment. Moreover, molecular <b>epidemiology</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the best}} methods to address some specific issues such as: 1. Exploring how diseases such as HIV/AIDS had expanded among countries and in the world 2. Exploring the distribution of diseases in populations and tracking their transmission chains 3. Exploring the virulence of pathogens using molecular markers and linking their characteristics to the epidemiological indicators such as incidence and prevalence In this paper written for general practitioners and medical experts, the applications of molecular epidemiology in public health and medicine by unfolding simple and practical examples have been discussed.

40|$|Circular <b>epidemiology</b> can <b>be</b> {{defined as}} the {{continuation}} of specific types of epidemiologic studies beyond the point of reasonable doubt of the true existence of an important association or {{the absence of such}} an association. Circular <b>epidemiology</b> <b>is</b> an extreme example of studies of the consistency of associations. A basic problem for <b>epidemiology</b> <b>is</b> the lack of a systematic approach to acquiring new knowledge to reach a goal of improving public health and preventive medicine. For epidemiologists, research support unfortunately is biased toward the continued study of already proven hypotheses. Circular epidemiology, however, freezes {{at one point in the}} evolution of epidemiologic studies, failing to move from descriptive to analytical case-control and longitudinal studies, for example, to experimental, clinical trials. Good <b>epidemiology</b> journals <b>are</b> filled with very well-conducted epidemiologic studies that primarily repeat the obvious or are variations on the theme. Am...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} role assumed by {{epidemiology}} in occupational health literature and characterise its {{change over the}} years. METHODS [...] A bibliometric {{study was conducted with}} a MEDLINE search to evaluate 9024 articles published in eight representative occupational health journals for the period 1980 - 93. Articles related to <b>epidemiology</b> <b>were</b> found by descriptors indexed in the articles and their numbers and proportions among all published articles was tabulated for the study period. RESULTS [...] The proportion of source items indexed by epidemiology as a descriptor increased over threefold from 7. 9 % (42 / 534) in 1980 to over 25 % after 1990. <b>Epidemiology</b> <b>was</b> indexed most frequently as a subheading associated with other descriptors-for example, occupational diseases-epidemiology. Cohort studies had the largest increase in the descriptors that indicated epidemiological type of studies during the period studied. CONCLUSION [...] <b>Epidemiology</b> <b>is</b> assuming increasing importance in occupational health literature.
