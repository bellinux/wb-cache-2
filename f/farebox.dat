5|$|For Fiscal Year 2015, the {{estimated}} <b>farebox</b> recovery ratio (fare revenue divided by operating expenses) was 66 percent, {{based on the}} WMATA approved budget.|$|E
5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's <b>farebox</b> recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low <b>farebox</b> recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit (CT) is {{the public}} transit {{authority}} of Snohomish County, Washington, United States, excluding the city of Everett, in the Seattle metropolitan area. It operates local bus, paratransit and vanpool service within Snohomish County, as well as commuter buses to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus. CT is publicly funded, financed through sales taxes, <b>farebox</b> revenue and subsidies, with an operating budget of $133.2 million. The entire agency carried more than 10 million passengers in 2015, placing it fourth among transit agencies in the Puget Sound region. The city of Everett, which serves as the county seat, is served by Everett Transit, a municipal transit system.|$|E

25|$|CATACash {{cards are}} issued through the <b>farebox</b> as change during cash transactions.|$|E
25|$|Apart from that, the {{passenger}} can place the sectional fare into the <b>farebox.</b> However, this is permitted {{at the discretion}} of the driver.|$|E
25|$|The MBTA's {{solution}} was to turn the surface portion of the Green Line into a proof-of-payment system {{to increase the efficiency}} of boarding at peak times on surface Green Line stops. All doors on all trolleys open at some or all stations, depending on the branch. Passengers can pay their fare in several ways, depending on their payment method. Passengers paying with cash must enter through the front door and pay at the <b>farebox,</b> where they may receive a proof-of-payment receipt. Stored-value CharlieCard or CharlieTicket holders may also need to pay at the <b>farebox.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Niagara Falls Transit's new <b>fareboxes</b> are {{designed}} to be capable of handling Presto cards, and are now participating for those transferring from a GO Bus or Train.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to historic vehicles, the MTHA {{has a large}} collection of related transit-industry memorabilia such as badges, uniforms, passes, tickets, transfers, transfer punches, <b>fareboxes,</b> decals and manuals.|$|R
5000|$|Distance based fares were {{eliminated}} in 2006. RFID equipped electronic <b>fareboxes</b> {{were introduced in}} 2012. Passengers may now pay their fares with an MBTA Charlie Card or cash. As of January 2013, CCRTA fares are as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|Amtrak {{points out}} that in 2010, its <b>farebox</b> {{recovery}} (percentage of operating costs covered by revenues generated by passenger fares) was 79%, the highest reported for any U.S. passenger railroad.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} expenses {{for fiscal year}} 2011 were $95,628,000. The fare revenue was $49,026,000, making the <b>farebox</b> recovery ratio 51.3%. This rose to 59% in fiscal year 2012 and 64% in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Passengers pay upon {{alighting}} {{by either}} depositing the exact fare in coins into the <b>farebox,</b> or by tapping the Octopus card on the processor. The turnstile at the tram entrance and {{closed circuit television}} prevent fare evasion by passengers.|$|E
50|$|All {{fixed route}} buses are {{equipped}} with wheelchair lifts, bike racks, GPS, automated bus stop annunciation system, and electronic <b>fareboxes.</b> Passengers can access real-time bus information system for all system routes by downloading the free Transloc App on their smart phones.|$|R
25|$|The MTA {{has since}} {{installed}} new <b>fareboxes</b> {{on all of}} its buses that issue daily passes with magnetic strips; new ticket vending machines at Light Rail and Metro Subway stations issue identical passes including the weekly and monthly passes. Weekly and monthly passes are not sold on buses.|$|R
50|$|The blue Chicago Card was a stored value card. Users {{added value}} to the card at CTA vending {{machines}} or at select retail locations, and turnstiles or <b>fareboxes</b> deducted value from the card. Users usually registered cards with CTA and could receive a replacement {{in the event of}} theft, loss, or damage to the card.|$|R
25|$|The CharlieCard {{can store}} value (keep a cash balance) {{and hold a}} {{combination}} of time-based passes which allow unlimited rides during a set period of time. Passengers use the plastic CharlieCard by tapping it against a target on a gate or a vehicle <b>farebox.</b> If left in a wallet, the card can usually be read when the wallet {{is placed on the}} reader. The gate or <b>farebox</b> then either automatically debits the cost of the passenger's ride, or verifies that the card has a valid transfer or that the card has a pass that is valid for travel at the given time and location. Transit riders can add value or a monthly pass to their cards at machines located at MBTA stations and vehicles, MBTA ticket offices, retail sales terminals at select outlets and online.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources of}} {{financing}} are ticket revenue, government subsidies and advertising. The percentage of revenue from passenger charges {{is known as the}} <b>farebox</b> recovery ratio. A limited amount of income may come from land development and rental income from stores and vendors, parking fees, and leasing tunnels and rights-of-way to carry fiber optic communication lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} owned by the City of Seattle, but {{currently}} is operated by King County Metro under a contract with the city government. King County Metro Transit contributes 75% of the operating costs, net of <b>farebox</b> revenue, and the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) pays the remaining 25%. The city retains sponsorship revenue and Federal Transit Administration funds.|$|E
50|$|The first {{double deck}} route to become OMO was Route 233 serving the Roundshaw Estate near Croydon. XA class Leyland Atlanteans were fitted with {{periscopes}} {{so that the}} driver could view the upper deck. The vehicles were fitted with Johnson <b>fareboxes,</b> a simpler system of fare collection than the autofare system fitted to the Merlins.|$|R
50|$|NOTE: UMass Amherst buses (3000-series) do {{not have}} <b>fareboxes</b> and operate via a proof-of-payment system (see UMass Transit buses below).One-way fares for adults 13 and older are $1.15 if {{purchased}} at the PVTA Customer Service Center at Springfield Union Station. Transfers for children 6-12 are $0.25, and transfers for mobility impaired passengers and seniors are $0.10.|$|R
50|$|On the Tren Ligero, {{or light}} rail line, {{passengers}} pay the fare at the stations, to ticket vending machines, and the platform of each station is a paid area, with turnstiles preventing access to persons lacking a valid fare. On the trolleybuses, passengers pay the exact fare upon boarding, into <b>fareboxes,</b> with drivers responsible for monitoring fare payment.|$|R
25|$|Johnson's break {{came through}} an old family {{connection}} with the industrial du Pont dynasty. In 1869, the brothers A.V. and Bidermann du Pont gave him a clerk's job on the street railway business they had acquired in Louisville. Johnson rose rapidly in the business, and discovered a taste for the mechanical side of it. He patented several inventions, including an improved type of streetcar rail, and the glass-sided <b>farebox</b> still used on many buses today.|$|E
25|$|The {{automated}} fare collection {{equipment is}} also compatible with the MBTA's CharlieTicket, a paper card with a magnetic stripe that operates as a stored-value card or time-period (monthly, weekly, or daily) pass. The MBTA first implemented the stored-value CharlieTicket on the Silver Line in February 2005. The ticket is inserted into a slot in the gate or <b>farebox,</b> the fare is deducted, and the remaining balance is displayed on a small screen. The ticket is {{then returned to the}} rider even if there is no remaining value.|$|E
25|$|By 1876, thanks {{partly to}} {{royalties}} from his <b>farebox,</b> Johnson {{was able to}} strike out on his own, purchasing a controlling share in the street railways of Indianapolis. In the 1880s and 90s he expanded his interests to lines in Cleveland, St. Louis, Brooklyn and Detroit, and also entered the steel business, building mills in Lorain, Ohio and Johnstown, Pennsylvania to provide rails for streetcar tracks. He moved to Cleveland in 1883 and soon afterwards bought a mansion on the 'Millionaire's Row' of Euclid Avenue.|$|E
5000|$|At SkyTrain {{stations}} and SeaBus terminals, [...] "Compass Tickets" [...] are purchased from electronic ticket dispensers. Buses accept Canadian coins only but electronic ticket machines on the SkyTrain and SeaBus systems also accept Canadian bills, major credit cards, and Interac debit cards. The <b>fareboxes</b> and electronic ticket dispensers used by TransLink are manufactured by Cubic Transportation Systems.|$|R
25|$|When the CharmCard {{system is}} fully implemented, {{it will be}} used not only on Maryland Transit Administration transit {{services}}, but will also be able to be used in Washington D.C. on all WMATA buses, the Washington Metro and on most local bus services in Northern Virginia. Likewise, the WMATA SmarTrip card will be accepted by the <b>fareboxes</b> used by the MTA.|$|R
25|$|The MBTA has various fare {{structures}} for its {{various types of}} service. The CharlieCard electronic farecard is accepted on the subway and bus systems, but not on commuter rail, ferry, or paratransit services. Passengers pay for subway and bus rides at faregates in station entrances or <b>fareboxes</b> {{in the front of}} vehicles; MBTA employees manually check tickets on the commuter rail and ferries.|$|R
25|$|Caltrain {{purchased}} 16 used Bombardier BiLevel Coaches from Metrolink in 2014 to {{cope with}} increasing ridership by lengthening certain Bombardier sets from five to six cars. The $15million purchase was financed by a <b>farebox</b> revenue fund. Since the cars had retired from Metrolink service, they required {{up to a year}} of rehabilitation before being placed in service with Caltrain. The ex-Metrolink cars were of older Series 1 and 2 that have riveted bodies, instead of the welded bodies in the Series 6 and 7 cars that Caltrain had purchased starting from 2002.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, San Joaquin County {{and seven}} cities {{along the route}} formed the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission (SJRRC) to oversee the {{creation}} of the service. In May 1997, the Altamont Commuter Express Joint Powers Authority (ACE JPA) was formed by the SJRRC, Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), and Alameda Congestion Management Agency (ACMA). That agreement formalized financial support, administrative processes, and governance for the rail service. The operation is funded by a variety of state and federal sources, largely sales tax revenue collected by the three JPA signatories; <b>farebox</b> revenues account for about one-third of costs.|$|E
25|$|MBTA Boat {{services}} {{have the highest}} <b>farebox</b> recovery ratio of any MBTA service type, at 55% by a 2012 report. However, the service still operates at a $5 million annual loss to the MBTA and carries a relatively small percentage of passengers, which has resulted in calls for its discontinuance or modification. In 2012, facing a substantial budget gap, the MBTA proposed substantial service cuts and fare increases. All ferry routes were to be cut, resulting in $3.7 million savings for the agency. Temporary measures were found to avoid some service cuts including the ferries; however, weekend Quincy service was eliminated and fares raised 35% {{in an attempt to}} eliminate the subsidy required. State lawmakers also then proposed that Massport take over the ferries from the MBTA.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 {{automatic}} <b>fareboxes</b> were introduced, {{and the job}} of {{a separate}} conductor was eliminated from the streetcars. The line still has one of the Ford, Bacon & Davis 1894 vintage cars in running condition. Although it is not used for passenger service, it stays busy with work operations such as track sanding. The rest of the line's cars date from 1923-24.|$|R
50|$|When the CharmCard {{system is}} fully implemented, {{it will be}} used not only on Maryland Transit Administration transit {{services}}, but will also be able to be used in Washington D.C. on all WMATA buses, the Washington Metro and on most local bus services in Northern Virginia. Likewise, the WMATA SmarTrip card will be accepted by the <b>fareboxes</b> used by the MTA.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also pointed}} out, [...] "The {{additional}} problems with paper currencies are it jams our <b>fareboxes,</b> {{and it is}} easy to steal. As a result, there is additional cost for theft deterrent equipment and an increase in maintenance costs {{associated with the use of}} one dollar bills. I speak without hesitation that transportation authorities across this Nation would love to substitute dollar coins for dollar bills." ...|$|R
