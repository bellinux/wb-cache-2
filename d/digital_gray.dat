The algorithm separates the image into many small clusters which are processed independently and, therefore, it is capable of parallel implementation. 1...|$|E

For example, in a digital modulation scheme such as QAM where data is typically transmitted in symbols of 4 bits or more, the signal's constellation diagram is arranged so that the bit patterns conveyed by adjacent constellation points differ by only one bit. By combining this with forward error correction capable of correcting single-bit errors, it is possible for a receiver to correct any transmission errors that cause a constellation point to deviate into the area of an adjacent point. This makes the transmission system less susceptible to noise.|$|R

The <b>digital</b> <b>gray</b> level image is treated as a 3 D surface whose multifractal measures are calculated by performing dilations on this surface. Plotting the acquired measures against the size of the structuring element, the local morphological multifractal exponents can be estimated, based on which the unsupervised fuzzy C-means clustering method is used to segment a texture image into the desired number of classes. Randomly choosing 12 natural textures from the Brodatz album, 66 mosaics of 2 textures and 495 mosaics of 4 textures are used to test the new segmentation approach and other two techniques, where the multifractal features are extracted by the box-counting based methods.

40|$|This {{transform}} {{was introduced}} in the year 1997 by Rajan [2], [4] on the lines of Hadamard Transform. This paper presents, in addition to its formulation, the algebraic properties of the transform and its uses in pattern recognition. Rajan Transform (RT) is a coding morphism by which a number sequence (integer, rational, real or complex) of length equal to any power of two is transformed into a highly correlated number sequence of the same length. It is a homomorphism that maps a set consisting of a number sequence, its graphical inverse and their cyclic and dyadic permutations, to a set consisting of a unique number sequence ensuring the invariance property under such permutations. This invariance property is also true for the permutation class of the dual sequence of the number sequence under consideration. A number sequence and its dual are like an object and its mirror image. For example, the four point sequences x(n) = 3, 1, 3, 3 and y(n) = 2, 4, 2, 2 are duals to each other. Observe that the sum of each sequence is 10 and one sequence could be obtained from the other by subtracting the elements of the other sequence from 5, which is half of its sum. Since RT of a number sequence is an organized number sequence {{with a high degree of}} correlation, it is suitable for effective data compression. This paper describes in detail the techniques of using RT for pattern recognition purposes. For example, pattern recognition operations like extracting lines, curves, isolated points and points of intersection of lines from a <b>digital</b> <b>gray</b> or colour image could be carried out using RT based fast algorithms.

30|$|Traditional {{infrared}} radiation measurement mainly includes two kinds, one is direct measurement based on temperature and wavelength, {{the other is}} indirect measurement based on image. The results of direct measurement are relatively accurate, but {{it is impossible to}} realize the rapid measurement of remote targets, and the equipment required for direct measurement is relatively complex [1]. Therefore, the research in the field of {{infrared radiation}} measurement mainly focuses on indirect measurement. The accuracy of indirect infrared radiation measurement is affected by many factors. Accurate calibration of measuring equipment is required to obtain accurate measurement values. This calibration requires an accurate calculation model, and the establishment of the model is closely related to the idea of the model, the environmental condition of the measurement area and the time of measurement [2 – 11]. Material motion is the source of infrared thermal radiation. The size of infrared thermal radiation is mainly affected by the temperature of the object {{and the nature of the}} material itself. Describing thermal radiation requires some commonly used basic quantities. Thermal radiation has both the general law of electromagnetic waves and the particularity of its radiation. Therefore, in order to better describe the measurement technology of infrared radiation characteristics, we should first master the basic metrics describing infrared radiation. The radiation calibration of infrared radiation measurement system based on image is the basis of the measurement of infrared radiation characteristics. The purpose of radiation calibration is to obtain its own response parameters including the response rate and its own bias response, so as to establish a quantitative relationship between the radiation output of the radiation source and the <b>digital</b> output <b>gray</b> value of the infrared radiation measurement system.

Soil Sci. 91 : 69 - 76. Determining soil water content (SWC) is fundamental for soil science, ecology and hydrology. Many methods are put forward to measure SWC, such as drying soil samples, neutron probes, time domain reflectrometry (TDR) and remote sensing. Sampling and drying soil is time-consuming. A neutron probe cannot determine SWC of surface soil accurately because neutrons escape {{when they are}} emitted near soil surface and TDR is, to some extent, influenced by soil salinity and temperature. Remote sensing can obtain SWC over a large area {{across a range of}} temporal and spatial scales. Complicated terrain and atmospheric conditions often make remote sensing data unreliable. Determining SWC from surface gray level (GL) measurements in the visible spectrum may have advantages over other remote sensing techniques, because surface soil images can be easily acquired by digital cameras, even with complicated landforms and meteorological conditions. However, few studies use this method, and further work is required to develop the ability of visible spectrum digital images to accurately estimate SWC. In this study, 42 soil samples were collected to investigate the relationship between surface GL and SWC using computer processing of soil surface images acquired by a digital camera. After establishing an equation to describe this relationship, a simple calibrated model was developed. The calibrated model was validated by an independent set of 48 soil samples. The results indicate that surface GL was sensitive to SWC. There was a negative linear relationship between surface GL and the square of SWC for the 42 calibration soil samples (correlation coefficients > 0. 91). Based on this negative relationship, a model was established to estimate SWC from surface GL. The results of model validation showed the estimated SWCs by surface GL were very close to the measured SWCs (correlation coefficient = 0. 99 at a significant level of 0. 01). Generally, SWC could be estimated from surface GL for a given soil, and the model could be used to quickly and accurately determineg SWC from surface GL measurements...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{definition}} for connected components of gray images is introduced. The proposed definition {{takes into account}} both the gray values of the pixels and the differences of the gray values of the neighboring pixels. It depends on two parameters ϵ and δ and so we call it an (ϵ, δ) -component. We develop an algorithm to partition an image into (ϵ, δ) -components and give implementations of it on several images using different values of ϵ and δ. Then we explore applications {{of the concept of}} (ϵ, δ) -component in various areas of computer vision. First we propose a method for image understanding by applying the theory of (ϵ, δ) -components. We study various properties of an image at the connected component level, from the low level vision to an intermediate level vision. Using the information obtained from various component histograms and certain pre-knowledge, we describe how to select suitable values of the parameters so that an object in a gray image may be represented by an (ϵ, δ) -component. Segmentation of the object could be done by locating the corresponding component. Next we propose a new definition of <b>digital</b> connectivity for <b>gray</b> images on a 2 D space for arbitrary grid systems. We extend a digital version of the Jordan curve theorem and its converse which was proved earlier by Rosenfeld (1970) for the rectangular grid system. We also extend in two directions the concept of well-composed sets introduced by Latecki, Eckhardt and Rosenfeld (1995). Finally, we propose a new feature-based method for stereo matching, which uses the boundaries of (ϵ, δ) -components as the matching primitives. Under certain assumptions, there is a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of the points on the boundaries of (ϵ, δ) -components of stereo pairs. This correspondence can be identified using the epipolar geometry. Using matched boundaries, we can identify the corresponding connected components determined by the boundaries and by changing the values of the parameters, we obtain a hierarchical stereo correspondence method. ...|$|R
