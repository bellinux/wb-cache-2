We introduce two types of open <b>innovation</b> <b>partnerships</b> - science-based and market-based partnerships - and examine their relationships with project financial performance. In addition, we investigate whether the open innovation - project performance relationships {{are influenced by the}} way how R&D projects are managed. Our results show that R&D projects with open <b>innovation</b> <b>partnerships</b> are associated with a better financial performance providing that they are managed in the most suitable way. Market-based partnerships are positively correlated with project performance if a formal project management process is used; however these partnerships are associated with a lower performance for loosely managed projects. In contrast, science-based partnerships are associated with higher project revenues for loosely managed projects only. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
