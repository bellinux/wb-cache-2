40|$|During a {{centrifuge}} experiment, any interruption {{that requires}} stopping the centrifuge {{may influence the}} results. Centrifuges often must be stopped for animal maintenance (food, water and waste removal), especially in cases of timed feedings. To {{eliminate the need for}} stopping the centrifuge while still providing timed feeding, an automatic paste <b>diet</b> <b>feeder</b> was developed. The feeder is based on a constant volume concept and can deliver a predetermined amount of paste diet at specified time intervals. This unit was supported by water delivery and waste collection systems.

40|$|A {{specialized}} paste <b>diet</b> <b>feeder</b> {{was developed}} {{in support of a}} hypergravity (2 G) centrifuge study. The centrifuge study was to be compared to a previously flown Russian Cosmos spaceflight so experimental parameters of the 14 day spaceflight had to be duplicated. In order to duplicate at hyper G an experiment that took place in weightlessness, all other conditions must be as identical as possible. Stopping the centrifuge to provide maintenance for the animals causes unacceptable changes in experimental research results. Thus the experimental protocol required the delivery of a designated amount of paste diet at regular intervals for a two week period without stopping the centrifuge. A centrifuge and a stationary control cage, each containing 10 laboratory rats, were fitted with feeders that were calibrated to provide 140 plus or minus 2 g of paste diet every 6 hours. This paper describes development of the feeder design and results of its operation over the two week experiment. The design philosophy and details of the feeder system are provided with recommendations for future such devices...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 290 growing pigs (PIC 1050 × 337, {{initially}} 103. 1 lb) {{were used in}} a 91 -d study to evaluate the effects of diet form (meal vs. pellet) and feeder design (conventional dry vs wet-dry) on finisher pig performance. The treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with 11 replications per treatment and 25 to 27 pigs per pen. Half of the pens were equipped with a 5 -hole conventional dry feeder while the other half had a double-sided wet-dry feeder. All pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet containing 45 to 65 % by-products in 4 phases. The only difference among treatments was diet form (meal vs. pellet). Pen weights and feed disappearance were measured on d 0, 16, 21, 43, 57, 71, and 91. Pictures of feeder pans were taken during Phase 4 and then evaluated {{by a panel of}} 4 for percentage of pan coverage. From d 0 to 91, no <b>diet</b> form × <b>feeder</b> design interactions were observed for ADG. Pigs fed pelleted diets had a tendency for improved (P < 0. 07) ADG compared to those given meal diets. In addition, pigs fed with wet-dry feeders had improved (P < 0. 01) ADG compared to those with conventional dry <b>feeders.</b> A <b>diet</b> form × <b>feeder</b> design interaction was observed (P < 0. 04) for ADFI. When using a wet-dry feeder, pigs given meal diets had similar ADFI as those fed pelleted diets. However, when using dry feeders, pigs given pelleted diets had a much greater ADFI than pigs fed meal diets. In addition, a <b>diet</b> form × <b>feeder</b> design interaction was observed for F/G. Pigs fed both meal and pelleted <b>diets</b> via wet-dry <b>feeders</b> had similar F/G, but pigs fed pelleted diets in a conventional dry feeder had poorer F/G compared to pigs given meal diets in a conventional dry feeder. The pellets used during this experiment had average percentage fines of 35. 1 ± 19 % and an average pellet durability index (PDI) of 75. 8 ± 8. 4. We attribute the interactions to the poor pellet quality, leading to more feed wastage from the dry feeders. These results suggest that pellet quality is important to decrease feed wastage and sorting by the pigs and to optimize growth performance...|$|R

Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with the main effects of <b>feeder</b> adjustment and <b>diet</b> form. The 2 feeder adjustments were a narrow feeder adjustment (minimum gap opening of 0. 50 in.) and a wide adjustment (minimum gap opening of 1. 00 in.). The feeders were adjusted to the minimum gap setting, but the agitation plate could be moved upward to a maximum gap opening of 0. 75 or 1. 25 in. for the narrow and wide adjustments, respectively. The 3 diet forms were meal, poor-quality pellets (50 % pellets and 50 % fines), and screened pellets with minimal fines. Average daily gain, ADFI, and F/G were determined by weighing pigs and measuring feed disappearance on d 0, 12, 22, 39, 48, and 69. No <b>diet</b> form × <b>feeder</b> adjustment interactions were observed (P > 0. 24). For Phases 1 (d 0 to 22) and 2 (d 22 to 48), feeder adjustment did not influence (P > 0. 28) ADG, but ADFI tended to increase (P 0. 17) between pigs fed from either feeder adjustment...|$|R

The treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with 11 replications per treatment and 25 to 27 pigs per pen. Half of the pens were equipped with a 5 -hole conventional dry feeder {{and the other half}} had a double-sided wet-dry feeder. All pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet containing 20 % dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) during the first 4 dietary phases and 10 % DDGS in phase 5. The only difference in diet among treatments was diet form (meal vs. pellet). Pen weights and feed disappearance were measured on d 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 86, and 104. Pictures of feeder pans were taken once during each phase and evaluated by a panel of 4 individuals for percentage pan coverage. From d 0 to 28, no <b>diet</b> form × <b>feeder</b> design interaction was observed for ADG or F/G. Pigs fed pelleted diets had poorer (P < 0. 001) F/G compared with those fed meal diets, which appeared to be due to poor pellet quality (39. 6 % fines). From d 42 to 86, pellet quality improved (4. 4 % fines), and a <b>diet</b> form × <b>feeder</b> interaction (P < 0. 02) was observed for ADG, whereas pigs presented meal diets in a dry feeder had decreased ADG compared with pigs presented pelleted <b>diets</b> in dry <b>feeders</b> or pigs presented feed via wet-dry <b>feeders</b> regardless of <b>diet</b> form. Pigs presented pelleted diets had improved (P < 0. 001) F/G compared with those fed meal diets. Pigs fed via wet-dry feeders had increased (P < 0. 03) ADFI and poorer F/G compared with pigs with dry feeders. Overall, pigs fed with wet-dry feeders had increased (P < 0. 02) ADG and ADFI, and poorer F/G compared with those with dry feeders, whereas pigs presented pelleted diets had a tendency for improved (P < 0. 06) F/G compared with those presented meal diets. In conclusion, regardless of diet form, pigs fed from wet-dry feeders had increased ADG and ADFI compared with pigs fed via dry feeders. Additionally, pellet quality appeared to influence responses because pigs provided higher-quality pellets via dry feeders had increased growth performance compared with pigs fed meal diets. Conversely, if pellet quality was poor, feed efficiency benefits associated with pelleting were lost...|$|R

40|$|Daily food {{consumption}} of the eight dominant demersal fish species of the bathyal eastern Ionian Sea were determined from field data on four seasonal cruises (April 1999, July August 1999, November 1999 and February 2000). Daily ration (DR) estimates ranged from 0. 198 to 4. 273 % WW/WW. Overall, DR estimates were independent of the model used, and they were comparable to the daily consumption of other deep-sea fauna (e. g. fish and crustaceans). Both sharks studied (Galeus melastomus and Etmopterus spinax) exhibited the highest values of DRs, together with the macrourid Coelorhynchus coelorhynchus in August. Among osteichthyes, DR estimates were related (in a multi-linear regression model) {{to the nature of}} their diet (i. e. their trophic level deduced from ? 15 N isotopic composition, the mean number of prey and trophic diversity). Thus, species feeding at a lower trophic level, ingesting a large number of prey items and with a very diversified diet had higher DR than species from higher trophic level and feeding fewer prey items. By season, the DR of species feeding mainly on mesopelagic prey (Hoplostethus mediterraneus and Helicolenus dactylopterus) were higher in summer, while DR for benthos/suprabenthos feeders (i. e. C. coelorhynchus and Nezumia sclerorhynchus) were higher in spring. Higher {{food consumption}} coincides with maximum food availability, both among mesopelagic feeders (higher availability of euphausiids, Pasiphaea sivado and Sergestes arcticus in summer) and among Macrouridae (higher suprabenthos densities in spring). In a tentative estimate the energy intake deduced from diet (i. e. mean energy value of food ingested) was constant in all seasons for each species studied.

In Exp. 1, 320 pigs (DNA 400 × 200; initial BW = 10. 7 kg) were randomly allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments with 16 pens/treatment and 5 pigs/pen for a 21 -d growth trial. The 4 dietary treatments used the same corn-soybean meal-based formulation that were mixed from the same batch of ingredients. Corn was ground through the same 4 -high roller mill, but using different roller configurations including feed with corn fraction ground to 650 µm using 2 sets of rolls (2 -high), feed with corn fraction ground to 495 µm using 3 sets of rolls (3 -high), feed with corn fraction ground to 340 µm using 4 sets of rolls in a fine grind configuration (4 -high fine), and feed with the corn fraction ground to 490 µm using 4 sets of rolls in a coarse grind configuration (4 -high coarse). In Exp. 2, 90 pigs (PIC 327 × 200; initial BW = 12. 2 kg) were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diet comparisons to determine feed preference. The 3 diets compared were the 2 -high, 4 -high fine, and 4 -high coarse configurations. Each pen contained 2 feeders, each containing 1 of the 3 treatment <b>diets.</b> <b>Feeders</b> were rotated once daily within each pen for the 7 -d study, with 5 pigs per pen, and 6 pens per comparison. In Exp. 1, there were no differences in ADG, ADFI or G:F between roller mill configurations.

In Exp. 2, when given a choice, pigs consumed 67 % (P < 0. 05) of the diet containing corn ground through the 2 -high roller mill when compared to the diet containing 4 -high fine corn. There was no difference in feed consumption comparing diets with 2 -high roller mill corn or corn from the 4 -high roller mill in a coarse configuration. When comparing corn from the two 4 -high configurations, pigs consumed 63 % (P < 0. 05) of the diet manufactured in the coarse configuration and 37 % when manufactured in the fine grind configuration.

Pens of pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary preference comparisons with 10 replications per comparison. Treatment diets used were a corn-soybean meal control with no supplemental Cu, or the control diet with 150 ppm of added Cu from either CuSO 4 or TBCC.

Therefore, we examined feed pelleted from different mills as well as conditioning temperature as factors influencing our previous results. In Experiment 1, pens of pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments with 10 pens per treatment and 7 pigs per pen. The 3 dietary treatments used the identical corn-soybean meal–based formulation and were mixed from the same batch of ingredients. Experimental diets were: (1) feed mixed at mill B but pelleted in mill A; (2) feed mixed and pelleted at mill B; and (3) feed mixed at mill B and fed in meal form. Experiment 2 was a feed preference study where pens of pigs were randomly allotted to the same diets as Experiment 1 with 4 pens per treatment and 7 pigs per pen. Pens contained 2 feeders, each containing 1 of 3 treatment <b>diets.</b> <b>Feeders</b> were rotated once daily within each pen for the entire 33 -d study with three diet comparisons tested: 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, and 2 vs. 3. In Experiment 3, pens of pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments and fed for 16 d with 14 pens per treatment and 5 pigs per pen. Similar to Experiment 1, all diets used the identical corn-soybean meal–based formulation and were mixed from the same batch of ingredients. The experimental diets were: (1) feed mixed at mill A and fed in meal form; (2) feed mixed at mill A, but pelleted at mill B; (3), (4), and (5) feed mixed and pelleted at mill A at a conditioning temperature of 140, 160, or 180 ˚F, respectively. In Experiment 1, pigs fed the mill-B pelleted diet had the greatest (P < 0. 05) ADG, whereas pigs fed the mill-A pelleted diet had the lowest (P < 0. 05) ADG, with the meal diet from mill B intermediate (Table 6). There were no differences in ADFI among the three experimental diets. The mill-A pelleted diet significantly worsened (P < 0. 05) F/G and final BW compared with the mill-B pelleted diet, whereas the mill-B mash diet only tended (P < 0. 06) to worsen F/G compared with the mill-B pelleted diet. In Experiment 2 for comparison 1, pigs consumed more (P < 0. 05) of the mill-B pelleted diet than the mill-A pelleted diet, which translated into pigs eating 70 % of their daily intake from the mill B pellet (Table 7). For comparison 2 and 3, pigs fed either the mill-A or mill-B pellet consumed more feed (P < 0. 05) than the mill B diet fed in mash form, with the pellets equated to 90 % of their daily intake. For Experiment 3, {{there were no differences}} among the three diets pelleted under increasing conditioning temperatures at mill A, so they were combined for analysis (Table 8). Pigs fed the meal diet had improved (P < 0. 05) ADG compared with pigs fed the mill-A pellet with the mill-B pellet fed pigs intermediate. For ADFI, both mill-B and mill-A pellet-fed pigs had reduced (P < 0. 05) intake compared with the meal diet but improved (P < 0. 05) F/G. Final BW was reduced when pigs were fed the mill-A pelleted diet compared with the mash diet, with the pigs fed the mill-B pellet intermediate. In our study, conditioning temperature did not seem to explain the differences between mill-related growth performance differences observed in Experiments 1 and 2. More research is needed to fully elucidate the reason why pig performance may differ when the same feed is processed in different mills...|$|R

In Exp. 1, pigs fed with increasing feeder gap had decreased (linear; P < 0. 03) G:F due to increased (linear; P < 0. 02) ADFI. In Exp. 2, there was a tendency (P = 0. 08) for increased ADG as feeder trough space increased from 4. 45 to 8. 9 cm/pig. Pigs fed with the wide feeder gap setting had increased (P < 0. 01) ADFI and decreased (P < 0. 01) G:F compared to pigs with the narrow feeder gap setting. 	Experiments 3 and 4 were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of diet form (meal vs. pellet) and feeder design (conventional dry vs. wet-dry) on finisher pig performance.

40|$|To {{trace the}} dietary {{evolution}} of the two abundant Middle to Late Pleistocene rhinoceros species Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis and Stephanorhinus hemitoechus in Europe over several climatic cycles, we examined comprehensive material of stratigraphically well-defined alaeopopulations from different regions and interglacials. Using morphometrics and mesowear analysis, these reconstructions of Stephanorhinus diets indicate that habitat diversity and interspecific competition with closely related rhinoceros species induced variation in feeding behaviour. Although anatomical features of both species suggest significantly higher dietary specializations compared to the Early to early Middle Pleistocene Stephanorhinus hundsheimensis, their mesowear signals are characteristic of a mixed <b>feeder</b> <b>diet,</b> {{similar to that of}} extant mammal species in relatively open habitats. Both species retained a degree of dietary flexibility, enabling them to survive in a range of environments. Although each of these rhinoceroses preferred different habitats, species identity alone is not sufficient to establish the real dietary traits of a Stephanorhinus palaeopopulation. As a consequence, their occurrence in a faunal assemblage alone cannot be taken to indicate a specific habitat. S. kirchbergensis and S. hemitoechus were embedded in a dynamic process of temporo-spatial replacements and interspecific differentiation of rhinoceroses in the western Palaearctic. However, dietary specialization in these Middle to Late Pleistocene European rhinoceroses was not the result of a directed time-transgressive evolution.

The δ 13 C and δ 15 N ratios of SPM, mussels and macroalgae were determined monthly, with SPM samples collected along a 10 km onshore–offshore transect, over 14 months at Kenton-on-Sea, on the south coast of South Africa. Clear nearshore (0 km) to offshore (10 km) carbon depletion gradients were seen in SPM during all months and extended for 50 km offshore on one occasion. Carbon enrichment of coastal SPM in winter (June–August 2004 and May 2005) indicated temporal changes in the nearshore detrital pool, presumably reflecting changes in macroalgal detritus, linked to local changes in coastal hydrography and algal seasonality. Nitrogen patterns were less clear, with SPM enrichment seen between July and October 2004 from 0 to 10 km. Nearshore SPM demonstrated cyclical patterns in carbon over 24 -h periods that correlated closely with tidal cycles and mussel carbon signatures, sampled monthly, demonstrated fluctuations {{that could not be}} correlated to seasonal or monthly changes in SPM. Macroalgae showed extreme variability in isotopic signatures, with no discernable patterns. IsoSource mixing models indicated over 50 % reliance of mussel tissue on nearshore carbon, highlighting the importance of nearshore SPM in mussel diet.

Isotopic signatures reveal three main groups according to their foraging strategies: pelagic feeders (Abudefduf sexfasciatus, A. sparoides, A. vaigiensis, Chromis ternatensis, C. dimidiata, Dascyllus trimaculatus and Pomacentrus caeruleus), benthic feeders (Chrysiptera unimaculata, Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus and Amphiprion akallopisos) and an intermediate group (D. aruanus, P. baenschi and P. trilineatus). Stomach contents reveal that planktonic copepods and filamentous algae mainly represent the <b>diets</b> of pelagic <b>feeders</b> and benthic feeders, respectively. The intermediate position of the third group resulted from a partitioning of small planktonic prey, small vagile invertebrates and filamentous algae. In this last feeding group, the presence of a wide range of d 13 C values in P. trilineatus suggests a larger trophic niche width, related to diet-switching over time. Some general considerations about the feeding habits of damselfishes reveal that their choice of habitat on the reef and their behavior appear to be good predictors of diet in this group. Benthic (algae and/or small invertebrates) feeders appear to be solitary and defend a small territory on the bottom; zooplankton feeders remain in groups just above the reef, in the water column.

Species were selected due to their habitat, trophic level, feeding behaviour and their use in the Italian <b>diet.</b> Mussels, filter <b>feeder</b> and sedentary organisms, were used {{in order to test}} water pollution whereas Norway lobster and red mullet (benthic fish) were used in order to test sediment pollution. The concentration of ?PCBs exceeded that of ?OCs in the samples analysed. The highest concentrations of ?PCBs (1415 ng/g lipid weight) and ?OCs (507 ng/g lipid weight) were found in pilchard while the lowest concentrations of the same pollutants were found in cephalopods. Our results have shown that species such as anchovy, pilchard and mackerel, were the most polluted due to their location at the last level of the trophic chain. All samples contained different concentrations of PCBs and among these, congeners 153 and 138 were the most representative. Among the OCs, except for the cuttle-fish, the highest concentrations were found for p,p(') -DDE and p,p(') -DDD that are metabolite of DDT. The prevailing DDE presence, compared to DDT (high DDE/DDT ratio), suggested that the biotransformation rate of pollutants was very efficacious in fish and above all in crustaceans. Results have also been interpreted in terms of geographical distribution and organisms' biological cycle. None of the samples analysed exceeded the tolerance limits established by the OCs Italian legislation...|$|R

During an obesity-control program in Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) at Zoo Zurich, a seasonal fluctuation of body mass war observed once ideal body mass had been reached. The focus {{of this study was}} the question if metabolism of a male and three female animals was affected by seasonality according to their seasonal breeding behaviour, using data on pelleted food intake (from computer controlled feeders) and body mass (from regular weighing). The pelleted <b>diet</b> in the <b>feeder</b> boxes was provided additionally to a daily ration containing vegetables, fruits, pellets for environmental enrichment, and fish. This daily ration was adjusted, within prescribed limits, by the animal keepers depending on the previous day's consumption. Formulas developed for dogs were used to estimate the metabolizable energy (ME) content of the diet and maintenance requirement of the bears depending on their individual body mass. Energy requirements for minimum walked distances between the feeders was calculated as well as energy requirement for fat accretion or energy gained from body fat by body mass loss. Body mass showed a seasonal fluctuation with maxima in spring and minima in autumn, in contrast to the pattern typically observed in animals from the temperate zone; in the male, the body mass maximum occurred later than in the females. Feed intake from feeder boxes peaked in autumn, at the beginning of body mass gain in the females. These patterns cannot be explained as seasonal adaptations to climatic changes in the zoo environment, but match the natural breeding season of Andean bears in their natural habitat, suggesting genetically fixed photoperiodic clues. The data indicate that body mass fluctuation in a range considered ideal for the species was mostly based on the additional food whose amount was adjusted - within limits - by the keepers on a daily basis. Such adjustment, without incurring the risk of obesity in bears that are known as voracious eaters, {{is a good example of}} the skill required in animal husbandry...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that dried distiller’s grains with {{solubles}} (DDGS) has an ME value similar to that of corn, but pigs fed diets with DDGS have a lesser feed intake than do those fed corn. We conducted three studies to evaluate the effects of DDGS on palatability and feed intake of growing pigs. In Exp. 1, 90 gilts (initially 58. 2 lb) were used to evaluate the effects of a diet based on cornsoybean meal, alone or with 30 % DDGS from two different sources, on feed preference. Source 1 DDGS was obtained from an ethanol plant built before 1990 and source 2 was obtained from a plant built after 1990. Each pen of pigs had two feeders, one with the cornsoybean meal diet and the other with one of the DDGS sources. There were 10 pens with six pigs per pen and 10 pens with 3 pigs per pen, for a total of 90 gilts; all pigs were blocked by weight. The location of the feeders was moved morning and evening each day. From d 0 to 7, there were no differences in ADFI among the dietary treatments. From d 7 to 13 and overall (d 0 to 13), however, feed intake was less (P< 0. 01) for both DDGS diets, when compared with the corn-soybean control. In Exp. 2, 187 barrows and gilts (initially 52. 1 lb) were used {{to examine the effects of}} increasing DDGS (source 2) in a 21 -d preference study. Treatments consisted of a control diet based on corn-soybean meal, or the control diet with 10, 20, or 30 % DDGS. There were 17 pigs per pen and 11 pens. There were four feeders in each pen, each containing a different <b>diet,</b> and the <b>feeders</b> were moved every morning and evening during the trial. During each week for the overall trial, increasing DDGS decreased (linear; P 0. 33) on feed intake in either the cornsoybean meal or DDGS diets. These studies demonstrate that pigs prefer corn-soybean diets to diets containing DDGS. For these experiments, the source of DDGS or the addition of a feed flavor did not change palatability. Although it seems that the ME content of DDGS could be comparable to that of corn, palatability problems may affect pig performance, even when DDGS included at low rates in the diet...|$|R

Treatments were arranged as a 2 x 3 factorial with the main effects of <b>feeder</b> adjustment and <b>diet</b> form. The 2 feeder adjustments were a narrow and wide feeder adjustment (minimum gap opening of 1. 27 and 2. 54 cm, respectively). The 3 diet forms were meal, poor-quality pellets (70 % pellets and 30 % fines for Exp. 1 and 2 and 50 % pellets and 50 % fines for Exp. 3), and screened pellets with minimal fines (3 to 10 %). In Exp. 1, 210 pigs (initially 11. 9 kg BW) were used in a 21 -d trial with 7 pigs per pen and 5 pens per treatment. No <b>feeder</b> adjustment x <b>diet</b> form interactions were observed. There were no differences in ADG, ADFI, or G:F due to feeder adjustment. Pigs fed the meal diet had increased (P < 0. 05) ADG and ADFI compared with pigs fed the poor-quality or screened pellets. Pigs fed meal or poor-quality pellets had decreased (P < 0. 05) G: F compared with pigs fed screened pellets. In Exp. 2, 1, 005 nursery pigs (initially 14. 1 kg BW) were used in a 28 -d trial with 26 to 28 pigs per pen and 6 pens per treatment. Pigs fed from the narrow feeder adjustment had decreased (P < 0. 05) ADG and ADFI compared with pigs fed from the wide adjustment with no differences in G: F. Pigs fed the meal diet had decreased (P < 0. 05) ADG compared with pigs fed poor-quality or screened pellets. Pigs fed meal or poor-quality pellets had decreased (P < 0. 05) G: F compared with pigs fed screened pellets. In Exp. 3, 246 pigs (initially 56. 8 kg BW) were used in a 69 -d trial with 5 pens per treatment and 6 or 7 pigs per pen. Overall, ADFI decreased (P < 0. 05) and G: F increased (P < 0. 05) for pigs fed from the narrow adjusted feeders compared with the wide adjustment with no differences in ADG. Overall, pigs fed meal diets tended to have decreased (P < 0. 10) ADG and had decreased (P < 0. 05) G: F compared with pigs fed screened pellets; ADG and G: F in those fed poor-quality pellets were intermediate. Feeding meal or poor-quality pellets increased (P < 0. 05) ADFI compared with pigs fed screened pellets. In conclusion, feeding nursery pigs from a wide feeder gap may increase ADG and ADFI with no negative effects on G: F. For finishing pigs, reducing feeder gap reduced feed disappearance and improved G: F. In all experiments, the greatest G: F improvements from pelleting were observed when the percentage of fines was minimized...|$|R
40|$|Benthic filter feeders {{have a key}} {{functional}} role in the dynamics of coastal food web as an intermediate trophic level and bioengineers. A wide variety of factors, operating across multiple spatial scales (e. g. hydrographic regime, human activities), can affect {{the composition of the}} water column and thus the availability of food for benthic populations. Food availability in turn affects the growth, reproductive rates and survival of benthic organisms, and consequently, can influence the functioning of the entire ecosystem. This study aims to evaluate how various environmental factors may modify the diet of intertidal filter feeders living along the South African coast. Specifically, the effects of biogeography, upwelling, urbanization and freshwater input on the dietary regimes of five species of filter feeders (two mussel and three barnacle species) were investigated using fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope (SI) analyses. Strong interspecific differences were found among the five species considered. However, all species responded to factors operating at large (100 s km) and meso (10 s- 100 s km) scales (i. e. biogeography and upwelling respectively). The barnacles exhibit habitat segregation and showed different FA and SI signatures from each other, while the two mussel species, an invasive and native species that co-occur in the same mussel beds, had partially overlapping diets. Differences in their diets were found only using FA analysis, while their SI signatures differed on only one occasion. This highlights the importance of using the appropriate tool, and ideally combined techniques, to investigate diets. FA and SI signatures of all species considered changed among the three biographical provinces (west, south and east coasts of South Africa) exhibiting similar patterns that reflect the two oceanographic regimes that characterize the coastline: the eutrophic Benguela Current on the west coast and the oligotrophic Agulhas Current on the other two coasts. Upwelling had a significant effect on FA and SI signatures, with stronger effects on the west coast than the south coast. The results indicate that benthic filter feeders at upwelling areas consumed a mix of coastal macroalgal detritus and phytoplankton, which was probably brought onshore during downwelling events. At smaller spatialscales and using repeated sampling, the influence of upwelling on the west coast was found to be pervasive, rather than discrete, so that it may be more appropriate to categorize upwelling by referring to upwelling centres and downstream areas. SI underlined a significant effect of urbanization on the <b>diet</b> of filter <b>feeders</b> with an enrichment in the δ¹⁵N being characteristic of anthropogenic effect. Although a large number of rivers characterize the South African coast, no distinct effect of freshwater input was found for either the SI or FA signatures of the filter feeders. This contrasts with earlier work on demersal species and suggests that freshwater input does not significantly affect food availability for intertidal filter feeders, and that other factors (e. g. hydrogeography) are more important in determining the diet of these populations. These results highlight that environmental and anthropogenic factors operating at different spatial and temporal scales {{have a profound effect on}} benthic ecosystems, and that they control the relationship between primary production and primary consumers in coastal areas. Above all, this work highlights the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which different factors affect feeding regimes, and their critical role in coastal food webs...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate, determine nutrient digestibility and nutritive value of lemon pulp and orange pulp. The citrus by-products were replaced for yellow corn in the basal diet at 3 levels (20, 40 and 60 %) for each by-product. A total number of 21 White New Zealand rabbits (NZW) at 8 weeks of age were individually weighed and randomly assigned individually into seven groups representing the seven experimental groups. Each group was divided into three replicates of one rabbit each. All animals were kept under the same management and hygienic conditions and were housed in metal battery cages supplied with separated <b>feeders.</b> <b>Diets</b> were offered ad-libitum and fresh water was available all times from automatic nipple drinkers. The experimental period lasted for 11 days. All rabbits were vaccinated against diseases and they were under veterinary control. The result showed that lemon and orange pulps are rich in CF, NDF, ADF, ADL, Hemi-cellulose and cellulose compared to yellow corn but CP and GE content for lemon and orange pulps are similarly equal compared to yellow corn. The content of vitamin C in lemon pulp and orange pulp was 0. 068 g/ 100 g and 0. 144 g/ 100 g compared with yellow corn 0. 030 g/ 100 g, respectively. The anti-oxidant content of lemon pulp and orange pulp was 11. 60 l and 12. 2 l compared the yellow corn (8. 29 l) at 25 l and 17. 9 l and 16. 4 l compared with 15. 24 l at 50 l, respectively. The total saturated fatty acids content of lemon pulp and yellow corn was approximately equal but its content in orange pulp was higher than the yellow corn. Total unsaturated fatty acids content of lemon pulp and orange pulp were to be lower than that in yellow corn. There were insignificant differences in DM and Organic Matter (OM) digestibility among the experimental diets and control diet. The obtained results also that 40 % substitution level of lemon pulp recorded the highest (p 0. 05) value for CP digestibility (84. 77 %) compared others substitution levels of lemon pulp and control diet. The digestibility of Crude Fiber (CF) was recorded highest (p 0. 05) value for 60 % substitution level of orange pulp when compared to the control diet and other tested levels of lemon pulp and orange pulp. The Ether Extract (EE) digestibility was recorded the lowest (p 0. 05) value with 60 % substitution of lemon and orange when compared to the control diet and other substitution levels of lemon pulp. The diet containing 20 % substitution level of orange pulp recorded highest (p 0. 05) digestibility of NFE. While, the diet containing 60 % substitution recorded lowest (p 0. 05) value of DCP when compared to control diet and other substitution levels of lemon pulp. The different substitution levels of orange pulp showed insignificant differences when compared to the control diet. The Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) and Digestible Energy (DE) recorded insignificant difference among control diet and 20, 40 and 60 % substitution levels of lemon pulp. The diet containing 20 % substitution level of orange pulp was higher in TDN and DE than the control diet. The diets containing 40 and 60 % substitution levels for orange pulp recorded insignificant differences when compared to the control diet. Conclusively, replacing lemon pulp at levels of 20 and 40 % and orange pulp at levels of 20 and 60 % for yellow corn in rabbit diets achieved best nutrients digestibility and nutritive value...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{increased}} sediment exposure on coastal marine ecosystems {{is one of}} the most important contemporary environmental issues. Sediment exposure is defined as the concentrations of sediment particles suspended in the water column and the amount of sediment depositing on the seabed. In addition to natural events, such as land erosion, rainfall, and tidal currents, anthropogenic activities such as land use, road building, logging, mining, port maintenance and dredging, contribute to the discharge of a great amount of sediment in the water column. As sessile suspension-feeder assemblages play a critical role in marine ecosystems through their active transfers of organic and inorganic between the water column and the seabed (i. e. benthic-pelagic coupling), increased sediment exposure generated by anthropogenic activities may negatively impact these organisms. This study set out to evaluate the influence of increased sediment exposure on suspension-feeder assemblages in a temperate seagrass habitat. Most of the research was conducted within Posidonia sinuosa meadows near Woodman Point (32 ◦ 7 ’S, 115 ◦ 44 ’E), south of Fremantle, Western Australia. At this location, persistent sediment plumes from a cement manufacturer’s wash plant provided an opportunity to study the mechanisms through which increased sediment exposure can affect suspension feeder assemblages. This study was examining: the relationship between sediment exposure and suspension feeder assemblage composition; the influence of increased sediment exposure on the contribution of potential food sources to suspension feeder diets; and the influence of sediment exposure on suspension-feeding mechanisms (filtration and retention rates) and strategies (food particle selection). The descriptive work, presented in Chapter 1, revealed a strong gradient in sediment exposure with decreasing sediment deposition with distance from the wash plant. There was little dissimilarity, in term of species diversity and biomass, among suspension-feeder assemblages under high sediment exposure and those experiencing natural sedimentation regimes. These findings indicated that the suspension-feeder assemblages at the study site were resistant to high sediment exposure and that some species could potentially display compensatory mechanisms. Thus, the degree to which increased sediment exposure influences suspension feeders was more likely to be species specific and depend on the resilience of their feeding mechanisms and strategies. Those findings underlined the need to test the causal parameters underlying responses to suspension-feeding activity and selectivity due to increased sediment exposure. Results presented in Chapter 2 indicated that the three most conspicuous suspension feeder in term of biomass and abundances presented distinct isotopic signatures, implying dissimilarities in their diets. Differences in δ 13 C and δ 15 N can be explained by consumption of different types of picoplanktonic particles and the degree to which sedimentary organic matter contributed to their diets. Increased sediment exposure had no influence on the natural diets of the ascidian Herdmania momus and the bivalve Pinna bicolor. For the sponge Tethya sp, the contribution of sedimentary organic matter to its diet increased at sites with high sediment exposure, suggesting a potential benefit to its diet. Overall, the influence of sediment exposure on suspension <b>feeder</b> <b>diets</b> was species specific and dependent on the nature (e. g. organically rich versus organically depleted) and concentrations of the sediment. In Chapter 3 data are presented to show that feeding mechanisms and strategies of three species of suspension feeders best representing the benthic assemblages were influenced by sediment exposure. Under high sediment exposure, the ascidian Herdmania momus had lower pumping rates, but maintained a relatively constant food retention rate, and optimised its food intake by expanding its food sources from mainly cyanobacteria (Synechococcus) to a wider range of food sources. The bivalve Pinna bicolor also had lower filtration activity with high sediment exposure, again, maintaining relatively constant total retention rates and displaying a change in particle selection from bacteria and Synechococcus to larger picoeukaryotic cells of higher carbon content. The sponge Tethya sp. appeared to benefit from elevated sediment concentrations, as filtration and retention rates increased, potentially related to a lack of food selectivity. In Chapter 4, a short-term laboratory experiment was combined with a field transplant experiment to investigate the response of suspension feeders to increased sediment exposure. Under elevated sediment exposure, Herdmania momus and Pinna bicolor modulated their particle selection to optimise food intake, while the non-selective suspension feeder Tethya sp increased its particle retention rate and efficiency. Both the laboratory and transplant experiment findings corroborated observations made in Chapters 1 and 2; compensatory adaptations associated with the feeding activity, such as the modulation of pumping rates and the optimisation of food intake by particle selection, help to explain the potential resistance of suspension feeder community structure to high sediment exposure. A major outcome of this research is that it informs shallow coastal ecosystems stakeholders of the possible consequences of anthropogenic activities that increase sediment exposure, particularly those in the order of TSS at 40 mg·l- 1 and deposition rates in the order of 10 g·cm- 2 ·month- 1. Despite this magnitude of sediment exposure had little influence on suspension feeder assemblage composition, the effects on the suspension-feeding function, including the increase of the filtration activity and transfers of carbon to the benthos, potentially influence benthicpelagic coupling and other ecosystem-scale processes. Given the variation in sensitivity to sediment exposure among suspension feeder species, meaningful criteria to limit the effects of anthropogenic sediment loading on shallow coastal ecosystems should take into account the whole species assemblage present at any given site...|$|R
