5|$|Smith also {{purchased}} and raced Thoroughbred horses {{under the name}} Pleasant Valley Stable. His racing colors during the early 1890s were royal-purple and canary yellow. Smith's brother, Bill, became his principal horse trainer during the 1890s and early 1900s. One of his most successful horses was a two-year-old bay colt named King Cadmus. Smith purchased King Cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for $4,000 at the stable dispersal sale of the late August Belmont. The colt was a son of Kingfisher and was a full brother to another popular racehorse named <b>King</b> <b>Crab.</b> The horse only won two races in his entire racing career, but Smith won $195,000 from Cadmus' two victories. The first win occurred on September 3, 1891 at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and resulted in Smith winning approximately $115,000, which was the largest payout from a horse race recorded in the US at that time. Cadmus' other win occurred at Morris Park Racetrack in 1892 with Smith netting another $80,000. King Cadmus was a fast runner {{but he had a}} vicious temperament, seriously injuring several of Smith's employees, in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three-year-old in 1892.|$|E
50|$|Overall, the red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> {{have a high}} {{adaptation}} {{capacity in}} changes of salinity level because the crabs retain their vital functions and also their feeding locomotor activities. However, {{there is a difference}} in the salinity tolerance between juvenile red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and adult red <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> Juvenile red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are slightly more tolerant to low concentrations of salinity because the juvenile's volume regulation is significantly better. Juveniles are consistently hyposmotic to the seawater because they have lower sodium concentration in their hemolymph. Due to the smaller size of the juveniles their exoskeleton is structurally more rigid. The adult red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are hyperosmotic in high salinity and becomes hyposmotic in lower salinity. The hyperosmoticity is due to the higher sodium and potassium concentrations in the hemolymph compared to the surrounding water they live in.|$|R
50|$|Red (P. camtschaticus) {{and blue}} (P. platypus) <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> {{are some of}} the most {{important}} fisheries in Alaska, however populations have fluctuated in the past 25 years and some areas are currently closed due to overfishing. The two species are similar in size, shape and life history. Habitat is the main factor separating the range of blue and red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> in the Bering Sea. Red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> prefer shallow, muddy or sandy habitats in Bristol Bay and Norton Sound, while blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> prefer the deeper areas made up of cobble, gravel and rock that occur around the Pribilof, St. Matthew, St. Lawrence and the Diomede Islands.|$|R
50|$|King crabs are {{generally}} {{thought to be}} derived from hermit crab-like ancestors, which may explain the asymmetry still found in the adult forms. This ancestry is supported by several anatomical peculiarities which are present only in <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and hermit crabs. Although some doubt still exists about this theory, <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are the most widely quoted example of carcinisation among the Decapoda. The evidence for this explanation comes from the asymmetry of the <b>king</b> <b>crab's</b> abdomen, which is thought to reflect the asymmetry of hermit crabs, which must fit into a spiral shell. Although formerly classified among the hermit crabs in the superfamily Paguroidea, <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are now placed in a separate superfamily, Lithodoidea. This is not without controversy as there is a widespread consensus in the scientific community that <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are derived from hermit crabs and closely related to pagurid hermit crabs, and therefore a separate superfamily in the classification poorly reflects the phylogenetic relationship of this taxon.|$|R
25|$|In Alaska, {{three species}} of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> are caught commercially: the red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> (Paralithodes camtschaticus, found in Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, and the Kodiak Archipelago), blue <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> (Paralithodes platypus, St. Matthew Island and the Pribilof Islands), and golden <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> (Lithodes aequispinus, Aleutian Islands). The red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> {{is the most}} prized of the three for its meat. A fourth variety of <b>king</b> <b>crab,</b> the scarlet <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> (Lithodes couesi), is too small and rare to be commercially viable, even though its meat is {{considered}} sweet and tasty. Specific size requirements must be met: only certain types of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> are legal {{at different times of}} the year and only males can be kept.|$|E
25|$|Alaskan <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> {{fishing is}} carried out during the fall months in the waters {{off the coast of}} Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The {{commercial}} harvest is performed during a very short season, and the catch is shipped worldwide. Large numbers of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> are also caught in Russian and international waters.|$|E

40|$|Extracts {{with hot}} water (Ex-h) or 80 % ethanol (Ex-et) from ""Ishigani"" crab were {{investigated}} in order to utilize ""Ishigani"" crab, Charybdis japonica, which has been discarded after catching.

AMP, Gly, Ala, and Arg contents were lower than those of snow and Alaska <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> Addition of AMP, Gly, Ala, and Arg to the extract of ""Ishigani"" crab will be expected to improve it to be used instead of extracts of snow and Alaska <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> have an 11-month brood {{cycle in}} their first {{reproductive}} year and a 12-month cycle thereafter. Both red and blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> have planktotrophic larvae that undergo 4 zoeal stages {{in the water column}} and a non-feeding, glaucothoe stage which is an intermediate stage which seeks appropriate habitat on the sea floor.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, at {{the peak}} of the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> industry, Alaskan {{fisheries}} produced 200 million pounds of crab. However, by 1983 the total size of the catch had dropped to less than 10% of this size. Several theories for the precipitous drop in the crab population have been proposed including overfishing, warmer waters, and increased fish predation. The slow harvest forced many fishermen to diversify and catch snow crabs (such as bairdi (tanner) crab and snow crab) or cod. In recent years strict regulations have been enforced in order to responsibly manage the populations and allow them to rebound. The red and blue <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> population has stayed relatively low in almost all areas except Southeast Alaska since 1983, forcing many fishermen to concentrate on the golden <b>king</b> <b>crab.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{influx of}} crab from Russian {{fisheries}} has also created economic problems for U.S. crabbers. The amount of crab imported from Russia {{has increased from}} around 21 million pounds (9.5 million kg) in 2004 to 37.5 million pounds (17 million kg) in 2005 to more than 56 million pounds (25.45 million kg) in 2007. Much of this foreign crab is reportedly caught and imported illegally and {{has led to a}} steady decline in the price of crab from $3.55 per pound in 2003 to $3.21 in 2004, $2.74 in 2005 and $2.30 in 2007 for Aleutian golden <b>king</b> <b>crab,</b> and $5.15 per pound in 2003 to $4.70 in 2004 to $4.52 in 2005 and $4.24 in 2007 for Bristol Bay red <b>king</b> <b>crab.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some {{fish and}} {{amphibians}} {{found in the}} Sundarbans are sawfish, butter fish, electric ray, common carp, silver carp, barb, river eels, starfish, <b>king</b> <b>crab,</b> fiddler crab, hermit crab, prawn, shrimps, Gangetic dolphins, skipping frogs, common toads and tree frogs. One particularly interesting fish is the mudskipper, a gobioid that {{climbs out of the}} water into mudflats and even climbs trees.|$|E
25|$|Commercial fishing {{has long}} been {{considered}} one of the most dangerous jobs in America. In 2006, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked commercial fishing as the job occupation with the highest fatality rate with 141.7 per 100,000, almost 75% higher than the fatality rate for pilots, flight engineers and loggers, the next most hazardous occupations. However, Alaskan <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> fishing is considered even more dangerous than the average commercial fishing job, due to the conditions on the Bering Sea during the seasons they fish for crab. According to the pilot episode, the death rate during the main crab seasons averages out to nearly one fisherman per week, while the injury rate for crews on most crab boats is nearly 100% due to the severe weather conditions (frigid gales, rogue waves, ice formations on and around the boat) and the danger of working with such heavy machinery on a constantly rolling boat deck. Alaskan <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> fishing reported over 300 fatalities per 100,000 as of 2005, with over 80% of those deaths caused by drowning or hypothermia.|$|E
25|$|Hermit crabs {{are more}} closely related to squat {{lobsters}} and porcelain crabs than they are to true crabs (Brachyura). However, the relationship of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> to the rest of Paguroidea is a highly contentious topic. Many studies based on physical characteristics, genetic information, and combined data, support the longstanding hypothesis that the <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> in the family Lithodidae are derived hermit crabs and should be classified as a family within Paguroidea. Other researchers have challenged this, asserting that the Lithodidae (<b>king</b> <b>crabs)</b> should be placed with the Hapalogastridae in a separate superfamily Lithodoidea. Six families are formally recognized in the superfamily Paguroidea, containing around 1100 species in total in 120 genera.|$|R
50|$|Carcinisation is {{believed}} to have occurred independently in at least five groups of decapod crustaceans, most notably <b>king</b> <b>crabs,</b> which most scientists believe evolved from hermit crab ancestors. The other examples are the family Porcellanidae, or porcelain crabs (which are closely related to squat lobsters), the hairy stone crab Lomis hirta, the coconut crab Birgus latro, and true crabs. The example of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> (family Lithodidae) evolving from hermit crabs has been particularly well studied and, although some doubt this theory, there is considerable evidence in its favour. For example: most hermit crabs are asymmetrical, so that they fit well into spiral snail shells; the abdomens of <b>king</b> <b>crabs,</b> even though they do not use snail shells for shelter, are also asymmetrical.|$|R

25|$|Deadliest Catch is a {{documentary}} series aired by the Discovery Channel beginning in 2005. The show highlights {{the dangers of}} <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> fishing: freezing temperatures, turbulent seas, the pots that must be dragged up can weigh well over a ton when full, and, since the season is short – both because of regulations and the weather – fishermen often spend {{days at a time}} in very rough seas working long hours with little sleep.|$|E
25|$|Fisheries have {{traditionally}} been the most important way of living along the coast, {{where the majority of}} the Norwegian population live. The red <b>king</b> <b>crab,</b> originally from the northern Pacific ocean but brought to the Barents sea by the Russians, have invaded from the east and are now being exploited commercially (especially in the Varangerfjord). To prevent the crab from spreading too far south, crab fishing west of Nordkapp is totally unregulated.|$|E
25|$|The second {{pilot was}} a three-part miniseries {{entitled}} America's Deadliest Season, which premiered on July 18, 2004, {{and covered the}} 2003-04 king and opilio crab seasons. The miniseries followed the vessels Northwestern, Erla-N and Sea Star during <b>king</b> <b>crab,</b> and Erla-N, Saga and Arctic Dawn during opilio crab. The series also features several crises, including the half-capsized Raven (5 on board, all rescued alive), man-overboard calls from Shaman (recovered dead) and Saga (greenhorn Kevin Davis, rescued alive), and the constant threat of cold water and freezing spray.|$|E
50|$|Colder water {{slows the}} rate of crab growth and crabs at {{northern}} latitudes are often smaller than more southern crabs. Commercial harvest of blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> at the Pribilof Islands is limited to males with a carapace width (CW) over 6.5 in and St. Matthew Island is limited to crabs with CW greater than 5.5 in, corresponding to crabs over 4.7 in carapace length (CL). Diomede blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are similar in size to St. Matthew Island crabs.|$|R
50|$|The main {{industries}} in Nervei are sea harvesting and farming. The main exports are cod, dried fish, <b>king</b> <b>crabs,</b> sheep and products from mohair wool.|$|R
50|$|Pribilof Island blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> {{mate and}} produce eggs in late March to early May. Females {{generally}} brood their eggs externally for 12-14 months. Since blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> {{need more than}} a year to brood their eggs, they miss a breeding cycle just before the larvae hatch and only produce eggs every other year, although first-time breeders can often produce eggs in subsequent years. Females release larvae around the middle of April in the Pribilof Islands, while those held at warmer temperatures in the laboratory may release larvae as early as February.|$|R
25|$|Harris {{was forced}} to leave during the C. opilio season in season 4 due to {{what turned out to be}} a {{pulmonary}} embolism, and his medical issues prevented him from going out during the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> portion of season 5. Murray Gamrath relieved him as captain in both seasons. A camera crew stayed with Harris both when he was hospitalized in season 4 and after his forced departure at the start of season 5. He continued to make occasional appearances during season 5. Harris suffered a massive stroke on January 29, 2010, during filming of the C. opilio season for season 6 and died on February 9, 2010, from complications. Derrick Ray took over as captain for the remainder of the season.|$|E
25|$|The pot is {{then brought}} {{on board the}} boat and the crew sorts the <b>king</b> <b>crab.</b> Any crab not meeting the {{regulation}} requirements are thrown back. The crabs are stored live in a holding tank until the boat reaches shore, where they are sold. If the weather becomes too cold the live crabs may freeze and burst. If they are left in the tank for too long they will harm and possibly kill {{each other as they}} can be cannibalistic. Even the rocking of the boat can cause damage to the crab, so boards are inserted in the holds to prevent excessive side-to-side movement. If a crab dies in the hold for any reason it releases toxins which can kill other crabs. If the crew fails to remove the dead crabs, they can poison the entire tank and ruin the catch.|$|E
25|$|Argentine Patagonian cuisine {{is largely}} {{the same as}} the cuisine of Buenos Aires – grilled meats and pasta – with {{extensive}} use of local ingredients and less use of those products which have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since the guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and centolla (<b>king</b> <b>crab)</b> are also common, though over-fishing of centolla has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, there is a noted Alpine cuisine tradition, with chocolate bars and even fondue restaurants, and tea rooms are a feature of the Welsh communities in Gaiman and Trevelin {{as well as in the}} mountains. Since the mid-1990s there has been some success with winemaking in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuquén.|$|E
25|$|The FAO groups fishery catches {{using the}} ISSCAAP {{classification}} (International Standard Statistical Classification of Aquatic Animals and Plants). ISSCAAP has a group for crabs and sea-spiders, and another group for <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and squat lobsters.|$|R
50|$|The {{group has}} been moulded by several {{instances}} of carcinisation - {{the development of a}} crab-like body form. Thus, the <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> (Lithodidae), porcelain crabs (Porcellanidae) and hairy stone crab (Lomisidae) are all separate instances of carcinisation.|$|R
