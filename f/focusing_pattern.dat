40|$|In this work, a novel {{microfluidic}} {{platform for}} tunable particle focusing {{in a straight}} channel with symmetric semicircle obstacle arrays using electrophoresis (EP) -modified inertial effects was presented. By exerting an EP force on the charged microparticles, a relative velocity gap between microspheres and fluid in a straight channel with symmetric semicircle obstacle arrays was implemented. The relative velocity and fluid shear will induce shear-slip lift force (Saffman lift force) perpendicular to the mainstream direction. Therefore, the <b>focusing</b> <b>pattern</b> can be altered using the electrophoresis-induced Saffman force. The effects of electric field direction, flow rate, electric field magnitude, and particle size were also studied. This demonstrates the possibility of adjusting the particle inertial <b>focusing</b> <b>pattern</b> in a straight channel with with symmetric semicircle obstacle arrays using electrophoresis.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} Huygens-Fresnel {{diffraction}} integral, the propagation equations of a broadband laser {{passing through a}} dispersive lens and a dispersive wedge are derived. Smoothing effect on the side lobes of the <b>focused</b> <b>pattern</b> is achieved as the broadband laser passes through the lens because of the spectral dispersion of the lens. By inserting a dispersive wedge behind the lens, better smoothing effect is realized because a relative position shift between <b>focused</b> <b>patterns</b> of different frequency components is generated due to the spectral dispersion of the wedge. Smoothing effect on the side lobe is obtained even with small bandwidth of the broadband laser as the wedge is used. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

A hydrodynamic criterion was proposed {{to determine whether}} particles in channel flows can form a <b>focusing</b> <b>pattern</b> or not.

40|$|SUMMARY Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats {{which are}} {{susceptible}} to hypertension have lower urinary kallikrein excretion than salt-resistant (R) rats which are not susceptible. Some physicochemical characteristics of partially purified urinary kallikrein were compared between the S and R strains. The isoelectric <b>focusing</b> <b>pattern</b> of S kallikrein was shifted so that {{a higher proportion of}} enzyme was present in isoelectric forms that had higher pi values compared to the pattern for R kallikrein. This strain difference was unique to urinary kallikrein; it was not seen in kallikrein extracted from salivary glands. The isoelectric <b>focusing</b> <b>pattern</b> for R urinary kallikrein could be converted to an S-type pattern by treatment with neuraminidase, which suggests that the differing isoelectric focusing patterns arose from differences in the sialic acid content of the kallikrein. The S kallikrein was slightly more heat-labile than R kallikrein, which was also compatible with the lower sialic acid content of the S enzyme. Tests involving the active site of the enzyme (Km values, pH curves, and heat of activation) were identical for the S and R strains. It was concluded that the structural differences observed in urinary kallikrein between S and R strains were compatible with strain-specific posttranslational processing of the enzyme.

Stable cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged protein GFP-PCNA produce rich, dynamically varying sub-cellular <b>foci</b> <b>patterns</b> characterizing the cell cycle phases, including the progress during the S-phase. Variable fluorescence patterns, drastic changes in SNR, shape and position changes and abundance of touching cells require sophisticated algorithms for reliable automatic segmentation and cell cycle classification.
