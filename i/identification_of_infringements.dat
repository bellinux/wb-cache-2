40|$|Paraphrase Identification (PI) {{problem is}} to {{classify}} that whether or not two sentences are close enough in meaning to be termed as paraphrases. PI is an important research dimension with practical applications in Information Extraction (IE), Machine Translation, Information Retrieval, Automatic <b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> Copyright <b>Infringement,</b> Question Answering Systems and Intelligent Tutoring Systems, to name a few. This study presents a novel approach <b>of</b> paraphrase <b>identification</b> using semantic heuristic features envisaging improving the accuracy compared to state-of-the-art PI systems. Finally, a comprehensive critical analysis of misclassifications is carried out to provide insightful evidence about the proposed approach and the corpora used in the experiments...|$|R
40|$|YouTube {{has grown}} {{exponentially}} {{over the past}} several years. With that growth came unprecedented levels <b>of</b> copyright <b>infringement</b> by uploaders on the site, forcing YouTube’s parent company, Google Inc., to introduce a new technology known as Content ID. This tool allows YouTube to automatically scan and identify potential cases <b>of</b> copyright <b>infringement</b> on an unparalleled scale. However, Content ID is overbroad in its <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> copyright <b>infringement,</b> often singling out legitimate uses of content. Every potential case <b>of</b> copyright <b>infringement</b> identified by Content ID triggers an automatic copyright claim on behalf of the copyright holder on YouTube and subsequently freezes all revenue streams, for all parties, regardless of the legitimacy of the underlying claim. Using the plight of one video game reviewer known as “Angry Joe” as a paradigmatic example of the problems that Content ID can create, this Issue Brief argues that in its present form, Content ID has had disastrous consequences for the doctrine of fair use, YouTube itself, and ultimately, the very spirit of copyright law. By shifting the neutral presumption accompanied with fair use against the uploader, Content ID effectively overrides judicial precedent...|$|R
40|$|Similarity {{testing for}} {{circuits}} {{is an important}} task in the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> intellectual property rights. In this paper, we propose a novel procedure for global similarity measurement between circuit topologies (networks) and apply this procedure to the comparison of physical designs of circuits. We first construct networks to describe {{the way in which}} circuit elements interact. Then, we evaluate the properties of each node from the resulting networks by calculating the cumulative distribution of characteristic parameters such as degree, clustering coefficient, etc. Based on the maximum vertical distance of each pair of distributions, global similarity testing methods are proposed with consideration of the inhomogeneity of parameter distributions and the scale of the networks. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the strategy in terms of robustness and topological information mining. The methodology described here {{can be applied to the}} <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> physical designs of circuits that may contain suspected patent infringement, and it is suitable for a wide range of circuits and systems.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{detecting}} and localizing objects that are embedded in compressed video sequences. Such a capability has two major and increasingly important practical uses: (1) video surveillance; (2) <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> copyright <b>infringement.</b> We focus here only on {{the problem of}} video surveillance. As a general rule, detection and localization of patterns is most efficiently performed in a reduced-dimensional subspace of the original object space. In this regard, it would be ideal to operate directly on the compressed bit stream. As a first step towards doing this, we consider here the problem of detecting and localizing video objects in the DCT domain (i. e., after the quantized DCT coefficients have been decoded but before the inverse DCT has been applied). We present comparisons between this DCT-based approach and the more conventional method in which object detection and localization is performed entirely in the spatial domain...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} unfair {{competition}} {{from the perspective of}} criminal law. It aims to analyze the offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. In the introduction the document compares unfair competition within the parameters of civil and criminal law. The following chapters examine in detail the criminal offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and further, separate chapters are devoted to specific facts of unfair competition. An additional goal of this thesis is the introduction and brief analysis of other offenses that may qualify as unfair competition, and compare them with the offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Not only due to the possibility of criminal sanctions for unfair competition when all of the elements of the criminal offense <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> the competition rules under § 248 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code are not completely fulfilled, but also because of a possible single concurrent act with this offense. Based on the above, the text concludes by asking and answering the question whether the current legal regulation of unfair competition in the Criminal Code is appropriate and sufficient...|$|R

40|$|Studies on EU {{policy-making}} generally {{disregard the}} key {{role played by}} the Commission as an enforcement agent responsible for the instigation and continuation <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> cases. Furthermore, the Commission employs both amicable (‘management’) and coercive means (‘enforcement’) to induce compliance by member states, which are reflected in the different stages <b>of</b> the <b>infringement</b> proceeding. In contrast to current research, this study incorporates the perspective of the Commission on non-compliance. Based on assumptions about the relation between the Commission and member states, it is assumed that different mechanisms drive the instigation <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> proceedings and their escalation to later stages. Thus, it is predicted that conflict in the Council and member state low level of acceptance for EU policies increase the probability <b>of</b> instigating <b>infringement</b> cases. However, the same factors are expected to make escalations <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> to ECJ referrals less likely, because the Commission dependence on the cooperation of member states. The hypotheses are tested using a dataset on the policy preferences of the Commission and 15 member states with regards to 18 EU directives. On the basis of multinomial logit and ordered logit regression analyses, I find evidence that there are differences between the effects on the instigation and the escalation <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> cases...|$|R
