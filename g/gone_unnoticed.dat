5|$|The {{effect that}} seamounts have on fish populations has not <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed</b> by the {{commercial}} fishing industry. Seamounts were first extensively fished {{in the second}} half of the 20th century, due to poor management practices and increased fishing pressure seriously depleting stock numbers on the typical fishing ground, the continental shelf. Seamounts have been the site of targeted fishing since that time.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day {{one or both of}} the fusible plugs had melted, but this had <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed</b> by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E

5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen {{offered a}} {{different}} approach. Answering criticisms {{that there was}} no mention of this incident in any of the many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed</b> outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which make no mention of the sun.|$|E
5|$|In the post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center {{identified}} {{an additional}} subtropical storm that had <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed</b> {{during the course}} of the season. The storm formed on October 4 and was absorbed by a non-tropical low the next day after passing over the Azores, where Santa Maria Island reported sustained winds up to 40mph (60km/h). The low that absorbed the storm would eventually become Hurricane Vince. At its peak, the storm had winds of 50mph (80km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997mbar (hPa). No damages or casualties were reported.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, two Bristol Blenheims of No. 114 Squadron RAF made {{an attack}} on Frecamp and Dieppe, {{dropping}} bombs from high altitude. The Germans recorded no damage at Frecamp, and the attack on Dieppe seems to have <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed.</b> As the bombers headed home, they passed two Spitfires of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). These high-speed aircraft had been stripped of non-essential weight such as armament and radios and were fitted with cameras and extra fuel tanks. They photographed ports and airfields and then returned.|$|E

5|$|The threats {{faced by}} seabirds have not <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed</b> by {{scientists}} or the conservation movement. As early as 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was {{convinced of the}} need to declare Pelican Island in Florida a National Wildlife Refuge to protect the bird colonies (including the nesting brown pelicans), and in 1909 he protected the Farallon Islands. Today many important seabird colonies are given some measure of protection, from Heron Island in Australia to Triangle Island in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{sequencing}} {{begins with}} a culture of identical cells {{as a source of}} DNA. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be cultured and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences which are relatively short, often conserved within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S rRNA sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured species, indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes taken directly from the environment revealed that cultivation based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and archaeal species in a sample. Much of the interest in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed {{that the vast majority of}} microorganisms had previously <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed</b> by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E

5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed.</b> However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} that the Atlantic {{hurricane}} basin has been thoroughly studied since 1851, {{there was only one}} other storm prior to Hurricane Fred to attain Category 3 intensity south of 30°N and east of 35°W. This storm was Hurricane Frances in 1980. Frances attained major hurricane status farther south and east than Fred; however, Fred was the strongest of the two, peaking with estimated winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Just over a year later, this intensity record was broken by Hurricane Julia, which attained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a pressure of 948mbar (hPa; 27.99inHg) at 17.7°N and 32.2°W, becoming the easternmost-forming Category4 hurricane on record. In one of the NHC's discussions on Hurricane Fred, it was mentioned that due to the unusual location of a storm of its intensity, the hurricane would likely have <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed</b> before the advent of satellite imagery in the 1960s.|$|E

Because the event occurred in a remote area, there was little damage to human life or property, and it was in fact some years until it was properly investigated.|$|E

This combination resulted in an involuntary error on the part of both ATC and aircraft that could not be corrected by the time the air traffic controller realised that his instructions to the aircraft's crew were given in response to a mutual misunderstanding, which resulted from a navigational error on the crew's part that had <b>gone</b> <b>unnoticed.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1998, CNN, in {{partnership}} with corporate sister Time magazine, ran a report that Operation Tailwind in 1970 in Vietnam included use of Sarin gas to kill a group of defectors from the United States military.
