5000|$|TEFC motors are {{constructed}} {{with a small}} fan on the rear shaft of the motor, covered by a housing. This fan forces air over the motor frame fins, and cools the motor. The enclosure is [...] "Totally Enclosed". This means that the motor is <b>dust</b> <b>tight,</b> and has a moderate water seal as well. TEFC motors are not secure against high pressure water nor submersible. They are also not explosion proof without additional modifications.|$|E
5000|$|IPxx rating: The Ingress Protection rating or IP Code classifies {{and rates}} {{the level of}} {{protection}} provided against the ingress of solid foreign objects (first digit) or water (second digit), a higher digit means greater protection. In the US the NEMA enclosure type is used similarly to the international rating. Most inverters are rated for outdoors installation with IP45 (no dust protection) or IP65 (<b>dust</b> <b>tight),</b> or in the US, NEMA 3R (no windblown dust protection) or NEMA 4X (windblown dust, direct water splash and additional corrosion protection).|$|E
50|$|Feather dusters are {{effective}} in <b>dusting</b> <b>tight</b> areas, or areas where {{there are a lot}} of odds and ends to dust around. The individual feathers are able to penetrate through the knick-knacks and pull the dust out of the area without disturbing items. On large open surfaces or walls, or in trying to get spider webs in the ceiling, either a feather duster or other dusters like lambswool or synthetic dusters will work.|$|R
40|$|The {{survey for}} DUST in Nearby Galaxies with Spitzer (DUSTiNGS) {{identified}} several candidate Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in nearby dwarf galaxies {{and showed that}} dust can form even in very metal-poor systems (Z 0. 008 Z_). Here, we present a follow-up survey with WFC 3 /IR on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), using filters {{that are capable of}} distinguishing carbon-rich (C-type) stars from oxygen-rich (M-type) stars: F 127 M, F 139 M, and F 153 M. We include six star-forming DUSTiNGS galaxies (NGC 147, IC 10, Pegasus dIrr, Sextans B, Sextans A, and Sag DIG), all more metal-poor than the Magellanic Clouds and spanning 1 dex in metallicity. We double the number of dusty AGB stars known in these galaxies and find that most are carbon rich. We also find 26 dusty M-type stars, mostly in IC 10. Given the large <b>dust</b> excess and <b>tight</b> spatial distribution of these M-type stars, they are most likely on {{the upper end of the}} AGB mass range (stars undergoing Hot Bottom Burning). Theoretical models do not predict significant dust production in metal-poor M-type stars, but we see evidence for dust excess around M-type stars even in the most metal-poor galaxies in our sample (12 +log(O/H) = 7. 26 - 7. 50). The low metallicities and inferred high stellar masses (up to 10 M_) suggest that AGB stars can produce dust very early in the evolution of galaxies (30 Myr after they form), and may contribute significantly to the dust reservoirs seen in high-redshift galaxies.

40|$|The close {{environment}} of four old Pre-Main Sequence stars {{has been observed}} thanks to the coronagraphic mode of the HST/NICMOS 2 camera at lambda= 1. 6 micron. In {{the course of this}} program, the detection of a circumstellar annulus around HD 141569 has already been presented in Augereau et al. (1999 b). In this paper, we report the detection of an elliptical structure around the Herbig Be star HD 100546 extending from the very close edge of the coronagraphic mask (~ 50 AU) to 350 - 380 AU (3. 5 - 3. 8 arcsec) from the star. The axis ratio gives a disk inclination of 51 +/- 3 degrees to the line-of-sight and a position angle of 161 +/- 5 degrees, measured east of north. At 50 AU, the disk has a surface brightness between 10. 5 and 11 mag/arcsec^ 2, then follows a - 2. 92 +/- 0. 04 radial power law up to 250 - 270 AU and finally falls as r^{- 5. 5 +/- 0. 2 }. The inferred optical thickness suggests that the disk is at least marginally optically thick inside 80 AU and optically thin further out. Combined with anisotropic scattering properties, this could explain the shape of a brightness asymmetry observed along the minor axis of the disk. This asymmetry needs to be confirmed. The circumstellar disks around SAO 206462 and MWC 480 are not resolved, leading to constraints on the <b>dust</b> distribution. A <b>tight</b> binary system separated by only 0. 32 +/- 0. 04 arcsec is nevertheless detected in the close vicinity of SAO 206462.
