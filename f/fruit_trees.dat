40|$|Abstract: Azanza garkeana (morojwa) is a {{valuable}} edible indigenous <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species confined to east and southern Africa. Because of its multiple use the species is selected and retained by farmers in Botswana when they clear the woodland for crops and building house. It {{is one of the}} indigenous <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species that is semi-domesticated by local people in Botswana. The species is an important indigenous source of food in Botswana. Besides proving people with <b>fruits,</b> the <b>tree</b> also provides goods (timber, firewood, fodder etc.) and services (soil conservation, shade etc.). The species is an important source of essential minerals particularly P, Ca, Mg and Na. This paper reviews Azanza garckeana as an important multipurpose indigenous <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> with high potential social and economic value in Botswana.

5|$|Cyclone Zoe {{severely}} impacted {{the islands}} of the Solomon island chain, particularly {{the islands of}} Tikopia and Anuta. In Anuta, agricultural activities were disrupted. Various <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> and crops, especially in gardens on the island's hills, were destroyed by high winds and heavy rain. In addition, communications with other islands were disrupted. The impact on Tikopia was much greater; agricultural productivity on the island {{was said to have}} been wiped out. <b>Fruit</b> <b>trees</b> were estimated only to begin producing fruit again at least two years after Zoe's impact. Topsoil was left dry by the cyclone, preventing any immediate replacement of lost crops.|$|E

40|$|The <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> nursery {{accreditation}} scheme {{implemented by the}} Philippine Department of Agriculture (DA) has been promoted to enhance the supply of high quality <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> planting materials and {{reduce the number of}} dubious seedling market players. This paper examines the advantages of the <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> nursery {{accreditation scheme}} and draws implications for possible formulation of a scheme to accredit forest tree nurseries in the Philippines. Data were collected from interviews with accredited <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> nursery operators and the nursery accreditation officer-in-charge in Northern Mindanao. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of applicants for nursery accreditation each year since 2004, as a result of the advantages nursery operators observed from those who had already been accredited. A major advantage is that only accredited <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> nursery operators can join in the government procurement of seedlings through a bidding process which is always for substantial volumes. As a form of advertisement, accredited nurseries are posted on the government website thus creating a wide range of market opportunities which results in increased sales. Other advantages such as receiving free training in improving seedling production and occasionally receiving high quality propagation materials (scions and seedlings), subsidies for pesticides and fertilizers and free soil tests were enjoyed by accredited <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> nurseries. These opportunities encouraged other nursery operators to apply for accreditation. Accreditation by the DA places emphasis on maintaining high genetic quality of planting materials as well as the physical quality of the seedlings. Accrediting forestry nurseries is seen as a potential policy option that can expand the supply of high quality tree seedlings in the Philippines, as is the case with <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> seedlings...|$|R

That said, {{there are still}} a few farmers who continue to maintain, innovate and disseminate <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> diversity in their home gardens and orchards. The study was conducted in 36 communities of India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to find out why some farmers do maintain rich <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> diversity whereas many do not. The study also aims to answer the following research questions: What conservation practices do farmers do and what are the motivations for their efforts? What are characteristics of such farmers and what are key challenges? Participatory four cell method was carried out amongst the potential custodian farmers, followed by key informant survey and field validation. We found that quite a few farmers maintain rich diversity with few rare and unique <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species or varieties and are mainly driven by conservation ideology. The characteristics of such custodian farmers were identified and found to differ in their functions and motivations. Some functions of custodian farmers are critical for on-farm conservation of tropical <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> diversity.
