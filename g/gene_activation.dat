25|$|The {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (FGF) family with its prototype members FGF-1 (acidic FGF) and FGF-2 (basic FGF) consists to date {{of at least}} 22 known members. Most are single-chain peptides of 16-18 kDa and display high affinity to heparin and heparan sulfate. In general, FGFs stimulate a variety of cellular functions by binding to cell surface FGF-receptors {{in the presence of}} heparin proteoglycans. The FGF-receptor family is composed of seven members, and all the receptor proteins are single-chain receptor tyrosine kinases that become activated through autophosphorylation induced by a mechanism of FGF-mediated receptor dimerization. Receptor activation gives rise to a signal transduction cascade that leads to <b>gene</b> <b>activation</b> and diverse biological responses, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and matrix dissolution, thus initiating a process of mitogenic activity critical for the growth of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.|$|E
25|$|The Hartig net {{initially}} forms {{from the}} fully differentiated inner {{layer of the}} mantle, and penetration occurs in a broad front oriented transversally to the root axis, rather than from a single hyphae. As the hyphae contact the root cells and digest through the apoplastic space, some spruce (Picea abies) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) cells {{have been shown to}} produce chitinases and peroxidases that could inhibit Hartig net formation. Some plant cells exhibit transcripts for stress- and defense-related proteins such as pathogenesis-related and hypersensitive response-induced proteins.

25|$|Other {{luminescent}} systems: Early in {{his career}} Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans. This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing. In other work {{when he was in}} the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission. His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule (aequorin), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP). Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying <b>gene</b> <b>activation</b> and developmental patterns.

40|$|According to {{inductive}} conception, {{the interference}} of neighboring cells causes {{a production of}} broken spatial symmetry in an initially homogenous system (cell differentiation process) during embryo development. A concentration gradient of a specific substance (morphogen), which serves as an analog-type control signal, is proposed as an agent to provide this process. It is known fact, that genes’ activity are of a discreet-type (digit) and, therefore, cell differentiation mechanism based on the control digit-type signals {{in comparison with the}} analog-type signals is more or less probable. A model presented here simulates the cell differentiation process. The model {{is based on the assumption}} that only the digit-type interactions take place between adjacent cells (not analog-type interactions that are typical for the concentration gradient field). Within model assumptions, the genes’ interaction algorithms and boundary condition are postulated. Under the model assumptions, the cell differentiation process starts with the homogeneous blastula formation and comprises three consecutive stages. 1) The loop-like inhomogeneous cell formation development and corresponding set of the self-blocking <b>genes</b> <b>activation</b> - the set of the asymmetric pattern genes governs the process. 2) The line-type inhomogeneous cell formations, with their origins at different cells of the loop-type formation, development and corresponding self-blocking <b>genes</b> <b>activation</b> - the sets of the symmetric pattern genes govern the process. 3) The variety of the function <b>genes</b> <b>activation</b> in the complex inhomogeneous cell formation - the sets of the self-blocking genes govern the process. Under model assumptions the multi level tree-type inhomogeneous cell structures creation is possible. The number of the pattern genes limits the complexity of the inhomogeneous structure.

As simulated by the model, results qualitatively coincide with some of the experimental facts...|$|R
40|$|The {{signaling}} {{mechanisms by}} which skeletal muscle electrical activity leads to changes in gene expression remain largely undefined. We have reported that myotubes depolarization induces calcium signals in cytosol and nucleus via inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) and phosphorylation of both ERKs 1 / 2 and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). We now describe the calcium dependence of P-CREB and P-ERKs induction and of the increases in early genes c-fos, c-jun and egr- 1 mRNA. Increased phosphorylation and early <b>genes</b> <b>activation</b> were maintained {{in the absence of}} extracellular calcium, while the increase in intracellular calcium induced by caffeine could mimic the depolarization stimulus. Depolarization performed either {{in the presence of the}} IP 3 inhibitors 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2 -APB) or xestospongin C or on cells loaded with BAPTA-AM, in which slow calcium signals were abolished, resulted in decreased activation of the early genes examined.

2500|$|Due to its {{involvement}} in cancer development, inhibition of beta-catenin continues to receive significant attention. But the targeting of the binding site on its armadillo domain {{is not the}} simplest task, due to its extensive and relatively flat surface. However, for an efficient inhibition, binding to smaller [...] "hotspots" [...] of this surface is sufficient. This way, a [...] "stapled" [...] helical peptide derived from the natural β-catenin binding motif found in LEF1 was sufficient for the complete inhibition of β-catenin dependent transcription. Recently, several small-molecule compounds have also been developed to target the same, highly positively charged area of the ARM domain (CGP049090, PKF118-310, PKF115-584 and ZTM000990).

International audienceActivation of {{normally}} silent tissue-specific {{genes and}} the resulting cell "identity crisis" are the unexplored consequences of malignant epigenetic reprogramming. We designed a strategy for investigating this reprogramming, which consisted of identifying {{a large number of}} tissue-restricted genes that are epigenetically silenced in normal somatic cells and then detecting their expression in cancer. This approach led to the demonstration that large-scale "off-context" <b>gene</b> <b>activations</b> systematically occur in a variety of cancer types. In our series of 293 lung tumors, we identified an ectopic gene expression signature associated with a subset of highly aggressive tumors, which predicted poor prognosis independently of the TNM (tumor size, node positivity, and metastasis) stage or histological subtype. The ability to isolate these tumors allowed us to reveal their common molecular features characterized by the acquisition of embryonic stem cell/germ cell gene expression profiles and the down-regulation of immune response genes.

The main function of TrxG proteins, along with polycomb group (PcG) proteins, is regulating gene expression. Whereas, PcG proteins are typically associated with gene silencing, TrxG proteins are most commonly linked to <b>gene</b> <b>activation.</b> The Trithorax complex activates gene transcription by inducing trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) at specific sites in chromatin recognized by the complex.

50|$|The LysRS-Ap4A-MITF {{signaling}} pathway was first discovered in mast cells, in which, the MAPK pathway is activated upon allergen stimulation. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), which normally {{resides in the}} multisynthetase complex with other tRNA sythetases, is phosphorylated on Serine 207 in a MAPK-dependent manner. This phosphorylation causes LysRS to change its conformation, detach from the complex and translocate into the nucleus, where it associates with the MITF-HINT1 inhibitory complex.

In this study, using a detailed in vitro gene transcription analysis of the culture-adapted HB 3 strain of P. falciparum, we show that antigenic switching is governed by a global activation hierarchy favouring short and highly diverse genes in central chromosomal location. Longer and more conserved genes, which have previously been associated with severe infection in immunologically naive hosts, are rarely activated, however, implying an in vivo fitness advantage possibly through adhesion-dependent survival rates.
