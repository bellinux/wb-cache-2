50|$|Often {{the glass}} panes {{are set in}} a {{rabbeted}} frame and sealed with beveled putty or <b>glazing</b> <b>compound</b> to secure the glass.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the first}} curtain walls were made with steel {{mullions}} and the plate glass {{was attached to the}} mullions with asbestos or fiberglass-modified <b>glazing</b> <b>compound.</b> Eventually silicone sealants or glazing tape were substituted, using a glass mullion system. Some designs included an outer cap to hold the glass in place and to protect the integrity of the seals. The first curtain wall installed in New York City, in the Lever House building (Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, 1952), was this type of construction. Earlier modernist examples are the Bauhaus in Dessau (1926) and the Hallidie Building in San Francisco (1918).|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} {{windows of}} the 90 -year-old buildings on the main MIT campus are not energy efficient and compromise comfort levels. The single panes of glass allow too much heat transfer and solar heat gain. In addition, the steel framework has warped due to oxidation and decay of the <b>glazing</b> <b>compound,</b> resulting in air and water infiltration. This thesis explored a feasible solution of a partial window replacement that would not compromise the historical significance of the existing windows. The design and prototype demonstrated the replacement's functionality and preservation of aesthetic quality. The analysis showed an expected decrease in energy consumption of more than 70 % and cost savings of nearly $ 2 million a year. The analysis also showed that comfort levels are higher throughout the year. by YunJa Chen. Thesis (S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2007.

40|$|AbstractAnatase {{is one of}} {{a common}} and {{favorable}} material use in the manufacturing industry due to its uniqueness and functional performances to human and environment The study was focused on the performance of anatase mixed with glaze and applied on ceramic tiles by a dip coating method Two different sizes (micron and nano size) of anatase powder were used to observe their performance as antibacterial materials The anatase powder in micron size was varied at 5 wt%, 10 wt % and 15 wt%, whereas nano size anatase was fixed at 10 wt% The anatase powders were mixed with the <b>glaze</b> <b>compound</b> and then coated on the tile surface Sample produced were characterized through physical appearance, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis and antibacterial test Antibacterial testing by using E Coli was done on tiles and was observed by counting the colonies of bacterial growth in 0 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 8 hrs The addition of anatase slightly change the colour of the tile produced Whereas SEM results show the distribution of anatase powder in the tiles surface The antibacterial properties increased when the composition of anatase increased However, nano size anatase gave better antibacterial properties compared to micron size because of larger surface area of the antibacterial agents on the tiles...|$|R
50|$|Fluxes are substances, usually oxides, used in glasses, glazes and ceramic {{bodies to}} lower the high melting point of the main glass forming constituents, usually silica and alumina. A ceramic flux {{functions}} by promoting partial or complete liquefaction. The most commonly used fluxing oxides in a ceramic glaze contain lead, sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, barium, zinc, strontium, and manganese. These are introduced to the raw <b>glaze</b> as <b>compounds,</b> for example lead as lead oxide. Boron {{is considered by many}} to be a glass former rather than a flux.|$|R
500|$|Lithium oxide {{is widely}} used as a flux for {{processing}} silica, reducing the melting point and viscosity of the material and leading to glazes with improved physical properties including low coefficients of thermal expansion. Worldwide, {{this is one of}} the largest use for lithium <b>compounds.</b> <b>Glazes</b> containing lithium oxides are used for ovenware. Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is generally used in this application [...] because it converts to the oxide upon heating.|$|R
40|$|Pyrochlore type {{pigments}} Ln 2 Ce 2 O 7 and Ln 2 CeZrO 7 (Ln = Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb and Y) {{prepared by}} solid-state reaction were investigated. Effect of rare earths and zirconium ions and calcination temperature (1400, 1500 and 1600 oC for Ln 2 Ce 2 O 7 and 1400, 1450 and 1500 C for Ln 2 CeZrO 7) on their color properties in organic matrix and ceramic glazes, {{particle size distribution}} and phase composition were evaluated. The most interesting shades achieve compounds with the highest calcination temperature. Their colors depend on used rare earth ions (shades change from green, cross yellow to pink in organic mass and from green, cross yellow-green to orange in ceramic <b>glazes),</b> while <b>compounds</b> without zirconium have better color properties. Pigments Ln 2 Ce 2 O 7 calcined at 1600 C are single-phase (except Yb 2 Ce 2 O 7) ...|$|R
40|$|Many user {{facilities}} such as synchrotron light {{sources and}} free electron lasers require accelerating structures that support electric fields of 10 - 100 MV/m, {{especially at the}} start of the accelerator chain where ceramic insulators are used for very high gradient DC guns. These insulators are difficult to manufacture, require long commissioning times, and have poor reliability, in part because energetic electrons bury themselves in the ceramic, creating a buildup of charge and causing eventual puncture. A novel ceramic manufacturing process is proposed. It will incorporate bulk resistivity in the region where it is needed to bleed off accumulated charge caused by highly energetic electrons. This process will be optimized to provide an appropriate gradient in bulk resistivity from the vacuum side to the air side of the HV standoff ceramic cylinder. A computer model will be used to determine the optimum cylinder dimensions and required resistivity gradient for an example RF gun application. A ceramic material example with resistivity gradient appropriate for use as a DC gun insulator will be fabricated by <b>glazing</b> using doping <b>compounds</b> and tested...|$|R
40|$|Cobalt is {{currently}} {{the most commonly used}} blue colorant for ceramic glazes, however due to its toxicity in powder form {{there is a need for}} an alternative. Molybdenum, more specifically molybdenum oxide, is one alternative that has shown promise. This research is aimed at the direct incorporation of reduced molybdenum clusters into the <b>glaze</b> matrix. Two <b>compounds</b> have been synthesized that exhibit an intense blue color, Na 15 [MoVI 126 MoV 28 O 457 H 14 (H 2 O) 70] 0. 5 -[MoVI 124 MoV 28 O 427 H 14 (H 2 O) 68] 0. 5 and Na 21 [MoVI 126 MoV 28 O 462 H 14 (H 2 O) 54 (H 2 PO 2) 7]. These clusters were incorporated directly into the glaze and fired under a variety of conditions. Under oxidizing conditions, a series of whites, clear, and pale blue glazes were observed. Under reducing conditions gray and blue-gray glazes were obtained. Such results indicate the sensitive nature of the two compounds while under the intense oxidizing and reducing kiln atmospheres...|$|R
