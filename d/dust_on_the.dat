5|$|Later, Bilac {{escapes from}} the room {{in which he is}} being held without exiting through the only door. Mulder notices a large drag mark through the <b>dust</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, {{discovering}} a hatch leading to the museum's old steam tunnels. While exploring the tunnels, the agents find the remains of the victims and are attacked by a multitude of feral cats. As they try to escape, they come across Bilac's mutilated body. The two agents make their way out and close the hatch on the pursuing cats. The episode closes with Mulder suspecting that the animal attacks were associated with the burial urn that had been removed against the wishes of the Ecuadorian tribespeople; it is shortly returned to the burial grounds, where the local shaman watches the urn's reburial with jaguar-like eyes.|$|E

The Nordic moss monitoring program follows a protocol that demands that samples be collected at least 300 meters from a road and that samples be collected in non-urban areas. Significantly, samples for the study at Red Dog included the loose <b>dust</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moss, while the Nordic moss monitoring program moss samples were shaken to remove dust.|$|E

25|$|Little-used {{floppy disk}} drives sitting unused {{for years in}} {{computers}} can actually damage disks, due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings. This pulls dust into the mechanism, which coats all surfaces including the exposed read/write head. Upon loading a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed, the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism, and the <b>dust</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head is ground into the medium while the stirred-up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters, leading to nearly instant fouling of the media. The dust also gets into the drive mechanism lubricant, {{turning it into a}} sticky slime, which may jam the mechanism and prevent head movement. This causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use, and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations. Some users incorrectly assume that this means all their disks have gone bad, when it is in fact the drive that is the problem. The solution is for a technician to clean the drive before it is used after a long idle period.|$|E
500|$|In 1977, a tunnel-cleaning {{train was}} completed. This {{consisted}} of two 1938 driving motor cars, and three purpose-built vehicles. The middle vehicle of the five contains a fan unit, which supplies large volumes of low pressure air {{to a series of}} nozzles, which disturb the <b>dust</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tunnel walls and track. The cars on either side of it draw the dust-laden air into filter chambers, and are fitted with conveyors for discharging the dust at depots. To enable the train to operate sufficiently slowly for the cleaning process to be effective, a hydraulic drive was fitted to one of the motor cars, with settings to allow speeds of , , [...] and [...] Up to 6 tons of dust can be held in the filter bags, and the units are fitted with carbon dioxide and water mist fire fighting equipment, because of the combustible nature of fine dust particles. There were teething problems when the train began work in 1978, but by 1980, these had been resolved.|$|E
500|$|Small, {{relatively}} weak landspouts may be visible {{only as a}} small swirl of <b>dust</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend {{all the way to}} the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than , the circulation is considered a tornado. A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a [...] "stovepipe" [...] tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as [...] "wedge tornadoes" [...] or [...] "wedges". The [...] "stovepipe" [...] classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the Tang dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Taizong (r.626649), the threat of Göktürk tribesmen from the north prompted some court officials to suggest drafting corvée labourers to repair the aging Great Wall. Taizong scoffed at the suggestion, alluding to the Sui walls built in vain: [...] "The Emperor Yang of Sui made the people labor to construct the Great Wall in order to defend against the Turks, but in the end this was of no use." [...] Instead of building walls, Taizong claimed he [...] "need merely to establish Li Shiji in Jinyang for the <b>dust</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border to settle." [...] Accordingly, Taizong sent talented generals like Li Shiji with mobile armies to the frontier, while fortifications were mostly limited to a series of walled garrisons, such as the euphemistically-named [...] "cities for accepting surrender" [...] (受降城, shòuxiáng chéng) that were actually bases from which to launch attacks. As a result of this military strategy, the Tang grew {{to become one of the}} largest of all the Chinese empires, destroying the Göktürks of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate and acquiring territory stretching all the way to Kazakhstan.|$|E
500|$|... "Littlest Things" [...] has met mixed reviews; Heather Phares from AllMusic complimented the song, {{saying the}} ballad softens Allen's rough image and celebrates [...] "the mundane moments {{of a dying}} relationship", whereas Blender {{reporter}} Jon Dolan considers it a [...] "forlorn single", where the singer writes about the terror {{of being in a}} relationship [...] "with white-knuckled worry over a snip of florid piano from a ’70s soft-core porn flick". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticised Allen for being a [...] "poser who lacks charisma, bites off of everyone else, and is so sickeningly contemptuous of everyone but herself that it makes the pretty, melancholy piano-and-drum-loop ballad 'Littlest Things' seem like a farce". While analysing Alright, Still, The Guardian reviewer, Sophie Heawood, described the lyrics as the [...] "perfect description of missing someone: 'We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt/ I was just so happy in your boxers and your T-shirt'." [...] Mark Pytlik from Pitchfork Media gave a positive review, saying that [...] "'Littlest Things' is a supple piano-tickler that provides one of Allen's sweetest lyrical moments while simultaneously leaving Ms. Dynamite in the <b>dust</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> R balladeering front". He believed that the song is made out of Allen's [...] "comfort zone" [...] of songs such as [...] "Smile", the result being of [...] "high order, if not a bit more erratic". IGN reviewer Todd Gilchrist named the song as the album's [...] "most affecting tune", while thought it [...] "compiles a sad and beautiful checklist of the intimate moments she no longer shares with her dearly departed boyfriend".|$|E
