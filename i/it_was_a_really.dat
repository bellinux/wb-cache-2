Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role: [...] "I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and told him how lucky he was to have me and he promised to be model father after all.

[...] He was however bothered that there was no further information about the parallel universe. UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben compared [...] "What Lies Below" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Ice". Zalben concluded, [...] "Though both episodes are very good, 'Ice' {{is one of the best}} X-Files hours ever, perfectly channeling – but not ripping off – John Carpenter's The Thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The final {{segment is}} based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] to exactly match its namesake because of a [...] "big legal issue", {{according}} to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that [...] "For years we {{had never been able to}} parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, which is one of the all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, so we got to clear it. It was just a dream come true to satirize it. I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> funny idea that instead of not ever seeing the Grand Pumpkin, it comes to life, and he's really horrified at the way humans cook pumpkins into pies, and eat pumpkin seeds, which are basically pumpkin fetuses...." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of Back to the Future was {{finished}} in February 1981 and presented to Columbia, who put the film in turnaround. [...] "They thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> nice, cute, warm film, but not sexual enough," [...] Gale said. [...] "They suggested that we take it to Disney, but we decided {{to see if any}} other of the major studios wanted a piece of us." [...] Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light. Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney. [...] "They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner," [...] Gale said.|$|E

Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, to me, like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company.

After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories {{is a big part of}} what I do, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> natural and comfortable thing.

[...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love."

500|$|In 2002, {{the team}} {{had come up with}} a core {{gameplay}} mechanic idea based on three groups of forces; drones that would carry a desirable resource, protectors that would guard the drones, and harvesters that would attempt to take the resource from the drones; these would eventually bear out as the Little Sisters, Big Daddies, and splicers in the final game, but {{at the time of the}} concept, there was no set theme. They began working on creating a setting for the game as to be able to pitch the idea to game publishers. A 2002 demonstration version was based on the Unreal Engine 2 for the first Xbox. This demonstration was primarily set aboard a space station overtaken with genetically-mutated monsters; the main character was Carlos Cuello, a [...] "cult deprogrammer"—a person charged with rescuing someone from a cult, and mentally and psychologically readjusting that person to a normal life. Ken Levine cites an example of what a cult deprogrammer does: [...] " [...] people who hired people to [...] deprogram their daughter who had been in a lesbian relationship. They kidnap her and reprogram her, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> dark person, and that was the [...] character that you were." [...] This story would have been more political in nature, with the character hired by a Senator. The team collectively agreed that this game was not what they had set out to make, and were having trouble finding a publisher. They considered ending development, but as news about their efforts to make a spiritual successor to System Shock 2 began to appear in gaming magazines and websites, the team opted to continue development, performing a full revamp the game.|$|E
