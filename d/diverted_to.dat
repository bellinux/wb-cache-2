5000|$|During this time, {{the flight}} crew had several discussions with the company {{dispatcher}} about whether <b>to</b> <b>divert</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles, or continue on as planned to San Francisco. Ultimately the pilots chose <b>to</b> <b>divert.</b> Later, the NTSB found that while [...] "{{the flight crew}}'s decision <b>to</b> <b>divert</b> the flight <b>to</b> Los Angeles...was prudent and appropriate", nonetheless [...] "Alaska Airlines dispatch personnel appear to have attempted to influence the flight crew to continue to San Francisco ... instead of <b>diverting</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles". Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) transcripts indicate that the dispatcher {{was concerned about the}} effect on the schedule ("flow") should the flight divert.|$|R

5|$|The {{airfield}} {{served as}} an alternative destination for Imperial Airways when Croydon was fogbound. The runway was {{just long enough for}} this purpose. Using Penshurst as an alternate destination caused delays to the passengers as there were no Customs facilities. On 18 February 1932, both Croydon and Penshurst were fogbound, and Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXE Hengist <b>diverted</b> <b>to</b> Heston Aerodrome. As Customs facilities existed there, passengers were on their way in 10 minutes, as opposed to the three hour or longer delay when using Penshurst. The practice of having a Customs Officer attend Penshurst on a daily basis was instigated, but it was discontinued in February 1935. On 24 October 1932, a German and a French airliner <b>diverted</b> <b>to</b> Penshurst due to smog over London.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} {{called for}} the French and British to abandon the Antwerp–Namur line and strong positions in favour of improvised positions behind the Scheldt, without facing any real resistance. In the South, General Deffontaine of the Belgian VII Corps retreated from the Namur and Liège regions, the Liège fortress region put up stiff resistance to the German 6th Army. In the North, the 7th Army was <b>diverted</b> <b>to</b> Antwerp after the surrender of the Dutch on 15 May, but was then <b>diverted</b> <b>to</b> support the French 1st Army. In the centre, the Belgian Army and the BEF suffered little German pressure. On 15 May, the only sector to really be tested was around Leuven, which was held by the British 3rd Division. The BEF was not pursued vigorously to the Scheldt.|$|E

5|$|Commando Hunt VII {{came to a}} {{close with}} the {{launching}} of the PAVN offensive mentioned above. This conventional attack, backed by armor, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft units (including SAMs) rolled over the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam while two smaller offensives were launched in central and southern parts of the country. All U.S. and South Vietnamese air assets were <b>diverted</b> <b>to</b> first slowing, and then halting the onslaught. They were then utilized in the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam since late 1968 (see Operation Linebacker). Interdiction missions were then <b>diverted</b> <b>to</b> carry out an even heavier aerial offensive against the north (see Operation Linebacker II). The end was nigh for Commando Hunt. With the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in March 1973, the Vietnam War finally came to an end for the U.S.|$|E
