5000|$|In {{a theory}} {{developed}} by B. Roy Frieden, [...] "physical information" [...] {{is defined as}} the loss of Fisher information that is incurred during the observation of a physical effect. Thus, if the effect has an intrinsic <b>information</b> <b>level</b> J but is observed at <b>information</b> <b>level</b> I, the physical information is defined to be the difference I &minus; J. This defines an information Lagrangian. Frieden's principle of extreme physical information or EPI states that extremalizing I &minus; J by varying the system probability amplitudes gives the correct amplitudes for most or even all physical theories. The EPI principle was recently proven. It follows from a system of mathematical axioms of L. Hardy defining all known physics.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the research and}} development of the Dutch national standard for <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> of BIM. The US-developed "Levels of Development" (LOD) have become increasingly popular in the Netherlands. However, more and more projects felt the need to develop an additional LOD 250 and LDO 350. It became clear that the Dutch design-and-engineering process needed different <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> to operate effectively. During an R&D project that involved 9 Dutch SME companies research was done focused on the levels needed in the Dutch AEC industry. During this project, the team also looked at several other <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> - the Danish, the Australian, and the UK RIBA information and the LOD concept in CityGML. The project team came up with 7 <b>information</b> <b>levels.</b> A matrix was developed on which construction objects were linked to the 7 levels. Several companies in different BIM projects tested this matrix in practice. Results from this test were concluded in a guideline for effective use of the <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> and the matrix. This paper will describe the test results and the resulting recommendations for practical use of the standard in the Netherlands. Furthermore, an experiment was conducted to automatically identify the detail of the geometry of an IFC model. This was done by analyzing several characteristics like number of objects per m, and number of geometrical triangles per object. The results of this geometrical test are also added in the paper. © ASCE 2014...|$|R

Previous work has established that {{more information about}} the price development does not guarantee higher performance. In par-ticular, traders with limited information perform below mar-ket average and are outperformed by random traders; only insiders beat the market. However, this result has only been shown in markets with a few traders and a uniform distri-bution over <b>information</b> <b>levels.</b> We present additional sim-ulations of several more realistic information distributions, extending previous findings. In addition, we analyze the market dynamics with an evolutionary model of competing <b>information</b> <b>levels.</b> Results show that the highest informa-tion level will dominate if information comes for free.

40|$|Most Data Mining methods {{require an}} a priori {{specification}} of {{a measure to}} determine the similarity or distance between data objects. Usually the Euclidean distance or a similar measure is used. Such a classical distance measure might be appropriate if the data contains only valid values. But in practice there are also vague, inaccurate or even missing values in the data. Such values represent less information than valid values; they have a lower <b>level</b> of <b>information.</b> Therefore {{it is possible that}} two data objects can have dierent <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> for the same attributes. This fact is neglected when computing the distance between such objects with a classical measure. As a consequence the similarity of objects that have low <b>information</b> <b>levels</b> for a large number of their attributes is usually over-valued.

The historical and museological approaches to books as objects will be discussed. Books are artefacts just like any other objects made, modified, or used by human beings. Different authors have presented various approaches for describing the information architecture of artefacts.

Preservation is not a passive activity {{from the point of view}} of the information structure of the artefact. While choosing preservation strategies it is essential to consider the information structure of the artefact, especially when using information reformatting technologies, which create a new object with a specific information structure (photocopies, microforms, digitisation, etc.). The preservation of artefacts presumes the prior identification of the set of information to be preserved. Keywords: artefact, information, models, book, preservatio...|$|R
50|$|Because we {{have only}} partial {{information}} we can use an adversary argument {{to tell us how}} large n has to be to compute an -approximation. Because of these information-based arguments we can often obtain tight bounds on the complexity of continuous problems. For discrete problems such as integer factorization or the travelling salesman problem we have settle for conjectures about the complexity hierarchy. The reason is that the input is a number or a vector of numbers and can thus be entered into the computer. Thus there is typically no adversary argument at the <b>information</b> <b>level</b> and the complexity of a discrete problem is rarely known.|$|E
