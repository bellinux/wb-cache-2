5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII observation post for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding the eruption. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.|$|E

At 13:54, they found Auvinen's body next to a men's lavatory near the canteen. Signs of life were detected on his person and he was {{moved out of the}} building to receive first-aid. At 13:58, the officers found the last victim on the school's second floor. They believed he was still alive and moved him out of the school to receive first-aid, but a doctor then found that the victim was already dead {{by the time he was}} found.|$|E

The two men walk along the terrace, when Lord Charles is startled by a figure leaving the study by the French window, although Sir George sees nothing. When they enter the study, Mr. Carlile has the papers out but Lord Charles quickly sees that the plans of the fighter itself are gone. Carlile is adamant that they were in the safe and he put them on the table. He was distracted when he heard a woman's scream <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> ran out to find Leonie, Mrs. Vanderlyn's maid, who claimed that she had seen a ghost.

25|$|Emi is an energetic, extroverted blonde {{girl with}} twintails and forest-green eyes. She has {{prosthetic}} legs, having had her original legs amputated below the knees {{as a result}} of a car accident. Despite her disability, she still has more than enough lower body strength to walk, and in fact she is a successful track runner. She values good diet and exercise, and is on friendly terms with the head nurse of Yamaku; she promises to keep tabs on Hisao's exercise in exchange for having him as a running partner. Indeed, she meets Hisao by literally running into him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> <b>and</b> ironically endangers his heart on more than one occasion. Hisao feels guilty whenever she pouts, equating her expression to that of a sad puppy. Emi is Rin's friend and hall mate due to both having extremely passionate vocations and complementary disabilities. However, she has trouble getting emotionally close to people, because she is afraid of losing people important to her.|$|E

500|$|The press heard rumours about Lennon's {{wife and}} child {{at the end of}} 1963—after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe—and descended on her mother's house in Hoylake (where mother and son were staying), in November and December. Friends and {{neighbours}} protected their anonymity, but she was often approached by journalists. In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church, but didn't tell Lennon (who was on tour at the time), because she feared a media circus. She told him two days after, and he was angry as he hadn't wanted his son to be christened, even though Epstein had asked to be Julian's godfather. Not long after the christening, every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon's secret wife and baby boy. Epstein told the other Beatles {{to make the best of}} the situation, and hoped newspapers would not say Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him. [...] After living at Lennon's aunt's house for some months, the couple [...] moved to London and found a three-bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor's Gate, off Cromwell Road. The top floor flat was the third of three, which were each built over two floors. This meant climbing six flights of stairs, as the building had no lift. Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat, and then go back down to collect shopping bags. The Beatles' fans soon found out where they were living, and she would find them camping out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> <b>and</b> have to push through them when leaving or arriving.|$|E
500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} cast of the show on February 13, 1991 and was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on February 20, 1991. Filming of the episode had been delayed two days due to President's Day. Both Alexander and Louis-Dreyfus praised the scene in which Jerry and George discuss the types of employment George could apply for after he quit his job. Louis-Dreyfus stated she was jealous that she was not in the scene. A number of scenes in the episode were removed prior to broadcast, such as one in which George and Kramer meet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> Kramer informs George that Jerry has gone to the laundromat. The writers decided that George could just say Kramer told him Jerry was at the laundromat and, upon that addition, the scene was cut. Initially, during Jerry and George's conversation about jobs, George mentions Regis Philbin, when they discuss George being a talk show host. Additional dialogue between George and Jerry at the laundromat was also removed. Because the episode [...] "The Stranded" [...] did not air until mid season three, the few references [...] "The Revenge" [...] contained to the episode, were cut. The Newman subplot was significantly reduced; the character initially appeared in one scene, but it was never filmed. In that scene, he would have explained to Jerry and Kramer that he jumped from the roof, but an awning broke his fall, though Jerry and Kramer would remain skeptical. The episode also involved the second appearance of Harold the building superintendent, who had previously appeared in [...] "The Apartment". Harold would inform the main characters that Newman made up the story about the awning breaking his fall, though, with the reduction of the Newman subplot, the scene was removed.|$|E

500|$|Kevin Patrick Walls and Justin Whalin {{were among}} the final {{candidates}} for the key role of Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis. Whalin took part in auditions with Campbell. Skeet Ulrich ultimately secured the role. The producers viewed him as [...] "perfect" [...] for the part and noted his resemblance to a young Johnny Depp as he appeared in A Nightmare on Elm Street, {{one of the many}} films Scream references. Ulrich and Campbell had worked together on The Craft shortly before Scream. They believed the experience helped them be more comfortable with each other, which allowed a more natural portrayal of the relationship between their characters. [...] Though he failed to win the Loomis role, Walls remained in the film in the minor role of Steve Orth, boyfriend of Barrymore's Casey Becker. David Arquette was also approached for the role of Billy Loomis but he asked to read for the part of Dewey Riley after reading the script. [...] The role, described as [...] "hunky", was considered ill-fitting for Arquette's lean, slender appearance and approach but Arquette was still allowed to audition for the part. Craven appreciated his softer, funnier approach to the character, and gave him the role. Matthew Lillard was cast as Billy's equally sadistic friend Stu Macher by chance after accompanying his then-girlfriend to an unrelated audition taking place elsewhere in the same building. Casting director Lisa Beach saw Lillard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> asked him to audition for the part. He got into the role with [...] "incredible ferocity". The role of Randy Meeks was contested between Jamie Kennedy and Breckin Meyer. The producers favored Kennedy, believing him to best embody the role. As he had no major roles prior to Scream, the studio wanted a more prominent actor than Kennedy to play the character. The producers were adamant that he was the best choice and successfully fought to keep him. Roger L. Jackson, voice of the character Ghostface, was picked at the end of several weeks of local casting in Santa Rosa, where parts of Scream were filmed. The producers had originally intended to use his voice only as a placeholder, dubbing over it during post-production. They decided that Jackson's contribution was perfect and kept it. Craven described it as an [...] "intelligent" [...] and [...] "evil" [...] voice that would become irreplaceable to the series. To aid their performance, Jackson was never allowed to meet the other actors, preventing them from associating a face with the menacing voice. [...] Jackson was present on the set and spoke to actors by phone to help aid their performance.|$|E

50|$|Architecturally, Duncan has {{the same}} {{features}} as McMurtry with minor differences emphasized {{in order to establish}} its uniqueness.

Also, Duncan quad has different features from McMurtry, such as a fountain by the Commons, smaller trees, and walkways that go across the quad. The interior, however, is virtually the same, as both colleges contain mostly doubles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> single rooms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corners, with doubles having a pod bathroom inside and singles sharing common bathrooms. Both also have green roofs and fifth floor doubles and suites that open to the outside. <b>The</b> interior <b>hallways</b> of both Duncan and McMurtry were designed as contrasts to the other two most recently built residential colleges, Martel and Wiess, which have exterior <b>hallways.</b> <b>The</b> pair of McMurtry and Duncan are commonly referred to as McDuncan.|$|R
2500|$|A Finnish {{reporter}} from Helsingin Sanomat reported seeing rockets fired from near the Gaza Al-Shifa hospital.

Hamas security reportedly wore police uniforms and blocked access to {{certain parts of the}} hospitals. One of the interrogated militants reportedly said that civilians seeking medical attention usually were thrown out by the security. The Washington Post described Al-Shifa hospital as a [...] "de facto headquarters for Hamas leaders, who can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> offices."

40|$|Though {{creative}} nonfiction {{has been}} around since Montaigne, St. Augustine, and Seneca, we’ve only just begun to ask how this genre works, why it functions the way it does, and where its borders reside. But for each question we ask, another five or ten questions roil to the surface. And each of these questions, it seems, requires a more convoluted series of answers. What’s more, the questions students of creative nonfiction are drawn to during class discussions, the ones they argue the longest and loudest, are the same ideas debated by their professors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> corner bar. <b>In</b> this collection, sixteen essential contemporary creative nonfiction writers reflect on whatever far, dark edge of the genre they find themselves most drawn to. The result is this fascinating anthology that wonders at the historical and contemporary borderlands between fiction and nonfiction; the illusion of time on the page; the mythology of memory; poetry, process, and the use of received forms; the impact of technology on our writerly lives; immersive research and the power of witness; a chronology and collage; and what we write and why we write.
