When they travel, they often visit formal hotels that are designed by interior designers and architects who use national regulations to guide their design approach. In South Africa, interior designers and architects are governed by the South African National Standards. Universal design is an all-inclusive design theory that is often used by interior designers and architects to design for people with disabilities, including the visually impaired. Using an exploratory qualitative approach through direct observation and open-ended interviews, the study found that the <b>interior</b> <b>environments</b> in the formal hospitality industry in South Africa do not meet the needs of visually impaired people. Data shows that the <b>interior</b> <b>environments</b> of formal hotels in South Africa are designed aesthetically, but do not cognisance of people with visual challenges. The study further concludes that the South African National Standards do not adequately provide guidance for the design of <b>interior</b> <b>environments</b> for people with visual impairment. The study recommends that interior designers and architects should take up the challenge to engage with building features and materials beyond their physical properties and aesthetics, by considering how the needs of visually impaired people can be met in the design of <b>interior</b> hotel <b>environments.</b> M.

40|$|Can <b>interior</b> <b>environments</b> engage {{people in}} pleasurable and {{meaningful}} experiences and thereby {{have a positive}} influence on their happiness? This paper discusses why and how interior architects might want to consider implementing ideas in relation to ‘design for subjective well-being’. Despite of people being the ingredients that bring life to the built environment, it tends to be designed in such a way for them to predominantly only passively absorb the surrounding. Up to date, when designing <b>interior</b> <b>environments,</b> (<b>interior)</b> architects are mainly concerned about the fulfillment of various rather objective considerations. Typical reflections in this respect are: is there enough daylight, how are the acoustics, how is the accessibility and the organization of the inner space? Starting from such premises, the atmosphere of the inner space is given substance. However, empirical studies have shown that long-term happiness is less a matter of one’s circumstances than of the activities that a person engages in. Hence, one could go one step further from viewing the built environment as a static entity, to designing spaces that facilitate desirable activities. In other words, inner environments could aim to stimulate experiences that provide pleasure and meaning to its inhabitants. Subjective well-being (SWB) is an emerging research topic in the field of design sciences. Design models and strategies are being developed in an effort to increase users’ well-being. However, a detailed understanding of how these insights apply to interior architecture still needs to be refined. For this reason, this paper will firstly outline why <b>interior</b> <b>environments</b> could have the potential to contribute to people’s SWB and thereby to become platforms for the full spectrum of human well-being. The second section of the paper reflects on how a deliberate focus on SWB will affect the process of designing <b>interior</b> <b>environments.</b> The Positive Design Framework, developed by Desmet & Pohlmeyer (2013), will be introduced to the (interior) architectural community. Interior architects can use this framework as a guide to assist them in the design process of <b>interior</b> <b>environments</b> that aim to contribute to people’s happiness. A number of examples will demonstrate in an interior architectural vocabulary the value that this framework can have for this discipline. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
