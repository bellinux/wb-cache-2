40|$|UnrestrictedUnlike {{many aspects}} of the body, human teeth do not have natural {{regenerative}} mechanisms. Instead, the multiple tissues and mechanical structures in teeth combine to create a structural gradient that successfully absorbs a lifetime of impact forces from routine mastication without irreversible damage. The integration of hard and soft tissue types is advantageous for distributing loads but the resulting interfaces are prone to fracture. The intermediate boundary known as the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (<b>DEJ)</b> is a natural strategy which avoids abrupt changes in mechanical properties. The DEJ is a self-assembling structure which combines two dissimilar materials, enamel, and dentin. This junction is critical to the longevity of tooth function and is recognized to fulfill multiple roles. This thesis reviews the current state of knowledge related to the DEJ and its surrounding structures that cooperate together to create a failure resistant structure...|$|E
40|$|Alumina- and zirconia-based ceramic dental restorations are {{designed}} to repair functionality as well as esthetics of the failed teeth. However, these materials exhibited several performance deficiencies such as fracture, poor esthetic properties of ceramic cores (particularly zirconia cores), and difficulty in accomplishing a strong ceramic–resin-based cement bond. Therefore, improving the mechanical properties of these ceramic materials is of great interest {{in a wide range}} of disciplines. Consequently, spatial gradients in surface composition and structure can improve the mechanical integrity of ceramic dental restorations. Thus, this article reviews the current status of the functionally graded dental prostheses inspired by the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (<b>DEJ)</b> structures and the linear gradation in Young's modulus of the DEJ, as a new material design approach, to improve the performance compared to traditional dental prostheses. This is a remarkable example of nature's ability to engineer functionally graded dental prostheses.

40|$|During eating, {{the teeth}} usually endure the sharply {{temperature}} changes because of different foods. It is {{of importance to}} investigate the heat transfer and heat dissipation behavior of the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (<b>DEJ)</b> of human tooth since dentine and enamel have different thermophysical properties. The spatial and temporal temperature distributions on the enamel, dentine, and pulpal chamber of both the human tooth and its discontinuous boundaries, were measured using infrared thermography using a stepped temperature increase on the outer boundary of enamel crowns. The thermal diffusivities for enamel and dentine were deduced from the time dependent temperature change at the enamel and dentine layers. The thermal conductivities for enamel and dentine were calculated to be 0. 81 Wm- 1 K- 1 and 0. 48 Wm- 1 K- 1 respectively. The observed temperature discontinuities across the interfaces between enamel, dentine and pulp-chamber layers were due to the difference of thermal conductivities at interfaces {{rather than to the}} phase transformation. The temperature gradient distributes continuously across the enamel and dentine layers and their junction below a temperature of 42 °C, whilst a negative thermal resistance is observed at interfaces above 42 °C. These results suggest that the microstructure of the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) junction {{play an important role in}} tooth heat transfer and protects the pulp from heat damage...|$|E

The dentine was fractured at various known distances from the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction.</b> Near the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> the number of tubules per square millimetre was 22 000 and the mean tubular cross-sectional area was 3. 6 %.

Close to the pulp the number of dentinal tubules was 48 000 mm- 2 and the mean cross sectional area of tubules was 10. 2 percent. The number of tubules per square millimetre more than doubled and the area occupied by tubules increased threefold from the dentine close to the dentine-enamel junction, to that close to the pulp.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{number of}} {{publications}} on the oral features in Apert syndrome is limited. The present study investigated dental tissues in Apert syndrome histologically, {{to determine the}} nature and extent of anomalies, to provide some insight into the nature of the condition, and to explain how observed anomalies may affect the dental management of individuals with Apert syndrome. SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Extracted primary and secondary teeth were collected from patients with Apert who had attended the Australian Craniofacial Unit, Adelaide, South Australia. The total study sample comprised 13 individuals, aged from 14 to 21, with nine men and four women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 teeth were available for histological examination (the number belonging to each individual varied from 2 to 5 per patient). The teeth were sectioned longitudinally, and one-half of each tooth underwent decalcification. Sections were stained with H&E for routine histological examination. Ground sections were prepared from undecalcified tooth halves. RESULTS: Histological assessment of the dental hard tissues revealed an intact enamel and dentinal structure but some irregularities were noted in the region of the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (<b>DEJ),</b> which could affect caries progression and also make dental management more difficult. CONCLUSION: This study identified histological anomalies of the DEJ of Apert syndrome teeth. An improved appreciation of {{the nature and extent}} of dental anomalies in Apert syndrome should assist clinicians when undertaking management of affected individuals. T. L. Surman, R. M. Logan, G.

40|$|NoThe {{ability of}} prisms to {{effectively}} dissipate contact stress {{at the surface}} will influence wear rates in teeth. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to begin to quantify the effect of prism orientation on surface stresses. Seven finite element models of enamel microstructure were created, each model differing in the angulation of prism orientation with regard to the wear surface. For validation purposes, the mechanical behavior of the model was compared with published experimental data. In order to test the enamel under lateral loads, a compressed food particle was dragged across the surface from the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> (<b>DEJ)</b> towards the outer enamel surface (OES). Under these conditions, tensile stresses in the enamel model increased with increases in the coefficient of friction. More importantly, stresses were found to be lowest in models in which the prisms approach the surface at lower angles (i. e., more obliquely cut prisms), and highest when the prisms approached the surface at 60 ° (i. e., less obliquely cut). Finally, the direction of travel of the simulated food particle was reversed, allowing comparison of the difference in behavior between trailing and leading edge enamels (i. e., when the food particle was dragged either towards or away from the DEJ). Stresses at the trailing edge were usually lower than stresses at the leading edge. Taken together with what is known about prism orientation in primate teeth, such findings imply greater wear resistance at the intercuspal region and less wear resistance at the lateral enamel at midcrown. Such findings appear to be supported by archeological evidence...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} on human and Rhesus monkey enamel using three {{methods of analysis}} to gain information concerning the pattern of enamel calcification: (1) microhardness pattern of enamel mineralization; (2) microradiography; and (3) plastic substitution studies. Halves of teeth were selected and tested on a Tukon Microhardness Tester with a Knoop Diamond Indentor. The other half of each tooth was further sectioned. Several sections from each tooth were ground to less than 150 [mu] in thickness and microradiographs were taken; the remainder {{were used for the}} substitution studies. All organic tissue and water were removed from the sections and replaced with plastic. Decalcification of these sections revealed areas of low and high organic and water content. It was found that mineralization of the enamel matrix begins at the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> and proceeds peripherally, thus following the incremental pattern of formation of the enamel matrix. Final calcification is completed after the matrix is completely deposited and follows this same pattern from the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction</b> peripherally. The enamel rod matrix becomes calcified before the interrod substance, the latter thus presenting pathways for diffusion of tissue fluid containing calcium and phosphate ions, during the mineralization process. The interrod substance is the first area of enamel to be altered in dental caries. Thus the steps in enamel destruction are in reverse order to those in enamel formation...|$|R
5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border.

50|$|Unlike enamel, dentine may be demineralized {{and stained}} for {{histological}} study. Dentine consists of microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentine from the pulp to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The dentinal tubules extend from the dentinoenamel <b>junction</b> (<b>DEJ)</b> in the crown area, or dentinocemental junction (DCJ) in the root area, {{to the outer}} wall of the pulp. From the outer surface of the dentine to the area nearest the pulp, these tubules follow an S-shaped path. The diameter and density of the tubules are greatest near the pulp. Tapering from the inner to the outermost surface, they have a diameter of 2.5 μm near the pulp, 1.2 μm {{in the middle of the}} dentin, and 0.9 μm at the <b>dentino-enamel</b> <b>junction.</b> Their density is 59,000 to 76,000 per square millimeter near the pulp, whereas the density is only half as much near the enamel. Within the tubules, there is an odontoblast process, which is an extension of an odontoblast, and dentinal fluid, which contains a mixture of albumin, transferrin, tenascin and proteoglycans. In addition, there are branching canalicular systems that connect to each other. These branches have been categorized by size, with major being 500-1000 nm in diameter, fine being 300-700 nm, and micro being less than 300 nm. The major branches are the terminal ends of the tubules. About every 1-2 μm, there are fine branches diverging from dentinal tubules at 45 degree angles. The microtubules diverge at 90 degree angles. The dentinal tubules contain the cytoplasmic extensions of odontoblasts that once formed the dentin and maintain it. The cell bodies of the odontoblasts are aligned along the inner aspect of dentin against a layer of predentin where they also form the peripheral boundary of the dental pulp. Because of dentinal tubules, dentin has a degree of permeability, which can increase the sensation of pain and the rate of tooth decay. The strongest held theory of dentinal hypersensitivity suggests that it is due to changes in the dentinal fluid associated with the processes, a type of hydrodynamic mechanism.|$|R

50|$|In {{areas where}} both primary and {{secondary}} mineralization have occurred with complete crystalline fusion, these appear as lighter rounded areas on a stained section of dentin and are considered globular dentin. In contrast, the darker arclike areas in a stained section of dentin are considered interglobular dentin. In these areas, only primary mineralization has occurred within the predentin, and the globules of dentin do not fuse completely. Thus, interglobular dentin is slightly less mineralized than globular dentin.

The histopathological examination of initial skin biopsies was unable to diagnose ALM in four cases, differing from RCM that could identify malignant tumour cells by exploring the whole lesions. CONCLUSION: Reflectance confocal microscopy can help in the differentiation of ALM and acral nevus, and to guide the biopsy...|$|R
