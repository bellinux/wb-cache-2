25|$|The DS {{models are}} double action only pistols: the hammer doesn't stay cocked. Therefore the hammer spur has been removed, and is {{flush with the}} rear of the slide. The safety levers serve as manual safeties only and have no <b>decocking</b> feature..|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} meet {{requirements}} of some law enforcement agencies, Beretta modified the Beretta 92 by adding a slide-mounted combined safety and <b>decocking</b> lever, replacing the frame mounted manual thumb safety. This resulted in the 92S which was adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units.|$|E
25|$|Early P85 pistols were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} issue {{that resulted in}} one accidental discharge. If the firing pin broke {{in front of the}} firing pin block, applying the safety, which dropped the hammer, could transfer enough energy to the broken firing pin to cause a discharge. The P85 was recalled, and a new safety was installed that prevented contact between firing pin and hammer during a <b>decocking</b> operation. This modification was done free of charge. The P85 MKII was released with the safety fix, larger safety levers, improved accuracy, and the option of a stainless-steel slide.|$|E

2500|$|The Smith & Wesson Model 952 was {{introduced}} in 2000 as a Performance Center pistol based on the Model 52 but chambered in 9mm. Enhancements included a 5” match-grade barrel, titanium-coated spherical barrel bushing, 9-round magazine, loaded chamber indicator and a slide-mounted <b>decocking</b> lever. An enhanced version was produced in 2004 and a long slide variant with a 6" [...] barrel debuted in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The MK 23 is {{considered}} a match grade pistol, and is capable of making a [...] group at [...] The MK 23 is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion-resistant. It uses a polygonal barrel design, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability, and is much more expensive to produce. It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release {{on both sides of}} the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A <b>decocking</b> lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition).|$|E
2500|$|After several tests, Heckler & Koch and Colt {{submissions}} {{were selected}} to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. [...] They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. [...] At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. [...] They {{came up with a}} design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. [...] Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. [...] They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the <b>decocking</b> mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating barrel locking system from the All American 2000. [...] The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard.|$|E

2500|$|The first Omni {{dispensed}} with the [...] Browning 1911-style swinging link {{in favour of}} the Browning 1935-type fixed cam to lock the breech. Apart from the method of locking the breech, other features of the pistol were highly innovative. Three new magazine designs were tried. Omni I was a [...]45 ACP pistol with a single stack 7-round [...] magazine. [...] Omni II was a 9mm parabellum pistol with a single stack 9-round [...] magazine. Omni III was a 9mm parabellum pistol with a double stack 13-round [...] magazine, however the first five rounds fed into the action in a single column to {{reduce the likelihood of}} jamming. Another feature was the two-piece ball-jointed firing pin, which was designed to never break. Additionally the Omni had [...] dual sear bars for improved trigger pull; a trigger safety; finger-contoured trigger guard and a <b>decocking</b> manual safety lever. [...] The wealth of features meant the Omni was an expensive pistol to make compared to previous models, and together with its radical appearance, this discouraged commercial sales. Production of the Omni therefore ceased in 1986.|$|E

5000|$|The {{standard}} SIG P226 {{incorporates a}} <b>decocking</b> lever {{on the left}} side of the frame above the magazine release button, which first appeared on the Sauer 38H prior to World War II, which allows the hammer to be dropped safely. In chambering or firing a round, the actuation of the slide automatically cocks the hammer. By using the <b>decocking</b> lever, the hammer can be de-cocked without actuating the firing pin block, making it impossible to accidentally fire the weapon by using the <b>decocking</b> lever. Furthermore, using the <b>decocking</b> lever makes the weapon [...] "drop safe", which means the firing pin will be blocked from striking a loaded round unless the trigger is pulled. Pulling the trigger and slowly lowering the hammer does not make the weapon [...] "drop safe", and can result in an accidental discharge if sufficient force is applied to the hammer.|$|E
