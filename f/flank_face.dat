40|$|The {{life and}} the {{performance}} of an insert in metal cutting are mainly dependent on the heat that is generated in the contact zone on the tool rake and on the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> with the transient and machined surfaces. According to tool life standard the wear on the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> is usually taken as a decision for tool life. Hence knowledge of temperature on the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> becomes important. The temperature on the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> has been measured in this work for different CGI materials having different microstructure and physical properties in a turning operation. It has been seen that there is no significant difference of tool temperature noticed while machining different CGI materials having hardness from (140 - 236 HBW). For temperature measurement, special inserts assisted with gold-platinum thermocouple on the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> were used. It has been noticed that the materials having 31 % resultant force difference and 8 - 6 times tool life difference have almost same temperature on the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> measured at different distances from the edge line of the insert...|$|E

40|$|As {{documented}} by Darwin 150 years ago, emotion expressed in human faces readily draws our attention and promotes sympathetic emotional reactions. How do such {{reactions to the}} expression of emotion affect our goal-directed actions? Despite the substantial advance made in the neural mechanisms of both cognitive control and emotional processing, {{it is not yet}} known well how these two systems interact. Here, we studied how emotion expressed in human faces influences cognitive control of conflict processing, spatial selective attention and inhibitory control in particular, using the Eriksen flanker paradigm. In this task, participants viewed displays of a central target <b>face</b> <b>flanked</b> by peripheral <b>faces</b> and were asked to judge the gender of the target face; task-irrelevant emotion expressions were embedded in the target <b>face,</b> the <b>flanking</b> <b>faces,</b> or both. We also monitored how emotion expression affects gender judgment performance while varying the relative timing between the target and <b>flanker</b> <b>faces.</b> As previously reported, we found robust gender congruency effects, namely slower responses to the target faces whose gender was incongruent with that of the <b>flanker</b> <b>faces,</b> when the flankers preceded the target by 0. 1 s. When the flankers further advanced the target by 0. 3 s, however, the congruency effect vanished in most of the viewing conditions, except for when emotion was expressed only in the <b>flanking</b> <b>faces</b> or when congruent emotion was expressed in the target and <b>flanking</b> <b>faces.</b> These results suggest that emotional saliency can prolong a substantial degree of conflict by diverting bottom-up attention away from the target, and that inhibitory control on task-irrelevant information from flanking stimuli is deterred by the emotional congruency between target and flanking stimuli...|$|R

40|$|AbstractApplication of coolant to {{the cutting}} domain is {{increasingly}} important in machining titanium alloy, nickel-base superalloy and other difficult-to-machine materials. However, {{the effect of}} coolant speed on the accessibility of coolant to the tool tip {{has not yet been}} investigated. For this reason, the computational fluid dynamics analysis was applied to the coolant flow in turning where coolant is applied from the side of end <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> to the tool tip. In this study the free surface analysis or two phase computational fluid dynamics analysis of coolant and air was conducted for visualizing the flow of coolant around the tool tip. The capillary force is considered in the analysis because the gap between the tool <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> and machined surface is very small. The volume fraction of liquid obtained in finite volumes showed the accessibility of coolant to the tool tip. It is found to be difficult for coolant to access to the tool tip through a narrow gap between the tool <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> and machined surface when the coolant speed is not high. It is also found that the accessibility of coolant is improved as the speed of coolant is increased...|$|E
30|$|Also due to {{the above}} reasons, the {{required}} cycle times for polishing the surfaces of the different diamond coated milling cutters to thresholds are distinctive. Just adopting the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> as the example, for the UMCD film with the largest grain size, the highest initial Ra value, the extremely high diamond purity and hardness, it takes almost 75 cycle times to reduce the Ra value to the threshold. Owing to the refinement of the diamond grain caused by the boron doping and the slight reduction of the initial Ra value, 60 cycle times of AFM can reduce its Ra value to the threshold. The change of the grain size from micro to nano, along with the subsequent reduction of the initial Ra value, diamond purity and hardness, contribute much to the polishing efficiency of the nano-sized surfaces. As a result, such the required cycle time for {{the three types of}} diamond films is 25. In addition, it is found that for any of the diamond coated milling cutter, the required cycle time for the rake face is generally less than that for the <b>flank</b> <b>face,</b> because the grinding force provided of the polishing paste restricted in the spiral groove is relatively larger than that provided by the polishing paste around the <b>flank</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
40|$|Upright <b>flanking</b> <b>faces</b> have {{stronger}} {{detrimental effects}} on the recognition of upright target <b>face,</b> than inverted <b>flanking</b> <b>faces.</b> One possible explanation for this “flanker- inversion effect” was that the more holistically processed upright <b>flanking</b> <b>faces</b> allowed for more erroneous feature integration. Alternatively, crowding was known to be stronger when target and flankers were more similar. Here we investigate flanker-inversion effect on crowding in Chinese character identification. Five normally-sighted young adults participated. Targets of size 1. 2 ° were presented at 5 ° in the lower visual field. Four flankers with center-to-center distance of 1. 8 ° were presented in the crowded condition. Three types of flankers were used, upright or inverted Chinese and upright Korean characters. The identification contrast thresholds were estimated by QUEST and crowding strength was measured through threshold elevation (TE). Crowding on upright Chinese target was significantly stronger with inverted Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 59 ± 0. 32) than with upright Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 47 ± 0. 29). No inversion effect was observed for inverted Chinese target. Korean flankers produced similar crowding as upright Chinese flankers. Our results go against the similarity rule that predicts upright Chinese flankers would produce stronger crowding for upright Chinese target. Holistic processing preferred for inverted Chinese characters may account for the findings...|$|R

30|$|Both the UMCD and BDMCD films show micro-sized diamond grains with {{well-defined}} shapes, and the boron {{doping technique}} can slightly reduce the grain size. The {{average grain size}} of the UMCD film is 2 ‒ 4 μm, while that of the BDMCD film is 1 ‒ 3 μm. Attributed to the distinct crests and valleys of the shaped diamond grains, the surface roughness Ra values on the rake and <b>flank</b> <b>faces</b> of the UMCD coated milling cutter are as high as 242.54 and 267.91 nm, {{and those of the}} BDMCD coated ones are 237.15 and 252.4 nm. Cauliflower-like nodules composed of the dense nano-sized diamond grains (20 ‒ 500 nm) appear on the surfaces of not only the UFGD and BDFGD films, but also the BDM-UFGCD film with a surface UFGD layer. The nodules are more densely packed and form larger, shallower dome-like protrusions, resulting in a relatively lower surface roughness. Nevertheless, it is found that nano-sized diamond grains of the BDM-UFGCD film are larger than those of the single-layer FGD films, which can be distinguished from cauliflower-like shapes in the FESEM micrographs with lower amplification factors. As a result, the surface roughness Ra values on the rake and <b>flank</b> <b>faces</b> of the UFGD coated cutter reach 142.36 and 161.94 nm, and those of the BDFGD coated one are 137.22 and 167.54 nm, but those of the BDM-UFGCD coated one are a little higher, which are 162.9 and 186.22 nm. As a comparison, the uncoated milling cutter (R-WC), which is elaborately ground, performs a rather smooth surface.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} works, where Inconel 718, a highly corrosive resistant, nickel-based super alloy, was finish-turning under high speed conditions. The machining processes were carried out at three different cutting conditions (DRY, MQL 50 ml/h and MQL 100 ml/h), three levels of cutting speed (Vc= 90, 120 and 150 m/min), two levels of feed rate (f= 0. 10 and 0. 15 mm/rev) and two levels of cutting depth (d= 0. 30 and 0. 50 mm). The tool wear and flank wear progression were monitored, measured and recorded progressively at various time intervals. The experiments indicated that MQL condition performs better than dry condition in term of tool life. Most of the tool failures during machining were due to gradual failure where abrasive and notching wear on the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> was the dominant followed by, fracture on the flank edge and nose radius. Tool failure due to crater wear was not significant. Wear mechanism such as abrasive and adhesion were observed on the <b>flank</b> <b>face</b> and diffusion wear was observed on the rake face...|$|E
40|$|Do {{threatening}} {{or negative}} faces capture attention? The authors argue that evidence from visual search, spatial cuing, and flanker tasks is equivocal and that perceptual differences {{may account for}} effects attributed to emotional categories. Empirically, the authors examine the flanker task. Although they replicate previous results in which a positive <b>face</b> <b>flanked</b> by negative <b>faces</b> suffers more interference than a negative <b>face</b> <b>flanked</b> by positive <b>faces,</b> further results indicate that face perception is not necessary for the flanker-effect asymmetry and that the asymmetry also occurs with nonemotional stimuli.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that face processing is capacity-limited in distractor interference tasks and in tasks requiring overt recognition memory. We examined whether capacity limits for faces can be observed with a more sensitive measure of visual processing, by measuring repetition priming of <b>flanker</b> <b>faces</b> that were presented alongside a face or a nonface target. In Experiment 1, we found identity priming for face flankers, by measuring repetition priming across a change in image, during task-relevant nonface processing, but not during the processing of a concurrently-presented face target. Experiment 2 showed perceptual priming of the <b>flanker</b> <b>faces,</b> across identical images at prime and test, when they were presented alongside a face target. In a third Experiment, all of these effects were replicated by measuring identity priming and perceptual priming within the same task. Overall, these results imply that face processing is capacity limited, such that only a single face can be identified at one time. Merely attending to a target face appears sufficient to trigger these capacity limits, thereby extinguishing identification of a second face in the display, although our results demonstrate that the additional face remains at least subject to superficial image processing...|$|R

40|$|Variation {{of cutting}} forces has been {{investigated}} and correlated {{with the development of}} tool wear during dry machining of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy at cutting speeds of 150 and 220 m/min, respectively. Both the average and maximum flank wear increased more significantly with volume of material removed at higher cutting speed. The tool failure mode is flank wear at both cutting speeds; however, the mechanisms for the excessive flank wear are different. The average width of flank wear reaches the criterion at cutting speed of 150 m/min after 57. 2 cm 3 of material has been removed {{as a result of the}} gradual recession of cutting edge due to crater wear, which led to significant rise of feed force only at the end of tool life. Both average width and maximum width of flank wear exceeds the criteria at cutting speed of 220 m/min after 20. 8 cm 3 of material has been removed because of severe plastic deformation of cutting edge at the nose radius, which resulted in dramatic increase in all three components of cutting forces at the end of tool life.
