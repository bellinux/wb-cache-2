40|$|C {{does not}} have {{exception}} <b>handling</b> facilities. Errors are <b>handled</b> by examining the value returned by each function and signals (conditions reported to the program) are <b>handled</b> by using library functions. These approaches lead to ad hoc error-handling techniques and can make programs hard to understand. Exceptional C, a superset of C, provides exception <b>handling</b> facilities. Exceptional C integrates the two techniques used by C programmers (i. e., status values and signals) to <b>handle</b> errors into one unified exception <b>handling</b> mechanism. In this paper, I review exception <b>handling</b> models, specify the criteria used for designing the exception <b>handling</b> facilities in Exceptional C, and then describe these facilities.

40|$|Functional {{response}} {{describes the}} rate at which a predator consumes prey. <b>Handling</b> time, duration that a predator spends on a captured prey for the consumption, is one of the parameters of many functional response models. Although models typically assume that <b>handling</b> time is static, most empirical studies that directly quantified the relationship between <b>handling</b> time and prey density show that <b>handling</b> time decreases with prey density. In this study, I compare a community model that employs density-dependent <b>handling</b> time and a model with static <b>handling</b> time for their responses to enrichment. The density-dependent <b>handling</b> time is derived by assuming that predators adjust <b>handling</b> time to maximize their fitness. I show that the model with adaptive <b>handling</b> time is more robust to enrichment than the model with static <b>handling</b> time at realistic parameter values. Although community response to enrichment is used as an illustrative example, density-dependent <b>handling</b> time is a common empirical observation and would have general implications to ecological dynamics...|$|R

The semantics needs to capture the complex interactions between signal <b>handling</b> and exception <b>handling.</b> ...|$|R
