5|$|Final Fantasys {{popularity}} sparked Uematsu's {{career in}} video game music, {{and he would}} go on to compose music for over 30 titles, most prominently the subsequent games in the Final Fantasy series. He scored the first installment in the SaGa series, The Final Fantasy Legend, in 1989. For the second game in the series, Final Fantasy Legend II he was assisted by Kenji Ito. In late 1994, Uematsu signed on to finish the soundtrack for the critically acclaimed title Chrono Trigger after the game's composer, Yasunori Mitsuda, contracted peptic ulcers. In 1996, he co-composed the soundtrack to , and created the entire score for DynamiTracer. He also created music <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the games in the Hanjuku Hero series.|$|E

5|$|Orr {{started in}} {{organized}} hockey at age five. He first played as a forward, but {{was moved to}} defence by his coach, Royce Tennant. Going against the standard practice of the time, Tennant felt Orr's offensive skills were best suited for a rushing defenceman role and he gave Orr the freedom to play that role despite its inherent risks. With Orr on defence, the Parry Sound Shamrocks had many successes. After Tennant, Bucko MacDonald coached Orr, and Orr continued to excel against small town Ontario provincial competition on defence. At fourteen, Orr joined the Oshawa Generals, the Bruins' junior hockey affiliate, {{and he was an}} all-star <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> his four seasons.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill series {{composer}} Akira Yamaoka {{scored the}} soundtrack of Shattered Memories. It was his final {{contribution to the}} Silent Hill series before he resigned from Konami after 16 years with the company. Voice actress Mary Elizabeth McGlynn provided vocals for four musical pieces included {{in the game and}} co-directed Shattered Memories voice acting, and musician Joe Romersa wrote lyrics <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the pieces. The game is the first in the series to make prominent use of dynamic music; a composition is introduced and subsequently retracted, based on the player's actions, in every major area of the game. Widely varying compositions, ranging from undertones to rock music, were produced for the game.|$|E
5|$|Tephrochronology and {{radiocarbon}} dating indicate that Glacier Peak eruptions occurred in 1700 AD ± 100 years, 1300 AD ± 300 years, 900 AD ± 50 years, 200 AD ± 50 years, 850 BC, 3150 BC, and in 3550 BC. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> these was 2 to 4, {{small compared to}} the 5 of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. They were characterized mainly by a central vent eruption, followed by an explosive eruption. These eruptions varied in outcome; some produced lahars, some pyroclastic flows, and others lava domes.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Test of {{the series}} was a high-scoring draw, Loxton making six in his only innings. His 43 in the final Test {{of the series}} was overshadowed by centuries <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> his teammates, in an innings win that sealed the series 4–0. In the Test series as a whole, the Victorian all-rounder made 255 runs {{at an average of}} 42.50, but bowled only 34 overs in taking two wickets. He made little impact on the tour matches after the start of the Tests, passing fifty twice and taking two wickets from 13 overs in five matches. For the entire tour, Loxton totaled 809 {{first-class}} runs at 40.45 and took 12 wickets.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1982 {{was marred by}} both Downey and Gorham having to take breaks from the European tour to recover from personal problems. Downey {{was involved in a}} fight in a nightclub in Denmark in February, and Gorham was suffering from drug-induced exhaustion. Downey missed five concerts, and was replaced by Mark Nauseef again <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> them, and by Mike Mesbur of support band The Lookalikes for the other two. In March, Gorham collapsed and returned home; eight concerts were performed as a quartet and six others were postponed.|$|E

Although some UK media, including the Sun, reported in early May 2011 that production of the series was to continue, the BBC stated explicitly that no further episodes would be filmed. The fifth series was broadcast starting 3 October 2011 on Mondays and Tuesdays. It finished just two weeks later on 18 October 2011.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier at eye level was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the statues are known: William Fosten for the Driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1946 St. Louis Browns season, manager Luke Sewell was {{reluctant}} to turn Zoldak into a starter, but eventually gave him the nod. His first two starts were both victories, {{one of which was}} a complete game shutout against the Chicago White Sox, which gave him credit <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the Browns' first eight wins of the season. He pitched in 35 games over the season, 21 of them starts, and ended the year with a 3.43 ERA, a 911 record, and a career-high 51 strikeouts. Unlike the previous season, Zoldak was slow to start in 1947, not winning his first game until June 22 against the Washington Senators. He finished the season similar statistically to 1946: he played in 35 games and started 19, and had a record of 9-10 and a 3.47 ERA. During the offseason, Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck offered $100,000 for Zoldak, but were turned down, and he remained on the Browns to begin the 1948 season. Zoldak was projected to be the team's opening day starting pitcher against the Cleveland Indians, who had planned for him; instead he was used in relief and Fred Sanford was named the starter the day of the game.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British {{agent who}} has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E

5|$|Four {{ships of}} the class were ordered, under the {{provisional}} names Ersatz Siegfried (Helgoland), Ersatz Oldenburg (Ostfriesland), Ersatz Beowulf (Thüringen), and Ersatz Frithjof (Oldenburg), as replacements <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the coastal defense ships of the Siegfried-class, and the unique coastal defense ship SMS Oldenburg. SMS Helgoland was built at Howaldtswerke, Kiel. She was laid down on 11 November 1908, launched 25 September 1909, and commissioned nearly two years later on 23 August 1911. SMS Ostfriesland was built at Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven. She was laid down 19 October 1908, launched five days after her sister Helgoland, on 30 September 1909, and commissioned 1 August 1911. SMS Thüringen was built by AG Weser in Bremen. She was laid down on 2 November 1908, launched on 27 November 1909, and commissioned on 1 July 1911. SMS Oldenburg, the final vessel, was built by Schichau in Danzig; she was laid down 1 March 1909, launched 30 June 1910, and commissioned on 1 May 1912.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 two No. 38 Squadron King Airs were {{deployed}} to Vanuatu {{as part of}} Australia's aid effort following Cyclone Pam. The aircraft were used to conduct flights over the affected areas to assess {{the extent of the}} damage, and also evacuated Australian and New Zealand citizens. In February 2016 it was reported that the RAAF was considering consolidating its two squadrons equipped with King Airs into a single squadron located at RAAF Base East Sale. All of the RAAF's King Airs were grounded from 30 June 2016 after the hazardous chemical strontium chromate was detected in the aircraft; in the period immediately before the grounding No. 38 Squadron had been involved in flying politicians during the 2016 federal election. The King Airs began to return to service on 4 August that year after being cleaned. As part of its budget for the 2016-17 financial year, the Australian Government announced that Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare equipment would be acquired <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> No. 38 Squadron's King Airs. This equipment will comprise roll-on/roll-off kits, and will be delivered during the financial year.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994–95 season, Trapattoni's replacement, Marcello Lippi, {{wanted to}} create a more {{cohesive}} team, less dependent on Baggio, who was deployed as an outside forward in a 4–3–3 formation. Baggio was injured for most of the season, being ruled out for five months after sustaining a knee injury against Padova on 27 November 1994. After scoring from a free-kick, he was substituted by Alessandro Del Piero, who temporarily took his place in the team. Baggio returned to the starting line-up in the first leg of the Coppa Italia semi-final against Lazio in Rome on 8 March 1995, setting up Fabrizio Ravanelli's winner. On his first Serie A match back from injury, on 12 March 1995, Baggio scored Juventus' second goal in a 2–0 win over Foggia, and set up Ravanelli's goal. Due to his injury, Baggio only managed 17 Serie A appearances, but still contributed to the his first Scudetto with Juventus by contributing eight goals and eight assists. He provided assists <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the goals in the title-deciding match against Parma, which Juventus won 4–0 in Turin on 21 May 1995. He helped Juventus win the Coppa Italia that year, notching two goals and two assists, scoring the winning goal in the second leg of the semi-final. He helped lead Juventus to another UEFA Cup final by scoring four goals, including two goals and an assist over both legs of the semi-finals against Borussia Dortmund. Despite Baggio's strong performance, Juventus were defeated in the UEFA Cup final by Parma.|$|E
