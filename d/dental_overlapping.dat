40|$|The author {{traces the}} {{development}} of dento-maxillary disharmony (term used in French to designate the crowding of the teeth) {{since the beginning of}} our era in Western Europe and reviews the different hypotheses given to explain this phenomenon. It seems that <b>dental</b> <b>overlapping</b> is a real civilization disease, since it only appears with the western life style, as technology becomes more highly developed. Moreover, this is so not only in Europe, but throughout the world: crowding of the teeth sets in, in the human being, as soon as our civilization reaches him. How can we approach the causes of this phenomenon as objectively as possible? Since permanent teeth have only very slightly increased in volume since the latter Middle Ages, overlapping can only be due to a reduction in the maxillary bases holding them. Dento-maxillary disharmony is therefore none other than the clinical expression of a quantitative insufficiency maxillary-facial growth in the buccal sphere. This all happens as if 'something' were slowing down the normal development of maxillary structures or rather as if we currently lack one or several factors which favour the growth of the buccal cavity. Based on this premise, the author's deductions are as follows. The environmental factors alone can explain the rapidity of the appearance of this phenomenon in primitive man who is becoming civilized. These environmental influences can only be local since the buccal sphere seems to be the only one to undergo this type of atrophia. Factors which are both environmental and local can only be of a functional type. Among the functions carried out by the human cavity and its annexes, there are two which operate differently in primitive man or our ancestors, and in civilized man: mastication (since the dental wear almost no longer exists) and alimentary sucking which has almost disappeared from the life of the modern baby. However, the first clinical and radiographic signs of crowding are present during {{the first years of the}} life of a child (notably the non-existence of physiological diastemas separating the milk teeth), at the time when it could no longer fully carry out its masticating function. If we follow the author's reasoning, only one working hypothesis can be put forward: the disappearance of alimentary sucking of the modern child must constitute a primordial etiological factor in <b>dental</b> <b>overlapping.</b> There are evidently three steps to be taken. While there is still time, to study the quentitative and chronological differences which may exist in the maxillary-facial growth of the primitive child and the modern child. To emphasize the role of suckling and particularly the sucking of the breast in the growth of the buccal cavity. To determine by which process it carries out this function: it may be that the MOSS functional matrix theory will provide a great contribution. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dental {{cavities}} are a kind {{of disease}} that is increasing. The quantitative change has also produced qualitative changes concerning the type, extension and location of the lesions. Objective: To identify the selected risks of dental cavities among the students of a primary school. Methods: An analytic investigation of the controls and cases performed during academic course 2004 to 2005. The universe was constituted by 320 students where 204 were selected for this study. The cases were selected among the children who were affected by cavities (102) and the controls were selected by a simple randomized sample, i. e. a control one for each case (102). A consultation was carried out in the school to value the risks and the presence of the disease. Affectation due to cavities, malocclusion, and parodontopathies, age, sex, scholar degree, bad oral hygiene, previous experience of cavities in primary and permanent dentition, saliva viscosity, <b>dental</b> <b>overlapping,</b> orthodontic treatment, and sugar candies ingestions were the variables analyzed. Results: It was corroborated that the 49. 5 % of the cases were affected by cavities, 23 % by malocclusion, and parodontopathies were observed in the 2, 0 %. The 80. 3 % of the cases had a very bad oral hygiene, 50 % presented saliva viscosity and 95. 1 % of the cases used to ingest sugar candies. Conclusions: The association between the classic risks of dental cavities appearance such as bad oral hygiene, previous experience of cavities, saliva viscosity and sugar candies ingestion were shown in this study. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{fossiliferous}} late Early Pleistocene {{deposits of}} the Buia Basin (dated to c. 1. Ma) at the Danakil depression, contain three different suid species (. Kolpochoerus olduvaiensis, Kolpochoerus majus, and Metridiochoerus modestus). These suid taxa are morphologically evolved and {{are found in}} association with a diverse large vertebrate faunal assemblage, including the genus Homo and a rich accumulation of Acheulean tools. The anatomic, biometric, morphometric and dental microwear analyses, show significant data of dietary traits, habitat and evolutionary changes. In suids, despite their omnivorous diets, microwear study can {{play a significant role}} in understanding dietary habits. The results of our study show morphological distinction between the three suid species. Conversely, the microwear patterns recorded on the <b>dental</b> surfaces show <b>overlapping</b> of ecological niches among the species. We believe that their opportunistic feeding and rapid reproduction process might have sustained their survival within the mosaic environments of the Buia Basin in competition with other faunas (other ungulates, carnivores and monkeys) and hominins. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Studies {{of dental}} {{development}} have reported conflicting results regarding whether Neanderthal {{growth and development}} {{was similar to that}} of modern humans. The discovery of a partial permanent maxillary juvenile dentition (OR- 1) from the Obi-Rakhmat Grotto, Uzbekistan, provides the opportunity to assess dental development and age at death in a Paleolithic hominin with strong Neanderthal similarities using incremental dental features. Long-period lines on tooth crowns (perikymata) and roots (periradicular bands) were quantified, and crown formation, root development, and age at death were estimated. An anomalous upper molar was determined to be a left M 2 with a rare developmental condition (gemination). Perikymata numbers for OR- 1 were similar to modern southern African population means, but were less than modern northern European and Neanderthal means. Root extension rates were estimated to be similar to (or slightly higher than) modern human values, although few modern comparative data are available. Assuming the long-period line periodicity of this individual fell within a Neanderthal distribution (6 – 9 days), the maximum age at death of OR- 1 is estimated at 8. 1 years, but is {{more likely to have been}} 6. 7 – 7. 4 years (7 or 8 day periodicity). Modern European human developmental standards would suggest an age at death of approximately 8 – 9 years. These results are consistent with other studies suggesting that Neanderthal <b>dental</b> development <b>overlaps</b> with the low end of modern human populations, and demonstrates a greater range of variation in Middle Paleolithic hominins than previously reported. It is clear that perikymata number alone does not distinguish these taxa; data on long-period line periodicity and molar eruption would yield additional insight into Neanderthal life history.
