After completing workouts, which included weights and circuit training, she insisted on training for boxing. Later, boxing was made {{a part of her}} daily workout. She was trained by Kom's coaches to learn her distinct boxing style. Chopra explained that she did not have to act like a boxer, but had to become one and said [...] "To learn boxing was a religion.

500|$|Shaughnessy played {{basketball}} as a guard and ran {{track in the}} 440- and 880-yard events. The Minnesota athletic director asked him to join the basketball team before a game against Illinois, despite the fact he had never played and did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> He joined the track and field team in similar fashion, and replaced a half-mile runner {{even though he did}} not own and had never worn track spikes. In The Big Ten: A Century of Excellence, Shaughnessy was called [...] "one of the most versatile athletes in Minnesota's history." [...] Shaughnessy also competed as a rower with the St. Paul Boat Club. He {{was a member of the}} Sigma Chi fraternity.|$|E

[...] For the song's music video, the word [...] "nigger" [...] was replaced with the phrase [...] "black boys". The music video ends with a black musician implanting an electric guitar into the ground and setting it on fire. The final image is similar to that of a burning cross.|$|E

500|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{film critics}} have written favorably about the film. It has been {{hailed as a}} masterpiece by Kent Jones, Adolf Heinzlmeier, Berndt Schulz and Penelope Gilliatt, who said it was [...] "not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, not only a great work of humanism in a perfect rococo frame, but also an act of historical testimony." [...] Its themes have been analyzed by film scholar and Renoir's biographer Leo Braudy, who observed that the film [...] "embodies a social world {{in which there are}} rules but no values. If you don't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> you are crushed; but if you do <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> you are cut off from your own nature." [...] Dudley Andrew described the film's [...] "complex social criticism" [...] while Kenneth Browser and Peter Cowie wrote about its sense of humanity. Other critics have written about the film's darker themes; Andrew Sarris praised its depiction of class differences. The complexity of Renoir's storytelling techniques have been examined by Roger Ebert, who called it [...] "so simple and so labyrinthine, so guileless and so angry, so innocent and so dangerous, that you can't simply watch it, you have to absorb it", Luc Sante, who called it [...] "a dense clockwork mechanism" [...] and Robin Wood, who said the film [...] "operates on all levels." [...] Critics have praised its farcical elements: Pauline Kael called it [...] "a great satirical comedy, a dance of death" [...] and Gerald Mast wrote [...] " [...] depicts the failure of love, the failure of society, and the failure of men to rise above the ridiculous. Their only success is that they try and they care." [...] David Thomson praised Renoir's performance and remarked on [...] "Renoir's admission that the director, supposedly the authoritative and manipulating figure, is as much victim as originator of circumstances." [...] Amy Taubin said [...] "I can think of no other film that is as unfailingly generousto its audience, its characters, its actors, the milieu and the medium." [...] J. Hoberman wrote about its influence on Woody Allen, Robert Altman and Mike Leigh.|$|E
500|$|In an August 30, 2009 Detroit Free Press article, several {{current and}} former players on the 2008 and 2009 teams {{speaking}} anonymously said Michigan frequently violated the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) off-season 8-hour-per-week and in-season 20-hour-per-week practice limit. Rodriguez denied all of the allegations {{at a press conference}} the next day; [...] The New York Times quoted him as saying [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> and we follow the rules." [...] The University of Michigan Athletic Department's compliance office notified both the NCAA and the Big Ten Conference of its intentions to investigate itself. [...] Unlike the University of Michigan basketball scandal where all of the participants had left the school by the time the investigation completed and punishment was handed down, many of the athletes involved in this scandal are still students at the University of Michigan; failure to cooperate with the investigation might result in the NCAA revoking the athletes eligibility to participate in athletic competitions. In November, the university revealed its finding that the team failed to file the proper paperwork to document the team's training schedule.|$|E
500|$|VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote a memo on March 15, 2013 {{indicating}} that the VA was changing its performance measure for appointment wait times. The new goal involved measuring {{the number of days}} between a veteran's desired appointment date and the actual date of the appointment. A VA Office of the Medical Inspector report from December 2013 showed a dramatic change in March 2013 of the number of appointments booked within the 14-day window for the Ft. Collins, Colorado outpatient clinic. When investigators asked VA employees to explain [...] "what occurred in March 2013" [...] the employees said that [...] "they were instructed by Business office staff to access the appointment schedule, review it for capacity, inform the Veteran of schedule availability, and then enter the Desired Date as the patient appointment date" [...] and [...] "By entering the Desired Date as the appointment date, the wait time … appears to be zero days." [...] The Ft. Collins clinic is overseen by the Cheyenne, Wyoming, Veterans Affairs office. A coordinator at the Cheyenne office sent an email on June 19, 2013 with instructions on how to manipulate the appointment dates. The coordinator wrote, [...] "Yes, it is gaming the system a bit, but you have to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the game you are playing.” ...|$|E

500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with a smile to give her a little time.|$|E

In his analysis of the Persian poetry of Muhammad Iqbal, he states that [...] "we have a large number of non-Persian-speaking poets {{in the history of our}} literature, but I cannot point out any of them whose poetry possesses the qualities of Iqbal's Persian poetry. Iqbal was not acquainted with Persian idiom, as he spoke Urdu at home and talked to his friends in Urdu or English. He did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of Persian prose writing."

He writes scores, write the parts for {{everybody}} just as he wants them to sound. ... Wayne also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules.

2500|$|William Henry Wilkinson {{suggests}} that the first cards may have been actual paper currency which doubled as both the tools of gaming and the stakes being played for, similar to trading card games. Using paper money was inconvenient and risky so they were substituted by play money known as [...] "money cards". One of the earliest games in which we <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> is Madiao, a trick-taking game, which dates to the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Fifteenth century scholar Lu Rong described it is as being played with 38 [...] "money cards" [...] divided into four suits: 9 in coins, 9 in strings of coins (which may have been misinterpreted as sticks from crude drawings), 9 in myriads (of coins or of strings), and 11 in tens of myriads (a myriad is 10,000). The two latter suits had Water Margin characters instead of pips on them [...] with Chinese characters to mark their rank and suit. The suit of coins is in reverse order with 9 of coins being the lowest going up to 1 of coins as the high card.|$|E
