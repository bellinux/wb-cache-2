40|$|Introduction: Premenstrual syndrome(PMS) is a {{condition}} characterized {{by a number of}} behavioral, psychological and physical symptoms recurring cyclically during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The uncertainty in the pathogenesis of PMS has led to many treatments being suggested as possible therapies. This study was carried out to compare the effects of Echinophora-platyloba <b>and</b> <b>Fennel</b> extracts on the PMS. Methods: In this single, blind randomized clinical trial, ninety students with moderate to severe PMS were divided into three groups of thirty students, each. The first group received E. platyloba extract, the second received <b>Fennel</b> extracts <b>and</b> the third group received Placebo. The severity of PMS was detected by Daily Record Of severity of Problems(DRSP) questionnaire at the end of first and second month after the intervention and compared with the results before intervention. Data analysis was performed by SPSS, One-Way Anova, Dunn and Wilcoxan tests and P< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The Mean premenstrual syndrome scores were similar in three groups before the intervention [(100. 8 ± 22. 1 in Echinophora platyloba group, 101. 3 ± 33. 4 in <b>Fennel</b> group <b>and</b> 104. 3 ± 19. 5 in Placebo group), P= 0. 58) ], but {{there was a significant difference}} between them after the intervention and the effects of E. platyloba <b>and</b> <b>Fennel</b> extracts in reduction of symptoms was greater than the placebo[(49. 7 ± 23. 2 in E. platyloba group, 64. 43 ± 29. 3 in <b>Fennel</b> group <b>and</b> 79. 1 ± 28. 1 in Placebo group), P= 0. 009) ]. There was no significant difference between the effects of E. platyloba <b>and</b> <b>Fennel.</b> Conclusion: As E. platyloba <b>and</b> <b>Fennel</b> extracts reduce the symptoms of PMS significantly, their use is advisable in PMS patients...|$|R

25|$|Certain spices {{have been}} {{reported}} to counteract the production of intestinal gas, most notably the closely related cumin, coriander, caraway, <b>fennel</b> <b>and</b> others such as ajwain, turmeric, asafoetida (hing), epazote, and kombu kelp (a Japanese seaweed). Most starches, including potatoes, corn, noodles, and wheat, produce gas as they are broken down in the large intestine. Intestinal gas can be reduced by fermenting the beans, and making them less gas-inducing, or by cooking them in the liquor from a previous batch. Some legumes also stand up to prolonged cooking, which can help break down the oligosaccharides into simple sugars. On the other hand, fermented bean products such as miso are less likely to produce as much intestinal gas. Fermentative lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum reduce flatulence in human intestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|DOCG {{regulations}} {{stipulate that}} Barbaresco wines must be aged {{for a minimum}} of 2 years (at least 1 year in oak) prior to release and aged for at least 4 years to be considered a riserva. The wines must have a minimum 12.5% alcohol level though most wines are closer to 13.5%. Well-made examples of Barbaresco wines are expected to be aged at least 5 to 10 years after vintage before they are consumed, as they are extremely tannic and tight in their youth, and some continue to drink well even after 20 years. The typical style of a Barbaresco has bouquets of roses or violets with flavor notes of cherry, truffles, <b>fennel</b> <b>and</b> licorice. As the wine ages, it can develop smoky notes and more earthy and animal flavors like leather and tar.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Premenstrual {{syndrome}} (PMS) is {{a condition}} characterized {{by a number of}} behavioral, psychological and physical symptoms recurring cyclically during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The uncertainty in the pathogenesis of PMS has led to many treatment protocols being suggested as possible therapies. The present study was carried out to compare the effects of echinophora-platyloba <b>and</b> <b>fennel</b> extracts on the PMS against placebo in students of Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences in 2008. METHODS In this single-blind randomized clinical trial, 90 students with moderate to severe PMS enrolled in the study and were randomely divided into three equal groups. The first group received echinophora-platyloba extract, the second group received <b>fennel</b> extracts <b>and</b> the third group received placebo. The severity of PMS was measured by Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) questionnaire {{at the end of the}} first and second menstrual cycles before the intervention and the results were compared with them after the intervention. Data was analyzed using Dunn, Kruskal Wallis, and Pearson correlation tests by SPSS (v. 11. 5) and p 0. 05), but the differences were significant after the intervention (49. 7 ± 23. 2 in echinophora-platyloba group, 64. 4 ± 27. 5 in <b>fennel</b> group <b>and</b> 79. 1 ± 28. 1 in placebo group, respectively, p < 0. 001). No significant differences were seen between the echinophora-platyloba <b>and</b> <b>fennel</b> groups. CONCLUSION The echinophora-platyloba <b>and</b> <b>fennel</b> extracts could reduce the severity of PMS. The effects of echinophora-platyloba <b>and</b> <b>fennel</b> were similar <b>and</b> greater than the placebo. Administration of the extracts of these herbs is suggested for relieving the signs and symptoms of PMS...|$|R

In winter brent geese and wading birds such as sanderlings and turnstones may be seen; during the summer months the largest colony of sand martins in Kent nests in the soft cliffs, on top of which fulmars were also reported to have begun nesting in 2013, and wading curlews may be seen at any time. The grasslands on the cliff top are among the few remaining cliff-top wildflower meadows left in Kent, and are home to butterflies and skylarks. Also present are the nationally scarce hog's <b>fennel</b> <b>and</b> two species of digger wasp, Alysson lunicornis and Ectemnius ruficornis.
