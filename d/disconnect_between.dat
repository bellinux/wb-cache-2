25|$|While herbicide-use {{has been}} {{proposed}} as one factor causing the decline in overwintering numbers of eastern monarchs, {{it is not the}} only possibility. Another is that the monarchs are experiencing problems reaching Mexico. This idea has been embraced by a number of leading monarch researchers, largely because of recent evidence showing that the number of breeding (adult) monarchs has not declined in the last two decades, based on long-term citizen science data. The lack of long-term declines in the numbers of breeding, and migratory monarchs, yet the clear declines in overwintering numbers, implies there is a <b>disconnect</b> <b>between</b> these life stages, that must be growing. One expert has proposed that a large and growing threat to migrating monarchs is mortality from car strikes.|$|E

The A's swept the series 3–0 however, despite having to start {{on the road and}} losing second baseman Mark Ellis, who sustained a broken finger after getting hit by a pitch in the second game. Their victory was short-lived though, as the A's were swept 4–0 by the Detroit Tigers. Manager Ken Macha was fired by Billy Beane on October 16, four days after their loss in the 2006 American League Championship Series.

Section 3 provides a summary of nutrition-related policies and programmes, and Section 4 does the same for agriculture-related policies and programmes. An analysis of the main pathways and <b>disconnects</b> <b>between</b> agricultural growth and nutritional improvement is presented in Sections 5 and 6 and Section 7 concludes the paper and identifies areas for future research. 1. Nutrition Situation and Trends There {{are a number of}} sources of anthropometric data in Pakistan, and the National Nutrition Survey 2011 (NNS 2011) is widely regarded as being among the more authoritative nationally and provincially representative surveys. Besides anthropometric measures for children the NNS 2011 also collected data on adult women’s body mass index (BMI) and blood and urine samples for children and adult women to analyse micronutrient adequacy. Apart from its obvious value as a reliable source of information on the current situation, the NNS 2011 has the advantage of comparability with an earlier round of the same survey in 2001 (NNS 2001) ...|$|R

25|$|Renaud's {{observations}} {{regarding the}} apparent <b>disconnect</b> <b>between</b> French patterns of high saturated fat consumption and their {{low rates of}} cardiovascular disease can be quantified {{using data from the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In 2002, the average French person consumed 108grams per day of fat from animal sources, while the average American consumed only 72 grams. The French eat four times as much butter, 60 percent more cheese and nearly three times as much pork. Although the French consume only slightly more total fat (171 g/d vs 157 g/d), they consume much more saturated fat because Americans consume a much larger proportion of fat in the form of vegetable oil, with most of that being soybean oil. However, according to data from the British Heart Foundation, in 1999, rates of death from coronary heart disease among males aged 35–74 years were 115 per 100,000 people in the U.S. but only 83 per 100,000 in France.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{regulations}} frequently mandate {{the use of}} "best available" science, but {{ensuring that}} it is used in decisions around the use and protection of natural resources is often challenging. In the Western US, this relationship between science and management {{is at the forefront}} of post-fire land management decisions. Recent fires, post-fire threats (e. g. flooding, erosion), and the role of fire in ecosystem health combine to make post-fire management highly visible and often controversial. This paper uses post-fire management to present a framework for understanding why <b>disconnects</b> <b>between</b> science and management decisions may occur. We argue that attributes of agencies, such as their political or financial incentives, can limit how effectively science is incorporated into decision-making. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, the lack of synthesis or limited data in science can result in <b>disconnects</b> <b>between</b> science-based analysis of post-fire effects and agency policy and decisions. Disconnects also occur because of the interaction between the attributes of agencies and the attributes of science, such as their different spatial and temporal scales of interest. After offering examples of these disconnects in post-fire treatment, the paper concludes with recommendations to reduce disconnects by improving monitoring, increasing synthesis of scientific findings, and directing social-science research toward identifying and deepening understanding of these disconnects. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

Whether during the inversion experiment people really see an upside-down world as being normal, or whether they adapt to it only behaviorally, has been debated for a long time. Neuroimaging studies done a century after the original experiment have shown no difference in early levels of visual processing, which indicates the perceptual world stays inverted at that level of cognition.
