The investigation was conducted by comparing the 25 MPa, 27 MPa and 30 MPa average cube compressive strengths and the 30 MPa, 30 Mpa and 31 MPa average cube compressive strengths of 1 : 2 : 4, 1 : 1. 5 : 3 and 1 : 1 : 2 concretes produced with Portland-limestone cement grades 32. 5 and 42. 5 respectively with the minimum durability concrete strength requirements for building structural members in Eurocode 2 <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> that are obtainable in Nigeria. Investigation revealed that Portland-limestone cement grades 32. 5 is only suitable for the construction of superstructure members inside low humidity buildings (class XC 1) and is not suitable for the construction of buried building foundations and external building superstructure members. Portlandlimestone cement grade 42. 5 is only suitable for the construction of superstructure members in <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> XC 1 and XC 2 (building superstructure members subject to long-term water contact) and building foundations buried in non-aggressive natural soils and groundwater. Both cement grades 32. 5 and 42. 5 are not suitable for the construction of building external superstructure members sheltered from/exposed to rain and subject to high humidity (class XC 3) and/or cyclic wet and dry condition (class XC 4).

CUR committee VC 81 {{has developed a}} guideline for service life design based on initiation of corrosion due to chloride penetration for <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> XD or XS. A semi-probabilistic simplification of the DuraCrete methodology is introduced with a probability of failure of < 10 % for corrosion initiation.

The guideline permits optimisation with respect to cover depth and concrete composition. The required concrete performance is the chloride diffusion resistance, measured as Rapid Chloride Migration.

40|$|Background: High {{television}} {{exposure time}} at young age {{has been described}} as a potential risk factor for developing behavioral problems. However, less is known about the effects of preschool television on subsequent bullying involvement. We examined the association between television viewing time through ages 2 - 5 and bullying involvement in the first grades of elementary school. We hypothesized that high television exposure increases the risk of bullying involvement. Method. TV viewing time was assessed repeatedly in early childhood using parental report. To combine these repeated assessments we used latent <b>class</b> analysis. Four <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> were identified and labeled "low", "mid-low", "mid-high" and "high". Bullying involvement was assessed by teacher questionnaire (n = 3423, mean age 6. 8 years). Additionally, peer/self-report of bullying involvement was obtained using a peer nomination procedure (n = 1176, mean age 7. 6 years). We examined child risk of being a bully, victim or a bully-victim (compared to being uninvolved in bullying). Results: High television <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> was associated with elevated risks of bullying and victimization. Also, in both teacher- and child-reported data, children in the high television <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> were more likely to be a bully-victim (OR = 2. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 42 - 3. 13 and OR = 3. 68, 95 % CI: 1. 75 - 7. 74 respectively). However, all univariate effect estimates attenuated and were no longer statistically significant once adjusted for maternal and child covariates. Conclusions: The association between television viewing time through ages 2 - 5 and bullying involvement in early elementary school is confounded by maternal and child socio-demographic characteristics...|$|R

An algorithm-derived local connected fractal dimension (LCFD) frequency measure {{was used in}} this comparative analysis. Canonical variates (CVA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to evaluate the discrimination power of the method among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> (unexposed, Cd exposed, TBA exposed). Misclassification, sensitivity and specificity, both with original and cross-validated cases, were determined. LCFDs frequencies enhanced the differences among classes which were visually selected after their means, respective variances and the differences between Cd and TBA exposed means, with respect to unexposed mean, were analyzed by scatter plots. Selected frequencies were then scanned by means of LDA, stepwise analysis, and Mahalanobis distance to detect the most discriminative frequencies out of ten originally selected. Discrimination resulted in 91. 7 % of cross-validated cases correctly classified (22 out of 24 total cases), with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 95. 5 % (1 false negative with respect to 21 really positive cases) and 75 % (1 false positive with respect to 3 really negative cases). CVA with convex hull polygons ensured prompt, visually intuitive discrimination among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> and graphically supported the false positive case. The combined use of semithin sections, which enhanced the visual evaluation of the overall lamellar structure; of LCFD analysis, which objectively detected local variation in complexity, without the possible bias connected to human personnel; and of CVA/LDA, could be an objective, sensitive and specific approach to study fish gill lamellar pathology.

40|$|The {{reinforced}} steel corrosion {{which is the}} most important problem of reinforced concrete structures durability is generally stipulated for carbonization of concrete surrounding it. Concrete cover calculation at the design stage is predicated one because of the differences in manufacturing conditions and use of constructions. The applying of the probabilistic approaches to the carbonation process modeling allows to get predicated grade of the depth of carbonization of concrete and, thus, to settle minimum concrete cover thickness for a given projected service life of a construction. The procedures for concrete mix design for different strength classes of concrete are described in the article. Current recommendations on assignment of concrete strength class as well as concrete cover are presented. The European Standard EN 206 : 2013 defines the content requirements for the concrete structures operated in the <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 1, including the minimum values of water-cement ratio, minimum cement content, and minimum strength class of concrete. Since the standard does not include any basis or explanations of the requirements, we made an effort to develop a scientific justification for the mentioned requirements. We developed the probabilistic models for the process of carbonation of concrete based on the concrete mix which was designed using the software VTK-Korroziya. The reinforced concrete structures with concrete cover 20 – 35 mm operated in the most unfavorable conditions within the <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 1 were analyzed.

40|$|The {{combined}} use of guided quantitative expert {{analysis and}} of multivariate exploratory data analysis is reported as a robust, sensitive and sufficiently specific approach to study European sea bass gill secondary lamellar pathology after exposure to incremental doses of cadmium and terbuthylazine up to 48 h. The following elementary pathological findings were considered: “epithelial lifting”, “epithelial shrinkage”, “epithelial swelling”, “pillar cells coarctation”, “pillar cells detachment”, “channels fusion”, “chloride cells swelling”, and “chloride cells invasion”. The relative spatial extension was determined according to <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> and {{data were analyzed}} by means of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and canonical variates analysis (CVA). Histologically and ultrastructurally, cellular shrinkage/coarctation prevailed in cadmium exposed lamellae, whereas cellular swelling and epithelial lifting were predominant in terbuthylazine exposed lamellae compared to unexposed fish. Both CCA and CVA permit a good graphical data grouping according to <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> {{by means of the}} convex hull minimum polygons. This also reveals exposure dose and time gradients in CCA plot. Accordingly, epithelial swelling and epithelial shrinkage were comparatively associated to higher exposure time, whereas epithelial shrinkage and pillar cells coarctation were comparatively associated to higher exposure dose. LDA with only “epithelial shrinkage”, “epithelial swelling” and “pillar cells coarctation” in the model classified correctly 87. 5 % of the cross-validated cases.
