The method is applied for large excitation amplitudes and large quality factors for primary and secondary resonances of the first mode in case of hardening-type and softening-type behaviors. We show that the combined DQM–FDM technique improves convergence of the dynamic solutions. We identify primary, subharmonic, and superharmonic resonances of the microactuator.

40|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>microactuator</b> is a {{paradigm}} of MEMS. Cantilever and double clamped microbeams {{are often used}} in microswitches, microresonators and varactors. An efficient numerical prediction of their mechanical behaviour {{is affected by the}} nonlinearity of the electromechanical coupling.

To overcome the computational limits of the available numerical methods two new formulations are here proposed and compared. Modifying the classical beam element in the Finite Element Method to allow the implementation of a Non incremental sequential approach is firstly proposed. The so-called Discrete Geometric Approach (DGA), already successfully used in the numerical analysis of electromagnetic problems, is then applied. These two methods are here formulated, for the first time, in the case of strongly nonlinear electromechanical coupling. Numerical investigations are performed to find the pull-in of microbeam actuators experimentally tested. The non incremental approach is implemented by discretizing both the structure and the dielectric region by means of the FEM, then by meshing the electric domain by the Boundary Element Method (BEM).

40|$|Abstract—Electrostatic comb microactuators {{have had}} a fun-damental {{limitation}} in that the allowable travel range is limited to one-third of the total gap between comb fingers. Travel beyond this allowable range results in “pull-in ” instability, independent of mechanical design parameters such as stiffness and mass. This brief focuses {{on the development of}} an active control system that stabilizes the actuator and allows travel almost over the entire available gap between comb fingers. The challenges to be addressed include the nonlinear dynamics of the actuator and system parameters that vary with each fabricated device. A non-linear model inversion technique is used to address the nonlinear dynamics of the system. An adaptive controller is developed to provide improved position tracking in the presence of fabrication imperfections. The developed control system is then implemented on a special microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) <b>electrostatic</b> <b>microactuator</b> fabricated using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) on silicon-on- insulator (SOI) wafers. The use of DRIE allows the fabrication of a high aspect ratio device that can produce large electrostatic forces with low actuation voltages.

40|$|Energy-based {{modeling}} {{and control of}} dynamical systems is crucial since energy is a fundamental concept in Science and Engineering theory and practice. While Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-based Control (IDA-PBC) is a powerful theoretical tool to control port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) systems that arise from energy balancing principles, sensorless operation of energy harvesters is a promising practical solution for low-power energy generation. The thesis addresses these two problems of energy-based control and efficient energy generation. The design via IDA-PBC hinges on {{the solution of the}} so-called matching equation which is the stumbling block in making this method widely applicable. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a constructive approach for IDA-PBC for PCH systems that circumvents the solution of the matching equation is presented. A new notion of solution for the matching equation, called algebraic solution, is introduced. This notion is instrumental for the construction of an energy function defined on an extended state-space. This yields, differently from the classical solution, a dynamic state-feedback that stabilizes a desired equilibrium point. In addition, conditions that preserve the PCH structure in the extended closed-loop system have been provided. The theory is validated on four examples: a two-dimensional nonlinear system, a magnetic levitated ball, an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>microactuator</b> and a third order food-chain system. For these systems damping structures that cannot be imposed with the standard approach are assigned. In the second part of the thesis, the design of a nonlinear observer and of an energy-based controller for sensorless operation of a rotational energy harvester is presented. A mathematical model of the harvester with its power electronic interface is developed. This model is used to design an observer that estimates the mechanical quantities from the measured electrical quantities. The gains of the observer depend on the solution of a modified Riccati equation. The estimated mechanical quantities are used in a feedback control law that sustains energy generation across a range of source rotation speeds. The proposed observer-controller scheme is assessed through simulations and experiments. Open Acces...|$|E

A technique that allows for a higher resolution is atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this technique the topography of a surface is mapped by measuring the force acting on an extremely sharp tip when it is scanned over a surface of interest. In this thesis the functionalization of AFM probes is explored, which gives exciting additional possibilities next to imaging. Regarding actuation, the integration of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>microactuator</b> in the probe was investigated, motivated by the drive towards high-speed (video-rate) AFM. To make the integration more straightforward, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) compatible fabrication process for the fabrication of in-plane tips was developed and tested. With this process, sharp silicon nitride tips (best measured radius 8 nm) can be batch fabricated on monocrystalline silicon cantilevers with arbitrary shapes. Electrochemical sensing functionality in AFM was obtained by filling a fountain pen probe with mercury, resulting in an in-situ renewable mercury microelectrode. Both dropping mercury electrode and hanging mercury droplet configurations were obtained, depending on the pressure applied on the mercury. Chronoamperometric measurements and cyclic and square-wave voltammograms were obtained with the potential of microscale spatial resolution. Liquid deposition in AFM was studied by using nanofountain pen probes with various tip shapes. Arrays of spots were deposited in contact mode by spotting and writing lines which subsequently break up into droplets. Contactless deposition was achieved by using electrohydrodynamic deposition.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} characterization {{and implementation of}} the first microfabrication process to incorporate high aspect ratio compliant polymer structures in-plane with traditional silicon microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This discussion begins with in situ mechanical characterization of microscale polymer springs using silicon-on-insulator-MEMS (SOI-MEMS). The analysis compares microscale samples that were tested on-chip with macroscale samples tested using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. The results describe the effect of the processing steps on the polymer during fabrication and help to guide the design of mechanisms using polymers. Characterization of the dielectric breakdown of polymer thin films with thicknesses from 2 to 14 μm between silicon electrodes was also performed. The results demonstrate that there is a strong dependence of the breakdown field on both the electrode gap and shape. The breakdown fields ranged from 250 V/μm to 635 V/μm, depending on the electrode geometry and gap, approaching 10 x the breakdown fields for air gaps of the same size. These materials were then used to create compliant all-polymer thermal and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>microactuators.</b> All-polymer thermal actuators demonstrated displacements as large at 100 μm and forces as high as 55 μN. A 1 mm long electrostatic dielectric elastomer actuator demonstrated a tip displacement as high as 350 μm at 1. 1 kV with a electrical power consumption of 11 μW. The actuators are fabricated with elastomeric materials, so they are very robust and can undergo large strains in both tension and bending and still operate once released. Finally, the compliant polymer and silicon actuators were combined in an actuated bio-inspired system. Small insects and other animals use a multitude of materials to realize specific functions, including locomotion. By incorporating compliant elastomer structures in-plane with traditional silicon actuators, compact energy storage systems based on elastomer springs for small jumping robots were demonstrated.

While MEMS technology enables significant reduction in physical size of various types of sensors, actuators and systems by several orders of magnitude, does not necessarily imply less system complexity.

40|$|Polymethyl {{methacrylate}} (PMMA) {{has been}} proposed as a material for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to initiate the research on environmentally friendly micro-nano machining technology using polymer materials. A polymer MEMS process has been developed using hot embossing and precision machining. MEMS structures less than 2 孠were successfully embossed. The PMMA layer that remained after hot embossing was removed by a polishing process to release the movable parts. A PMMA <b>electrostatic</b> comb-drive <b>microactuator</b> was fabricated. Both finger width and gap between fingers were 5 孬 and thickness was larger than 70 孮 An operated displacement of 11 孠at a drive voltage of 100 V was obtained. It was 20 times larger {{than that of a}}n identical silicon device. A torsional micro mirror device driving with vertical comb actuator was fabricated. The size of the mirror was 1 ױmm 2. The maximum tilt angle of 5. 6 was obtained with driving voltage of 100 V and frequency up to 100 Hz. A chevron-shaped PMMA thermal actuator with a thickness of about 50 孠has been fabricated and tested successfully. The displacement was about 5 times larger than that of a Si counterpart at the same power consumption. Full Tex...|$|R
30|$|Lastly, {{the lens}} {{scanning}} {{can also be}} employed for endomicroscopic applications. Paired lenses on a millimeter scale are mounted on electromagnetic [21] or <b>electrostatic</b> [13, 23] <b>microactuators,</b> and they serve as scanning lenses for two dimensional laser scanning. Including commercial glass lenses, a plano-convex polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microlenses [21] or gradient-index (GRIN) lenses [13] {{can serve as a}} scanning lens. Siu et al. have demonstrated a magnetically actuated MEMS microlens scanner by employing external magnetic field for actuation (Fig.  3 g) [21]. The microlens scanner features a plano-convex PDMS microlens and a ferromagnetic nickel platform with a pair of suspension springs. All the components except the PDMS microlens are made of electroplated nickel and thus an external magnetic field induce a magnetic moment to rotate the nickel platform with a periodic focal scanning trajectory. The scanning angle shows 23 ° under an external magnetic flux density of 22.2  ×  10 − 3 Tesla. An electrostatic MEMS lens scanner has also been demonstrated by Park [13, 24]. The lens scanner has two aspheric glass lenses on orthogonally resonating electrostatic MEMS microstages for Lissajous scanning pattern (Fig.  3 h). The scanner has the lateral angle of ± 4.6 ° at 277  Hz and the vertical angle of ± 4.2 ° at 204  Hz as the lens mass provides high-Q motions at low operating voltages of 5  Vpp DC and 10  Vpp AC.|$|R
40|$|Several authors [1, 2] {{have given}} overviews of {{microelectromechanical}} systems, including microactuators. In our presentation we will review {{some of these}} results, and provide {{a brief description of}} the basic principles of operation, fabrication, and application, of a few selected <b>microactuators</b> (<b>electrostatic</b> and surface tension driven). We present a description of a three-level mechanical polysilicon surface-micromachining technology with a discussion of the advantages of this level of process complexity. This technology is capable of forming complex, batch-fabricated, interconnected, and interactive, microactuated micromechanisms which include optical elements. The inclusion of a third deposited layer of mechanical polysilicon greatly extends the degree of complexity available for micromechanism design. Two examples of microactuators fabricated using this process are provided to illustrate the capabilities and usefulness of the technology. The first actuator is an example of a novel actuation mechanism based on the effect of surface tension at these micro-scale dimensions and of a microstructure within a microstructure. The second is a comb-drive-based microengine which has direct application as a drive and power source for micro optical elements, specifically, micro mirrors and micro shutters. This design [3] converts linear oscillatory motion from electrostatic comb drive actuators into rotational motion via a direct linkage connection. The microengine provides output in the form of a continuously rotating output gear that is capable of delivering drive torque to a micromechanism...|$|R
