40|$|International audienceIn India, {{particularly}} in semi-arid regions, groundwater levels are declining at alarming rates due to over-exploitation and the sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources is in deep crisis. There {{is little or}} no information on groundwater sustainability indicators, which can signal towards the challenges in water management. In this study we downscaled an entire watershed into three zones based on the different hydrodynamic behaviour recorded at the borewell scale. A process-based simple, multi-parameter linear auto-regressive model was developed to predict groundwater levels, which uses recharge, groundwater withdrawal and irrigation return flow as input variables. A comprehensive and predictive long-term <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> is used as a state indicator to evaluate the sustainability and management challenges in the watershed. Two groundwater withdrawal scenarios were designed {{to assess the impact of}} groundwater withdrawal on the <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance.</b> We found that geological heterogeneities play a crucial role in controlling groundwater fluctuations. The storage change in two different groundwater withdrawal scenarios shows gradually declining groundwater storage in both scenarios.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Springs are {{outcrops}} of aquifers surface, and {{the water}} cycle in this environment pass through the recharge, generally defined {{as the amount of}} water added to the aquifer, which may occur locally from rainwater infiltration. This study uses the Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) method to estimate the direct recharge and a <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> to estimate the deep recharge on unconfined aquifers. The WTF method employs data of the aquifer water levels and its specific yield to estimate the direct recharge. The <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> considers the direct recharge estimated by the WTF method, as the water input in the system and outputs as the base flow and deep recharge. The recharge was estimated at four areas at the watershed of Alto Rio Grande city, Minas Gerais (MG) state, in Brazil.

40|$|Summary The {{increasing}} salinity of {{land and}} water resources in the coastal areas of Saurashtra {{is a matter of}} grave concern for the Government in Gujarat. Salinization of groundwater causes socio-economic and environmental problems. Although already recognized by the Recharge Committee and the High-level Committees I and II in the early 1970 s, still much work has to be done. However, the Salinity Ingress Prevention and Control along with some NGOs have constructed artificial recharge structures to arrest the salinity ingress. A joint effort by Deltares, IGRAC, Arcadis and the Ambuja Cement Foundation made it possible to perform a study for the salinity ingress problem. This study has got the objective to investigate the effectiveness of these artificial recharge structures to control the salinity ingress in the Kodinar region by developing a density driven groundwater solute transport model. Furthermore a qualitative analysis was carried out to investigate the salinization in the entire coastal area of Saurashtra by use of a simple <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> approach. The model predicts for the reference scenario (stagnant situation) that the coastal region becomes fresher due to a positive <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> {{based on the fact that}} only average years in terms of precipitation were used. As a consequence the seawater front does not seem to be moving towards inland although the model constraint that the cell dimensions are not adequate could also cause this. Incorporating dry years into the model could show other results and would level out the positive <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> to zero. There is also up-coning in the upper areas where basalt is present. A low permeability combined with drainage cause this. Although the model results are not satisfactory for the reference case, the comparison between the various scenarios was very useful. It can be concluded that the use of artificial recharge structures along with drip irrigation are beneficial. The future outlook that the region becomes drier, the sea level rises and the fact that there is an increase in population have got strong negative implications for the salinity ingress problem. Assessment of the qualitative analysis of the coastal area of Saurashtra does not lead to valid conclusions as there was no correlation between the <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> and the fraction saline area. This was caused by the fact that river fluxes could not be determined. However, the region of Kodinar and Talaja are gravely affected by salinity although the amount of storage of artificial recharge structures is very high. There is a lot of agricultural activity in these areas perhaps due to these artificial recharge structures. Probably in dry years the level of agricultural activity is maintained. This leads to a strong negative impact on the <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance.</b> It may therefore be concluded that the additional groundwater obtained from artificial recharge structures could act as a perverse incentive to use this water for additional agricultural activity making these areas very sensitive to salinization whenever a dry year occurs. In order to obtain reliable model results it is recommended that TDS-concentration and water table measurements should be measured in observation wells and more frequent to obtain an idea how the groundwater system works. More pump tests should be conducted to obtain more accurate hydraulic parameters of the soil. Additionally infiltration measurements and water heights of the river should be taken in order to determine a more reliable flux from checkdams, rivers and percolation tanks. It is recommended that water saving techniques like drip irrigation should be developed. Also additional artificial recharge structures are needed to control the salinity ingress problem. But most importantly, But most importantly, installation of a groundwater management approach program is recommended by integrating the various stakeholders, experts and the government into an organization which is responsible for the VII salinity ingress problem and the availability of fresh groundwater as a sustainable natural resource. Only by doing this the salinity ingress problem can be controlled efficiently...|$|E

40|$|In the {{northern}} Apennines of Italy, springs are quite widespread over the slopes. Due to the outcropping of low-permeability geologic units, {{they are generally}} characterized by low-yield capacities and high discharge variability during the hydrologic year. In addition, low-flow periods (discharge lower than 1 Ls - 1) reflect rainfall and snowmelt distribution and generally occur in summer seasons. These features strongly condition the management for water-supply purposes, making it particularly complex. The "Mulino delle Vene" springs (420 m a. s. l., Reggio Emilia Province, Italy) {{are one of the}} largest in the Apennines for mean annual discharge and dynamic storage and are considered as the main water resource in the area. They flow out from several joints and fractures at the bottom of an arenite rock mass outcrop in the vicinity of the Tresinaro River. To date, these springs have not yet been exploited, as the knowledge about the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer and their hydrological behaviour is not fully achieved. This study aims to describe the recharge processes and to define the hydrogeological boundaries of the aquifer.

40|$|The Kali–Hindon inter-stream region extends over {{an area of}} 395 km 2 {{within the}} Ganga–Yamuna interfluve. It is a fertile tract for {{sugarcane}} cultivation. Groundwater is a primary resource for irri-gation and industrial purposes. In recent years, over-exploitation has resulted in an adverse impact on the groundwater regime. In this study, an attempt {{has been made to}} calculate a water bal-ance for the Kali–Hindon inter-stream region. Various inflows and outflows to and from the aquifer have been calculated. The recharge due to rainfall and other recharge parameters such as horizon-tal inflow, irrigation return flow and canal seepage were also evaluated. Groundwater withdrawals, evaporation from the water table, discharge from the aquifer to rivers and horizontal subsurface outflows were also estimated. The results show that total recharge into the system is 148. 72 million cubic metres (Mcum), whereas the total discharge is 161. 06 Mcum, leaving a deficit balance of − 12. 34 Mcum. Similarly, the <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> was evaluated for the successive four years. The result shows that the <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> is highly sensitive to variation in rainfall followed by draft through pumpage. The depths to water level are shallow in the canal-irrigated northern part of the basin and deeper in the southern part. The pre-monsoon and post-monsoon water levels range from 4. 6 to 17. 7 m below ground level (bgl) and from 3. 5 to 16. 5 m bgl respectively.

40|$|Effective {{management}} of limited water {{resources in the}} North China Plain requires reliable calculation of historical <b>groundwater</b> <b>balances</b> at local, sub-watershed scales. These calculations typically are hindered by poorly constrained recharge estimates. Using a simple soil-water balance model, we independently calculated annual recharge from irrigated cropland to unconfined alluvial aquifers underlying Luancheng County, Hebei Province, {{in the western part}} of the North China Plain, for 1949 – 2000. Model inputs include basic soil characteristics and daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, irrigation, crop root depth, and leaf-area index; model outputs include daily actual evapotranspiration and areal groundwater recharge. Results indicate that areal recharge is not a constant fraction of precipitation plus irrigation, as previously assumed, but rather the fraction increases as the water inputs increase. Thus, model-calculated recharge rates range from 5 to 109 cm year 1, depending on the quantity of precipitation and irrigation applied. The important implication is that, because this drainage recharges the underlying aquifer, improving irrigation efficiency by reducing seepage does not save water. This explains why successful efforts to reduce groundwater pumping for irrigation have had no effect on water-table declines. So long as crop cover is extensive and all crop-water requirements are met—which has been the case in Luancheng County since the 1960 s—groundwater levels will continue to decline at a steady rate.

This technique has gained international acceptance.

Although irrigation from the groundwater could ensure the food security of the area, different water management scenarios showed that the ground water table will be declining as a result. Recharge and water table calculations show that irrigation increases the recharge to the water table {{but at the same time}} reduces the overall water table depth due to pumping. Water table depth will not be depleted if irrigation follows the CWR of vegetables. Calculations for future water table levels indicate that, if the current irrigation rate is extended across all of the irrigable land in the area, the water table level will fall by 2 m per year.

Water resources, namely, groundwater is one of the commodities that need to be developed further to fuel the future economic growth in the area. Therefore, the Department of Groundwater Resources which is the key authorized department for groundwater resources management in Thailand is currently investigating the hydrogeology and groundwater resources of the aquifers in the Mae Sai aquifers system. Using first results of this field investigation, this article aims to numerically determine the <b>groundwater</b> <b>balance</b> in the Mae Sai aquifers. The Mae Sai aquifer is conceptualized as a multi-layer aquifer and groundwater flow is simulated by a fully 3 D finite difference model.

In 2013, LAMO has been applied {{as a tool to}} implement in Latvia aims laid down by the European Union Water Framework Directive for sustainable use of water resources. The set of hydrogeological maps was prepared for updating of the water management plans for the river basin districts of Gauja, Daugava, Lielupe and Venta. For aquifers, distributions of groundwater heads and infiltration flows were mapped. In the maps of heads, directions of groundwater flows and contacts of aquifers with rivers were shown. By joining information, carried by the distributions for heads and infiltration flows, the special maps were created where isolines of heads and areas of groundwater discharge, recharge and transit were shown. Numerous geological profiles were provided. The profile represents the geological stratigraphy, isolines of groundwater head and directions of groundwater flows. <b>Groundwater</b> flow <b>balances</b> were obtained for the whole Latvia and for the river basin districts...|$|R
