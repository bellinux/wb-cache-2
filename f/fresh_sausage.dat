50|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> {{are simply}} {{seasoned}} ground meats that are cooked before serving. <b>Fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> normally {{do not use}} cure (Prague powder #1) although cure can be used if desired. In addition <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> typically do not use smoke flavors, although liquid smoke can be used. <b>Fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> are never smoked in a cold smoker because {{of the danger of}} botulism.|$|R

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{identifying}} microbial contamination in the scalding asepsis and cooling processes {{as well as in}} <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> obtained. Salmonella was identified in two scald water samples but was absent in the water from chiller and in the final product, which might be explained in terms of chlorine addition and temperature reduction. The analysis revealed that MPN of Escherichia coli was in the range of < 1 - 11 /mL in the scald water and < 1 - 64 /mL in the chiller. Aeromonas sp. count showed 5 to 3. 5 x 10 ¹ CFU/mL in the scald water and 9 to 3. 7 x 10 ² CFU/mL in the chiller, probably due to the psycrophile characteristics of Aeromonas and evisceration process. The analysis of <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> chicken revealed a sharp increase in the Aeromonas count (2. 5 x 10 ³ CFU/g). Results showed the need of including Aeromonas analyzes in microbiological tests of foods...|$|R
30|$|The {{amount of}} fluids {{released}} during chewing {{of meat and}} meat products {{is an important factor}} in their organoleptic evaluation. The juiciness is reported to be directly related to the quantum of intra muscular fat (Marbling) and moisture content. Refrigerated storage of duck meat sausages for 14  days significantly (P <  0.01) decreased mean juiciness scores compared to <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages,</b> which is evident due to the loss of moisture during storage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> may be red or white. Red {{sausages}} contain paprika (pimentón in Spanish) and {{are usually}} fried; they can also contain other spices such as garlic, pepper or thyme. The most popular type of red sausage is perhaps txistorra, a thin and long paprika sausage originating in Navarre. White sausages do not contain paprika and can be fried, boiled in wine, or, more rarely, in water.|$|E
5000|$|A British <b>fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> {{typically}} contains around 10% butcher's rusk, 10% water, 2.5% seasoning, and 77.5% meat.

As meat can be fatty or lean, the X% is calculated using reference tables with the intention to give a fairer representation of the [...] "visual lean" [...] meat content.|$|E
50|$|In Brazil {{there is}} {{a version of the}} blood sausage called chouriço or morcela (sometimes the Castillian Spanish version morcilla is used as well) , {{consisting}} of a <b>fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> made of the blood and fat from pork and usually rice. It is a variation of the Portuguese blood sausage, and it is known for its deep dark color. In some regions, it is popular on barbecues (Churrascos) as a starter.|$|E
40|$|The {{shelf-life}} of <b>fresh</b> Italian pork <b>sausages</b> {{packed in}} modified atmosphere was studied. Samples were packed using {{different levels of}} oxygen (high and low) with different levels of carbon dioxide (high-low) in the atmospheres headspace and were stored at 4 °C for 9 days. Microbial, physiochemical and sensory parameters were analyzed during storage. A consumer test was performed to determine the critical acceptability levels. Sensory data were mathematically modelled to estimate product shelf life. A first-order kinetic model and a Weibull-type model aptly described, respectively, the changes in <b>fresh</b> pork <b>sausage</b> odor and color over storage time. These models {{may be used to}} predict the sensory shelf life of <b>fresh</b> pork <b>sausage.</b> Results showed that 20 % O 2 and 70 % CO 2 extend <b>fresh</b> pork <b>sausage</b> shelf life to 9 days at 4 °C. The microbial quality of the samples at the critical sensory level of acceptability was within the range of microbial acceptability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of a concentrated fermented dextrose (FD), a natural antimicrobial product, combined with low dose γ-irradiation (1. 5 kGy) on the microbiological quality of <b>fresh</b> pork <b>sausages.</b> <b>Fresh</b> pork <b>sausages</b> containing the FD (0. 25 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 75 %) were prepared in a meat pilot plant and were irradiated using a UC- 15 A irradiator equipped with a 60 Cobalt source. The γ-irradiation treatment alone was able to reduce the initial psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria by more than 2 log CFU/g and kept the lactobacillus population under the detection limit (100 CFU/g). Results also showed that the FD alone was able to extend the shelf life of the sausages from 5 days up to 13 days. At day 13, the FD or irradiation alone showed 2 log CFU/g less mesophilic bacteria than the control. After combining FD and irradiation another reduction of the microbial count of 1 log CFU/g was observed. When combining the irradiation treatment with the FD results it showed a reduced growth rate of the psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria compared to both treatments alone. This study demonstrated that FD with low dose gamma irradiation act in synergy to reduce the multiplication of the total bacterial flora in <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages...</b>|$|R
50|$|In Spain, <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages,</b> salchichas, {{which are}} eaten cooked, and cured sausages, embutidos, which are eaten uncooked, are two {{distinct}} categories. Among the cured sausages are found products like chorizo, salchichón, and sobrasada. Blood sausage, morcilla, {{is found in}} both cured and fresh varieties. They are made with pork meat and blood, usually adding rice, garlic, paprika and other spices. There are many regional variations, and in general they are either fried or cooked in cocidos.|$|R
5000|$|Cajun boudin is a <b>fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> {{made with}} green onions, pork, pork liver (making it {{somewhat}} gritty/grainy), and rice. Pig's blood was sometimes added to produce boudin rouge, but this tradition became increasingly rare after {{the mid-twentieth century}} due to {{the decline of the}} boucherie (traditional communal butchering) and government health regulations prohibiting the transportation of raw blood. As a result, Cajun boudin is now usually made without blood; however, blood or [...] "black" [...] boudin can still be purchased.|$|E
50|$|Siskonmakkara is a mild, Finnish <b>fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> made of pork, cooked before serving. The meat is {{soft and}} smooth-textured and usually {{squeezed}} from its casing when cooking. The most common dish using this sausage is siskonmakkara soup (siskonmakkarakeitto) {{in which they are}} cooked in, and simultaneously flavours, the soup stock. The sausage can also be used for a stroganoff or macaroni casserole in place of mince meat. It does not keep well and should be used on the day it is bought.|$|E
5000|$|Inline {{grinding}} systems: In {{the meat}} processing industry, grinding systems {{are used for}} grinding meat and {{are to be found}} ahead of the filling process in the product preparation phase. With inline grinding systems, a grinding system is integrated into the vacuum filler’s filling flow as an auxiliary device. The filling and grinding process steps can therefore be combined in a single machine. This means that the filling product is moved by the vacuum filler and, during filling, it is chopped to the final grain size within the grinding system. An important application for inline grinding systems is dry sausage or <b>fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> production.|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus spp. ecology in <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> {{stored at}} 4 °C {{for a period}} of 10 days was investigated. Microbiological {{analyses}} to assess the quality and safety of the products studied were carried out, and strains on MSA agar were isolated. A total of 85 strains were identified, by traditional methods, as Staphylococcus spp. and a PCR-DGGE method, together with a S. xylosus-specific PCR, were used to determine the species of the strains isolated. Almost 50 % of them were recognized as S. xylosus, but strains of S. pasteuri, S. warneri, S. equorum and S. succinus, were also found. Interesting population dynamics were observed, characterized by a succession of S. pasteuri and S. warneri at 0 day, with S. xylosus at 3 days and S. equorum at 6 and 10 days. Molecular characterization of S. xylosus strains and cluster analysis highlighted the presence of six main populations in the <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> studied. However, the clusters were formed by strains isolated at different days of storage, implying a homogeneous distribution of the six subpopulations throughout the period in the products followed. © 2004 Elsevier B.
