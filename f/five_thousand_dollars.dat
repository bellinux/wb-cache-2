5|$|By early 1957, Fisher {{had lost}} {{patience}} with Häyhänen {{and demanded that}} Moscow recall his deputy. In January 1957, Häyhänen received a message from Moscow promoting him to Lieutenant Colonel and granting him leave in the Soviet Union. Upon hearing he was due to return to Moscow, Häyhänen was fearful {{that he would be}} severely disciplined or even executed. Häyhänen fabricated stories to justify his delay, claiming to Fisher that the FBI had taken him off the RMS Queen Mary. Fisher, unsuspecting, advised Häyhänen to leave the U.S. immediately to avoid FBI surveillance and handed him two hundred dollars for travel expenses. Prior to his departure, Häyhänen returned to Bear Mountain Park and retrieved the buried <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> for his own use. Häyhänen arrived in Paris on May Day, having sailed from the U.S. aboard La Liberté. Making contact with the KGB residency he received another two hundred dollars for his journey to Moscow. Four days later, instead of continuing his journey to the Soviet Union he entered the American embassy in Paris, announcing that he was a KGB officer and asking for asylum.|$|E

25|$|To {{accomplish}} the latter end and consolidate its bishop's authority, the new diocese needed a dedicated cathedral. There were also broader social reasons. Irish Catholic immigration {{had led to}} a nativist backlash, {{in the form of}} the Know-Nothing Party, and McCloskey knew that a cathedral in Albany would be an assertion of the immigrants' place in their new country. At the first retreat he presided over, McCloskey persuaded the assembled priests to pledge over <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> as the seed of a building fund.|$|E

The Cherokee became the sole nation of the Five Civilized Tribes to abolish slavery during the war. But despite {{the actions of the}} National Council, few slaves were freed. Those Cherokee loyal to the Confederacy held more slaves than did pro-Union Cherokee. Despite agreeing to end slavery, pro-Union Cherokee did not provide for civil and social equality for Freedmen in the Cherokee Nation.|$|E

25|$|The greatest, {{according}} to Townsend, was the 1840 case involving {{the will of}} a man named James Rogers. In the will, Rogers expressed that he had already provided assets from his estate amounting to <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> {{to the children of}} his first marriage and that upon his death, his estate was to be divided among his second wife and her children. A team of Menefee, future governor James F. Robinson, and Madison C. Johnson represented the five children from the first marriage, who filed suit to set aside the will on the grounds that their father had suffered a stroke and was not of sound mind when constructing the will. They argued opposite Henry Clay and Robert C. Wickliffe. The case lasted six days, and the decision in the case went against Menefee and Robinson.|$|E

The game was never released as the dealer had lost interest. According to Salvo, the development of Skeet Shoot took him around a month at night in his home to finish. After his friend sent him an advertisement from a Dallas newspaper by newly founded studio Games by Apollo that asked for programmers, he contacted Apollo founder Pat Roper and showed him Skeet Shoot.

500|$|The {{sequence}} wherein Mulder runs {{was shot}} on a motorcycle. Manners recalled that, because Duchovny {{had been able}} to outrun two horses in the fourth season episode [...] "Tunguska", he needed something faster to film the scene with. Several locations that were scouted for the episode proved difficult to use. Two churches that had been selected for the episode pulled out just before filming began and replacements had to be found immediately. The scenes in the woods were filmed at Griffith Park in Los Angeles. The location was chosen because it possessed [...] "probably the only pine trees in Los Angeles". Due {{to the fact that the}} actual park is rather sparsely populated by brush, the foliage was all created by the crew of the series. Manners shot several of the forest scenes with a 200 millimeter lens, so that the lights of Los Angeles would be disguised in the distance. Padgett's furnace was filmed on a set called the red/blue room. It had originally been created for the sixth seasoner opener [...] "The Beginning". The jail set was constructed in a large warehouse by a different production company. The X-Files rented the space for several days for filming, for <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars.</b> Finding a graveyard with [...] "old-fashioned vertical tombstones" [...] proved a challenge for locations manager Ilt Jones. Eventually one was found in Altadena, California, east of Los Angeles. The fog in the cemetery was created by burying small [...] "misters" [...] that produced water vapor. The vapor was cold so that it would stay low to the group and emulate the properties of actual fog.|$|E

2500|$|... in 1999, Bright {{received}} a tip about a bluegrass act who was performing {{at a bar}} called [...] "The Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar" [...] in Nashville's Printer's Alley. The group consisted of Gary Vernon (stage name [...] "Gary LeVox"), Joe Don Rooney and Jay DeMarcus. After hearing them perform, Bright was impressed by their vocal blend and invited {{them to come to}} his office where they sang for him a cappella. [...] Bright signed them to a recording, publishing, and management contract, and promptly took them into the studio to record three songs. At that time the band did not have a name; so, during a performance they asked their bar patrons to suggest one. A man came up at their intermission and suggested [...] "Rascal Flatts", saying that he once had a band by that name in high school. They liked the name, and bought the rights to it on the spot for <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> using funds from their signing bonus. The agreement was written on a napkin. Bright auditioned the group for executives of Disney's Lyric Street Records who agreed on a recording contract, but Bright retained total creative control. It was a risky proposition at first, because all of the band's salaries, expenses, equipment, and pre-existing tour obligations had to be paid by Bright and his new company. [...] Bright's employees took the band members to the gym regularly to get them in better physical shape. Bright worked incredible hours and told his wife, [...] "If this flops, we'll have to sell the house". [...] The band, Rascal Flatts, became an enormous success, their first seven albums were all certified platinum or higher in record sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of 2009, [...] they had sold 18.6 million albums.

2500|$|The Orthodox Churches of Greece and Cyprus {{have also}} been {{a great source of}} {{humanitarian}} aid to the Serbs.

Archbishop Chrysostomos praised the close relations between the Churches of Serbia and Cyprus, remarking that the presence of Patriarch Pavle was proof of the unity and brotherhood between the two Churches. Patriarch Pavle compared the situations that Greeks in Cyprus face to those that Serbs face, saying that both Cyprus and Serbia were struggling for their freedom. He also reaffirmed Serbian support to the Greeks of Cyprus. During his official visit to Serbia in September 2001, Archbishop Christodoulos announced that the Church of Greece would be donating 150 million drachmas for the mission of the Serbian Orthodox Church and another 100 million drachmas for the construction of the church of Saint Savvas. In an address at Belgrade's Cathedral, Archbishop Christodoulos referred to the help which the Greeks had offered to the Serbs. For all of his activities and assistance to the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Serbian people, Patriarch Pavle conferred the medal of Saint Sava of the First Order to Archbishop Christodoulos. [...] At the ceremony Patriarch Pavle was quoted as saying that, [...] "The Greek Church has always sympathised with the troubles we have been in, rendering us support as well as aid in medicines and food". Likewise, Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica awarded Archbishop Christodoulos the highest medal of the Yugoslav Federation for the help of the Greek Church towards the Serbian people during the last decade.

[...] In 2004, Hellenic College and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology (HC/HC) raised over <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> to assist in the rebuilding of the Orthodox Seminary of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Kosovo after the seminary was burnt by Albanians. [...] During the first days of Holy Week, the Rev. Protopresbyter Nicholas Triantafilou, President of HC/HC, announced that offerings collected during the week would be designated for this cause as well as coordinating relief efforts. [...] It is also worth noting that, following the catastrophic fire at Chilandar Monastery in Mount Athos, the Greek authorities coordinated the collection of donations and the rebuilding effort. [...] Most of the expected cost, estimated at over 30 million euros, will be provided by Greece.
