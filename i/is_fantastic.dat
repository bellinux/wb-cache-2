Jason Callina of Herald News gave the trailer a positive response, saying, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>fantastic</b> to see characters that I grew up with in the flesh...we still {{have to wait till}} the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for now they have my interest". Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer for the amount of characters that will appear in the film. Child wrote, [...] "overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of us will be chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map".|$|E

Famitsu editor Ranbu Yoshida said that [...] "it feels like a very different game from its predecessor" [...] and that [...] "it's easy to lose yourself in changing and redoing areas you've previously finished." [...] Assistant editor Norihiro Fujiwara added that [...] "the setting and presentation <b>is</b> <b>fantastic,</b> and the issues people brought up with the first game—its linearity, its lack of meaty gameplay—are {{a thing of the}} past. You're sucked into the game right from the beginning, and the story's very easy to get into." [...] The game won the [...] "Future Division" [...] award at the 2011 Japan Game Awards and later won an [...] "Award of Excellence" [...] at the 2012 Japan Game Awards.|$|E
500|$|Irving {{was dismayed}} by the storyline which saw Meyer shot in a road rage incident, {{describing}} filming the scenes as an [...] "unpleasant experiences", the worst aspect being that Meyer loses his spleen {{as a result of}} his injuries. Of the later storyline which sees Meyer investigated by Tom Campbell-Gore on behalf of the hospital Board, Denis Lawson explained: [...] " [...] actually rather fancies Meyer's job but if he finds against him in the investigation he cannot get the job because it's a conflict of interest. So he has to play a rather clever game, which he does." [...] On taking over as head of the cardiothoracic surgery department, he commented: [...] "George <b>is</b> <b>fantastic</b> in the show, but obviously I'm going to do something very, very different, so I don't feel that I'm stepping into his shoes." ...|$|E

500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without doubt I think he’s the best man for the job right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year and we moved forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground <b>is</b> <b>fantastic,</b> the club just keeps moving forward. All the facilities keep improving and I hope that I can come back and make another positive difference". In his first game back in charge of the club, Stevenage secured a 1–0 victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April. Stevenage ended the 2012–13 campaign in 18th-place, and Westley released four players and transfer-listed three others.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of its centenary about 20 per cent of the LSO's members were women. Some musicians, {{including}} Davis, judged that this improved the orchestra's playing as well as its behaviour. Others, including Previn and the veteran principal trumpet Maurice Murphy, felt that although the technical standard of playing had improved, the diminution of the orchestra's machismo was a matter for regret. Comparing the LSO of 2004 with the orchestra of the 1960s and 1970s, Murphy said, [...] "Now the strings have improved so much, the playing <b>is</b> <b>fantastic,</b> but it has lost something of its gung-ho quality." [...] The orchestra of the 1960s had a reputation for tormenting conductors it disliked; even such notorious martinets as George Szell were given a hard time. By the 21st century the orchestra had long abandoned such aggression; civilities were maintained even with conductors whom the orchestra took against: they were simply never re-engaged.|$|E

[...] He said that he found it exciting and weird to work with the EastEnders cast, but they made him feel comfortable. However, he admitted to feeling nervous about having to dance in front of professional dance group Flawless in the series finale, saying that learning to dance was [...] "very, very, very stressful." [...] The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved.

500|$|Wright scored his 179th {{goal for}} Arsenal against Bolton Wanderers {{and broke the}} club goalscoring record in a 4–1 win at Highbury. Manager Arsène Wenger praised the striker's achievement, adding [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>fantastic</b> for the timing of his movement. It is so {{intelligent}} when he has not got the ball." [...] Arsenal faced Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 21 September 1997; at 2–2, a late goal by left back Nigel Winterburn from 25 yards ended the home team's resistance, who went down to ten men after Frank Leboeuf was sent off. September ended with a third consecutive win, against West Ham United. Goals from Bergkamp, Wright and Overmars helped Arsenal move {{to the top of}} the league table, one point above champions Manchester United. October began with a 5–0 win at home to promoted Barnsley, but two goalless draws – first at Crystal Palace and then to Aston Villa meant Manchester United moved a point ahead of Arsenal.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Murphy {{achieved}} mainstream success when he {{was cast}} in the leading role in Danny Boyle's horror film [...] 28 Days Later.

Casting director of the film Gail Stevens suggested that Boyle audition Murphy [...] for the role, having been impressed with his performance in Disco Pigs. [...] Stevens stated {{that it was only}} after seeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude {{at the beginning of the}} film. She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera, but enthused that he had a [...] "dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that <b>is</b> <b>fantastic</b> for the film". His performance, which Richard Cosgrove considers to be [...] "extremely convincing", [...] earned him nominations for Best Newcomer at the 8th Empire Awards and Breakthrough Male Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards. [...] Released in the UK in late 2002, by the following July 28 Days Later had become a sleeper hit in America and a major success worldwide, putting Murphy before a mass audience for the first time.

500|$|... "Suede and America fuelled {{my desire}} to prove to {{everyone}} that Blur were worth it", Albarn told Mojo in 2000, [...] "There was nothing more important in my life." [...] Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity, not everybody was convinced with Albarn's new British-centric manifesto. Food Records owner David Balfe, in particular, strongly disagreed, and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur's image. After the still-sceptical Balfe finally relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead {{to work on their}} second album with Albarn's first choice of producer, Andy Partridge of XTC. Blur and Partridge began work at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart. However, the pairing didn't work out. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a [...] "disaster"; he added that [...] "as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn't ... sexy". Partridge said in 1999 of the sessions: [...] "I felt quite fatherly and I thought I did sterling work. They got Dave ‘Twat’ Balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was rolling around going, ‘This <b>is</b> <b>fantastic,</b> you're George Martin and they're The Beatles.’ Next day he'd say, ‘Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.’" [...] The band successfully recorded four songs, but they were wary about working in the same conditions again.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>fantastic,</b> but of course, Auschwitz <b>is</b> <b>fantastic,</b> too". Browning {{testified that the}} Madagascar Plan was not [...] "Hitler's pipe dream" [...] as Irving claimed, and that [...] "I would not call it a pipe dream, because I think, if England had surrendered, they {{would have tried to}} do it. They would have tried to implement it just as they tried to implement the Lublin reservation plan [...] and just as they tried and succeeded in implementing the death camp plans." ...|$|E
