40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there is a difference in delayed healing following dental extractions for Type 2 diabetics on oral <b>hypoglycaemics</b> and non-diabetic patients. METHODS: Prospective patients referred for dental extractions were recruited into two groups: known diabetics and non-diabetics with no conditions associated with poor healing. All had a random blood glucose level (BGL). Extractions were performed using local anaesthesia. Delayed healing cases were identified and statistical evaluation performed to identify risk factors. RESULTS: There were 224 Type 2 diabetics on oral <b>hypoglycaemics</b> (BGL 7. 51, range 4. 1 – 17. 4) and 232 non-diabetics. The diabetic group were older, more males and less smokers than the control group. Twenty-eight patients, 12 (5 %) diabetic and 16 (7 %) control group, had socket healing delayed for more than one week but all healed in four weeks. There were no statistical differences between delayed healing and age, gender, diabetic state, BGL or smoking. The younger control group had more healing problems. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional view that diabetics have increased delayed healing was not supported. Type 2 diabetics on oral <b>hypoglycaemics</b> should be treated the same as non-diabetic patients for extractions. S. Huang, H. Dang, W. Huynh, P. J. Sambrook and A. N. Gos...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To assess {{achievement}} of management targets among participants with diagnosed diabetes. METHODS: Participants in the North West Adelaide Health Study (n= 4060), a representative cohort aged 18 + years, were assessed at baseline in 2000 - 03 and follow-up in 2004 - 06. Diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes were determined from fasting plasma glucose (> or = 7. 0 mmol/L) and self-reported data. RESULTS: Baseline prevalences were 5. 6 % (95 % CI 4. 9 - 6. 3) diagnosed and 1. 0 % (95 % CI 0. 7 - 1. 4) undiagnosed diabetes. Annual incidences were 5. 1 per 1000 diagnosed and 1. 7 per 1000 undiagnosed diabetes. Among those with long-term diagnosed diabetes, 45. 8 % had HbA 1 c or = 1. 0 mmol/L, and 45. 6 % had LDL< 2. 5 mmol/L.

METHODS: We investigated the possible association between low HDL-C levels, defined as < or = 10 th gender specific percentile, and circulating markers of inflammation (IL- 1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 18, and CRP) in a population of 1044 community dwelling older Italian subjects from the InChianti study. RESULTS: Using logistic regression analysis we demonstrated that IL- 6 levels (III versus I tertile, OR: 2. 10; 1. 10 - 3. 75), TG (III versus I tertile OR: 27. 45; 8. 47 - 88. 93), fasting insulin (III versus I tertile OR: 2. 84; 1. 50 - 5. 42), and age (OR: 1. 038; 1. 002 - 1. 075) were associated with low HDL-C independent of smoking, BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes, physical activity, alcohol intake, oral <b>hypoglycaemics,</b> CRP, IL- 18, and TNF-alpha levels.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAfter acute necrotizing {{pancreatitis}} (ANP), a pancreatic fistula {{may occur}} from disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS) where {{a segment of}} the pancreas is no longer in continuity with the main pancreatic duct. AimTo study the outcome of patients treated using Roux-Y pancreatic fistula tract-jejunostomy for DPDS after ANP. MethodsBetween 2002 and 2011, patients treated for DPDS in the setting of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopanreatography (MRCP) documented main pancreatic duct disruption with Roux-Y pancreatic fistula tract-jejunostomy. ResultsIn all, seven patients with DPDS were treated. The median age was 62 years (range 49 – 78) and five were men. The cause of ANP was gallstones (2), alcohol (1), ERCP (1) and idiopathic (3). Pancreatic necrosectomy was done in six patients. Time from onset of pancreatitis to fistula drainage was 270 days (164 – 365). Pancreatic fistulae arose from DPDS in the head/neck (4) and body/tail (3). Patients had a median fistula output of 140 ml (100 – 200) per day before surgery. The median operative time was 142 min (75 – 367) and estimated blood loss was 150 ml (25 to 500). Patients began an oral diet on post-operative day 4 (3 – 6) and were hospitalized for a median of 7 days (5 – 12). The median follow-up was 264 days (29 – 740).

40|$|Introduction: In the {{clinical}} practice classification of diabetes type in adult patients is often difficult. In non-obese adults distinguishing between Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in the Adult and {{type 2 diabetes}} leads to introduction of different treatment strategies. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess relationship between introduction of insulin therapy at the diagnosis and occurrence of chronic microangiopathic complications of diabetes in non-obese patients aged above 35 years. Material and methods: The group of 71 non-obese patients (BMI < 30 kg/m 2) with diabetes diagnosed after the age of 35 was estimated. At diagnosis 24 patients were treated with insulin (group A) and 47 patients with oral <b>hypoglycaemics</b> (group B). Results: No significant differences in presence of microangiopathic complications were noted between the groups after 6 years of duration of diabetes. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, risk factors for the development of any type of diabetic microangiopathy were: longer duration of diabetes (RR 1. 12, 95 %CI: 1. 00 - 1. 27, p= 0. 04), higher HbA 1 c value (RR 2. 00, 95 %CI: 1. 21 - 3. 31), and higher BMI (RR 1. 25, 95 %CI: 0. 99 - 0. 25, p= 0. 048). Moreover the risk factors for microangiopathy were: CRP concentration (RR 1. 36, 95 %CI: 1. 03 - 1. 80, p= 0. 025) and smoking status (RR 4. 37, 95 %CI: 1. 33 - 14. 44, p= 0. 013). Conclusions: Initial insulin therapy in non-obese patients with diabetes diagnosed above the age of 35, after 6 years of duration of diabetes, does not decrease significantly the risk of micro and macroangiopathic complications. Main risk factors for development of microangiopathic complications are: longer duration of diabetes, worse metabolic control of diabetes, higher body mass index, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level and smoking...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A sound {{knowledge}} of pathophysiology {{of a disease}} and clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (CPT) of a drug is required for safe and rational prescribing. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to assess how adequately the undergraduate CPT teaching had prepared interns in Nigeria for safe and rational prescribing and retrospectively, to know how they wanted the undergraduate curriculum to be modified so as to improve appropriate prescribing. The effect of internship training on the prescribing ability of the interns was also sought. Methods A total of 100 interns were randomly selected from the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja; Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idiaraba; General Hospital Lagos (GHL); the EKO Hospital, Ikeja; and Havana Specialist Hospital, Surulere. A structured questionnaire was the instrument of study. The questionnaire sought information about the demographics of the interns, their undergraduate CPT teaching, experience of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug interactions since starting work, confidence in drug usage and, in retrospect; any perceived deficiencies in their undergraduate CPT teaching. Results The response rate was 81 %. All the respondents graduated from universities in Nigeria. The ability of the interns to prescribe rationally (66, 81. 4 %) and safely (47, 58 %) was provided by undergraduate CPT teaching. Forty two (51. 8 %) respondents had problems with prescription writing. The interns would likely prescribe antibiotics (71, 87. 6 %), nonsteroidal analgesics (66, 81. 4 %), diuretics (55, 67. 9 %), sedatives (52, 62. 9 %), and insulin and oral <b>hypoglycaemics</b> (43, 53 %) with confidence and unsupervised. The higher the numbers of clinical rotations done, the more confident were the respondents to prescribe unsupervised (χ 2 = 19. 98, P 2 = 11. 57, P 2 = 11. 25, P Conclusion Undergraduate CPT teaching in Nigeria appears to be deficient.

40|$|Background: gestational {{diabetes}} (GDM) affects 3 % to 6 % of all pregnancies. Women {{are often}} intensively managed with increased obstetric monitoring, dietary regulation, and insulin. However, {{there has been}} no sound evidence base to support intensive treatment. The key issue for clinicians and consumers is whether treatment of GDM improves perinatal outcome. Objectives: to compare the effect of alternative treatment policies for GDM on both maternal and infant outcomes. Search methods: we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2009) and bibliographies of relevant papers. We updated this search on 1 July 2011 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria: randomised controlled trials comparing alternative management strategies for women with GDM and impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy. Data collection and analysis: two authors {{and a member of the}} Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's editorial team extracted and checked data independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with the third author. Main results: eight randomised controlled trials (1418 women) were included. Caesarean section rate was not significantly different when comparing any specific treatment with routine antenatal care (ANC) including data from five trials with 1255 participants (risk ratio (RR) 0. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 80 to 1. 12). However, when comparing oral <b>hypoglycaemics</b> with insulin as treatment for GDM, there was a significant reduction (RR 0. 46, 95 % CI 0. 27 to 0. 77, two trials, 90 participants). There was a reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia with intensive treatment (including dietary advice and insulin) compared to routine ANC (RR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 48 to 0. 88, one trial, 1000 participants). More women had their labours induced when given specific treatment compared to routine ANC (RR 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 13 to 1. 57, two trials, 1068 participants). The composite outcome of perinatal morbidity (death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture and nerve palsy) was significantly reduced for those receiving intensive treatment for mild GDM compared to routine ANC (RR 0. 32, 95 % CI 0. 14 to 0. 73, one trial, 1030 infants). There was a reduction in the proportion of infants weighing more than 4000 grams (RR 0. 46, 95 % CI 0. 34 to 0. 63, one trial, 1030 infants) and the proportion of infants weighing greater than the 90 th birth centile (RR 0. 55, 95 % CI 0. 30 to 0. 99, three trials, 223 infants) of mothers receiving specific treatment for GDM compared to routine ANC. However, there was no statistically significant difference in this proportion between infants of mothers receiving oral drugs compared to insulin as treatment for GDM. Authors' conclusions: specific treatment including dietary advice and insulin for mild GDM reduces the risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity. However, it is associated with higher risk of labour induction. More research is needed to assess the impact of different types of intensive treatment, including oral drugs and insulin, on individual short- and long-term infant outcome...|$|R

40|$|Background An {{estimated}} 50 % {{of patients}} {{do not take}} their medicines as prescribed, which is decision intentional for an estimated 30 % of these patients(1). Reasons for this intentional non-adherence are numerous and include a desire to reduce inconvenient effects, to avoid adverse effects, or a fear of medication dependence. For the remaining 70 % of non-adherent patients, their behaviour is dominated by unintentional factors such as confusion and memory failure. (1) Medication Organisation Devices (MODs) {{are an integral part}} of standard care to support patients suspected of being unintentionally non-adherent. Accurate data for the prevalence of their use are unavailable, however, conservative estimates indicate that in 2001 at least 100, 000 people were using MODs in the UK; with an aging population, this number will have substantially increased over the past 13 years. (2) MODs are usually a box or blister pack divided into days of the week with several compartments per day to allow for different dose timings. However, there is no definitive evidence for the effect(s) of MODs on adherence. The UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme therefore funded a pilot randomised controlled study. Objectives Provide an indication of the effect(s) of MODs and generate data to inform a full trial of their effectiveness and cost effectiveness. Methods Patients were randomised to receive their usual prescribed medication either in standard packaging or a MOD. Patients were eligible if community dwelling, aged 75 years or more, self-medicating at least three different solid orally administered medicines and identified as non-adherent through a pill count three weeks after provision of a new medication supply. This was likely unintentional non-adherence based on self-report questionnaire data. Post-randomisation, adherence for two months was measured by pill count. Findings Post ethical approval from NHS East of England, 29 community dwelling patients were recruited. Three participants subsequently withdrew and one was excluded due to level of visual impairment being unsafe for standard care medication packaging. Of the remaining 25 participants, 12 received standard medication packaging and 13 received their medication in a MOD. Five (38 %) participants receiving a MOD experienced an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE). No AEs or SAEs were reported for the control group. The table below summarises the (S) AEs recorded. The median (IQR) increase in adherence was 11 % (0, 45) for MOD participants experiencing an (S) AE compared with 5 % (0, 17) for standard packaging participants. An adherence increase exceeding 40 % was measured for 35 % (95 % CI 21 %) of the medicines prescribed for participants experiencing an AE compared with 13 % (95 % CI 10 %) for those with no reported AE. Discussion The small sample size precludes determination of any definitive causal link between MODs and AEs. The relationship is, however, plausible; all of the participants described in the table were prescribed at least one medicine which may contribute to a fall and the increase in adherence for MOD participants was greater than for the control. The use of MODs appears to have resulted in a greater proportion of the prescribed medicine being administered and thereby increasing risk of iatrogenic events. (5) The findings of this study are in agreement with previous studies designed to promote adherence which have reported increased mortality and healthcare costs for participants receiving the intervention. (6, 7) It is intuitive that increasing adherence to a medication may result in a dose related AE. It may therefore be prudent to review the prescribed dose of any medication with a high risk of dose related AEs (e. g. antihypertensives, <b>hypoglycaemics,</b> anticoagulants, and anticonvulsants) before introduction of an adherence intervention, and to monitor after its introduction to ensure treatment is optimised...|$|R
