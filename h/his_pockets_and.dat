5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, he bowled 422 overs {{for his new}} county, conceding just 516 {{runs and}} {{capturing}} 41 wickets. The following year, at Trent Bridge (when {{it was so cold}} that KS Ranjitsinhji kept his hands in <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.|$|E
25|$|Much {{controversy}} surrounded Selig and {{his involvement}} in Bonds' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig {{and the possibility that}} he and Henry Aaron would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the San Diego Padres, sitting in Padres owner John Moores' private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep his hands in <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> have a look of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the San Francisco Giants' game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run against the Washington Nationals; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.|$|E
60|$|Merton also rose; {{the fifty}} pounds were in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> (<b>and</b> <b>his</b> I O U in <b>his</b> friend's <b>pocket),</b> <b>and</b> {{there was nothing}} more to detain him.|$|R

2500|$|A {{young woman}} in a miniskirt jumps onto a bus. The bus starts abruptly, and she falls onto the lap of a seated priest. Surprised, she looks down and exclaims, [...] "Wow!" [...] / [...] "It's not a 'wow!', my daughter", says the priest, [...] "it {{is the key to the}} Cathedral of Christ the Saviour!" [...] Later, when the priest reaches the cathedral, he fishes through <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> exclaims, [...] "Oh dear! I left the key at home." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the fair, Pawnee Bill’s Wild West Show {{brokered}} {{an agreement}} with the government to have Geronimo join the show, again under Army guard. The Indians in Pawnee Bill’s show were depicted as “lying, thieving, treacherous, murderous” monsters who had killed hundreds of men, women and children and would think nothing of taking a scalp from any member of the audience, given the chance. [...] Visitors came to see how the “savage” had been “tamed,” and they paid Geronimo to take a button from the coat of the vicious Apache “chief.” (Geronimo was not a chief.) The shows put a good deal of money in <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> allowed him to travel, though never without government guards.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot {{announces that}} Gustave is not Drouet but Marrascaud. It was [...] "Robert" [...] who was Drouet; Marrascaud killed {{him and took}} his place. We learn that during his first night in the hotel, Poirot did not drink his coffee, as he {{suspected}} it was drugged, and actually witnessed Gustave entering his room, rifling <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> finding the note from Lementeuil. The three card players were members of Marrascaud's gang but never attacked their leader; the carve-up of Marrascaud's face {{was carried out by}} Dr Lutz, who is a plastic surgeon and not a psychiatrist as he has pretended to be. This is the real reason the rendezvous took place in such an isolated spot.|$|E

2500|$|Vaudreuil and Montcalm were {{minimally}} resupplied in 1758, as the British {{blockade of}} the French coastline limited French shipping. The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes {{to supply the}} colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them {{to stay away from}} trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle; yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing [...] "bad medicine" [...] as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years after}} first seeing There Will Be Blood, I am {{convinced}} that Paul Thomas Anderson's profound portrait of an American primitive—take that, Citizen Kane—deserves pride of place among the decade's finest. Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven {{in the form of}} a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to [...] "drink the milkshake" [...] of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than Boogie Nights and Magnolia—his rebel cries from the 1990s—Blood let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on Blood, I'll quote Plainview: [...] "It was one goddamn hell of a show." ...|$|E
