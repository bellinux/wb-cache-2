5|$|The {{probable}} {{leader of}} the group was George Gardstein, whose real name was {{likely to have been}} Poloski or Poolka; he used the aliases Garstin, Poloski, Poolka, Morountzeff, Mourimitz, Maurivitz, Milowitz, Morintz, Morin and Levi. Gardstein, who probably was an anarchist, had been accused of murder and acts of terrorism in Warsaw in 1905 before his arrival in London. Another member of the group, Jacob (or Yakov) Peters, had been an agitator in Russia while in the army and later as a dockyard worker. He had served a term in prison for his activities and had been tortured by the removal of <b>his</b> <b>fingernails.</b> Yourka Dubof was another Russian agitator who had fled to England after being flogged by Cossacks. Fritz Svaars was a Latvian who had been arrested by the Russian authorities three times for terrorist offences, but escaped each time. He had travelled through the United States, where he undertook a series of robberies, before arriving in London in June 1910.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning <b>his</b> <b>fingernails</b> with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
5000|$|Just as {{he appears}} to be [...] "breaking", the real Number Six mentally overcomes his {{brainwashing}} when he discovers a bruise on <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> that he got when Number Twenty-four tried to get his picture a bruise that, furthermore, has migrated from the base of <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> to midway, confirming that days or weeks have passed, not the single day shown on his calendar. He then gives himself an electric shock to reverse the therapy. He also physically overcomes the impostor, who reveals his name as Curtis. After being forced to reveal his password and remove the fake mole from his wrist, Curtis escapes and is then mistakenly killed by Rover.|$|R

When Raven tries {{to shut the door}} on him, Trigon sticks <b>his</b> huge <b>fingernail</b> in the door's way and gives Raven a stuffed bunny. Raven uses her powers to chop off <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> so the door will close and then uses her powers to tear the stuffed bunny to pieces.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, Fred Slack, a dentist, broke <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> at work, {{and created}} an {{artificial}} nail as a realistic-looking temporary replacement.

25|$|The writer's life allowed Maugham {{to travel}} and to live {{in places such as}} Spain and Capri for the next decade, but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of Liza. This changed in 1907 with the success of his play Lady Frederick. By the next year, he had four plays running {{simultaneously}} in London, and Punch published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting <b>his</b> <b>fingernails</b> nervously as he looked at the billboards.|$|E
25|$|An {{elaborate}} fourteen-day {{period of}} mourning followed the cremation, {{during which the}} family performed various symbolic acts around the pyre and were regarded to be highly polluted in ritual terms, thus necessitating not only that they took regular baths but also that any other Nair who might touch them must also take a bath. The period {{was followed by a}} feast and by participation in sports events, which also involved Nairs from nearby villages. Subsequently, the family stayed in mourning while one male member undertook a diksha, during which time he had to maintain a pure life. This involved him living with a Brahmin, bathing twice daily and desisting from cutting either his hair or <b>his</b> <b>fingernails,</b> as well as being prevented from speaking with or indeed even seeing women. In some cases the diksha might last for a year rather than the more usual forty-one days, in which case there would be considerable celebration at its end.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, back at Miley's {{house in}} Malibu, her brother Jackson, Oliver Oken and Rico Suave open a package {{addressed}} to Robby which {{turns out to}} be a bounce house. Ignoring Robby, they open the box and the bounce house automatically inflates itself, getting the boys stuck to the window for quite some time, but Rico eventually deflates it with <b>his</b> <b>fingernail.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{the next}} instant he had looked up sharply, with a sudden {{peculiar}} shrug, {{and a kind of}} cry, like the first thin cry of an awakened child, in his mind. Without a moment's hesitation he climbed swiftly upstairs again to the big sepulchral bedroom. He pressed with <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> the tiny spring in the looking-glass. The empty drawer flew open. There were finger-marks still in the dust.|$|R
25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew <b>his</b> <b>fingernails</b> out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E
25|$|Following the IRA {{killing of}} a Royal Irish Constabulary {{sergeant}} outside Bandon church in July 1920, Percival captured Tom Hales, commander of the IRA's West Cork Brigade, and Patrick Harte, the brigade's quartermaster, {{for which he was}} appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Both prisoners later claimed to have been repeatedly beaten and tortured while in custody. Hales alleged that a pair of pliers had been used on his lower body and to extract <b>his</b> <b>fingernails.</b> Harte suffered brain injury and died in a mental hospital in 1925. The claims of torture were denied by Percival and his colleagues, Hales being unable to produce any visible wounds beyond missing teeth and Harte's head injury being officially recorded as the result of being rifle-butted upon arrest. Ormonde Winter, the head of British Intelligence in Dublin Castle, later named Hales as an informer who had invented the story as an excuse for providing the names of his fellow IRA members in return for a lesser sentence.|$|E
500|$|Traumatized, Arkham donned his mother's {{wedding dress}} and razor, vowing to bind the evil spirit of [...] "The Bat" [...] with sorcery. He treated Hawkins for months before finally killing him {{by means of}} {{electrocution}} during a shock therapy session. Arkham continued his mission even after he was incarcerated in his own asylum; using <b>his</b> <b>fingernails,</b> he scratched {{the words of a}} binding spell all over his cell until his death.|$|E
50|$|Rolen {{suffered}} a non-displaced fracture {{of his right}} middle finger during fielding drills at spring training. <b>His</b> <b>fingernail</b> was also torn off. As a result, Rolen missed {{the beginning of the}} regular season, having surgery to insert a screw in his broken finger. Marco Scutaro was the Jays' third baseman in Rolen's place. On April 25, 2008, Rolen was activated from the 15-day disabled list. Two days later, against the Kansas City Royals, he hit his first home run as a Blue Jay.|$|R
500|$|Phát {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "political Catholic", a term for those who practiced or converted to the religion to curry favor with Diệm, who made most military and political appointments and promotions on the basis of religion. Phát's habit of customarily being seen in public with a swagger stick and his reputation for autocratic leadership alienated most of his subordinate officers. He grew <b>his</b> pinky <b>fingernail</b> to great length, a practice observed by mandarins during Vietnam's imperial era to denote their status. Some observers claimed that the mandarin style of <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> spread to <b>his</b> general behavior, decrying him as [...] "haughty" [...] and [...] "hawklike". U.S. military advisors regarded Phát as [...] "mediocre". As a colonel, he served as the commander of 2nd Division, located in central Vietnam from 8 June 1961 until 18 June 1963, when he was replaced by Colonel Trương Văn Chương.|$|R
5000|$|He {{taught at}} the St. Petersburg Conservatory from 1878, his pupils {{including}} Sergei Prokofiev, Nikolai Myaskovsky, Mikhail Gnesin, Lazare Saminsky and Boris Asafyev. [...] Consistent with his character, he was a variable but at times brilliant instructor. Conductor Nikolai Malko, who studied harmony {{with him at the}} conservatory, wrote, [...] "Lyadov's critical comments were always precise, clear, understandable, constructive, and brief.... And it was done indolently, without haste, sometimes seemingly disdainfully. He could suddenly stop in midword, take out a small scissors from his pocket and start doing something with <b>his</b> <b>fingernail,</b> while we all waited." ...|$|R
500|$|Hippocratic {{medicine}} was notable for its strict professionalism, discipline, and rigorous practice. The Hippocratic work On the Physician recommends that physicians always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and serious. The Hippocratic physician paid {{careful attention to}} all aspects of his practice: he followed detailed specifications for, [...] "lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting" [...] in the ancient operating room. He even kept <b>his</b> <b>fingernails</b> to a precise length.|$|E
500|$|Hindley's {{father had}} {{served with the}} Parachute Regiment and had been {{stationed}} in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the Second World War. He had been known in the army as a [...] "hard man" [...] and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he {{taught her how to}} fight, and insisted that she [...] "stick up for herself". When Hindley was 8, a local boy approached her in the street and scratched both of her cheeks with <b>his</b> <b>fingernails,</b> drawing blood. She burst into tears and ran into her parents' house, to be met by her father, who demanded that she [...] "Go and punch him , because if you don't I'll leather you!" [...] Hindley found the boy and succeeded in knocking him down with a sequence of punches, as her father had taught her. As she wrote later, [...] "at eight years old I'd scored my first victory".|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, the Supreme Court {{revisited}} {{questions about}} the constitutionality of involuntary bodily intrusions in several key cases. In 1973, the Court ruled in Cupp v. Murphy {{that the police were}} permitted to extract a tissue sample from underneath a suspect’s fingernails to recover [...] "evanescent" [...] physical evidence. The suspect in Cupp was suspected of strangling his wife and voluntarily went to a police station to answer questions. Officers noticed bloodstains under the suspect’s fingernails and detained him, but did not place him under arrest. Against the suspect’s wishes, the police scraped out a tissue sample from under <b>his</b> <b>fingernails</b> to retrieve the evidence. The biological material found under the suspect’s fingernails was later found to have come from the victim. Citing Schmerber, the Court held that this warrantless search was justified under the exigent circumstances exemption of the Fourth Amendment because the search was necessary to preserve the “highly evanescent evidence” under the defendant’s fingernails.|$|E
50|$|Marv vs. Kevin - The Hard Goodbye (Despite Marv's brute {{strength}} and durability, Kevin gets the drop {{on him and}} disarms/blinds him with <b>his</b> sharp <b>fingernails</b> before knocking him out with a sledgehammer).|$|R
25|$|Upon his arrest, Chikatilo gave a {{statement}} {{claiming that the}} police were mistaken, and complained that he had also been arrested in 1984 for the same series of murders. A strip-search of the suspect revealed a further piece of evidence: one of Chikatilo's fingers had a flesh wound. Medical examiners concluded the wound was from a human bite. Chikatilo's penultimate victim, Viktor Tishchenko, was a physically strong youth. At the crime scene, the police had found numerous signs of a ferocious physical struggle between the victim and his murderer. Although a finger bone was later found to be broken, and <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> had been bitten off, Chikatilo had never sought medical treatment for his injuries.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{characters}} possess unique additional status bars or icons. These include Guido Mista's available {{ammunition and}} members of Sex Pistols, Enrico Pucci's 14 Words to switch between Whitesnake and C-Moon, or Gyro's Steel Balls and Rotation energy. Characters from Part 7 Steel Ball Run have a shared unique status bar which represents how {{many parts of the}} [...] they possess; for example, one piece allows Gyro to use the Scan move, two pieces allow Johnny to automatically restore <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> bullets (otherwise requiring a special move to activate), while all three pieces enable Valentine to use D4C -Love Train- which makes him immune to projectile attacks, particularly those from Johnny and Gyro.|$|R
500|$|There {{have been}} {{persistent}} rumors of clashes among the musicians during the session. Douglas' version is that Mingus complained about Roach's playing, {{then left the}} studio mid-session, taking his bass with him. Ellington caught up with Mingus on the street outside and persuaded him to return. Ellington's account was slightly different – the reason for Mingus leaving was the same, but he was persuaded to return at the elevator. Another version is that Mingus was upset because Ellington did not use any of Mingus' compositions for the recording. Duke's son, Mercer Ellington, stated that the trio had a contract with United Artists for two albums, {{but they could not}} be persuaded to record together again. Critic Thomas Cunniffe suggests that, listening to the tracks in the order in which they were recorded, [...] "one can easily hear the tension building during the uptempo numbers", and that Mingus' temporary departure probably occurred after playing [...] "Money Jungle", which [...] "represents the apex of the group's inner tension, with Mingus plucking the strings with <b>his</b> <b>fingernails,</b> Roach firing up the music with polyrhythms and Ellington laying down highly dissonant chords".|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp, The Mad Hatter. Wasikowska {{said that}} the characters, [...] "both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their {{separate}} worlds, and have a special bond and friendship." [...] Burton explained that Depp [...] "tried to find a grounding to the character ... {{as opposed to just}} being mad." [...] Burton also said that, [...] "In a lot of versions it's a very one-note kind of character and you know [...] goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character." [...] The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt; Depp believes that the character [...] "was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair, through <b>his</b> <b>fingernails</b> and eyes". Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter's clothes, skin, hair, personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions. In an interview with Depp, the character was paralleled to [...] "a mood ring, [...] his emotions are very close to the surface". The [...] Hatter is [...] "made up of different people and their extreme sides", with a gentle voice much like the character's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent (which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher's Rab C. Nesbitt character) reflecting a darker, more dangerous personality. Illusionary dancer David [...] "Elsewhere" [...] Bernal doubled for Depp during the [...] "Futterwacken" [...] sequence {{near the end of the}} film.|$|E

5000|$|The Virginia Minstrels {{put on a}} full {{minstrel}} show at the New York Bowery Amphitheatre on 6 February 1843. Whitlock was {{the most}} famous of the foursome, but soon all four names became well known as they toured New York and Boston. Whitlock's banjo was long-necked and four-stringed, though a fifth was added by 1844. He played the instrument by striking the strings with <b>his</b> <b>fingernail.</b> Whitlock also did a [...] "Locomotive Lecture", a predecessor to the stump speech, wherein he feigned a complete lack of knowledge about steam engines and the railroad. Whitlock wrote some music, as well; his [...] "Miss Lucy Long" [...] became a hit for both the Virginia Minstrels and Christy's Minstrels.|$|R
50|$|He was {{employed}} as clerk and secretary {{to the director}} of the Royal Air Force sports board at the Air Ministry, then in Kingsway. Knowing nothing about sport, he considered <b>his</b> clean <b>fingernails,</b> well combed hair and his father's service had done the trick.|$|R

Julie's shoulders and chest are almost completely covered by the metallic substance at this point, and the substance now bears an unknown symbol. When a doctor touches the substance it reacts by removing <b>his</b> <b>fingernail,</b> whereas Julie feels no more than a tingling and some slight warmth. The doctor believes the situation to be a horrible prank, and refuses to treat Julie.

[...] In prison he twice attempted suicide, once by hanging himself with a rope made out of strips of his shirt, and a second time by cutting his wrists with <b>his</b> <b>fingernails.</b> A subsequent psychiatric assessment found him to suffer from very mild mental retardation, and to be a danger to himself and others.|$|E
50|$|A {{native of}} Miami, Florida, George Van Horn has {{maintained}} a lifelong interest in herpetology. According to a first-person account published in Orlando Magazine in 2011 {{at the age of}} 67, when he was six years old he met Bill Haast who was the owner of the Miami Serpentarium and became his mentor, and the first snake he ever picked up was a rattlesnake which struck at him but hit <b>his</b> <b>fingernail</b> without penetrating the skin. He then started milking a cottonmouth in his grandmother's basement and began filling a handmade vial of venom from it. Van Horn said in 2011 that had been bitten at least 12 times by venomous snakes. He opened up the Reptile World Serpentarium in St. Cloud in 1972. He received hospital treatment for king cobra bites in 1977 and again in 1995, and said he brings his own vial of venom to the hospital in such instances.|$|R
