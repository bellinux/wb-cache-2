50|$|Ammunition boots, {{also known}} as <b>Boots,</b> <b>ankle,</b> General Service (BGS), were the {{standard}} footwear for the British Army from the late 1880s until the late 1950s. They replaced the earlier <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> {{that had been in}} service since the early 1800s.|$|R
50|$|Hinckley also {{produced}} an accompanying clothing range consisting of sew-on patches, {{leather jacket and}} <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> all featuring Edward Turner's original 'paper-dart' Thunderbird logo.|$|R
50|$|These are {{the most}} widely worn style of fashion boots, usually under pants. <b>Ankle</b> <b>boots</b> are also the only type of fashion boot {{commonly}} worn by both men and women, {{and the only one}} to have remained popular without a break since the 19th Century. They vary in length from booties or shoe boots (effectively a shoe that skims the <b>ankle)</b> to <b>boots</b> that cover {{the lower part of the}} calf.|$|R
50|$|For GS Dress, {{olive green}} {{lightweight}} trousers are worn with high-leg boots. For Barrack dress, bottle-green barrack trousers (for male members) and skirt (for female members) are worn with Oxford-style parade shoes or <b>ankle</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|R
50|$|By the 20th century, the slip-on loafers {{were common}} male footwear. During this period other popular shoes {{included}} low, laced oxfords in various leathers, <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> and specialized sport shoes. During the 1950s, the loafer became fashionable.|$|R
5000|$|Coney Island Dominators - From Coney Island, Brooklyn, the gang's {{members are}} black and Latino. They are noted as wearing blue paisley polo shirts, monkey jackets, tight black chino pants, <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> and high-crowned narrow-brimmed straw hats with Mercedes-Benz hood emblems attached.|$|R
50|$|Late in the Napoleonic Wars, the British army began issuing <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> that {{replaced}} the buckle shoes. These types of boots remained in use throughout the 19th century and {{were used in}} conflicts including the Crimean War (1853-1856), First Zulu War (1879), and First Boer War (1880-1881).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Ulster Defence Regiment {{soldiers}} in South Armagh wearing 1968 Pattern DPM combat jackets and trousers, with green shirts and berets. This was the basic temperate combat uniform during the 1970s and early 1980s, worn with green sweaters, <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> and puttees, and 1958 Pattern webbing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design is}} {{credited}} to Queen Victoria's shoemaker Joseph Sparkes-Hall. The shoemaker certainly claimed {{it as his}} own, patenting the design in 1851 and citing his royal wearer, saying: [...] "She Victoria walks in them daily and thus gives the strongest proof of the value she attaches to the invention". In his advertising of the period, he refers to the boot as J. Sparkes-Hall's Patent Elastic <b>Ankle</b> <b>Boots.</b> The boot became popular for horse riding as well as walking.|$|R
2500|$|... 1966– In {{the film}} Mister Buddwing, a sign posted on a {{bridge in the}} film reads [...] "Stairway to Welfare Island." [...] Suzanne Pleshette, playing the {{character}} Grace, tries to throw herself off the bridge wearing nothing but a fitted trench coat and white <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> before James Garner's character saves her.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, Courrèges {{launched}} his own fashion house. He became known for extremely simple, geometric, modern designs, including the [...] "little white dress" [...] and pants for women. They were often paired with low-heeled white <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> {{a style that}} {{became known as the}} Courrèges boot, and evolved into the popular go-go boot.|$|R

50|$|By {{the turn}} of the 21st century (2000-2007 and 2017) and fashion boots in a variety of styles were back to the same level of ubiquity that they had enjoyed in the 1970s. A pair of knee-length boots, often with metal accents, was widely {{regarded}} as a must-have wardrobe item for the clothes-conscious woman, paired with knee length skirts and dresses for business and casual wear. <b>Ankle</b> <b>boots</b> also remained very popular and {{in the latter part of}} the first decade knee-length styles worn over pants, especially jeans, were common. In 2009 thigh-length boots were a subject of major attention by the fashion press, receiving guarded approval and a level of mainstream acceptance that they had never previously achieved; this trend continued in 2010 and by the following year over-the-knee styles had become commonplace. Also in 2011, <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> were being promoted as a popular summer alternative to sandals.|$|R
5000|$|Auxiliarists {{also have}} several {{distinctive}} working uniforms and optional uniform items not authorized for active duty personnel. The Hot Weather Uniform {{consists of the}} ODU t-shirt, dark blue cargo shorts, and the baseball cap. Either brown leather boat shoes or black <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> may be worn. The Hot Weather Uniform was formerly authorized for active duty personnel, but was withdrawn from service because of its non-military appearance.|$|R
50|$|The service dress uniform {{consists}} of an environmental pattern tunic, long or short sleeved dress shirt, necktie, trousers (skirt optional for women), and black oxfords or <b>ankle</b> <b>boots.</b> Tunics, trousers, skirts, sweaters (for No 3C), scarves, raincoats, topcoats, and parkas are in the environmental colours of navy blue (actually black), rifle green, and air force blue; shirts are white, linden green, or light blue.|$|R
50|$|During the English Civil War, each {{soldier of}} the New Model Army was issued three shoes or <b>ankle</b> <b>boots.</b> After every march, the soldier would change them around {{to ensure they}} {{received}} even wear. Following the Restoration, shoes and uniforms followed the civilian pattern: shoes with buckles were used by most armies from 1660 until around 1800. Hessian boots were used by cavalry from the 18th century until World War I.|$|R
5000|$|Limited {{production}} of composition figures resumed {{several years after}} the end of World War II in 1945 subject to the strict terms of [...] "de-Nazification." [...] Post-war production included the politically inoffensive Swiss figures with their black German-style helmets and black <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> and a new line of American army figures wearing the dark olive uniform and [...] "steel pot" [...] style helmet of the WWII-era US Army.|$|R
25|$|The duo also {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman on October 4, 2010. The performance recalled some {{of the elements of}} their VMA performance, including the two female back-up dancers and Minaj's hype man S.B. wearing a Pink Friday t-shirt. Both later performed the single on the Live with Regis & Kelly show on October 11, 2010. Minaj performed in a blonde wig, kaleidoscopic Marc Bouwer couture dress, and Christian Louboutin <b>ankle</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Public {{protocol}} required red <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> for senators, {{and shoes}} with crescent-shaped buckles for equites, though some wore Greek-style sandals to [...] "go with the crowd". Costly footwear was {{a mark of}} wealth or status, but being completely unshod {{need not be a}} mark of poverty. Cato the younger showed his impeccable Republican morality by going publicly barefoot; many images of the Roman gods, and later, statues of the semi-divine Augustus, were unshod.|$|R

5000|$|A {{new design}} of field {{trousers}} {{was introduced in}} 1943, replacing the old World War I style straight legged [...] "Langhosen". New features included tapered ankles (to help fit with new <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> and gaiters, which replaced jackboots beginning in 1941/42), reinforced seat, and loops to allow a trouser belt to be used. They were the German soldiers' favorite and most robust trousers, and were produced {{right up to the}} end of the war.|$|R
50|$|The high-top is a shoe {{that extends}} {{significantly}} over the wearer's ankle. It is commonly an athletic shoe, particularly for basketball. It is sometimes {{confused with the}} slightly shorter mid-top, which typically extends no higher than the wearer's ankle. High-tops also {{should not be confused}} with shorter-length <b>boots</b> such as <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> since high-tops usually refer to athletic shoes, although can also refer to other above-ankle shoes such as some hiking boots.|$|R

50|$|The jodhpur <b>boot</b> is an <b>ankle</b> <b>boot</b> {{designed}} as a riding boot with a rounded toe and a low heel. They originally fastened with a strap and buckle, but today the term also includes designs with straps that do not wrap entirely around the ankle and the elastic-sided design without a strap also known as Chelsea boots. A closely related riding boot design is called a paddock boot, particularly if modified to have a lace-up front.|$|R
5|$|In 1986, Sindy {{manufacturers}} {{took advantage}} of new colour-changing technology and released Magic Moments Sindy, a doll whose hair and swimming costume changed colour when immersed in warm water. Sindy's senior designer Jane Braithwaite travelled to Paris each month to research fashion trends for Sindy's clothing {{in an attempt to}} reverse declining sales. As an example of Sindy's continually updated fashions, during this period the doll's footwear included kitten heels, sandals, knee-high <b>boots,</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> trainers, slippers, court shoes and slingbacks.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an <b>ankle</b> <b>boot</b> and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|R

50|$|In 1879, a Commission of Enquiry {{was formed}} {{with the task}} of {{evaluating}} the existing uniform, and in 1890, khaki was formally introduced. The khaki uniform comprised a black headdress (locally known as the Songkok), khaki shirt and short pants, black puttees and <b>ankle</b> <b>boots.</b> Strict regulations requiring them to be heavily starched and ironed produced a cardboard-like material which stood out unnaturally. The white gaiters were removed as it was difficult to keep them clean, although they remained part of the ceremonial uniform till 1910.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The British Army in Burma 1945. The {{tropical}} uniform {{consisted of}} green cotton shirt and trousers (the latter {{cut to the}} same pattern as the temperate serge Battle Dress trousers), <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> worn with puttees or anklets, bush hats (helmets are worn here, but were of little use in jungle conditions), and 1937 Pattern carrying equipment (green 1944 Pattern carrying equipment would become the norm in jungle terrain until {{the introduction of the}} 1958 Pattern). This uniform would be worn through the Malaysian Emergency ...|$|R
50|$|Fashion boots {{generally}} {{employ the}} same range of soles and heels as {{are found in}} shoes. The defining character of the boot is {{the length of the}} shaft. <b>Ankle</b> <b>boots</b> generally have a shaft height of less than 8 inches (20 cm), calf-length boots 8-15 inches (20-38 cm), knee-length boots 15-19 inches (38-48 cm), while over-the knee boots have shaft lengths of 19 inches (38 cm) or more; however these divisions are arbitrary and at the boundaries the decision as to whether a boot is, for example, calf-length or knee-length is largely subjective.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{fasteners}} {{are seen in}} fashion boots. Laces are commonly used in <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> but are too time-consuming for longer styles. Zip fasteners are widely employed in all styles of boot - they may run {{the entire length of}} the shaft, or just the ankle and lower calf - these partial-length zips make it easier to insert the foot into the toe of the boot by relaxing the fit around the <b>ankle.</b> Pull-on <b>boots</b> have no fasteners and tend to have a looser fit than zip or lace-up boots; they sometimes have a loop of leather at the top of the shaft, called a boot-strap, to assist with pulling the boot on. Finally, button-fastened boots were common at the beginning of the last century but are rarely seen today. If present, buttons are usually employed as design accents on boots; other decorative features include straps, buckles, studs, and decorative stitching.|$|R
50|$|Alie Lectric - she {{lights up}} in colors and is brainy and organized. She is 200 {{trillion}} light {{years old and}} wants to teach her friends on Earth to think like a star. She blushes in different colors, and has a colorful and bold style. She can't decide what she likes best food-wise, but loves doing Earth math as she thinks it's easy. She wants {{to learn how to}} not blush around cute Earth boys, and she doesn't really get static electricity. She is preppy and typically wears <b>ankle</b> <b>boots.</b> Her pet is called Hi-Def, and her symbol is a heart.|$|R
2500|$|Low {{black leather}} boots called [...] "boondockers" [...] were issued with the {{dungaree}} uniform, however, sailors {{were allowed to}} wear black leather jump boots. [...] Flight deck personnel were issued a type of taller cap-toe boot similar in design to jump boots known colloquially as [...] "wing walkers". These types of boots had zig-zag patterned out-soles to avoid gathering FOD (Foreign Object Debris) between the ridges that could litter the flight deck and cause potential damage to aircraft. [...] "Dealer/Chelsea" [...] style <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> (known colloquially as Lox boots) with elastic-sides were issued to personnel working with Liquid oxygen for easier removal in case the boots would freeze upon contact.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ankle</b> <b>boots</b> {{had either}} a hobnailed hard leather sole with metal heel J-cleat or a rubber sole with rubber cleats. When off duty, sailors could wear tabis. A collarless wool or cotton white, gray or light green undershirt was worn under the tunic. This {{had one or}} two patch breast pockets with buttoned flaps, most had only a single pocket on the left breast. A khaki cotton shirt with stand and fall collar and two breast pockets could be worn in warm climates, {{with or without the}} tunic. The flat-topped sailor's cap was {{replaced}} by a cloth field cap with a short leather or (more usually) cloth peak.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, {{after hearing}} of the {{donation}} of Archie Bunker's chair to the Smithsonian Institution, Diller opened her doors to the National Museum of American History. She offered them some of her most iconic costume pieces, {{as well as her}} gag file, a steel cabinet with 48 file drawers with more than 50,000 jokes she had written on index cards during her career. In 2011, the Albert H. Small Documents Gallery at the National Museum of American History displayed Diller's file and some of the objects that became synonymous with her comedic persona—an unkempt wig, wrist-length gloves, cloth-covered <b>ankle</b> <b>boots,</b> and a bejeweled cigarette holder.|$|R
