25|$|Among {{the many}} water {{recycling}} projects just being completed, the South Bay Water Recycling program distributes recycled water {{to more than}} 400 customers in the San Jose, area for irrigation, industrial and other purposes. In Northern California, two agencies have teamed up to develop the San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Program. Jointly sponsored by the Dublin San Ramon Services District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District, the program will provide recycled water to municipal parks, golf courses, business parks, greenbelts and roadways. The Irvine Ranch Water District has built a dual water system, which supplies recycled water to commercial high rises for use in flushing toilets and urinals. A West Basin Municipal Water District project distributes recycled water to more than 85 customers, including Chevron and Mobil refineries. Monterey County Water Recycling Projects provide recycled water for agricultural irrigation to help ease demands on an overused <b>groundwater</b> <b>aquifer.</b> The Padre Dam Water Recycling Facility was expanded to recycle 2 million gallons/day for turf irrigation at parks, golf courses and other commercial and industrial facilities.|$|E
500|$|Until 1993, {{artesian}} water {{was not known}} {{to be present in}} the Island of Hawaii. Drilling by the University of Hawaii at that time encountered an artesian <b>groundwater</b> <b>aquifer</b> at 300 meters below sea level and 100 meters of hole depth within a compacted layer of soil and lava where the flows of both Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea meet (Humuula saddle region). Isotopic composition shows the water present to have been derived from rain coming off Mauna Kea at an elevation higher than 2000 meters above mean sea level. Its presence is attributed to a freshwater head within Mauna Kea's basal lens. Scientists believe there may be more water in Mauna Kea's fresh water lens than current models may indicate. In 2012 two more bore holes were drilled on Mauna Kea and water discovered at much higher elevations than previously believed but shallower than expected. Donald Thomas, director of the University of Hawaii's Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes believes one reason to continue study of the aquifers is due to use and ‘occupancy’ of the higher elevation areas, stating: [...] "Nearly all of these activities depend on the availability of potable water that, in most cases, must be trucked to the Saddle from Waimea or Hilo — an inefficient and expensive process that consumes a substantial quantity of our scarce liquid fuels.” ...|$|E

30|$|Incubation {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} sediments from arsenic-contaminated <b>groundwater</b> <b>aquifers</b> of the Ganges–Brahmaputra delta demonstrated a relation between microbial activity and arsenic behavior; for example, arsenic was fixed in authigenic framboidal pyrite (Akai et al. 2004), and anaerobic metal-reducing bacteria worked to release arsenic from the sediments via reduction of Fe (III) (Islam et al. 2004). Zhu et al. (2008) showed that arsenic-bearing pyrite in black shale decomposed seven times faster when incubated with microbes than when incubated without microbes.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{which have been}} obtained in prediction studies on the colloid-associated trans-port of radionuclides through porous <b>groundwater</b> <b>aquifers</b> overlying as geochemical barrier the planned nuclear repository site at Gorleben, Germany. The studies incorporate three-phase retardation factors for 227 Ac, 228 Th, 232 U and 210 Pb in site-specific <b>groundwater</b> <b>aquifers</b> containing humic colloids and efficiencies for Brownian deposition of colloidal carriers onto immobile sedimentary grains. It is shown that colloid-bound radionuclide migration can be approximately modeled by using the basic advection-dispersion trans-port equation modified with three-phase retardation coefficients and colloid-chemical attachment factors due {{to the presence of}} multiple phases, i. e., fluid, colloid and immobile solid. Moreover, results of site-specific assessment studies indicate that the transport of colloid-associated radionuclides in porous <b>groundwater</b> <b>aquifers</b> overlying the Gorleben salt dome may not occur over long distances, provided that the nuclides are transported by porous flow only. rock salt may reach waste packages so that nuclides might be released (Warnecke et al., 1984, 1994). Therefore, for the performance of a long-term safety assessment the barrier function of the geological formations overlying the salt dome have been studied by batch, column and diffusion experiments (Lieser et al., 1990; Meier et al. ...|$|R
