She traveled to Washington, D.C. in June 2009 to unveil a statue of her late husband in the Capitol rotunda. She was also on hand as President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act, and lunched privately with Michelle Obama. Reagan revealed {{in an interview with}} Vanity Fair that Michelle Obama had telephoned her for advice on living and entertaining in the White House. Following the death of Senator Ted Kennedy in August 2009, she said she was [...] "terribly saddened... Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> the Kennedy family... I will miss him." [...] She attended the funeral of Betty Ford in Rancho Mirage, California, on July 12, 2011.|$|E

[...] Her son-in-law, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, wrote a letter recounting how she had accidentally broken her arm in October 1885: [...] "On Monday 26 when crossing the library on the way to dinner with the emperor who as usual preceded her by a few steps (and with whom, I infer from what she told us, she was arguing as she sometimes does), she caught her foot in a file under a table and fell down flat face forward." [...] Nonetheless, she continued to express undiminished love for her husband.|$|E

500|$|Fonda, in The Huffington Post, {{said she}} regretted {{some of the}} {{language}} used in the original protest letter and how it [...] "was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers." [...] She continued, writing [...] "the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens." [...] Fonda emphasized that she, [...] "in no way, support the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Israel many times and love the country and its people." [...] Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to The Huffington Post rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as [...] "a strong supporter and friend of Israel".|$|E
500|$|President Obama {{said that}} Kennedy's death marked the [...] "passing of an {{extraordinary}} leader" [...] and that he and First Lady Michelle Obama were [...] "heartbroken" [...] to learn of his passing, while Vice President Biden said [...] "today we lost a truly remarkable man," [...] and that Kennedy [...] "changed the circumstances of {{tens of millions of}} Americans". Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> the Kennedy family.... I will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at the loss of my best friend in the Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy." [...] (Byrd had broken down on the Senate floor and cried uncontrollably when Kennedy's cancer diagnosis was made public the previous year.) Upon his death, his sister Jean is the only one still living of the nine Kennedy siblings.|$|E
500|$|Toivonen's WRC {{contract}} with Lancia Martini consisted of five events. Fiorio {{stated that the}} team needed another top driver as [...] "Audi will have four top drivers next year {{so it would be}} very difficult competing with only two." [...] Toivonen had his Lancia 037 debut in Portugal with very limited testing experience: [...] "It has been snowing in Italy every time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> try this car, so I don't know its limits." [...] However, similarly to his Opel Ascona 400 debut at the same event two years ago, Toivonen immediately took the lead and set several fastest stage times before retiring. This time the retirement was not caused by a broken clutch, but a mistake and a crash by Toivonen. After a retirement also in Greece, he finished third in his home event, the 1000 Lakes Rally. These three remained Toivonen's only WRC events of the season as his back injury forced him to miss the Sanremo and RAC rallies. Before Sanremo, Markku Alén re-signed with Lancia and Fiorio stated he wanted to sign Toivonen with a similar two-year contract, depending on the condition of his back and his contractual situation with Rothmans Porsche, who had claimed Toivonen had already re-signed with them. Toivonen chose to become a full-fledged Lancia driver for the 1985 season.|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Been</b> <b>to</b> Hiroshima Mon Amour (2009) was {{produced}} at the Voice & Vision Theater at {{part of the}} Hiroshima Project at Ohio Theatre. Written {{as a response to}} the famous 1959 film Hiroshima mon amour, the play follows three stories taking place at different points in time. The first follows a French actor who falls in love with a man in Hiroshima, the second is about a man’s fiancée who becomes a victim of the bomb, and the third revolves around three students in New york City who watch the 1959 film and argue about it. Miyagawa said she wrote this film because, “I was annoyed by the appropriation of the city’s tragedy by the French female protagonist. How could one person’s loss possibly be thought of as a metaphor for the deaths of one hundred thousand people?”. Martin Harries, a NYU English professor, praises the play, “There are many plays that look like they want to be movies. There are too few that take them on in meaningful, craft, theatrical ways. Here is one.” ...|$|E

Orchestrated by Yeston, the piece celebrates {{the evolution of the}} idea of individual liberty and equality, along with our inherent and universal entitlement to it, as our civilization’s [...] greatest intellectual achievement of the past 1,000 years. Sung by a mixed chorus, boys choir, and gospel choir, texts include excerpts from the Magna Carta, the writings of Thomas Jefferson, a setting of Martin Luther King Jr.’s Memphis Speech (<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> the mountaintop), and original lyrics by the composer. Subsequently, after composing the music for Broadway's 2009 revival of The Royal Family Yeston wrote the music and lyrics to Death Takes a Holiday, a musical version of the play La Morte in Vacanza by Alberto Casella (later a film called Death Takes a Holiday), with a book by Peter Stone and Thomas Meehan. [...] It played in the summer of 2011 Off-Broadway at the Laura Pels Theatre. [...] The musical received mixed to positive reviews and was nominated in eleven categories for the 2011–12 Drama Desk Awards, including Best Musical, Music and Lyrics. It was also nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Musical and Score., and cited as one of Time Magazine's top ten plays and musicals of the 2011 season.|$|E
