5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E
5|$|Evancho saw {{the film}} version of the musical The Phantom of the Opera and liked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> her mother {{purchased}} the DVD; Evancho began singing the songs at home. Her parents have said that they did not recognize that her voice was unusual until her first talent competition, which she entered just before her 8th birthday. In the competition, Kean Idol, Evancho finished in second place. She began taking voice lessons and singing at various events, churches and nursing homes, mostly in Pennsylvania. She also started a YouTube channel, sang in the Children's Festival Chorus of Pittsburgh (now Pittsburgh Youth Chorus) during its 2008–09 season, and performed the title role in a 2009 school musical version of Little Red Riding Hood.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E

25|$|She resumed making butter art in 1873, {{when she}} created a {{bas-relief}} portrait, which she donated {{to a church}} fair. Her husband safely transported it, on horseback, the seven miles to the fair. The sale of the portrait earned the church enough money to fix their roof.

25|$|Brighton's {{transformation}} from fishing village to high-class, fashionable spa town and resort {{happened in the}} second half of the 18th century and was prompted by several factors. Sea-bathing and drinking seawater became an upper-class fad, encouraged by the publication in 1750 of local doctor Richard Russell's book on the subject. The good climate—sunny, mild and breezy—also became widely known when Brighton's first guidebook was published by Anthony Relhan in 1761. Road improvements encouraged visitors from London and elsewhere: the road from London to Brighton, notorious for its poor (sometimes impassable) condition, was turnpiked throughout its length in 1770. The arrival of royalty and the effects of their patronage then gave the town such prestige that it became Britain's largest and most important seaside resort. The Duke of Cumberland lived in the town from 1779; the Prince of Wales first visited him in 1783 (although he may also have come in search of Brighton's reputed health benefits); and he liked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he came back every year and eventually took up residence at the Royal Pavilion.|$|E
500|$|Art critic Nikolaus Pevsner {{described}} {{the building as}} possessing a [...] "rare picturesque beauty".

500|$|However, {{according}} to Turner Classic Movies (TCM), the grapefruit scene was a practical joke that Cagney and costar Mae Clarke {{decided to play}} on the crew while the cameras were rolling. Wellman liked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he left it in. TCM also notes that the scene made Clarke's ex-husband, Lew Brice, very happy. [...] "He saw the film repeatedly just to see that scene, and was often shushed by angry patrons when his delighted laughter got too loud." ...|$|E

Subsequently, he let Gamasutra editor and popular Twitter user Brandon Sheffield play the game, who enjoyed <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he shared it with his more than 3,000 Twitter followers.

500|$|In December 1935, Parker Brothers sent {{a copy of}} {{the game}} to Victor Watson, Sr. of Waddington Games. Watson and his son Norman tried the game over a weekend, and liked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> Waddington took the (then extraordinary) step of making a transatlantic [...] "trunk call" [...] to Parker Brothers, the first such call made or {{received}} by either company. This impressed Parker Brothers sufficiently that Waddington was granted licensing rights for Europe and the then-British Commonwealth, excluding Canada. Waddingtons version, their first board game, with locations from London substituted for the original Atlantic City ones, was first produced in 1936.|$|E
500|$|The same {{paper had}} {{received}} Keable's second novel, 1922's The Mother of All Living, favourably; reviewer Louise Maundell Fields called it [...] "Not only...better from an artistic {{point of view}} ... its general outlook is both steadier and more mature. [...] the book has in <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> is well done and worth while that one does not feel inclined to carp at its comparatively few weaknesses." [...] On the whole, other reviews were less favourable. The characters in both Peradventure and Recompense were criticised for lacking depth: reviewers said they served only as vehicles for conveying different theoretical points of view. A later book, 1927's Ann Decides, was dismissed succinctly by the Chicago Daily Tribune as [...] "tosh".|$|E

500|$|Beach Thomas's war work led {{to state}} recognition, {{as it did}} for many of the correspondents and {{newspaper}} owners; France appointed him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE award, which he too received: [...] "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency." [...] This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.|$|E
500|$|After a {{match in}} the Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15 days in jail, and fined $50 for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury meant that Costello was unable to compete and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Don Kent returned to NWA Mid-America to work as a singles wrestler, while Costello had a full hip replacement, and was forced to retire from active competition. In 1975, Costello surprised everyone by returning to professional wrestling as the manager of a team known as [...] "The Love Brothers" [...] (Hartford and Reggie Love). He [...] actually stepped into the ring on occasion as part of special six-man tag team matches.|$|E
500|$|As {{well as the}} Blue Moon Boys, {{his regular}} backing band of Moore, bassist Bill Black and drummer D.J. Fontana, Presley was joined by {{established}} RCA Victor musicians Chet Atkins (who also helped Sholes produce the session) on guitar, and Floyd Cramer on piano. Following a suggestion from Presley, Sholes used a hallway at the studio to get an unusual echo for the single. Sholes was attempting to recapture the Sun Records sound, but he was unaware that Sun founder Sam Phillips had used two tape recorders and a slight time delay to create it on previous Presley recordings. When Phillips first heard [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", he remarked {{that it was a}} [...] "morbid mess". Most others at RCA agreed, declaring [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] a terrible choice of song, especially after hearing that the finished recording sounded nothing like Presley's Sun recordings. Internal memos from the time show that every one of RCA's executive corps disliked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> one of them insisted [...] "We certainly can't release that one".|$|E

500|$|Koshiro's track, [...] "Wrath of the Reset Bomb", {{used the}} motif {{associated}} with Viridi, {{which would be}} reused in multiple tracks. According to Sakurai, it was only intended {{to be used in}} one level, but he liked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he made it the theme for Viridi's Forces of Nature. A track that went through multiple redrafts was [...] "Aurum Island", the theme associated with the titular alien invaders: while every attempt made to create a theme ended up as a [...] "techno-pop song", the tune underwent multiple adjustments so it would not clash {{with the rest of the}} soundtrack while retaining its form. [...] "Lightning Chariot Base", due to the size of the level, was designed so players would notice its presence without growing tired of it. [...] "Practice Arena", the tune for the pre-multiplayer training area, was designed by Takada to have a light, analogue feel; it was originally composed for a different unspecified area, but it was decided that it fitted well with the build-up to a multiplayer match.|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
2500|$|After {{a two-year}} break, Fluke {{returned}} with what became a breakthrough into mainstream popular music when, in 1993, they released the single [...] "Slid". This became an instant club classic {{when it was}} picked up by DJ Sasha who liked <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> he included three separate remixes of it on his Renaissance album. This burst of success was followed by two further singles, [...] "Electric Guitar" [...] (...) and [...] "Groovy Feeling", and, in the same year, the release of the group's second album, Six Wheels On My Wagon.|$|E
