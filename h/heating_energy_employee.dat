In order {{to analyze the}} rural <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> consumption, energy consumption questionnaire which covers main factors related to rural building energy consumption is designed. The information collected in questionnaire which covers 181 questions mainly includes five parts: family basic information, rural residential building features, building envelope information, indoor air quality in winter and building <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> consumption. Two hundred questionnaires were collected in three northeastern provinces in China. Different frequency distributions {{can be obtained from}} the statistical analysis. Three ratios which included the ratio of annual household <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> consumption to total energy consumption, that of annual household <b>heating</b> commodity <b>energy</b> consumption to total <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and that of annual household <b>heating</b> non-commodity <b>energy</b> consumption to total <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> consumption were calculated and analyzed.

This type of latent <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> storage material consists of normal paraffin (pentacosane C_ H_, latent heat : 164 kJ/kg, melting point of 327. 2 K) as a latent heat material, and polyethylene as a shape-stabilizing material. The effects of cold {{inlet air temperature}} and flow rate, {{and the amount of}} <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> storage particles on the outlet air temperature from the heat storage vessel and the completion time of the <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> release process were investigated. As a result, the non-dimensional correlations for the outlet air temperature from the heat storage vessel and the completion time of the <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> release process were expressed in terms of non-dimensional pumping power, Stefan number and ratio of the packed particle layer height to the diameter of the cylindrical heat storage vessel. 一般に、固液相変化潜熱蓄熱システムにおいては、熱媒体と蓄熱材とはカプセル壁により隔離されており、その熱抵抗が大きな熱損失と迅速な熱授受を阻害する要因となることから、著者らは潜熱体が融解しても蓄熱材が固相状態の形状を保つカプセル型の形状安定化平板状パラフィン蓄熱体の開発とその蓄熱槽内での蓄放熱特性に関する研究を行ってきた。また、前報においては、潜熱蓄熱槽内に充填した球状の形状安定化パラフィン蓄熱材を温空気流入により流動層化し、熱媒体である温空気の搬送動力の軽減と蓄熱材の均一な蓄熱効果の検討結果を報告した。本報告は、前報に述べた潜熱蓄熱操作により得られた形状安定化パラフィン系球状潜熱粒子充填層に低温空気を流入させ、流動層化した場合の、球状潜熱粒子群の放熱特性に関する実験結果を述べたものである。具体的には、この種の流動層型潜熱蓄熱槽の放熱特性を評価する上で重要な要素となる蓄熱槽出口空気温度および潜熱放熱完了時間に関して、送風動力、蓄熱槽入口空気温度および蓄熱材粒子層高さを実験因子として検討するものである。さらに、蓄熱槽出口空気温度および潜熱放熱完了時間を予測する無次元整理式の提案を試みるものである...|$|R

2500|$|A {{thermal power}} station is a power station in which <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> is {{converted}} to electric power. [...] In most of the {{places in the world}} the turbine is steam-driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated; this is known as a Rankine cycle. The greatest variation in the design of {{thermal power station}}s is due to the different heat sources; fossil fuel dominates here, although nuclear <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> and solar <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> are also used. Some prefer to use the term energy center because such facilities convert forms of <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> into electrical energy.

The analysis of the <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> consumption has been made based on the real measured data in the period from year 2011 till the year 2015. For the last five years, building energy efficient topic has become more and more actual. Various governmental institutions, private companies and NGO had realized massive information campaign since 2010. However, the number of fully renovated buildings is very low. For example, in Riga less than 1 % of multi-apartment buildings have been renovated since 2010. In the most cases buildings’ owners have replaced the old windows implemented local energy efficient measures such as hydraulic balance of heating and hot water systems, sealed entrance doors and windows in staircases etc. Moreover, the inhabitants have improved their habits and are able now to control their <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> consumption.
