25|$|George was {{reported}} to have gotten into fights at school, including a fight where <b>he</b> <b>scratched</b> a girl with a knife. This assertion by Stinney's seventh-grade teacher, who was black, was disputed by Aime Stinney Ruffner when it {{was reported}} in 1995. A local white woman who remembered Stinney from childhood said Stinney had threatened to kill her and her friend the day before the murder, and that he was known as a bully.|$|E
25|$|De Mestre's {{success as}} a trainer or an owner were not {{repeated}} in the betting ring. He frequently gambled on the wrong runner from his stable, and many times lost to the bookmakers all his considerable stake winnings from a carnival. In 1882, the first year bookmakers were licensed at Flemington, he tried to recoup some of his gambling losses by betting on two of his horses for a VRC Derby-Melbourne Cup double in what is reputed {{to be the largest}} single bet ever placed in the Colonies up to that time. After winning the first leg of the bet with Navigator, <b>he</b> <b>scratched</b> this same horse from the Cup as he felt that his other horse Sweet William would be the winner. Injury prior to the race placed Sweet William in 5th place, and de Mestre lost his gamble.|$|E
500|$|Traumatized, Arkham donned his mother's {{wedding dress}} and razor, vowing to bind the evil spirit of [...] "The Bat" [...] with sorcery. He treated Hawkins for months before finally killing him {{by means of}} {{electrocution}} during a shock therapy session. Arkham continued his mission even after he was incarcerated in his own asylum; using his fingernails, <b>he</b> <b>scratched</b> {{the words of a}} binding spell all over his cell until his death.|$|E

500|$|Butcher did not confine {{himself to}} {{recording}} events {{that took place}} when he was present. [...] He was not above re-enacting historical events for a photo: for example, the 1878 lynching of two Custer County homesteaders {{at the behest of}} rancher Print Olive, or the cutting of another rancher's fences by homesteaders. [...] The latter photograph has been uncritically accepted by many historians as documentation of the actual event, although a closer examination reveals that the wire-cutters are made out of wood. [...] Butcher also did not hestitate to retouch photos. [...] He photographed a hill in Cherry County that had been important to early setters because of its cedar trees; since the trees had been cut long before he got there with his camera, <b>he</b> <b>scratched</b> trees on the bare hill on his negative. [...] To illustrate Ephraim Swain Finch's account of how he had battled an 1876 infestation of grasshoppers, he posed Finch in his cornfield, then incised scores of dots and specks into the negative to depict the flying insects. [...] When he sought to illustrate a large flock of ducks, but realized that the birds were flying too fast for his camera to record, he photographed the scene without the waterfowl and then scratched dozens of ducks into the negative.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, <b>he</b> <b>scratched</b> some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you {{what the hell is going}} on in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian innings started modestly, {{with only}} a total of two {{boundaries}} coming off the blades of the two openers, Sehwag and Chopra, but then in the eighth over, with the scorecard reading 30 for no loss, they cracked two fours off a Gillespie over and took 11 runs off it. In the ninth over, they handed out the same treatment to Bichel as well, carting him for 13 runs to bring a fifty-run partnership from just 9.4 overs. India's first 10 overs yielded 54 runs. But in the fifth and last ball of the eleventh over, Bichel, who was a controversial selection after a poor game in Brisbane, bowled to a straight, canny field by Waugh, and ended Chopra's 27-run stay with an innocuous half-volley, which Chopra drove uppishly towards the bowler. Bichel showed wonderful athleticism in holding on to a low return catch, breaking the 66-run partnership. Later, in the 15th over, by which time Sehwag had already bludgeoned 47 from 41 balls, Bichel [...] "outfoxed" [...] Sehwag with a legcutter which bounced more than expected, resulting in a fatal edge from Sehwag, which was held onto by Hayden (81/2). Sachin Tendulkar, yet to score a run in the series after his ill-fated duck at the Gabba, was distinctly ill at-ease, and was almost run out by Langer. He made a solitary run before getting out to Bichel, whose third wicket reduced the Indians to 83/3. Sourav Ganguly, man of the match in the previous test was the next batsman, but he could hardly do anything to stop the run-glut. <b>He</b> <b>scratched</b> his way to 2, before he was run out, leaving the Indian team reeling at 85/4. VVS Laxman the next man walked in.|$|E
50|$|Henceforth {{he sells}} the few sticks, which he owns only. <b>He</b> <b>scratches</b> {{together}} {{some money to}} buy a new horse. In the meantime, the creditors sell the phaeton and the remaining horse, and shared the money according to the debts of Cabber between themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Quix05 is {{also known}} for his live sets in which <b>he</b> <b>scratches</b> hip hop into any genre and is known to [...] "cover" [...] the Tracy Chapman song [...] "Fast Car". Using a {{test-tone}} record, he manipulates {{the speed of the}} platter to create the notes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, Michael G. Nastos states [...] "Adasiewicz {{is a fine}} player, in the {{backdrop}} overall, and more pronounced as an emerging writer. <b>He's</b> <b>scratching</b> the surface, and offering great potential on this fine effort that comes recommended to those who choose to listen closely." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he turned}} around three times and pinched himself again. [...] "Very strange, very strange, indeed," [...] muttered Grandfather Frog over and over again. <b>He</b> <b>scratched</b> his head first {{with one hand and}} then with the other, and the more <b>he</b> <b>scratched</b> the {{stranger}} it all seemed.|$|E

60|$|Then the middy took to {{advancing}} in {{a sitting}} posture--after a manner known to infants--at {{the same time}} intensifying the urbanity of his look and the wheedlement of his tone. The gazelle suffered him to approach until his fingers were {{within an inch of}} its nose. There the middy stopped. He had studied animal nature. He was aware that it takes two to love as well as to quarrel. He resolved to wait. Seeing this, the gazelle timidly advanced its little nose and touched his finger. <b>He</b> <b>scratched</b> gently! Spunkie seemed to like it. <b>He</b> <b>scratched</b> progressively up its forehead. Spunkie evidently enjoyed it. <b>He</b> <b>scratched</b> behind its ear, and--the victory was gained! The gazelle, dismissing all fear, advanced and rubbed its graceful head on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|The Judge merely grunted. <b>He</b> <b>scratched</b> {{among his}} papers, and {{produced}} some legal cap {{and a bunch}} of notes.|$|E

I gave him a hint one day, and he got so angry with me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Ewins came in, and the Russian said he must go. Mrs. Lander {{tried to}} detain him, too, {{as she had}} tried to keep Mr. Hinkle, but he was inexorable.
