5|$|Islamic feminists {{advocate}} women's rights, gender equality, {{and social}} justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of <b>equality</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, hadith (sayings of Muhammad), and sharia (law) towards {{the creation of a}} more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.|$|E

Financially, Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and trademark of a fashion show called Fashionetta. Politically, ACHR continued lobbying for equality concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Collier-Thomas, the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education, transportation, employment, and improving <b>equality</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> armed forces and public places. The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954's Brown v. Board of Education. However, as a whole, ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963.|$|E

The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors which began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given <b>equality</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers.

25|$|While {{working with}} the WSPU, Lucy Burns met Alice Paul at a London police station.

The women discussed their suffrage experiences in the United Kingdom and the American women's movement. Burns and Paul bonded over their frustration with the inactivity and ineffective leadership of the American suffrage movement by Anna Howard Shaw. Their similar passions and fearlessness in the face of opposition made them quickly become good friends. Both women were passionate about activism, and the feminist struggle for <b>equality</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK inspired Burns and Paul to continue the fight in the United States in 1912.|$|E
25|$|Denying {{the states}} their {{intended}} role as joint {{partners in the}} federal government by abolishing their <b>equality</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate would, according to Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (in Texas v. White), destroy the grounding of the Union. This Article V provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the District of Columbia full representation in the Congress without also granting it statehood. Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two Senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states. Whether unanimous consent of the 50 states would be required for such an amendment to become operative remains an unanswered political question.|$|E
