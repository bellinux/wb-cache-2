40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{bifurcation}} of the homogeneous fixed {{point of a}} lattice of n diffusively coupled logistic maps. An analytical computation of the reduced map on the centermanifold is performed by {{taking into account the}} symmetries of the system. If n is even, a subcritical flip bifurcation causes a symmetry breaking of the homogeneous pattern whichproduces a traveling (rotating) wave with velocity 1 and time period 2. For odd n, since the bifurcation has a two dimensional normal form, we limit ourselves to consider only the simplest case (n = 3). In this case, a supercritical flip bifurcation is observed; three less symmetric periodic orbits of time period 2 are generated by the breaking of the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>orbit.</b> However, the bifurcation is rather degenerate and we have numerical hints that a second family of asymmetric periodic points is generated. Some details, pertaining to the dynamicsof the truncated map on the two dimensional center manifold for n = 3, are also presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a family of}} mathematical objects called P-schemes, where P is a poset of subgroups of a finite group G. A P-scheme {{is a collection of}} partitions of the right coset spaces H, indexed by H∈P, that satisfies a list of axioms. These objects generalize the classical notion of association schemes [BI 84] as well as the notion of m-schemes [IKS 09]. Based on P-schemes, we develop a unifying framework for the problem of deterministic factoring of univariate polynomials over finite field under the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH). More specifically, our results include the following: We show an equivalence between m-scheme as introduced in [IKS 09] and P-schemes in the special setting that G is an multiply transitive permutation group and P is a poset of pointwise stabilizers, and therefore realize the theory of m-schemes as part of the richer theory of P-schemes. We give a generic deterministic algorithm that computes the factorization of the input polynomial ƒ(X) ∈ F q [X] given a "lifted polynomial" ƒ (X) of ƒ(X) and a collection F of "effectively constructible" subfields of the splitting field of ƒ (X) over a certain base field. It is routine to compute ƒ (X) from ƒ(X) by lifting the coefficients of ƒ(X) to a number ring. The algorithm then successfully factorizes ƒ(X) under GRH in time polynomial in the size of ƒ (X) and F, provided that a certain condition concerning P-schemes is satisfied, for P being the poset of subgroups of the Galois group G of ƒ (X) defined by F via the Galois correspondence. By considering various choices of G, P and verifying the condition, we are able to derive the main results of known (GRH-based) deterministic factoring algorithms [Hua 91 a; Hua 91 b; Ron 88; Ron 92; Evd 92; Evd 94; IKS 09] from our generic algorithm in a uniform way. We investigate the schemes conjecture in [IKS 09] and formulate analogous conjectures associated with various families of permutation groups, each of which has applications on deterministic polynomial factoring. Using a technique called induction of P-schemes, we establish reductions among these conjectures and show that they form a hierarchy of relaxations of the original schemes conjecture. We connect the complexity of deterministic polynomial factoring with the complexity of the Galois group G of ƒ (X). Specifically, using techniques from permutation group theory, we obtain a (GRH-based) deterministic factoring algorithm whose running time is bounded in terms of the noncyclic composition factors of G. In particular, this algorithm runs in polynomial time if G is in Γ k for some k= 2 O(√(log n), where Γ k denotes the family of finite groups whose noncyclic composition factors are all isomorphic of subgroups of the symmetric group of degree k. Previously, polynomial-time algorithms for Γ k were known only for bounded k. We discuss various aspects of the theory of P-schemes, including techniques of constructing new P-schemes from old ones, P-schemes for symmetric groups and linear groups, orbit P-schemes, etc. For the closely related theory of m-schemes, we provide explicit constructions of strongly antisymmetric homogeneous m-schemes for m≤ 3. We also show that all antisymmetric <b>homogeneous</b> <b>orbit</b> 3 -schemes have a matching for m≥ 3, improving a result in [IKS 09] that confirms the same statement for m≥ 4. In summary, our framework reduces the algorithmic problem of deterministic polynomial factoring over finite fields to a combinatorial problem concerning P-schemes, allowing us to not only recover most of the known results but also discover new ones. We believe progress in understanding P-schemes associated with various families of permutation groups will shed some light on the ultimate goal of solving deterministic polynomial factoring over finite fields in polynomial time. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Geometrical {{properties}} of three-body orbits with zero angular momentum are investigated. If {{the moment of}} inertia is also constant along the orbit, the triangle whose vertexes are {{the positions of the}} bodies, and the triangle whose perimeters are the momenta of the bodies, are always similar (“synchronised similar triangles”). This similarity yields kinematic equalities between mutual distances and magnitude of momenta. Moreover, if the orbit is a solution to the equation of motion under <b>homogeneous</b> potential, the <b>orbit</b> has a new constant involving momenta. For orbits with zero angular momentum and non-constant moment of inertia, we introduce scaled variables, positions divided by square root of the moment of inertia and momenta derived from the velocity of the scaled positions. Then the similarity and the kinematic equalities hold for the scaled variables. Using this similarity, we prove that any bounded three-body orbit with zero angular momentum under homogeneous potential whose degree is smaller than 2 has infinitely many collinear configurations (syzygies or eclipses) or collisions.

40|$|Diffusively coupled networks, {{in which}} {{different}} {{components of a}} network adjust their behavior according to the local sum of differences between their own and neighbors' states, are a ubiquitous class of spatially-distributed models appearing in engineered and biological systems, and produce surprisingly rich dynamics. In this dissertation, we develop analysis methods and distributed algorithms that exploit the local structure of the network {{as well as individual}} component dynamics in order to guarantee the desirable operation of the aggregate network system in the absence of centralized coordination. We begin by formulating network design problems to guarantee coordination of multi-agent systems by imposing constraints on the underlying structure of the diffusive coupling graph linking agents. The resulting constraint-derived linear matrix inequalities may then be iteratively solved using convex semidefinite programming, resulting in significant performance gains in several multi-agent systems problems. Our approach furthermore identifies critical nodes and edges in a network, and aids in developing strategies to enhance connectivity and robustness. Next considering the case where desired steady-state trajectories may be time-varying, we derive conditions to determine whether limit cycle oscillations synchronize in diffusively coupled systems. Conversely, we highlight cases of diffusion-driven instability, a phenomenon widely hypothesized as a mechanism behind pattern formation in biological systems, in which sufficiently large diffusive coupling may destabilize a spatially <b>homogeneous</b> periodic <b>orbit.</b> The analytical and numerical conditions we derive lend insight to designing distributed laws where the local behavior about a specific attractor is of interest. We then turn to the problem of developing distributed laws that guarantee spatially uniform behavior globally in diffusively coupled systems. We first study systems with spatially-dependent diffusive coupling, and subsequently examine the case where the network itself has dynamics and adapts according to the agents' states. We develop adaptive laws to guarantee synchronization in systems with spatially-dependent coupling, and apply these results to a number of problems of interest arising from multi-agent systems and cooperative control. We finally address the case where the dynamics of the agents may be subject to spatially-varying input disturbances, and derive distributed laws to guarantee synchronization in the presence of such heterogeneities...|$|R

40|$|A new {{stability}} {{analysis of}} the two elementary Poincaré-based chaos control schemes, OGY and difference control, is given by means of Floquet theory. This approach allows to calculate exactly the stability restrictions occuring for small measurement delays and for an impulse length shorter than {{the length of the}} orbit. This is of practical experimental relevance; to avoid a selection of the relative impulse length by trial and error, it is advised to investigate whether the used control scheme itself shows systematic limitations on the choice of the impulse length. To investigate this point, a Floquet analysis is performed, similar to that of [Just et al. 1997] for the time-continuous Pyragas scheme. Here the expansion dynamics in vicinity of the orbit is assumed to be <b>homogeneous</b> along the <b>orbit,</b> which is of course a simplification to have a model situation to obtain qualitative results. As an unexpected result, while for OGY control the influence of the impulse length is marginal, difference control is shown to fail when the impulse length is taken longer than one half of the orbit length [Claussen 1998; Claussen 2002; Claussen 2003]. This impulse length limitation reproduces the experiments by [Mausbach 1998]. The linear model approach is extended to the case where the local Ljapunov exponent varies along the orbit to be stabilized; the dynamics of the system with applied OGY control can be piecewise integrated as before to show that the qualitative result survives if the simplifying assumption of a constant local Ljapunov exponent is relaxed.

40|$|The {{structure}} of a radar-derived meteoroid orbit data set is examined in the current study. Biases in the parameter distributions and measurement uncertainties for the orbits are determined. Meteoroid stream related substructure is searched for {{in order to determine}} the level to which the dust population probed retains memory of the assumed progenitors of the current meteoroid population: the short-period comets. The detectable consequence of streams within the data set are meteor showers: several methods of shower detection are discussed and tested. The data set provided by the AMOR meteoroid orbit radar system is used for these tests, though the techniques developed and the comparative survey of earlier techniques are of value to searches of similar radar meteor data sets and indeed in many cases to such data derived by other methods (e. g. photographically). AMOR is situated near Christchurch, New Zealand (172 ° 39 'E, 43 ° 34 'S) and has been operating with increasing time-coverage since 1990. It is one of the most sensitive orbit-determining meteor detection systems ever deployed, routinely measuring to a limiting radio magnitude of + 14 which corresponds to a dust particle size of ~ 40 µm (similar to those which form the zodiacal light). From the time of the vernal equinox in 1995 to mid- 1999 the characteristics of ~ 5. 3 X 105 meteors, of sufficient quality for orbit calculation, were measured using a static equipment setup. The large <b>homogeneous</b> meteoroid <b>orbit</b> catalogue resulting is the main data source used currently. Searching for fluctuations, associated with shower presence, in the meteor rate curve is found to be inapplicable due to the relative weakness of even the major showers against the background (the strongest shower comprises approximately 5 % of the total meteors observed per day at their activity peak). A new direct search approach for associations of data set orbits with mean stream orbits from other surveys is defined and tested. Only the major showers (η Aquarids (ETA), Southern  Aquarids (SDA),  Capricornids (CAP) and Daytime Sextantids (DSX)), in addition to a few other minor showers, have associations at the 95 %/ 99 % significance levels under this Poisson statistic based test. A new method using wavelet enhancement to search for showers in radiant-speed-time space is introduced. This method is found to be effective and relatively straightforward in implementation; it detects the four major showers in addition to a number of other peaks-the significance of most of the latter is attributed to low background meteor activity at the time. Finally, the single-linkage cluster analysis technique, as used in many photographic meteor surveys, is applied. This again discovers the four major showers but it is found that the cutoff level in the hierarchy at which these showers are complete is rather unstable and subjective. Randomisation tests, in an attempt to determine a statistically significant cutoff level, indicate that all structure including the major showers is essentially randomly formed from the background. This extreme result contradicts other methods. The conclusion reached is that the randomisation tests and the single-linkage method itself are inappropriate for their current use. The AMOR data set is found to be dominated by sporadic (non-shower) meteors and most traces of past cometary passages have been erased. This is particularly true of the ≈ 50 % of the data set which are in retrograde orbits: their importance, after correction for a large detection bias is found to be negligible. The antihelion, helion and apex sporadic sources appear strongly in the AMOR data set. These virtual sources, formed by the combination of the true spatial dust distribution with the observation biasing conditions, are explored further to reveal any orbital structure appearing within. The only definite meteor showers found using several different methods are the major showers. These comprise less than 1 % of the total meteors observed per year over the five year data set: approximately 1 x 103, 2 X 103, 3 X 102 and 4 x 102 meteors are detected in total from the ETA, SDA, CAP, and DSX respectively. Two other showers appearing under the wavelet enhancement method, labelled Peaks A and C (approximately 3 x 102 and 9 x 102 meteors respectively), are found to be significant. These showers, which also appear significantly under the direct search method, are studied and Peak C is identified with the omicron Cetids. Due to their long-lived activity it is found to be difficult to determine whether Peaks A and C are true showers, or instead, simply favourable alignments of the sporadic biased regions in which they lie. It is found to be unlikely that showers, of lesser activity than those above, are detectable against the strong sporadic meteor background. One reason for this scarcity is that owing to the size range probed by AMOR the coherence of a stream may be lost over a relatively short time-interval: typical shower mass distributions favour larger particle sizes and hence many of the smaller particles detected by AMOR are non-shower "noise". The biases on the data set demonstrated in this study are so strong that these will also act to remove the detectability of minor showers. The presence of large measurement uncertainties on radar-derived orbits, as compared with those detected hotographically, also has a major effect on detectability. Two methods for the calculation of individual orbit uncertainty are tested and found to provide generally equivalent results. The uncertainty in the AM OR orbital parameters varies greatly, with a general increase as the geocentric speed of the meteoroid increases. Representative uncertainties in the orbit-defining heliocentric velocity components are found to range between 6 % and 55 % (uncertainties close to the latter correspond to retrograde orbits). The prograde meteoroid orbit region close to the ecliptic, in which most meteoroid streams are detected, is found to have the lowest orbital element uncertainties-representative values for which are: ∆q = 0. 03 AU, ∆e = 0. 03, ∆w = 5 °, ∆i = 2 ° and ∆Ω= 0 °. The orbital statistics and character of the four major showers, in addition to the two shower candidates Peaks A and C, are further analysed. Daily motion in the radiant position, generally occurring in a plane parallel to the ecliptic, is seen for all showers. Daily motion in the orbital elements is also measured: the SDA provide a particularly good example in q and w. It is found that the spread in the orbital parameters of each shower is similar to, or smaller in magnitude than, that expected from the individual meteor measurement uncertainties: measurement of the physical spread in such parameters is generally not possible. Good agreement is reached between the mean orbits of the showers and a variety of published sources, indicating the correct calibration of the AMOR system; the large number of shower orbits in each case ensure a high level of reliability in their respective means...|$|R
