50|$|Pratylenchus penetrans is {{a species}} of {{nematode}} in the genus Pratylenchus, the lesion nematodes. It occurs in temperate regions worldwide, regions between the subtropics and the polar circles. It is an animal that inhabits the roots {{of a wide variety}} of plants and results in necrotic lesions on the roots. Symptoms of P. penetrans make it hard to distinguish from other plant pathogens; only an assay of soil can conclusively diagnose a nematode problem in the field. P. penetrans is physically very similar to other nematode species, but is characterized by its highly distinctive mouthpiece. P. penetrans uses its highly modified mouth organs to rupture the outer surface of subterranean plant root structures. It will then enter into the root interior and feed on the plant tissue inside. P. penetrans is considered to be a crop parasite and farmers will often treat their soil with various pesticides in an attempt to eliminate the damage caused by an infestation. In doing this, farmers will also eliminate many of the beneficial soil fauna, which will lead to an overall <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> quality in the future. Alternative, more environmentally sustainable methods to control P. penetrans populations may be possible in certain regions.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{benefits}} of using Vetiveria nigritana, especially in subsistence agriculture, is that it reduces soil erosion and nutrient loss associated with water runoff and wind displacement. Essentially, when Vetiveria nigritana is planted in hedgerows surrounding a crop or in multiple spaced rows, it creates a barrier that prevents soil run-off. This is because the plant’s thick grass structure is able to accumulate soil and nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon that {{would otherwise have been}} lost due to runoff. In fact, studies have shown that planting Vetiveria nigritana hedgerows reduces soil loss by around 70%, which allows farmers to retain the nutrients within their soil. Secondly, the use of Vetiveria nigritana also reduces water runoff, in some cases by 130%, which is beneficial because in areas where irrigation is not present, conserving natural rainfall is essential for the survival of a farmer’s crop. In addition, the use of the type of vetiver grass is ideal in places like the African subtropics to prevent soil erosion and runoff because Vetiveria nigritana {{has been shown to be}} highly effective on a variety of different slopes in preventing the <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil.</b> Therefore, Vetiveria nigritana would benefit subsistence farmers because the increased nutrients, retention of soil and the accumulation of water that it causes would help to improve crop yields.|$|E

Data analyzed by regression, F test (α 5 %; or Kruskal-Wallis), DMR test (α 5 %; or Mood Median) and correlation test.

40|$|This paper gives a brief {{introduction}} to various land degradation processes. It then gives {{an overview of}} the trends in land degradation in Chile and other South American countries. An important tendency of agriculture has been the conversion of traditional cultivations like beans and corn to new export cultivations, in particular soybeans and sorghum. Observers have noticed an obvious relationship in deforestation that has occurred in the region with the increase of pasturelands for cattle raising. Erosion that constitutes one or more serious forms, including the generalized <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> in the region, can be verified, and has increased in recent decades due to uncontrolled expansion of cattle raising at unapt zones and the extension of agriculture to zones of slopes where freak erosion occurs. In particular certain countries have experienced grave characteristics, including the abandonment of extended areas. The principal problems <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> that affect the southern region of South America are: water erosion, wind erosion, advance of dunes, extraction <b>of</b> <b>soil,</b> salinization, problems <b>of</b> drainage, fertility loss, acidification, <b>soil</b> compaction, loss <b>of</b> structure, biological <b>degradation,</b> desiccation <b>of</b> fertile plains, landslides, and irreversible changes in the <b>soil</b> use.
