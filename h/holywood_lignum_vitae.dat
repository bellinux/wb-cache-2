50|$|Various other {{hardwoods}} {{may also}} be called <b>lignum</b> <b>vitae</b> {{and should not be}} confused with it. The best-known come from Bulnesia arborea and Bulnesia sarmientoi (in the same subfamily as Guaiacum) and are known as Verawood or Argentine lignum vitae; they are somewhat similar in appearance and working qualities as genuine <b>lignum</b> <b>vitae.</b> Some hardwoods from Australasia (e.g., Vitex lignum-vitae and some species of Acacia and Eucalyptus) are also referred to as <b>lignum</b> <b>vitae.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Bulnesia sarmientoi is a {{tree that}} inhabits {{a part of the}} Gran Chaco area in South America, around the Argentina-Bolivia-Paraguay border.

50|$|The {{belaying}} {{pins and}} deadeyes aboard USS Constitution {{and many other}} sailing ships were made from <b>lignum</b> <b>vitae.</b> Due to its density and natural oils, they rarely require replacement, despite the severity of typical marine weathering conditions, and also resisted jamming in their mortise holes.

50|$|Master clockmaker John Harrison used <b>lignum</b> <b>vitae</b> in the {{bearings}} and gears of his pendulum clocks {{and his first}} three marine chronometers (all of which were large clocks rather than watches), since the wood is self-lubricating.

Also, the bearings in the original 1920s turbines of the Conowingo hydroelectric plant on the lower Susquehanna River were made from <b>lignum</b> <b>vitae.</b> The shaft bearings on the horizontal turbines at the Pointe du Bois generating station in Manitoba are made from <b>lignum</b> <b>vitae.</b> Other hydroelectric plant turbine bearings, many of them still in service, were fabricated with <b>lignum</b> <b>vitae</b> and are too numerous to list here.|$|R
