Harle would follow this single up with [...] "Super Natural" [...] three months later on 12 August 2016. Harle's most mainstream-friendly to date, the single features prominent guest vocals from Canadian pop star Carly Rae Jepsen. An official music video starring Harle and Jepsen, directed by Bradley & Pablo (who have also directed <b>music</b> videos by <b>PC</b> <b>Music's</b> Hannah Diamond and label affiliates QT and Charli XCX), was released one week later on 19 August 2016.|$|R

50|$|Compaq {{originally}} competed directly against IBM, manufacturing {{computer systems}} equivalent with the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC,</b> {{as well as}} Apple Computer. In the 1990s, as <b>IBM's</b> own <b>PC</b> division declined, Compaq faced other <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> Compatible manufacturers like Dell Computer, Packard Bell, AST Research, and Gateway 2000.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1983, {{the first}} <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> {{compatible}} portable computer (and indeed the first 100% <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> compatible, or [...] "clone," [...] of any kind) was the Compaq Portable.|$|R

5000|$|Sound {{cards for}} {{computers}} {{compatible with the}} <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> were very uncommon until 1988, which left the single internal PC speaker {{as the only way}} early PC software could produce sound and music. The speaker hardware was typically limited to square waves, which fit the common nickname of [...] "beeper". The resulting sound was generally described as [...] "beeps and boops". Several companies, most notably Access Software, developed techniques for digital sound reproduction over the PC speaker (see RealSound); the resulting audio, while barely functional, suffered from distorted output and low volume, and usually required all other processing to be stopped while sounds were played. Other home computer models of the 1980s included hardware support for digital sound playback, or music synthesis (or both), leaving the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> at a disadvantage to them when it came to multimedia applications such as music composition or gaming. The initial design and marketing focuses of sound cards for the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> platform were not based on gaming, but rather on specific audio applications such as music composition (AdLib Personal Music System, IBM <b>Music</b> <b>Feature</b> Card, Creative <b>Music</b> System), or on speech synthesis (Digispeech DS201, Covox Speech Thing, Street Electronics Echo).|$|R
50|$|IBM later {{used the}} same {{approach}} for its 1983 introduction of the XT/370 model of the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC,</b> which was a standard <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> XT {{with the addition of}} a System/370 emulator card.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} the {{original}} <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> (<b>IBM</b> machine type 5150) was released in 1981, the BASIC in ROM was a key feature. Contemporary popular personal computers such as the Commodore 64 and the Apple II line also had Microsoft Cassette BASIC in ROM (though Commodore renamed their licensed version Commodore BASIC), so in {{a substantial portion of}} its intended market, the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> needed BASIC to compete. As on those other systems, the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC's</b> ROM BASIC served as a primitive diskless operating system, allowing the user to load, save, and run programs, as well as to write and refine them. (The original <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> was also the only <b>PC</b> model from <b>IBM</b> that, like its aforementioned two competitors, included cassette interface hardware. A base model <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> had only 16 KiB of RAM and no disk drives of any kind, so the cassette interface and BASIC in ROM were essential to make the base model usable. Of the five 8 KiB ROM chips in an original <b>IBM</b> <b>PC,</b> totaling 40 KiB, four contain BASIC and only one contains the BIOS; the ROM BASIC accounts for over half of the total system memory to be precise.) ...|$|R
50|$|As the non-x86 {{architectures}} died off, and x86 systems standardized into fully <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> compatible clones, {{a market}} filled {{with dozens of}} different competing systems {{was reduced to a}} near-monoculture of x86-based, <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> compatible, MS-DOS systems.|$|R
25|$|The 640 KB {{barrier is}} an {{architectural}} limitation of <b>IBM</b> and <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> compatible PCs. The Intel 8088 CPU, {{used in the}} original <b>IBM</b> <b>PC,</b> was able to address 1MB (220bytes), since the chip offered 20 address lines.|$|R

50|$|Eagle {{was also}} one of the first {{manufacturers}} of clones of the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC.</b> The Eagle PC was introduced in 1982. It had enhanced 752 × 352 graphics compared to the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC's</b> 640 × 200 resolution, and it was quieter because it did not need a cooling fan. The PC 2 followed, but the screen resolution was downgraded to match that of the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC.</b> Later the Eagle Spirit portable came out, and the Eagle Turbo.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, {{the launch}} of the VisiCalc {{spreadsheet}} (initially for the Apple II) first turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool. After the 1981 release by IBM of its <b>IBM</b> <b>PC,</b> the term personal computer became generally used for microcomputers compatible with the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> architecture (PC compatible).|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} response to the first paintbrush program for the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC,</b> PCPaint, which had been released the prior year by Mouse Systems, the company responsible for bringing the mouse to the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> for the first time.|$|R
50|$|The term is not {{synonymous with}} <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> compatibility, as this implies a {{multitude}} of other computer hardware; embedded systems, as well as general-purpose computers, used x86 chips before the PC-compatible market started, some of them before the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> (1981) itself.|$|R
5000|$|On the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC,</b> however, at $240 per copy (the price set by IBM), CP/M-86 sold poorly {{compared}} to the $40 PC DOS; one survey found that 96.3% of <b>IBM</b> <b>PCs</b> were ordered with DOS, {{compared to}} 3.4% with CP/M-86 or Concurrent CP/M-86. In mid-1982 Lifeboat Associates, perhaps the largest CP/M software vendor, announced its support for DOS over CP/M-86 on the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC.</b> BYTE warned that IBM, Microsoft, and Lifeboat's support for DOS [...] "poses a serious threat to" [...] CP/M-86.|$|R

50|$|MS-DOS for <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> {{compatible}}s with Intel x86 CPUs. It {{started as}} 86-DOS, {{which served as}} the basis for Microsoft's MS-DOS, and was rebranded by <b>IBM</b> as <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> DOS until 1993. Various compatible systems were later produced by different organizations, starting with DR-DOS in 1988.|$|R
50|$|The <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> {{that had}} been marketed by IBM since 1981, using Intel 8088, was not {{powerful}} enough to process the far eastern languages of Japanese, Korean and Chinese.

50|$|Before the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> was introduced, the {{personal}} computer market was dominated by systems using the 6502 and Z80 8-bit microprocessors, such as the TRS 80, Commodore PET and Apple II series, which used proprietary operating systems, and by computers running CP/M. After IBM introduced the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC,</b> {{it was not until}} 1984 that <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> and clones became the dominant computers. In 1983, Byte forecast that by 1990, IBM would command only 11% of business computer sales. Commodore was predicted to hold a slim lead in a highly competitive market, at 11.9%.|$|R

50|$|The {{key feature}} of the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> was that despite its {{technical}} mediocrity and higher-than-market price, it had IBM's enormous public respect behind it. It was an accident of history that the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> happened to have an Intel CPU (instead of the technically superior Motorola 68000 that had been tipped for it, or an IBM in-house design), and that it shipped with <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> DOS (a licensed version of Microsoft's MS-DOS) rather than the CP/M-86 operating system, but these accidents were to have enormous significance in later years.|$|R
50|$|Early {{after the}} launch of the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> in 1981, there were still dozens of systems that were not IBM PC-compatible, but did use Intel x86 chips. They used Intel 8088, 8086, or 80186 processors, and almost without {{exception}} offered an OEM version of MS-DOS (as opposed to the OEM version customized for IBM's use). However, they generally made no attempt to copy the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC's</b> architecture, so these machines had different I/O addresses, a different system bus, different video controllers, and other differences from the original <b>IBM</b> <b>PC.</b> These differences, which were sometimes rather minor, were used to improve upon the <b>IBM</b> <b>PC's</b> design, but {{as a result of the}} differences, software that directly manipulated the hardware would not run correctly. In most cases, the x86-based systems that didn't use a fully <b>IBM</b> <b>PC</b> compatible design didn't sell well enough to attract support from software manufacturers, though a few computer manufacturers arranged for compatible versions of popular applications to be developed and sold specifically for their machines.|$|R
