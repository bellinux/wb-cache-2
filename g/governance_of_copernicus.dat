40|$|This {{extensive}} study {{offers a}} general {{overview of the}} reception <b>of</b> <b>Copernicus’s</b> astronomical and cosmological proposal from the years immediately preceding {{the publication of his}} major work, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (Nuremberg, 1543), to the Catholic prohibition of the heliocentric system in 1616. It is a reconstruction of the Renaissance cultural debates that were either provoked by the impact <b>of</b> <b>Copernicus’s</b> work or that conversely reshaped and transformed the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Copernicus’s</b> achievements. Certain aspects of this reception and transformation are treated with particular attention: epistemology, cosmology, space conceptions, natural philosophy, the incipient classical physics, theology and anthropology. The treatment of the different authors, issues and debates is based on an extensive and up-to-date bibliography concerning both the primary sources and the secondary literature...|$|R

50|$|Copernicus is {{postulated}} to {{have spoken}} Latin and German with equal fluency. He also spoke Polish, Greek and Italian. The vast majority <b>of</b> <b>Copernicus's</b> surviving works are in Latin, which {{in his lifetime}} was the language of academia in Europe. Latin was also the official language of the Roman Catholic Church and of Poland's royal court, and thus all <b>of</b> <b>Copernicus's</b> correspondence with the Church and with Polish leaders was in Latin.|$|R
