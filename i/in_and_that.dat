5|$|At {{a public}} meeting in Alresford on 14 May, Onslow {{reported}} that subscriptions to the defence fund were already pouring <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> invitations {{to visit and}} speak had been received from many towns. As the Claimant addressed meetings {{up and down the}} country, journalists following the campaign often commented on his pronounced cockney accent, suggestive of East London origins. The campaign drew in some high-level supporters, among whom was George Hammond Whalley, a controversial anti-Catholic who was MP for Peterborough. He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches; after a meeting in St James's Hall, London, on 11 December 1872, each made specific charges against the Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice. They were both fined £100 for contempt of court.|$|E
5|$|By 1782 MacBride was {{operating}} in the Channel, and in April was sent out as a scout ahead of the main force under Admiral Samuel Barrington, which aimed to intercept a French squadron that had left Brest bound for the East Indies. He sighted the force on 20 April and alerted Barrington. The British moved <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> day and the following captured {{over half of the}} French force. After this success MacBride was appointed to the Irish station in June, where he worked in the impress service while Artois cruised under her first lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} fees {{themselves were}} a significant {{legacy of the}} expansion effort. Smith claims US$14 to $15 million was brought <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it saved the league. A more modest assessment suggests expansion saved the Stampeders and Tiger-Cats—both teams were undeniably in distress during the era—and that the other Canadian teams were able to have maintain a semblance of stability.|$|E

5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced {{him to write}} about the sort of world he would like to live <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E

25|$|Hillary Clinton was {{the winner}} of the popular vote in the primary, with Barack Obama {{trailing}} in second. Clinton's win was the first time a woman had ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. (Shirley Chisholm's prior win in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern.) However, Clinton and Obama received an equal number of delegates to the National Convention since the percentages of their votes were close.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff.

I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

25|$|Divers may {{test whether}} a mask {{is a good}} fit by placing it on their face, without using the straps, and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help this {{indicates}} that no air is being drawn <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin all the way round the mask. Optimum sealing requires that hair strands do not cross under {{the edge of the}} seal, as they can provide a path for water to leak into the mask. This is more a problem with the forehead hairline than with lower facial hair, as water from the top tends to run into the eyes, while water pooling at the bottom is easily purged by exhaling a small volume of air through the nose. Most bearded divers learn to manage the slight leakage without difficulty, inconvenience, or greasing the moustache. Other factors affecting a comfortable fit are sufficient space for the nose in the nose pocket, no contact between the rigid mask frame and the bridge of the nose, and no excessive pressure on the forehead. There should also be sufficient space between the mask lenses and the face that the eyelashes do not contact the glass noticeably when blinking.|$|E
25|$|Lawson was as {{known for}} her off stage romances as she was for her onstage performances. In 1933 her {{engagement}} to Maurice Henry van Raalte, heir to a cigar importing fortune, ended tragically with her fiancé's sudden death. In May 1934 Lawson announced she was to marry a Mr H Glendenning, a cameraman {{on the set of}} Money in the Air, a film that Lawson had a part <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> was eventually distributed as Radio Pirates. But only a few months later in August 1934 Lawson caused a national sensation when it was announced that she was engaged to Fred Perry, the world's premier tennis player and winner of multiple Grand Slam tournaments. The couple first met when Perry visited the London studies of the film Falling in Love, in which Lawson played the role of Ann Brent. Perry later escorted Lawson to an exhibition match at Highbury Fields and proposed marriage before he departed to New York City to defend his US Open title. The couple's engagement became a news sensation, which took a toll on their relationship. When Perry turned down on offer of $50,000 to turn pro, he reportedly said it was because he would face tax issues and jeopardise his relationship with Lawson. In April 1935, while Perry was in the United States, the engagement was called off. Lawson reportedly stated that she broke off the engagement because publicity killed their romance, she had tired of the ridiculous rumours that had circulated in the media and she was opposed to Perry's plans to live permanently in America.|$|E

500|$|Qur'anic Arabic uses a diaphonemic {{writing system}} that {{indicates}} both the pronunciation in Mecca, the western dialect the Qur'an was written <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> of eastern Arabia, the prestige dialect of pre-Islamic poetry. For example, final [...] was pronounced something like [...] in Mecca, and written ي , while it had merged with [...] in eastern Arabia and was written as ا [...] In order to accommodate both pronunciations, the basic letter of Meccan Arabic was used, but the diacritic was dropped: ى. Similarly, the glottal stop {{had been lost}} in Meccan Arabic in all positions but initially, so the Meccan letters were retained with the eastern glottal stop indicated with a diacritic hamza.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} since the American Revolution, the {{geography}} of the Boston area has undergone significant expansion, and the islands named Hog and Noddle's are no longer islands. [...] In the late 19th and early 20th century, the channel that separated Noddle's and Hog was filled <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> between Hog Island and the mainland was filled in {{over the course of the}} late 19th century and early 20th century leaving just a small, narrow creek between the former islands and the mainland. [...] In terms of modern geography, the Orient Heights neighborhood of East Boston is the present location of Hog Island and nearby Breeds Island, and much of the remainder of East Boston is what was then Noddle's Island. The Chelsea Creek has been narrowed due to the expansion of Chelsea and has been dredged and straightened to create a deep shipping channel.|$|E
500|$|Dungeon Keeper was Molyneux's final {{project with}} Bullfrog {{before he left}} in July 1997 to form Lionhead Studios, and after completion, he stated {{that he wanted to}} make [...] "the coolest game ever". Molyneux decided to leave Bullfrog in July 1996 due to {{frustration}} over corporate meetings and other management responsibilities that ensued after it was sold to Electronic Arts in 1995. He intended to leave as soon as Dungeon Keeper was complete, and his departure was one reason he wanted to make the game good. As a result of Molyneux's decision, Electronic Arts asked him to leave its offices, but Molyneux wanted to continue development, so the team moved into his house. Molyneux, Mark Webley, Tim Rance, and Steve Jackson made the decision to found Lionhead when Dungeon Keeper was nearing completion. In 2017, Molyneux expressed regret at leaving Bullfrog, and explained that he was drunk when he handed his notice <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "such a silly thing to do".|$|E

500|$|Following the {{critical}} and commercial breakthrough of her third studio album Control (1986), Jackson was motivated {{to take a}} larger role in her album's creative process. According to Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits (2002), A Records requested she record an album similar to Control. It was rumored that label executives suggested a concept album entitled Scandal, which would have centered around her personal and family life. However, Jam later denied the claim that Scandal was ever suggested, although he confirmed there was encouragement to produce a [...] "Control II." [...] Jackson opposed the idea of a direct sequel to Control, stating [...] "that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something that I really believed <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> I really felt strong about." [...] She was initially criticized for choosing to dedicate the album's theme to social consciousness, but remained resolute in her commitment to the concept. Jam stated that her inspiration for the album's theme came primarily from watching CNN and other news sources. In particular, her reaction to the Stockton playground murders led to recording [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "State of the World".|$|E
