5|$|Years later, an {{interview}} with Henry Lee Loggins's son Mayor Jhonny B. Thomas revealed that Till was shot and tossed over the Black Bayou Bridge in Glendora, Mississippi, near the Tallahatchie River. The group <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Roy Bryant's home in Money, where they reportedly burned Emmett's clothes.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increasing}} dissatisfaction with Everman {{over the course}} of the Bleach tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later claimed that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{returned}} to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, where he had lunch. As his aides arrived, he informed them of his sacking. Whitlam drafted a resolution for the House, expressing confidence in his Government. No ALP Senate leaders were at The Lodge, nor did Whitlam and his party contact any when they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Parliament House, confining their strategy to the House of Representatives.|$|E
60|$|Phyllis Poynton <b>drove</b> {{straight}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{her hotel}} {{and went to}} her room. A sympathetic chambermaid followed her in.|$|R
25|$|The {{first phase}} began in early January 1945, when Soviet forces <b>drove</b> Germany <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its territories in East Prussia and Silesia.|$|R
60|$|Then Edie <b>drove</b> herself <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Peveril Court, {{feeling that}} only Evan Meredith knew besides; {{and she could}} surely count at least on Evan's honour.|$|R
5|$|Brynn {{drove to}} the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing, but {{initially}} he did not believe her. The pair <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house in separate cars, and Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called 911 at 6:20a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed suicide by shooting herself in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{moved up}} a {{position}} as he passed Button for fifth position at turn three on the same lap. On lap twenty-eight, Trulli <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his garage to retire with a hydraulics failure that was caused by his power steering becoming heavy during the safety car period. Vettel set a new fastest lap of the race of 1:54.098, extending his lead over Alonso to 3.5 seconds. Button, who was under pressure from Hülkenberg and Kubica, made a pit stop {{at the end of}} lap twenty-eight for intermediate tyres and rejoined in fifteenth place. Kovalainen was sent into a spin by Buemi, having been passed by Petrov two laps later.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Bleach in June 1989, Nirvana {{embarked}} on its first national tour, and the album became a favorite of college radio stations. Due to increasing differences between Everman {{and the rest of}} the band over the course of the tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later said that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller, and had initial sales of 40,000 copies. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album. In late 1989, the band recorded the Blew EP with producer Steve Fisk.|$|E
60|$|He <b>drove</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Paris, and {{she promised}} {{to come and}} see him in his studio and let him {{introduce}} her to his artist friends.|$|R
60|$|Then Kisa {{entered the}} hut, and lost {{no time in}} searching every hole till she came upon some grass, under which Ingibjorg's feet were hidden, and putting them in her cart, <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> her own hut.|$|R
50|$|About 10 {{miles outside}} of Sioux Falls, the gang {{released}} the hostages, and drove off. The hostages were eventually {{picked up by a}} passing motorist who <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the bank.|$|R
5|$|Ferrari ordered Massa {{to reduce}} his car speed on his out-lap to help Alonso {{minimise}} the effects of losing second position. Glock <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his pit box where his mechanics examined his car for damage and decided to retire him from the race. Kubica avoided making contact with Sutil when his lollipop man stopped him before he could drive away from his pit box. It {{was the second time}} that season Kubica and Sutil were involved in an incident in a pit lane; Kubica had made contact with Sutil when the latter was driving into his pit box in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} thirty-fourth lap and Vettel led at the restart. Hamilton ran deep, heading into the first corner and allowing Alonso to retake second position and immediately came under attack from Massa. Kubica took eighth place from Hülkenberg by taking the inside line at the third corner. Sutil took to the inside line and passed Button for twelfth on lap thirty-six. Button was pushed wide onto the run-off area and fell to fifteenth position.|$|E
5|$|After the pit stops, which {{concluded}} on lap 91, Riggs reclaimed {{the first}} position. Kahne {{closed the gap}} to teammate Riggs, who was holding a lead of four-tenths of a second, by lap 95. One lap later, Kahne passed Riggs (who complained his car had too much understeer) for first place. Earnhardt moved into second when he passed Riggs on the 100th lap. Lap 105 saw the fifth caution; Waltrip lost control {{of his car and}} hit the turn four outside wall, causing him to spin while attempting to make a pit stop for fuel. During the caution, all drivers again made pit stops. Kahne maintained the lead at the lap-110 restart, followed by Earnhardt and Bowyer. Gordon passed Bowyer to claim third position one lap later. Bowyer lost two further positions when Burton and Johnson overtook him on the 115th lap. A sixth caution was prompted on the following lap when Kurt Busch spun leaving turn two and hit the inside wall on the backstretch; while attempting to avoid Busch, Sorenson lost control in turn two, and went towards the inside backstretch wall. Most of the leaders, including Kahne, made pit stops for fuel. Harvick and Kahne avoided a collision on pit road. Sadler led the field at the lap-121 restart, followed by Raines and Robby Gordon. Raines passed Sadler to reclaim the lead two laps later, while Sadler <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> pit road with engine problems on lap 125.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in dry weather conditions for most of the 90-minute period and became wet when rain fell in the closing stages which prevented any drivers from improving on their fastest times, Brendon Hartley in Porsche's No. 1 car set an early lap time of one minute and 39.655 seconds which remained the fastest time {{for the remainder of the}} session. He was 1.6 seconds quicker than Romain Dumas in the team's No. 2 entry, who in turn, was two-tenths of a second faster than Loïc Duval in the No. 8 Audi. A LMGTE car impacted Dumas, causing him to spin into the turn seven gravel trap, and sustained damage to his car's right-rear tyre, causing the deployment of a full course yellow flag. He was extracted from the gravel trap and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pit lane for car repairs. Jonny Kane in the No. 36 Signatech Alpine was the fastest driver in LMP2 with a time of one minute and 49.632 seconds set in the session's closing minutes, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Jakes. LMGTE Pro was led by James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE, while Carroll's Gulf Racing car was fastest in LMGTE Am, despite driving off the track in the session's closing minutes.|$|E
50|$|After the party, Bailey <b>drove</b> Smith <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Hackney, {{arriving}} {{there after}} midnight. Before Bailey dropped Smith off at marshes, Smith said to Bailey {{that he would}} leave the disposal {{of the body to}} Cooke.|$|R
5000|$|... "On the 25th", {{according}} to Potocki, [...] "the Cossacks {{moved into the}} field, with Tatars, and so did our army" [...] and [...] "did considerable harm to them and <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the heart}} of the plain he drove them, [...] And he <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hill: [...] To {{the top of the hill}} he drove them, [...] As he {{followed}} them, followed them still!" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{noise of}} the grenades alerted Major Norman to the {{presence}} of Argentines on the island, and he thus <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Government House. Realising that the attack was coming from Moody Brook, he ordered all troop sections to converge on the house to enable the defence to be centralised.|$|E
25|$|Two days later, the Walters's Plymouth Reliant {{was found}} {{abandoned}} in Kentucky, where {{the couple had}} kidnapped Oline Carmical, Jr., a college professor from Williamsburg, and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Dayton with Carmical locked {{in the trunk of}} his car. On July 17, they abandoned this stolen vehicle in Dayton, Ohio, and Carmical, who was still locked in the trunk, was rescued by authorities. Coleman and Brown later received 20-year sentences for a Federal kidnapping charge for bringing Carmical across a state line.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} shock {{prompted}} Gacy {{to call his}} mother {{the next day and}} ask whether his father would allow him to return home. His father agreed and the same day, Gacy <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> live with his family in Chicago. Upon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the Northwestern Business College, from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.|$|E
60|$|He {{started off}} {{without waiting for}} a reply, and all the Americans followed. Together they circled the horses and <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the corral. When Billy had saddled and mounted {{he saw that the}} others had done likewise.|$|R
5000|$|In 1191 {{a revolt}} at Viajaya <b>drove</b> Suryajayavarman <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Cambodia and enthroned Jaya Indravarman V. Vidyanandana revolted against Cambodia, {{occupied}} Viajaya, killed both Jaya Indravarman IV and Jaya Indravarman V, then [...] "reigned without opposition over the Kingdom of Champa." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{talked for}} an hour with the girl, gave her {{explicit}} instructions, thrust some money into her hand, and then <b>drove</b> her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the bend in the path whence she quickly made her {{way up to the}} great house.|$|R
25|$|Two {{weeks into}} their relationship, the couple booked {{into a hotel}} in Bayswater, {{following}} a meal out. In the hotel room, Lynch raped and beat Piper, threatened to cut her with a razor and hang her, and stabbed her {{several times in the}} arms. After eight hours at the hotel, they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Piper's Golders Green flat. Piper was treated for her wounds at Royal Free Hospital, but withheld the nature of the incident from the doctors and police, because she was afraid of Lynch.|$|E
25|$|Qazi {{climbed back}} into his vehicle and drove to a nearby park. After 90 minutes of waiting, he {{realized}} that he was not being actively sought and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his Reston apartment. He hid the rifle in a green plastic bag under a sofa, went to a McDonald's for something to eat, and booked into a Days Inn for the night. He learned from CNN news reports that police had misidentified his vehicle and did not have his license plate number. The next morning, he took a flight to Quetta, Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers {{responded with}} a long 15-play drive to retake the lead on Gary Anderson's 30-yard field goal, making the score 10–7. After a punt, Pittsburgh <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Chiefs 35-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs. Kansas City then took over {{and drove to the}} Steelers 42, but on fourth down and 1, {{defensive}} end Gerald Williams sacked Montana for a 7-yard loss, giving his team the ball on their own 49 with under a minute left. The Steelers made the most of their opportunity, scoring on O'Donnell's 26-yard touchdown completion to Ernie Mills that increased their lead to 17–7 {{at the end of the}} half.|$|E
5000|$|Yes, the 190 {{was causing}} us real {{problems}} at this time. We could out-turn it, but you couldn't turn all day. As {{the number of}} 190s increased, so the depth of our penetrations deceased. They <b>drove</b> us <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the coast really.|$|R
50|$|His volunteers {{had quite}} a few successes over the Ottoman forces, notably at Suldouze where Petros’ 1,500 {{horsemen}} overcame the forces of Kheiri Bey's (8,000 men). Petros also defeated the Ottomans in a major engagement at Sauj Bulak and <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rowanduz.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, dear Fred." [...] And so {{he walked}} down the hill to the priest's house almost triumphantly. He thought himself {{fortunate}} in not finding the priest who had ridden off from Ardkill to some distant part of the parish;--and then <b>drove</b> himself <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Ennis.|$|R
25|$|Price and I <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Panj-kiang {{to obtain}} extra food and water.... We had gone only five miles when we {{discovered}} {{that there was no}} more oil for our motor.... Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E
25|$|Just {{minutes before}} the murder, Sheriff's Deputy Don Welch had driven by and spotted Lunsford {{speaking}} to the men. Moments after the murder, Welch witnessed the suspects speed past him in their vehicle. Welch immediately <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the spot where Lunsford had been and found his dead body. Welch radioed for help, and at around 2:00a.m., Chief Deputy Stanaland, another colleague of Lunsford, found them both. Stanaland noticed the video camera in Lunsford's cruiser. He rewound the video, watched it over and then made a copy of it. The three suspects, realizing Welch had spotted them, abandoned their vehicle {{less than a mile}} from the town of Garrison. They then fled on foot, taking the marijuana with them. Their vehicle was found later in the day.|$|E
25|$|At dusk, {{with the}} dead and wounded piling up, Anderson sent two {{ambulances}} filled with critically wounded men to the bridge under a flag of truce, requesting that they be allowed to pass through to the Allied lines beyond. The Japanese refused, and instead demanded that the Indian brigade surrender, offering {{to care for the}} wounded. Still hopeful of relief, Anderson refused to consider surrendering. The Japanese then ordered that the ambulances were to remain on the bridge to act as a roadblock, and they would be shot if they attempted to move. After dark, Lieutenant Austin and a driver, both of whom were themselves wounded, slipped the brakes of the ambulances, and let them run quietly backwards down the slope from the bridge. Amid the roar of gunfire, they started the engines and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the brigade.|$|E
50|$|Back was {{a master}} of {{controlling}} the ball {{at the back of}} a rolling maul and in 1999 he was Leicester's top try scorer with 16 tries as Tigers often kicked penalties to touch for lineouts near to the opposition's try line, won the subsequent lineout and the pack <b>drove</b> <b>Back</b> over <b>to</b> score.|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{after taking}} the {{checkered}} flag, Alan Kulwicki <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> around <b>to</b> the frontstretch. He proceeded {{to stop at the}} flagstand and turn around, to drive what he referred to as a [...] "Polish victory lap", clockwise (backwards) around the track, waving to fans. It mimicked a similar celebration he did at his first victory in 1988 at Phoenix.|$|R
60|$|While his {{captain was}} repeating his {{inquiries}} for {{instructions on the}} deck of the Basilisk at Greenwich, moored off the Trafalgar Hotel, Tancred fell into reveries of female pilgrims kneeling at the Holy Sepulchre by his side; then started, gave a hurried reply, and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> quickly <b>to</b> town, to pass the remainder of the morning in Brook Street.|$|R
