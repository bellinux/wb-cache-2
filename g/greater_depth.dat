5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{can be used}} to generate tables or schedules matched to a diver's planned dive profile and breathing gas mixtures. The usual procedure is to generate schedules for the intended profile and for the most likely contingency profiles, such as slightly <b>greater</b> <b>depth,</b> delayed ascent and early ascent. Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a more conservative schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a <b>greater</b> <b>depth</b> of interpretation.|$|E
50|$|High {{pressure}} nervous {{syndrome is}} rarely {{of importance to}} recreational divers. Breathing any gas at <b>great</b> <b>depths</b> (hundreds of feet) can cause seizures. Interestingly it was discovered because divers were using gas mixtures without nitrogen {{to be able to}} go to <b>great</b> <b>depths</b> without experiencing nitrogen narcosis. It turns out that nitrogen prevents HPNS. The answer? Add very small amounts of nitrogen to gas mixes when diving at <b>great</b> <b>depth,</b> small enough to avoid nitrogen narcosis, but sufficient to prevent HPNS.|$|R
25|$|At <b>depths</b> <b>greater</b> than a {{few hundred}} metres, the sun has little effect on water {{temperature}}, because the sun's energy has been absorbed by water at the surface. In the <b>great</b> <b>depths</b> of the ocean the water temperature is very low. In fact, 75% {{of the water in}} the world ocean (the <b>great</b> <b>depths)</b> has a temperature between 0°C and 2°C.|$|R
25|$|At <b>great</b> <b>depths,</b> food {{scarcity}} {{and extreme}} pressure works {{to limit the}} survivability fish. The deepest point of the ocean is about 11,000 metres. Bathypelagic fishes are not normally found below 3,000 metres. The <b>greatest</b> <b>depth</b> recorded for a benthic fish is 8,370 m. It may be that extreme pressures interfere with essential enzyme functions.|$|R
5|$|My Iron Lung, an EP {{and single}} {{released}} late in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the <b>greater</b> <b>depth</b> they aimed for on their second album. It {{was their first}} time working with their future producer Nigel Godrich, then working under Leckie as an audio engineer. It was also Radiohead's first collaboration with artist Stanley Donwood, who has produced all of their artwork since. Promoted through alternative radio stations, My Iron Lungs sales were better than expected, and suggested {{for the first time}} that the band had found a loyal fanbase and were not one-hit wonders.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a <b>greater</b> <b>depth.</b> Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|Hunter's {{direction}} in some scenes {{was inspired by}} Otto Preminger's work on the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel. That film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scène; Hunter found himself using several of Preminger's techniques {{to make the most}} out of several of the episode's smaller sets such as the RR Diner. Several scenes in the episode were also shot using a split diopter lens, allowing for a <b>greater</b> <b>depth</b> of field. For example, a scene featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer talking had the actors at either side of a room; the split diopter lens allowed for both of them to still be in sharp focus. The episode ends with a shot featuring a Dutch angle; Hunter was the only director on the series who Frost and Lynch allowed to use this shot, which was otherwise forbidden.|$|E

5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of <b>greater</b> <b>depth</b> perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a <b>greater</b> <b>depth</b> of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{competed in}} the State League for the second {{consecutive}} year in early 2004, and finished with the second-most runs in the competition, scoring 401 runs at an average of 44.55. From New Zealand, she travelled to South Africa to join up with the England team for five ODIs. After scoring 90 runs in a warm-up contest against an Invitational XI, she finished as England's second most prolific run-scorer behind Edwards, though she only once reached a half-century in the international matches. Back in England for the 2004 Super Fours competition, Taylor and Edwards once more headed the batting tables, Taylor narrowly trailing her international team mate in terms of runs scored, but ahead of her on batting average, having scored 351 runs at 87.75. In the subsequent series against New Zealand, Taylor was the top-scorer in the first Twenty20 International match played by either gender. Despite the quicker-scoring nature of the Twenty20 game, Taylor was praised for her measured batting and placement. In the ODIs, England possessed <b>greater</b> <b>depth</b> in their batting, making the team less reliant on Taylor and Edwards' performances. That depth helped them to win the series 3–2, despite a low-scoring sequence of matches for Taylor in which she averaged below twenty.|$|E

5|$|A deep {{stop was}} {{originally}} an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a <b>greater</b> <b>depth</b> than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables. This practice {{is based on}} empirical observations by technical divers such as Richard Pyle, who found that they were less fatigued if they made some additional stops for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with the currently published decompression algorithms. More recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops have become available, but these algorithms {{and the practice of}} deep stops have not been adequately validated. Deep stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues, so the addition of deep stops of any kind can only be included in the dive profile when the decompression schedule has been computed to include them, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Nevertheless, deep stops may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real-time computation, as the PDC will track the effect of the stop on its decompression schedule. Deep stops are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression, but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas, as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long.|$|E
