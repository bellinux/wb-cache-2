2500|$|... “…Let the hours, {{the minutes}} and the seconds pass as they will, {{as long as}} they do so as quickly as {{possible}} so that I can slap that bocú... From today, it is only 18 days until the carnaval starts. How it torments me to think that there are still so many days to go; I wish it were tomorrow;... I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{descended from}} the rooftop to the street, where he got {{into his car and}} drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: [...] "It was a horrible sight. People were still trying to get up. Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what I was seeing. I stopped to reload my camera. I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning {{overhead}} bridge in the background. Then I saw a man pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [...] on the baby. I ran toward the child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
60|$|Saluting, he too {{passed away}} into the dark, and {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of spear-blades striking together and of rifles being cocked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Physician," [...] {{said the}} {{officer of the}} Guard as I went through the gates, [...] "what passes yonder in <b>the</b> Monument? Methought <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God," [...] said Hamilton, softly, as he kneeled beside Harry and {{supported}} his head, while Charley bathed his temples--"thank God that I {{have been in}} time! Fortunately I was walking by the river considerably in advance of Redfeather, who was bringing up <b>the</b> canoe, when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of <b>the</b> fray, and hastened to your aid." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> too--a {{sound like}} a light {{footstep}} following us.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they were}} gone and {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of horses being driven rapidly along the drive.|$|E
60|$|And as I {{went in the}} {{darkness}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of voices and {{the running of the}} feet of Cæsar's messengers.|$|E
60|$|With {{a prayer}} of {{gratitude}} upon my lips I scrambled upward toward the boat's deck. I could not see Thurid and Matai Shang now, but <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of conflict and thus knew that they still fought--the thern for his life and the black for the increased buoyancy that relief from the weight of even a single body would give the craft.|$|R
60|$|The ruse worked, and Thurid fired no more at us. Presently <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> {{diminishing}} <b>sound</b> of whirring propellers {{and realized}} that again I was safe.|$|R
6000|$|... "And it {{is a long}} time," [...] said Mr. Goodenough, {{shaking hands}} with him, [...] "since <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of my own tongue outside my party." ...|$|R
60|$|We stood {{listening}} in breathless silence. Then far away {{through the darkness}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a door creaking upon its hinges.|$|E
60|$|She left {{me to sit}} {{a little}} longer by the screen, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of her feet die out along the gallery above.|$|E
60|$|I cast my {{arm over}} my face and pretended to be asleep. Presently <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a man passing through the bushes, and the Tlascalan stood over me.|$|E
60|$|Yet the {{promises}} of Eleonora were not forgotten; for <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of <b>the</b> swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and once--oh, but once only! I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.|$|R
60|$|Happily {{there was}} no need of this extreme expedient, for I had not been there half-an-hour before <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> harsh <b>sound</b> of an opening lock, and the general himself emerged from the main door.|$|R
40|$|My name is Wilmot, from Liberia. I am 16 years old. At age five, I {{fled from}} Liberia {{with my mother}} to Sierra Leone. I was too young {{at the time to}} really {{understand}} what was happening. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of guns. <b>I</b> saw people running. I saw people shooting. I saw people being killed. I saw people dying. People as young as I were dying [...] . I saw families like mine, in the thousands, leave everything behind and run…The children of Liberia appeal to the Security Council of the United Nations {{to do everything possible to}} stop the fighting in Liberia...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Nay, lord, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound,</b> I saw the light, [...] But since I {{did not see}} the Holy Thing, [...] I sware a vow {{to follow}} it till I saw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Ralph, it {{was here}} that I found you. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of your voice as you knelt praying on this stone, and I {{followed}} it. God heard that prayer, Ralph." ...|$|E
6000|$|As if {{the wind}} blew many ways [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound,</b> and more and more: [...] It seem'd to follow with the Chaise, [...] And still I heard it as before.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> united <b>sound</b> of all <b>the</b> voices, giving {{force to}} these simple and pathetic words, I thought I could see {{something}} {{of the reason why}} that rude old translation still holds its place in Scotland.|$|R
2500|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> tatatatatatatatatat <b>sound.</b> <b>I</b> {{thought it}} was fireworks. An eerie <b>sound</b> fell over <b>the</b> common. The quiet felt like gravity pulling us to the ground. Then a young man's voice: [...] "They fucking killed somebody!" [...] Everything slowed down and the silence got heavier.|$|R
60|$|Presently I became {{certain that}} my {{instincts}} had not deceived me, for <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> quick <b>sound</b> of a bicycle bell. This was odd, for surely {{no one would}} ring {{for me to get}} out of the way. Then there was another tinkle, a little nearer.|$|R
60|$|There was silence, and I {{heard the}} Maid's iron tread pass down the {{creaking}} wooden stairs, and soon <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of singing birds, for my window {{looked out on}} the garden.|$|E
60|$|I saw chivin and chub in {{the stream}} when washing my hands, but my {{companion}} {{tried in vain to}} catch them. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of bullfrogs from a swamp on the opposite side.|$|E
60|$|But behind me, {{coming from}} the village, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of light and rapid footsteps. I turned my head. It was Blanche Moyat, short-skirted, a stick in her hand, a feather stuck through her Tam-o'-Shanter.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> slow, {{deliberate}} <b>sound</b> creeping {{towards me}} again. Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching {{against the walls}} and tapping the furniture.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of loud {{voices from the}} cabin, but to say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other {{thoughts}} that I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to do, I began to pay more heed.|$|R
60|$|It was at {{this very}} moment, above the dreadful turmoil of the roaring flames, the yells of the savages and the shrieks and groans of wounded and dying men, that <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sweetest <b>sound</b> which ever fell upon my ears--the sound of shots being fired, many shots, and quite close by.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] the {{man said}} doggedly. [...] "After he has turned up twice as he has, I shouldn't be {{surprised}} at nothing--not if <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> {{of him and his}} men galloping up outside, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{left the}} room, and {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of running footsteps. The door was opened, and Mary Phillips entered, closely {{followed by the}} captain. I started back; I shouted as if I had a speaking-trumpet to my mouth:-- ...|$|E
60|$|As Martina {{finished}} speaking <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of tramping {{guards and}} of a woman's dress upon the pavement. Then a voice, that of Irene, spoke, and though her words were quiet I caught in them the tremble of smothered rage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was never}} so pleased in my life," [...] Mr. Armstrong said, [...] "as when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> first <b>sound</b> of your guns. Who you were I could not of course make out, but I {{supposed}} {{it must be}} a party from one of the villages which had got news of the attack on us here." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had not <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of voices, but Mrs. Temple turned, startled, {{and looked}} towards the house. I {{followed}} her glance, and suddenly I {{knew that my}} heart was beating.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come hither, oh Holly," [...] she said, [...] "and sit thou at my feet, {{and see me}} {{do justice}} on those who would have slain thee. Forgive me if my Greek doth halt like a lame man; it is so long since <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of it that my tongue is stiff, and will not bend rightly to the words." ...|$|R
