Although legend attributes to him no special powers to bless brews or to make crops grow, tellers of old tall tales are happy to adapt them to fit Gambrinus. Gambrinus stories use folklore motifs common to European folktales, such as the trial by ordeal. Some, of course, imagine Gambrinus {{as a man who}} has an enormous capacity for <b>drinking</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E

25|$|Beer Street and Gin Lane are two prints {{issued in}} 1751 by English artist William Hogarth {{in support of}} {{what would become the}} Gin Act. Designed to be viewed {{alongside}} each other, they depict the evils of the consumption of gin as a contrast to the merits of <b>drinking</b> <b>beer.</b> At almost the same time and on the same subject, Hogarth's friend Henry Fielding published An Inquiry into the Late Increase in Robbers. Issued together with The Four Stages of Cruelty, the prints continued a movement started in Industry and Idleness, away from depicting the laughable foibles of fashionable society (as he had done with Marriage à-la-mode) and towards a more cutting satire on the problems of poverty and crime.|$|E
25|$|Manet's {{paintings}} of café scenes are observations {{of social life}} in 19th-century Paris. People are depicted <b>drinking</b> <b>beer,</b> listening to music, flirting, reading, or waiting. Many of these paintings were based on sketches executed on the spot. He often visited the Brasserie Reichshoffen on boulevard de Rochechourt, upon which he based At the Cafe in 1878. Several people are at the bar, and one woman confronts the viewer while others wait to be served. Such depictions represent the painted journal of a flâneur. These are painted in a style which is loose, referencing Hals and Velázquez, yet they capture the mood and feeling of Parisian night life. They are painted snapshots of bohemianism, urban working people, {{as well as some}} of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
25|$|Pay {{was below}} {{industry}} standard, {{and there was}} no pension scheme. Working conditions could be bad; for example, the engine crews had to work half-cab locomotives tender-first half the time. There was no canteen or washing facilities, and conditions in the workshops at Shepherdswell were very primitive. Nobody seems to have noted any staff toilet there. However, narrative evidence suggests {{that there was a lot}} of spare time on the job, although tales of staff <b>drinking</b> <b>beer</b> in pubs while their trains waited (which would entail instant dismissal on the main line) are probably urban legends. It seems that the staff used the pubs near the railway at Shepherdswell, Eythorne, Woodnesborough and Port Richborough as places to wait over and to have their lunches in the absence of any company facilities (tragically, of these only one of the two station pubs at Shepherdswell survives).|$|E
