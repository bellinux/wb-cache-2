This wall {{is a part of}} temporary shaft that serves for exchange of tunnel boring machines {{and at the same time}} it is a permanent structure of an adjacent metro station. Part of the thesis deals with description of construction sequence of diaphragm walls, excavation of the shaft, excavation of the adjacent metro station and following construction of metro tubes and backfilling of the shaft. Inseparable part of the thesis is assessment of geological conditions and geotechnical parameters. Furthermore, a study on temperature loads on struts was carried out and the results of the study were used for design of the struts. To fulfil the requirements of the assignment several models of the shaft structure and adjacent metro station were built in program Plaxis and one model of the diaphragm wall of the shaft was created in program Geo 5.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of liquefaction on modal parameters (frequency and damping) of pile-supported structures. Four physical models, consisting of two single piles and two 2 [*]×[*] 2 pile groups, were tested in a shaking table where the soil surrounding the pile liquefied because of seismic shaking. The experimental results showed that the natural frequency of pile-supported structures may decrease considerably owing to the loss <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> offered by the soil to the pile. On the other hand, the damping ratio of structure may increase to values in excess of 20 %. These findings have important design consequences: (a) for low-period structures, substantial reduction of spectral acceleration is expected; (b) during and after liquefaction, the response of the system may be dictated by the interactions of multiple loadings, that is, horizontal, axial and overturning moment, which were negligible prior to liquefaction; and (c) with the onset of liquefaction due to increased flexibility of pile-supported structure, larger spectral displacement may be expected, which in turn may enhance P-delta effects and consequently amplification of overturning moment. Practical implications for pile design are discussed...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the quadriceps femoris tendon and femoral fascia attached to the superior pole of the patella and the patellar tendon at the inferior pole, the femoral fascia, vastus medialis muscle and vastus lateralis tendon form the patellar retinaculum to aid extension of the knee. The patella works as a lever arm by separating the point of action of the knee extension system from the rotation centre to increase the extension efficiency [1]. The patella is moved like a pulley in the femoral sulcus {{by the actions of}} the quadriceps femoris and patellar tendon with the bony support augmented by medio-lateral soft tissue restraints [6, 7]; the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), medial patellomeniscal ligament (MPML) and medial patellotibial ligament (MPTL) are closely involved in the medial support system, with the MPFL having the most important role [8]. The <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> system is complex and divided into two layers: a superficial layer comprising of fibrous tissue extending from the anterior vastus lateralis muscle and posterior oblique retinaculum, and a deep layer comprising the patellar epicondylar ligament, deep transverse retinaculum and patellotibial ligament directly attached to the inferior pole of the patella. In addition, the iliotibial ligament is also involved in the stability <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> [9]. Therefore, in {{addition to}} the quadriceps femoris and patellar tendons involved in extension and flexion of the knee joint, many support systems involving soft tissues are circumferentially present around the patella.|$|R

Experiments indicate that the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>lateral</b> <b>support,</b> the direct result of an interference fit between rod and crater, must be on the order of the target’s ballistic-penetration resistance, and does not vary with the impact velocity over the range studied.

The design <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> systems, in {{the context}} of surface excavations, are usually done using {{conventional}} (classical) methods of analysis. For these design procedures limit state assumptions are made concerning the lateral earth pressures acting on the structure to determine the support system characteristics. No information with regard to the deformation of the soil adjacent to the structure can be provided. The objective of this thesis is to examine the finite element method of analysis as an alternative design tool which is adaptable {{to a wide range of}} situations. Finite element models are developed to investigate the influence of the plastic flow rule, wall friction and the soil type on the behaviour of a cantilever support system. Subsequently, the effect of wall stiffness, prop stiffness and the application of prop loads on the performance of a multiple level support system is examined. The results from these studies focus on wall displacements, lateral earth pressures, bending moments, plastic strain patterns and surface settlements behind the wall. The investigation provides extensive information about the entire soil-structure interaction of the system. This potential of the finite element method can be used in the optimization of support system design...|$|R
40|$|Compression {{testing of}} large, thin, {{stiffened}} composite panels is complex {{due to the}} susceptibility of such panels to premature buckling and failure. Such failures are due to the artifacts of testing, such as, offset at load introduction edges, non-uniform distribution of loads, nature <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>supports,</b> crushing <b>of</b> panel edges etc. In this paper, a novel approach for compression loading of thin stiffened composite panels is proposed and validated from finite element analysis supported by tests. Compression loading of such panels (less than 2 mm thick) is challenging since the edges are susceptible to local crushing. To avoid this, loading edges of the panel were encased in mild steel casing blocks filled with finely grounded aluminium powder mixed with epoxy resin. Coupon level tests were conducted to measure mechanical properties of the interface between composite and casting mixture. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was used in these tests to measure the full field strains and to validate numerical simulations. Further, finite element analysis of the actual composite test panel with end casting mixture was performed which indicated that interface shear stresses and compression stresses at maximum expected load are much lower than allowables obtained from specimen tests. Hence, the Aluminium-Epoxy cast mixture proposed in this study can be used safely to cast edges of large stiffened panels for axial compression tests...|$|R

It was a retrospective, consecutive case review of sinus mucoceles treated endoscopically by a single surgeon over a four-year period (1998 - 2002). There were 41 mucoceles in 28 patients, including 24 frontal, eight frontoethmoidal, three ethmoidal, five maxillary and one frontal mucocele. Twenty-one patients underwent the modified Lothrop procedure for frontal mucoceles, and seven underwent simple drainage and marsupialization for frontoethmoidal, ethmoidal and maxillary mucoceles. At median follow-up of 16 months, all patients had a patent mucocele opening. Patients treated by drainage and marsupialization did not have any complications or mucocele recurrence. All patients treated by the modified endoscopic Lothrop procedure had improvement in symptoms and signs. Four patients had minor complications including epistaxis and adhesions and five required further surgery. The average hospital in-patient stay was 2 ± 1. 4 days. Endoscopic techniques, including MELP are effective in the short term for the management of complex and simple paranasal sinus mucoceles. MELP has a useful place in the management of mucoceles with a significant bony partition from an adjacent sinus or nasal cavity.

The main objective of this research work is to investigate the different factors affecting this type of distress. A three-dimensional finite elements model was designed to simulate different loading and shoulder conditions. A half fractional factorial experimental design was made to study five factors, namely, shoulder width, shoulder stiffness, axle load, tire pressure and pavement thickness. Each factor was studied at two levels to simulate extremely low and high conditions. Before carrying out the experimental analysis, a careful examination of the finite elements model was made to ensure accurate predictions. The multilayer elastic solution was carried out using Circly and Everstress software. The results of the multilayer and finite elements analyses were compared to actual measurements of vertical strains using the Transit New Zealand accelerated test track facility (CAPTIF). None of the models provided a perfect match between the measured and predicted vertical strains. The multilayer linear elastic solution and the three dimensional finite elements solutions were reasonably close. The order of importance of the different factors relies on the type of response and the location of that response. The shoulder stiffness was the most important factor affecting the maximum deflection under the outer wheel followed by the axle load, pavement thickness then shoulder width. For the compressive strain {{at the top of the}} subgrade and the maximum deflection between dual, the order of importance of factors was different.

The overall goal of our current project is to develop a sensorimotor adaptability training program to facilitate rapid adaptation to these environments. We have developed a unique training system comprised of a treadmill placed on a motion-base facing a virtual visual scene. It provides an unstable walking surface combined with incongruent visual flow designed to enhance sensorimotor adaptability. Greater metabolic cost incurred during balance instability means more physical work is required during adaptation to new environments possibly affecting crewmembers? ability to perform mission critical tasks during early surface operations on planetary expeditions. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize adaptation to a discordant sensory challenge across a number of performance modalities including locomotor stability, multi-tasking ability and metabolic cost. METHODS: Subjects (n= 15) walked (4. 0 km/h) on a treadmill for an 8 -minute baseline walking period followed by 20 -minutes of walking (4. 0 km/h) with support surface motion (0. 3 Hz, sinusoidal lateral motion, peak amplitude 25. 4 cm) provided by the treadmill/motion-base system. Stride frequency and auditory reaction time were collected as measures of locomotor stability and multi-tasking ability, respectively. Metabolic data (VO 2) were collected via a portable metabolic gas analysis system. RESULTS: At the onset <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> surface motion, subj ects walking on our treadmill showed an increase in stride frequency and auditory reaction time indicating initial balance and multi-tasking disturbances. During the 20 -minute adaptation period, balance control and multi-tasking performance improved. Similarly, throughout the 20 -minute adaptation period, VO 2 gradually decreased following an initial increase after the onset of support surface motion. DISCUSSION: Resu lts confirmed that walking in discordant conditions not only compromises locomotor stability and the ability to multi-task, but comes at a quantifiable metabolic cost. Importantly, like locomotor stability and multi-tasking ability, metabolic expenditure while walking in discordant sensory conditions improved during adaptation. This confirms that sensorimotor adaptability training can benefit multiple performance parameters central to the successful completion of critical mission tasks...|$|R

They {{can grow}} endogenously by inflation of a core and/or exogenously with the extrusion of shear bounded lobes and whaleback lobes at the surface. Internal structure is paramount {{in determining the}} extent to which lava dome growth evolves stably, or conversely the propensity for collapse. The more core lava that exists within a dome, in both relative and absolute terms, the more explosive energy is available, both for large pyroclastic flows following collapse and in particular for lateral blast events following very rapid removal <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> to the dome. Knowledge of the location of the core lava within the dome is also relevant for hazard assessment purposes. A spreading toe, or lobe of core lava, over a talus substrate may be both relatively unstable and likely to accelerate to more violent activity during the early phases of a retrogressive collapse. Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat has been erupting since 1995 and has produced numerous lava domes that have undergone repeated collapse events. We consider one continuous dome growth period, from August 2005 to May 2006 that resulted in a dome collapse event on 20 th May 2006. The collapse event lasted 3 h, removing the whole dome plus dome remnants from a previous growth period in an unusually violent and rapid collapse event. We use an axisymmetrical computational Finite Element Method model for the growth and evolution of a lava dome. Our model comprises evolving core, carapace and talus components based on axisymmetrical endogenous dome growth, which permits us to model the interface between talus and core. Despite explicitly only modelling axisymmetrical endogenous dome growth our core–talus model simulates many of the observed growth characteristics of the 2005 – 2006 SHV lava dome well. Further, it is possible for our simulations to replicate large-scale exogenous characteristics when a considerable volume of talus has accumulated around the lower flanks of the dome. Model results suggest that dome core can override talus within a growing dome, potentially generating a region of significant weakness and a potential locus for collapse initiation. ...|$|R

During implementation several concepts was developed and screened off to finally get the final result. Methods such as QFD, feasibility assessment and Go/No-Go-screening have been implemented. The instructions in the safety standard EN 1176 has been closely followed {{in the development of the}} seesaw. The final concept shows a broad seat with handles, seat backs and footrests on each side of a central section that is in the form of a U. On the sides of the seats there is a high <b>lateral</b> <b>support,</b> to lean against, and a low <b>lateral</b> <b>support.</b> Entry and exit will happen on the side where the low <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> is situated. Rubber buds are placed on the back of the seats and on the outside <b>of</b> the high <b>lateral</b> <b>support,</b> so that an assistant could be able to assist with entry and exit and also to provide extra speed in use. A rubber suspension unit, that makes the seesaw move, restricts the movement to ± 30 ˚. In order to stimulate the senses, such as vision and hearing, a ballgame was placed in the middle part of the platform...|$|R
40|$|An arched {{structure}} {{provides an}} effective load carrying system for large span structures. When {{it comes to}} long span roof structures, timber arches {{are one of the}} best solutions from both structural and aesthetical point of view. Glulam arched structures are often designed using slender elements due to economic consideration. Such slender cross-section shape increases the risk of instability. Instability analysis of straight members such as beam and column are explicitly defined in Eurocode. However, for instability of curved members no analytical approach is provided in the code, thus some numerical method is required. Nonetheless, an approximation is frequently used to obtain the effective buckling length for the arched structures in the plane of arches. In this master thesis a linear buckling analysis is carried out in Abaqus to obtain an optimal effective buckling length both in-plane and out-of-plane for circular glulam arched structures. The elastic springs are used to simulate the overall stiffness of the bracing system. The results obtained by the FE simulations are compared with a simple approximation method. Besides, the forces acting on the bracings system is obtained based on 3 D geometric nonlinear stress analysis of the timber trusses. Our findings conclude that the approximation method overestimates the effective buckling length for the circular glulam arched structures. In addition, the study indicates that the position <b>of</b> the <b>lateral</b> <b>supports</b> {{along the length of the}} arch is an important design aspect for buckling behaviour of the arched structures. Moreover, in order to acquire an effective structure <b>lateral</b> <b>supports</b> are needed both in extrados and intrados. Furthermore, instead of using elastic spring elements to simulate the overall stiffness of the bracing system, a full 3 D simulation of two parallel arches was performed. It was shown that the springs are stronger than the real bracing system for the studied arch...|$|R
