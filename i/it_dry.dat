Dried cassava chips are also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock feed in Ghana. In Malawi, cassava chips are prepared by soaking cassava, slicing it, and then letting <b>it</b> <b>dry.</b> This is the primary means by which cassava is transported to markets from production areas.|$|E
5|$|Darius, therefore, began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to {{completely}} subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Since {{this was to be}} a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stockpiling, and conscription. Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Xerxes' army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the Echeidorus River, his soldiers proceeded to drink <b>it</b> <b>dry.</b> In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.|$|E

25|$|When {{the seal}} is pressed onto the {{printing}} surface, the procedure differs according to plant or silk based paste. For silk based paste, the user applies pressure, {{often with a}} specially made soft, flat surface beneath the paper. For plant based paste, the user simply applies light pressure. As lifting the seal vertically away from its imprint may rip or damage paper, the seal is usually lifted off one side at a time, as if bent off from the page. After this, the image may be blotted {{with a piece of}} paper to make <b>it</b> <b>dry</b> faster, although this may smudge it. Usually {{there needs to be a}} pile of soft felt or paper under the paper to be imprinted for a clear seal impression.|$|E
25|$|A foundry facing mold wash is a {{water-based}} paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite. Painting {{the inside of}} a mold with it and letting <b>it</b> <b>dry</b> leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It {{can be used as a}} dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E

25|$|It inhabits steppe to taiga and {{mountain}} valleys near freshwater, grazing on {{plants such as}} sedges (Cyperaceae), and rarely swimming. It forms small flocks outside the breeding season. In the winter, it grazes on plains and stubble fields, sometimes far from water. Birds return from the winter quarters around April, and the breeding season starts soon thereafter. It breeds as single pairs or loose groups near marshes and other wetlands, with nesting activity starting about May. The clutch is usually 5–6 but sometimes up to 8 eggs, which are laid in a shallow nest made from plants, placed directly on the ground, often on a small knoll to keep <b>it</b> <b>dry.</b> The precocial young hatch after about 28 days and become sexually mature at 2–3 years of age. Around late August/early September, the birds leave for winter quarters, where they gather in small groups to moult their worn plumage.|$|E

The review {{described}} the episode as a [...] "test of patience" [...] due to Merlin's inability to use magic and the [...] "hideously jaunty, distinctly non-medieval soundtrack". Tom Shales of The Washington Post criticised the [...] "sluggish pace" [...] of the premiere, noting that the episode was only [...] "brightened" [...] by the dragon, though similar creatures were common in the genre and it [...] "lacks personality as well as panache". Shales felt that the series took [...] "the stuff of legend and imagination and makes <b>it</b> <b>dry</b> and commonplace". Den of Geek reviewer Mark Pickavance felt that the episode was [...] "uneven and often very stilted", and failed at introducing both the characters and telling the story of the first meeting of Arthur and Merlin.

The Times AA Gill described Merlin as [...] "bland", writing that it was for [...] "a large untapped audience that yearns for Abercrombie & Fitch drama".
