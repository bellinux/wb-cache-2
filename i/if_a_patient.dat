5|$|Once {{a patient}} is {{enrolled}} in hospice, the hospice becomes the insurance payor for that patient for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, the hospice is responsible for all care related to the heart failure. However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E
5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
5|$|The BDI {{suffers from}} the same {{problems}} as other self-report inventories, in that scores can be easily exaggerated or minimized by the person completing them. Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can {{have an effect on}} the final score. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey.|$|E

5000|$|This {{allows the}} {{emergency}} medical provider {{to obtain a}} quick estimate of how much body surface area is burned. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> entire back (18%) and entire left leg (18%) are burned, about 36% of the patient's BSA is affected. The BSAs assigned to each body part refer to the entire body part. [...] So, for example, <b>if</b> half of <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> left leg were burned, it would be assigned a BSA value of 9% (half the total surface area of the leg). Thus, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> entire back (18%), but only half of their left leg (9%) was burned, the amount of BSA affected would be 27%.|$|R
5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is {{resistant}} to either cladribine or pentostatin, then second-line therapy is pursued.|$|E
50|$|Sudden {{withdrawal}} from anticonvulsants {{may lead to}} seizures. It {{is for this reason}} that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> medication is changed, the patient will be weaned from the medication being discontinued following the start of a new medication.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were four}} {{communities}} of leprosy patients around the Honmyōji Temple, {{which was a}} temple of the Nichiren Sect of Buddhism; [...] "leprosy may result <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> faith was not enough", according to their sutra. Therefore, many leprosy patients gathered around the temple and prayed for improvement.|$|R
50|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment consists of thymectomy and immunoglobulin replacement with IVIG (Kelesidis, 2010). Immunodeficiency does not resolve after thymectomy (Arnold, 2015). To treat the autoimmune {{component of the}} disease, immune-suppression is sometimes used and it is often challenging to determine <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> symptoms are infectious or autoimmune (Arnold, 2015).|$|R
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> needs {{frequent}} venous access, {{the veins}} may scar and narrow, making any future access extremely difficult or impossible.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{studies may}} be {{performed}} <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> {{is to be}} evaluated for neurodegenerative disease or to determine the obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is breathing, {{then the}} rescuer will {{continue}} with the treatment indicated for an unconscious but breathing patient, which may include interventions such as the recovery position and summoning an ambulance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> basic {{emotional}} needs are not met in childhood, then schemas, coping styles, and modes can develop. Some basic needs {{that have been}} identified are: connection, mutuality, reciprocity, flow, and autonomy. For example, a child with unmet needs around connection—perhaps due to parental loss to death, divorce, or addiction—might develop an Abandonment schema.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> medical {{condition}} changes {{while still in}} triage, medical personnel can simply tag the patient again with the updated information and label the tags sequentially. The other option {{is to use a}} tag which can be altered so that the priority level can go up or down. This eliminates the need to re-tag the patient.|$|R
50|$|The PRIMUS {{has been}} {{utilized}} {{in clinical trials}} which assess the efficacy of a treatment or medication. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> score on the PRIMUS changes after a trial has taken place, it is inferred that the trial has {{had an effect on}} the patient’s quality of life. PRIMUS has been used to assess the efficacy of fingolimod and rivastigmine.|$|R
25|$|Because drotrecogin-alpha is a {{therapeutic}} protein, {{there exists a}} potential for immunogenicity. Antibodies against drotrecogin have been observed. There is insufficient data {{at this time to}} quantify the risk, but extreme caution should be exercised <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> has previously received drotrecogin-alpha.|$|E
25|$|EMB {{intolerance}} or {{resistance is}} rare. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is truly intolerant or is infected with TB that is resistant to EMB, then 2HRZ/4HR is an acceptable regimen. The main motivator for including EMB {{in the initial}} two months is because of increasing rates of INH resistance.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} Barrett's {{esophagus}} {{do not have}} dysplasia. Medical societies recommend that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> has Barrett's esophagus, and if the past two endoscopy and biopsy examinations have confirmed the absence of dysplasia, then the patient should not have another endoscopy within three years.|$|E

40|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> serum {{creatinine}} {{level is}} elevated and {{chronic renal insufficiency}} is suspected, {{it is important to}} determine whether the problem is acute or chronic; to determine the cause; to identify secondary causes (including multiple myeloma, renal vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, reflux nephropathy, stone disease with infection, and hypertension); to institute measures to slow the disease; and to control hypertension, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis...|$|R
50|$|The profile {{has also}} been {{utilized}} in clinical research studies {{in order to determine}} whether a treatment is effective. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> score on the questionnaire is significantly different after the treatment, this indicates that the treatment has had an effect. Clinical research studies where the NHP was utilized include investigations into erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, glucocorticoid replacement therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for tinnitus.|$|R
25|$|There is an {{intravenous}} preparation available, {{but it is}} irritant to veins, causing phlebitis. Most people {{absorb the}} drug extremely well after taking it orally, so, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> can swallow, {{there is not much}} need to administer it intravenously, even if used to treat endocarditis (infection of the heart chambers).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, U.S. FDA {{recommends}} monitoring closely {{for first}} 6 weeks of therapy for above symptoms {{as there is}} high risk during this time. Monitor for {{up to the first}} 18 weeks of treatment and <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> experiences 1) hepatitis plus rash or other systemic symptoms or 2) severe hypersensitivity or skin rash, nervirapine should not be restarted.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> {{exhibits}} a resistance to or poor response to diuretic therapy, ultrafiltration or aquapheresis {{may be needed}} to achieve adequate control of fluid retention and congestion. The use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits in patients with diuretic resistance and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of diuretics.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that a physician only {{needs to do}} what other physicians typically do (i.e. standard of care). However, {{in the case of}} informed consent, the legal standard is more commonly defined as what <b>a</b> reasonable <b>patient</b> would elect to do if she is informed. So <b>if</b> <b>a</b> reasonable <b>patient</b> would want to be screened if only she is informed or <b>if</b> <b>a</b> reasonable <b>patient</b> would want to receive <b>an</b> amniocentesis <b>if</b> only she is informed of that option, then a physician is legally obligated to inform the patient of these options.|$|R
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> {{presents}} with {{a sudden}} onset of severe symptoms, other forms of abnormal heart rhythm with high heart rate must be ruled out, as some may be immediately life-threatening, such as ventricular tachycardia. While most patients will be placed on continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, an ECG is essential for diagnosis. Provoking causes should be sought out.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November, the United Kingdom {{announced}} plans to build three more Ebola laboratories in Sierra Leone. The labs helped to determine <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> had been infected by the Ebola virus. At that time, it took as much as five days to test a sample because {{of the volume of}} samples that needed to be tested.|$|E
25|$|Although rare, CNS {{disorders}} {{can sometimes}} present as BPPV. A practitioner {{should be aware}} that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> whose symptoms are consistent with BPPV, but does not show improvement or resolution after undergoing different particle repositioning maneuvers — detailed in the Treatment section below — need to have a detailed neurological assessment and imaging performed to help identify the pathological condition.|$|E
30|$|To enable mutual {{adjustments}} (e.g., <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> condition deteriorates) and to {{solve problems}} at the level where the problem occurs, personal coordination is another strategy used at the emergency department (Van de Ven et al. 1976). When analyzing the information processing capacity, there are two critical factors: {{the number of people}} and their competencies(Burton et al. 2015). The decision maker’s capacity and information processing skills are especially important (Galbraith 1974).|$|R
50|$|Non-invasive {{positive}} pressure ventilation {{can be used}} <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> {{vocal cords}} adduct (close) during exhalation. Mild sedatives have also been employed to reduce anxiety as well as reduce acute symptoms of VCD. Benzodiazepines are {{an example of one}} such treatment, though they have been linked to a risk of suppression of the respiratory drive. While Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, does not suppress respiratory drive, it has been thought to be associated with laryngospasms.|$|R
40|$|Even <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> {{access to}} health {{information}} has been enhanced, <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> still doesn't have enough ability to utilize it.
