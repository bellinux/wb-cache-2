40|$|Aim: Present study {{pertains}} to lime treatment of <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> {{to improve its}} digestibility. The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess the in vitro dry matter degradability of total mixed ration containing lime treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> at varied levels of maize replacement to know the optimum level of lime and treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> as maize replacement in small ruminant diets. Materials and methods: Study was carried out in two phases. In phase I, A complete diet was formulated and treated with lime at variable concentrations (0 - 8 %) at 25 % of maize replacement and subjected to in vitro studies as per Tilley and Terry. On the basis of the results of this phase, a concentration of lime for olive treatment was selected and tested at variable levels of maize replacement (0 - 50 %) by treated olive cake in phase II. Data was analyzed as per the procedures suggested by Snedecor and Cochran. Results: The in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of composite diet increased from 43. 95 % at 0 % lime treatment to 48. 68 % on treating with 8 % lime with significant (P< 0. 05) increase at 6 % treatment level. Lime treatment beyond 6 % had no further significant effect on improving the digestibility. Graded levels of maize replacement by <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> treated with 6 % lime (lime percentage selected from phase I) showed that the in vitro digestibility of mixed ration was not compromised up to 40 % replacement level of maize by treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal.</b> Improved digestibility with lime treatment may be due to weakening of internal Hydrogen bonding, thereby disrupting the fiber structure in <b>olive</b> <b>meal.</b> Further lime may be saponifying the high level of fat present in <b>olive</b> <b>meal,</b> which may otherwise negatively impact the digestibility values. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the treatment with up to 6 % of lime can effectively increase the digestibility of <b>olive</b> <b>meal.</b> Treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> can replace up to 40 % of maize from daily ration without affecting the digestibility of composite ration. Thus incorporating lime treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> may prove beneficial to livestock producers. [Vet World 2013; 6 (7. 000) : 440 - 443...|$|R

In the test both <b>meal</b> and pelleted <b>feed</b> were used. The conclusions are: I. <b>Meal</b> <b>feed</b> gave a significantly lower salmonella level than heat-treated, pelleted feed. 2. The number of salmonella positive pigs were lower when using coarse grinding, but the effect of grinding level was not significant (P= 0. 08). 3. Pelleted feed gave a significantly higher production economy compared to <b>meal</b> <b>feed</b> - mainly due to a better feed conversion. 4. The content of starch in manure was affected by both grinding level and the pelleting process. Analyses showed approximately 25 times more starch in manure when using coarse grinded <b>meal</b> <b>feed</b> compared to fine grinded pelleted feed. 5. Pelleted feed gave a significantly poorer gastric health than <b>meal</b> <b>feed.</b> 6. The gastric health was considerably better when using coarse grinded <b>meal</b> <b>feed</b> compared to the other groups tested. It has been concluded that use of coarse grinded <b>meal</b> <b>feed</b> gives a better protection against salmonella, but the poorest economy.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{understanding}} of bicarbonate kinetics and CO 2 retention {{in the body}} is necessary to conduct amino acid tracer oxidation studies in both humans and laboratory animals. Significant metabolic activity is associated with eating which can affect bicarbonate steady state kinetics. A {{study was conducted to}} assess the impact of feeding regimen on the recovery of labelled bicarbonate and energy expenditure in adult female pigs (sows). Five catheterized sows (235 ± 5 kg) were fed semi-synthetic diets as: a single meal 2 h into the infusion after an overnight fast, or in eight hourly meals starting 2 h before the infusion. Oxygen consumption, CO 2 production and 14 CO 2 recovery (ie fraction not retained) were determined during primed, constant intravenous infusions of NaH 14 CO 3. Results The 14 CO 2 recovery (%) after fasting (58. 1 ± 4. 8) was lower than that after single <b>meal</b> <b>feeding</b> (78. 8 ± 5. 9) or hourly <b>meal</b> <b>feeding</b> (81. 0 ± 2. 6, P = 0. 03). CO 2 production correlated with 14 CO 2 recovery during hourly feeding (r = 0. 40, P = 0. 01); this relationship was not significant after single <b>meal</b> <b>feeding</b> (P = 0. 30), probably due to physical activity-associated CO 2 production. Conclusions The correlation of CO 2 retention factors with CO 2 production during hourly feeding suggests that this regimen should be preferred for future amino acid kinetics studies. </p...|$|R
