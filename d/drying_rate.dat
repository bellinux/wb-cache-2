25|$|Air {{circulation}} rate: Drying {{time and}} timber quality {{depend on the}} air velocity and its uniform circulation. At a constant temperature and relative humidity, the highest possible <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> is obtained by rapid circulation of air {{across the surface of}} wood, giving rapid removal of moisture evaporating from the wood. However, a higher <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> is not always desirable, particularly for impermeable hardwoods, because higher drying rates develop greater stresses that may cause the timber to crack or distort. At very low fan speeds, less than 1m/s, the air flow through the stack is often laminar flow, and the heat transfer between the timber surface and the moving air stream is not particularly effective (Walker et al., 1993). The low effectiveness (externally) of heat transfer is not necessarily a problem if internal moisture movement is the key limitation to the movement of moisture, as it is for most hardwoods (Pordage and Langrish, 1999).|$|E

5000|$|In some {{products}} having {{a relatively high}} initial moisture content, an initial linear reduction of the average product moisture content {{as a function of}} time may be observed for a limited time, often known as a [...] "constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> period". Usually, in this period, it is surface moisture outside individual particles that is being removed. The <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> during this period is mostly dependent on the rate of heat transfer to the material being dried. Therefore, the maximum achievable <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> is considered to be heat-transfer limited. If drying is continued, the slope of the curve, the <b>drying</b> <b>rate,</b> becomes less steep (falling rate period) and eventually tends to nearly horizontal at very long times. The product moisture content is then constant at the [...] "equilibrium moisture content", where it is, in practice, in equilibrium with the dehydrating medium. In the falling-rate period, water migration from the product interior to the surface is mostly by molecular diffusion, i,e. the water flux is proportional to the moisture content gradient. This means that water moves from zones with higher moisture content to zones with lower values, a phenomenon explained by the second law of thermodynamics. If water removal is considerable, the products usually undergo shrinkage and deformation, except in a well-designed freeze-drying process. The <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> in the falling-rate period is controlled by the rate of removal of moisture or solvent from the interior of the solid being dried and is referred to as being [...] "mass-transfer limited". This is widely noticed in hygroscopic products such as fruits and vegetables, where drying occurs in the falling rate period with the constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> period said to be negligible.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was the use and evaluation of dynamic modeling techniques to identify mathematical models for cereal <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> and quality changes that best describe thin-layer malt drying data. Seven thin-layer malt drying experiments were performed at the Great Western Malting pilot facilities, Vancouver, WA. Malt moisture content, temperature, β-amylase activity, endo-barley-β-glucanase activity, and color were all monitored as the malt was dried with air at various temperature and relative humidity values. A constrained direct search optimization method was used to fit available drying, enzyme deactivation, and color formation models to the data obtained by minimizing the error between predicted and experimental values. Because the deactivation of β- amylase observed during the kiln experiments was less than the error involved in β-amylase measurement, β-amylase modeling efforts were dropped from the study. The end result is a computer simulation of the malt kilning process that can predict malt <b>drying</b> <b>rates,</b> color formation, and endo-barley-β-glucanase deactivation based on the drying air temperature, relative humidity, and time spent in the kiln.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one way {{to determine}} the best operating conditions would be creating a mathematical model or process model using software to simulate the vibrating fluidized bed for the desired process.The effects of gas velocity and temperature were modelled. One optimal operating condition would be increasing the <b>drying</b> <b>rate.</b> This is because with increased <b>drying</b> <b>rate,</b> the drying process in the vibrating fluidized bed will be shorter giving the vibrating fluidized bed an overall better efficiency. There are 3 major mechanisms which determine the <b>drying</b> <b>rate.</b> The mechanisms are the heat & mass transfer in the gas side, the thermodynamic equilibrium in between the two phases during contact and the heat & mass transfer within the wet solid. These three mechanisms will increase with the increase in gas velocity as well as the heat & mass transfer coefficient. This will then cause the <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> to increase because of the increase in gas temperature which causes the gas humidity to decrease.The effects of particle size were modelled as well. It was found that. Larger particle need longer time to dry to reach the same moisture content due to increase in resistance within the particles against heat and mass transfer. Since the resistance against heat transfer within the particle is lower than the resistance against mass transfer; the convection heat not used to vaporize water is used to elevate the material temperature which will lead to higher moisture transfer coefficients within the particles and will cause higher <b>drying</b> <b>rate.</b> Therefore, it was concluded that for optimum operating conditions to be achieved, the particles which are fed into the vibratory fluidized bed should be decreased. Usually the particle size of the feed material is not a controlled parameter unless methods such as grinding are used but doing so would involve extra operating cost which should be avoided. Hence, another option would be by increasing the intensity of the vibrations in the vibrating fluidized bed.|$|E

40|$|Evaporation is an {{important}} process in water exchange between soil and atmosphere as well as applications in industry. Predictions of <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> from porous media are very difficult due to its highly non-linear behavior with typically high and fairly constant <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> in the beginning followed by a drop to low <b>rates.</b> The high <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> at {{the first stage of}} drying are attributed to the presence of liquid patches retained in corners of the partially air filled pore space that are interconnected to form conductive pathways. Under increasingly dryer circumstances these liquid connections break leading to the diffusion dominated low <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> of the second stage. The maximum extent of this corner flow region that determines the duration of the first stage is controlled by capillary forces opposed by gravity and viscous losses. To quantify these mechanisms, evaporation is studied from a single glass capillary with square cross section. Such geometry shows similar drying curve characteristics as macro-scale porous media with high rates as long as thick capillary sustained corner films extent between the receding meniscus and capillary surface. Increased flow resistance and gravity force as drying proceeds lead to film break-up at certain characteristic meniscus depth LC. LC was studied experimentally for drying of liquids ethanol and water from different capillary sizes under a range of evaporation rates and capillary inclination angles. This way the forces determining the extent of the corner films were changed systematically. Break-up of films as well as evolution of main meniscus depth were monitored to deduce LC and <b>drying</b> <b>rates.</b> For ethanol initial evaporation rates were in the order of 1000 mm/day and dropped abruptly when the corner films broke up. Increasing the evaporation rate led to a shortening of the films, whereas with decreasing gravity component the films became significantly longer. Maximum corner film extent for water was much shorter and mainly limited by corner geometry due to its high contact angle of 30 °. Model predictions on LC based on force balance and corner flow equations gave good results that were in accordance with the experimental data. The roundedness of the capillary corners had a large influence on maximum film length by limiting the curvature of the liquid interface at the capillary surface. This roundedness represents a critical pore size in real porous media that determines the maximum extent of the corner film region...|$|R

50|$|Temperature: If the {{relative}} humidity is kept constant, {{the higher the}} temperature, the higher the <b>drying</b> <b>rate.</b> Temperature influences the <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> by increasing the moisture holding capacity of the air, {{as well as by}} accelerating the diffusion rate of moisture through the wood.The actual temperature in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), which is the temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) is defined as the temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2 m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine {{the relative}} humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100 °C and wet-bulb temperature 60 °C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E
