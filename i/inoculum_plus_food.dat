30|$|A {{new test}} method {{suited for the}} {{assessment}} of the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactant under sewage plant simulation conditions is proposed. The test method foresees that an accurately known amount of the test substance is added to the sludge inoculum, and that the test substance is added in two sequential steps to overcome possible interferences from unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface-activity of the surfactant test substance. By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced in the sludge <b>inoculum</b> <b>plus</b> test substance and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this test allows the quantification of the anaerobic biodegradability of the test substance.|$|R

A substantial and significant reduction in stool output was, however, shown in the groups who received rice based ORS irrespective of feeding. These results show that food does not potentiate the efficacy of either glucose based or rice based ORS in adults with cholera.

30|$|The {{development}} of a new test method suited for the assessment of the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactant under sewage plant simulation conditions is based on an analysis of the existing methods, which are summarized in the Fraunhofer Report on the “Anaerobic Degradation of Detergent Surfactants” to the EU Commission (2002). As the most promising basis, the test method according to DIN 38414, part 8 was chosen. The test method was modified in that way that an accurately known amount of the test substance is added to the sludge inoculum, and that the test substance is added in two sequential steps to overcome possible interferences from unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface-activity of the surfactant test substance. By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced (after the second addition of the test substance) in the sludge <b>inoculum</b> <b>plus</b> test substance and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this test allows the quantification of the anaerobic biodegradability of the test substance.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{characteristics}} and oil types {{as well as}} the efficacy of two fertilizer formulations and three bioaugmentation packages in improving the bioremediation of oil-contaminated soils were assessed as a means of ex situ treatment selection and optimization through seven laboratory microcosm studies. The influence of bioremediation on leaching of oil from the soil was also investigated. The studies demonstrated the benefits of biostimulation to overcome nutrient limitation, as most of the soils were nutrient depleted. The application of both liquid and pelleted slow-release N and P fertilizers increased both the hydrocarbon biodegradation rates (by a factor of 1. 4 to 2. 9) and the percentage of hydrocarbon mass degraded (by > 30 % after 12 weeks and 80 % after 37 weeks), when compared with the unamended soils. Slow-release fertilizers can be particularly useful when multiple liquid applications are not practical or cost-effective. Bioaugmentation products containing <b>inoculum</b> <b>plus</b> fertilizer also increased biodegradation by 20 % to 37 % compared with unamended biotic controls; however, there was no clear evidence of additional benefits due to the inocula, compared with fertilizer alone. Therefore biostimulation is seen as the most cost-effective bioremediation strategy for contaminated soils with the levels of crude oil and refined products used in this study. However, site-specific considerations remain essential for establishing the treatability of oil-contaminated soils...|$|R

40|$|Food {{insecurity}} is {{an important}} barrier to retention in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with HIV infection (PLHIV). However, {{there is a lack}} of rigorous evidence about how to improve food security and HIV-related clinical outcomes. To address this gap, this randomized trial will evaluate three delivery models for short-term food and nutrition support for food insecure PLHIV in Shinyanga, Tanzania: nutrition assessment and counseling (NAC) alone, NAC <b>plus</b> <b>food</b> assistance, and NAC plus cash transfers. At three HIV care and treatment sites, 788 participants will be randomized into one of three study arms in a 3 : 3 : 1 ratio, stratified by site: NAC <b>plus</b> <b>food</b> assistance, NAC <b>plus</b> cash transfer, and NAC only. Eligible participants are: 1) at least 18 years of age; 2) living with HIV infection; 3) initiated ART in the past 90 days; and 4) food insecure, as measured with the Household Hunger Scale. PLHIV who are severely malnourished (body mass index (BMI) < 16 kg/m(2)) will be excluded. Participants randomized to receive food or cash transfers are eligible to receive assistance for up to six months, conditional on attending regularly scheduled visits with their HIV care provider. Participants will be followed for 12 months: the initial 6 -month intervention period and then for another 6 months post-intervention. The primary outcome is ART adherence measured with the medication possession ratio. Secondary outcomes include 1) retention in care; 2) nutritional indicators including changes in food security, BMI, and weight gain; 3) viral suppression and self-reported ART adherence; and 4) participation in the labor force. This rigorously designed trial will inform policy decisions regarding supportive strategies for food insecure PLHIV in the early stages of treatment. The study will measure outcomes immediately after the period of support ends as well as 6 months later, providing information on the duration of the interventions' effect. The comparison of food to cash transfers will better inform policies favoring cash assistance or will provide rationale for the continued investment in food and nutrition interventions for PLHIV...|$|R
40|$|European {{wild rabbit}} populations are declining in Mediterranean ecosystems, where {{the species is}} of special {{conservation}} interest, and translocations {{are one of the}} most-used tools to recover populations. We evaluated the effects of habitat and physiological and immune condition on the short- and long-term survival of translocated adult wild rabbits. Rabbits were released in four different habitat treatments frequently used in conservation programmes: additional shelter, additional <b>food,</b> additional shelter <b>plus</b> <b>food,</b> predator exclusion and control. Before releasing the rabbits, we determined their physiological condition from body-mass and serum levels of urea, creatinine and total protein, and their immune condition from the concentrations of antibodies against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. The risk of dying during the first 18 days post-release was two times lower in the predator exclusion treatment than that in the additional shelter, <b>food,</b> shelter <b>plus</b> <b>food</b> treatments and control. Short-term survival was also negative and positively correlated with creatinine and protein levels, respectively. The risk of dying from 19 to 180 days post-release in the additional food treatment was 10 and nine times lower than in predator exclusion and control, respectively, and negatively correlated with the antibody concentration against myxomatosis. The results suggest that short-term survival was related to predation risk and physiological condition, and long-term survival was related to food availability and myxomatosis incidence. We recommend that translocation programmes should consider using soft-release methods {{to reduce the risk of}} predation and ensure that all individuals are released in the best possible physiological condition to increase their short-term survival. We also suggest that the habitat be managed to ensure that the environment provides the appropriate conditions (i. e. food and shelter) for individuals and population persistence. Immune condition should be taken into account and translocation programmes should consider the origin of donor populations to reduce the variability of pathogen and virus strains. © 2011 The Authors.
