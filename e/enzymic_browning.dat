40|$|The {{phenolic}} {{content of}} sugarcane varieties was analysed during 6, 10 and 12 months age. The total phenolic content (TPC) {{was found to}} increase from 10 to 20 mg/ 100 ml (6 months) to 70 – 90 mg/ 100 ml (12 months) and stabilize during peak maturity period. Concentration of phenolics {{was found to be}} higher at the top portion of the sugarcane. The raw juice from cane samples were clarified by defecation and 30 – 40 % removal of TPC was observed. The sugar samples and the intermediate process products collected from sugar factories were analysed for the phenolic content and colour. Dark coloured sugars and intermediate products were found to have higher phenolics. <b>Enzymic</b> <b>browning</b> due to polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity contributes significantly to colouring of cane juice. The absorbance increased to an extent of 70 – 80 % during the first 10 min of juice extraction. Colour input to sugar process can be reduced by inhibition of PPO activity of cane juice by chemical inhibitors and heating. Ascorbic acid alone inhibited PPO activity by 35 % and to an extent of 85 % combined with heating. Juice holding time in mills for 10 – 15 min increases <b>enzymic</b> <b>browning</b> hence; heating the juice instantly on extraction could reduce the colour formation to an extent of 40 %...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to study {{possible}} pathways {{that lead to the}} development of brown kernel and postharvest rancidity. Inferior kernel quality results in nut rejection and hence leads to economic loss. Postharvest steps are inter-related to each other, therefore this project has attempted to cover as many aspects as possible to give a full understanding of how postharvest treatments affect macadamia quality. The study was conducted on five macadamia varieties including A 38, 246, 816, 842 and Daddow. The study shows that brown kernel can occur through three different pathways including <b>enzymic</b> <b>browning</b> reaction, Maillard reaction and microorganisms infection. To study the <b>enzymic</b> <b>browning</b> reaction, phenolic compounds and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities were analysed. The most common phenolic compounds present in macadamia are gallic acid and chlorogenic acid. Brown section had higher level of bound phenolics compared to the white section of the same kernel. This indicated the likely involvement of phenolic compounds in the formation of brown kernel. The possibility of Maillard reaction involvement was studied by determination of reducing sucrose substrate level by HPLC. Sucrose was hydrolysed into reducing sugars when nuts were subjected to drying using either heat pump or cabinet dryers. Reducing sugars then reacted with kernel protein causing brown pigment via the Maillard reaction. The Daddow variety showed the least hydrolysis degree compared to other varieties. Browning could also be a result of microorganisms infection as infected kernels turned into brown. As the kernel is a biological sample, when it was infected with moulds, it could utilise phenols which act as an anti-pathogenic compound. Analysis of the microstructure of kernels by confocal microscopy showed the distribution of possible brown pigment compounds such as lipid, carbohydrate, protein. Some other novel techniques such as X-ray tomography and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging used in this project provide {{a better understanding of the}} microstructure. The findings of this study have potential to improve the existing postharvest techniques used in the macadamia processing industry...|$|E
40|$|Lychee, {{like most}} arillate fruits, {{deteriorate}} rapidly once harvested. The first visual symptom of deterioration is skin browning. When stored under ambient conditions, the original bright red colour {{may be lost}} within 48 h. It {{has been suggested that}} lychee skin browning is primarily the result of polyphenol oxidase activity degrading the anthocyanins and producing brown coloured by-products. In some countries, sulphur dioxide fumigation has been recently introduced to control skin browning. Sulphur dioxide is an effective inhibitor of polyphenol oxidase and is widely used to control <b>enzymic</b> <b>browning</b> Application of sulphur dioxide however causes a rapid bleaching of the lychee skin. Colour will progressively return, but only to a dull orange colour. Application of 1 N HCl after sulphur dioxide treatment was shown to restore fruit to initial skin colour. Acid treatment is suggested to reverse the bleaching process by affecting the pigment structure...|$|E
40|$|Non <b>enzymic</b> <b>browning</b> (NEB) was {{studied in}} aqueous model systems that {{consisted}} of glucose and glycine at three different solid concentrations (20, 30 and 40 % by weight), each one at three glucose/glycine molar ratios (1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 5 : 1), heat treated for different times at three temperatures (70, 80 and 90 °C). Three different "indicators" of the NEB reaction were used: optical density at 294 nm, carbon dioxide formed via Strecker degradation and volatile compounds formed during the various steps of Maillard reaction. Spectrophotometric and gaschromatographic data were used in order to calculate kinetic constants and activation energy values of NEB reaction. Each indicator showed that the kinetic constant values increased with increasing solid concentration of the solution and heattreatment temperature and with the decreasing of glucose/glycine molar ratios. The activation energy, which causes carbon dioxide formation, {{was found to be}} approximately 100 kjx mol- 1, while for Amadoi compound formation the value of activation energy was about 160 kjx mol- 1 without an evident dependance from the solid concentration of the solution or glucose/glycine molar ratio. In our experimental and analytical conditions, thw measurement of optical density at 294 nm and carbon dioxide detection in the headspace were earlier indicators of the NEB reaction than the volatile compounds detection...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} pH and calcium on {{pericarp}} firmness and pectin solubility {{was investigated in}} tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. ‘Tavira’). Pericarp disks were vacuum-infiltrated with 50 mM CaCI₂ or with distilled water and incubated for 4 h in buffer solutions at pH 4. 5 and 7. 0, and subsequently stored at 2 ◦C for 5 days. CaCl 2 treatment {{had a significant effect}} on firmness retention in disks from turning and ripe fruit. Pericarp disks from mature-green fruit infiltrated with CaCl 2 were firmer than untreated tissue after a 4 h incubation period, but the effect of calcium did not persist during storage at 2 ◦C. pH had a significant effect on the firmness of pericarp disks excised from turning and ripe fruit, but not on mature-green tissue. Treatments at pH 7. 0 caused a reduction of the softening rate in disks from turning and ripe fruit, but had no significant effect at the mature-green stage. Water-soluble pectins decreased significantly in mature-green and ripe pericarp tissue following treatment with CaCl 2 at pH 7. 0, suggesting that pH affects pectin dissolution. Firmness changes induced by pH and calcium after a 4 h incubation treatment were highly correlated with pectin dissolution. The results indicate that, besides calcium, pH contributes to textural changes in tomato fruit pericarp. Since wounding inflicted during processing and acidic solutions used to prevent <b>enzymic</b> <b>browning</b> and microbial growth are likely to acidify the apoplast of fresh-cut fruit, the ability to maintain an apoplastic pH near 7. 0 can significantly contribute to enhanced firmness of fresh-cut fruit...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the International Conference “Environmentally {{friendly}} and safe technologies for quality {{of fruit and}} vegetables”, held in Universidade do Algarve, Faro, Portugal, on January 14 - 16, 2009. This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. The physiological bases for the effectiveness of technologies used in fresh-cut fruit were examined {{in an attempt to}} foster the shift from a market-pull to a science-push innovation model. Respiration rate of fresh-cut ‘Rocha’ pear were measured at various oxygen concentrations. Apparent Km values for oxygen uptake were very close to the fermentation thresholds, indicating that it is physiologically impossible to reduce the respiration rate of fresh-cut pear by more than 50 % without inducing fermentation. Based on this information, we hypothesize that optimizing oxygen concentration inside packages is of little or no value in fresh-cut pears. Additionally, additives used to reduce <b>enzymic</b> <b>browning</b> and softening may have pleiotropic effects on quality. It was found that pH significantly affected the rate and intensity of browning of fresh-cut pears. Browning was more intense in pears treated at pH 3. 0 and less pronounced at pH 7. 0, but the softening rate was lower at the latter pH value. Calcium salts also affected texture and color in a salt-specific manner. Larger color changes were observed with propionate and lactate. Although calcium ascorbate reduced color changes, fruit slices treated with this salt were softer than those treated with calcium propionate, lactate or chloride. Based on the physiological information gathered, we will develop and evaluate an integrated process to maximize the quality of fresh-cut ‘Rocha’ pear throughout the distribution chain...|$|E
