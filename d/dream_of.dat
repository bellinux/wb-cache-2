5|$|Despite the {{fluctuating}} critical {{assessment of}} the various works over the years, Elgar's major works {{taken as a whole}} have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s.

Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, {{and more than a dozen}} of The <b>Dream</b> <b>of</b> Gerontius. Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed.
