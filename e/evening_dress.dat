Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's <b>evening</b> <b>dress</b> included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E

25|$|During the 1880s, formal <b>evening</b> <b>dress</b> {{remained}} a dark tail coat and trousers {{with a dark}} waistcoat, a white bow tie, and a shirt with a winged collar. In mid-decade, the dinner jacket or tuxedo, was used in more relaxed formal occasions. The Norfolk jacket and tweed or woolen breeches were used for rugged outdoor pursuits such as shooting. Knee-length topcoats, often with contrasting velvet or fur collars, and calf-length overcoats were worn in winter. Men's shoes had higher heels and a narrow toe.|$|E

Enka singers, predominantly women, usually perform in a kimono or in <b>evening</b> <b>dress.</b> Male enka performers tend to wear formal dress, {{or in some}} performances, traditional Japanese attire. Nods to traditional Japanese music are common in enka. The melodies of enka are fundamentally Western harmonies, and electronic instruments are used, such as synthesizers and electric lead guitar with plenty of distortion, but its musical instruments also include traditional Japanese instruments such as the shakuhachi and the shamisen.|$|E

25|$|The 1937 Lobster Dress was {{a simple}} white silk <b>evening</b> <b>dress</b> with a crimson {{waistband}} featuring a large lobster painted (by Dalí) onto the skirt. From 1934, Dalí had started incorporating lobsters into his work, including New York Dream-Man Finds Lobster in Place of Phone shown in the magazine American Weekly in 1935, and the mixed-media Lobster Telephone (1936). His design for Schiaparelli was interpreted into a fabric print by the leading silk designer Sache. It was famously worn by Wallis Simpson {{in a series of}} photographs by Cecil Beaton taken at the Château de Candé shortly before her marriage to Edward VIII.|$|E

25|$|Duchamp {{participated in}} the design of the 1938 International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held at the Galerie des Beaux-arts, Paris. The show {{featured}} more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations. The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray, Salvador Dali, and Max Ernst to help him. At the exhibition's entrance he placed Salvador Dalí's Rainy Taxi, a work consisting of a taxicab rigged to produce a drizzle of water down the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and a blond mannequin covered with live snails in the back. In this way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full <b>evening</b> <b>dress.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Titanic is {{the best}} known aspect of Dorothy's life. After a six-week {{vacation}} in Italy with her mother, she was returning on the Titanic {{to make a new}} series of pictures for Eclair at Fort Lee. The women had been playing bridge with friends in the lounge {{on the night of the}} ship's fatal collision with the iceberg. With two of their game partners they escaped in Lifeboat #7, the first lifeboat launched. After arriving in New York on the rescue ship Carpathia, Dorothy was persuaded by her manager to appear in a film based on the sinking. She not only starred in the one-reel drama but also wrote the scenario. She even appeared in the same clothing she had worn aboard the Titanic that night—a white silk <b>evening</b> <b>dress</b> topped with a cardigan and polo coat.|$|E
25|$|Waistcoats (called vests in American English) {{were almost}} always worn with suits {{prior to the}} 1940s. Due to {{rationing}} during World War II, their prevalence declined, but their popularity has gone {{in and out of}} fashion from the 1970s onwards. A pocket watch on a chain, one end of which is inserted through a middle buttonhole, is often worn with a waistcoat; otherwise, since World War I when they came to prominence of military necessity, men have worn wristwatches, which may be worn with any suit except the full <b>evening</b> <b>dress</b> (white tie). Although many examples of waistcoats worn with a double-breasted jacket can be found from the 1920s to the 1940s, that would be unusual today (one point of a double-breasted jacket being, it may be supposed, to eliminate the waistcoat). Traditionally, the bottom button of a waistcoat is left undone; like the vents in the rear of a jacket, this helps the body bend when sitting. Some waistcoats can have lapels, others do not.|$|E

25|$|Three editions were {{published}} 1929–1931 in English and German. The British Library holds a reference copy. In this whodunit novel, private detective Will Disher {{is described as}} suave, plump, astute and bored, but Scotland Yard still asks him for help in solving the mystery. The plot begins with the masked-murderer scenario, this one being a toff in <b>evening</b> <b>dress.</b> Much of the plot takes place in an English country house, {{and some of it}} is set in London, but the general setting is the marshland just south of Herne Bay and Birchington in Kent. Real local place names such as Maypole, Whitstable and Stodmarsh are transmuted into fictional places with names such as the Hope Poles Inn, Winstonlea and Stodmere Farm, and a chase through countryside at night evokes the true atmosphere of the marshes around the rivers Stour and Wantsum with their dykes or banked drainage trenches, twisting lanes and dark woods.|$|E
25|$|The {{theater was}} a popular highly popular form of {{entertainment}} for almost all classes of Parisians during the First Empire; there were twenty-one major theaters active, and more smaller stages. At {{the top of the}} hierarchy of theaters was the Théâtre Français (today the Comédie-Française), at the Palais-Royal. Only classic French plays were performed there. Tickets ranged in price from 6.60 francs in the first row of boxes down to 1.80 francs for a seat in the upper gallery. <b>Evening</b> <b>dress</b> was required for the premieres of plays. At {{the other end of the}} Palais-Royal the Théâtre Montansier, which specialized in vaudeville and comedy. The most expensive ticket there was three francs, and audiences were treated with a program of six different farces and theater pieces. Another highly popular stage was the Théâtre des Variétés on Boulevard Montmartre. on owners of theater regularly invited fifty well-known Paris courtesans to the opening nights, to increase the glamour of the events; the courtesans moved from box to box between acts, meeting their friends and clients.|$|E
