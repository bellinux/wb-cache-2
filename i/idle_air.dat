The total time spent by freight vehicles waiting in queue or the average queue length evaluate the efficiency of the LB.

Receivers at the retail mall stores also see increased variability of delivery time with higher costs of personnel and probability of stock out. From an environmental standpoint, queueing freight vehicles often keep the engine on or <b>idling,</b> generating <b>air</b> and noise pollution, with negative impacts to the surrounding environment and to the shoppers.|$|R

It was very edifying to see these unbelievers shake their heads and frown, and hear them hold forth strongly upon navigation: not that they knew anything about it, but that they always mistrusted the captain in calm weather, or when the wind was adverse. Indeed, the mercury itself is not so variable as this class of passengers, whom you will see, when the ship is going nobly through the water, quite pale with admiration, swearing that the captain beats all captains ever known, and even hinting at subscriptions for a piece of plate; and who, next morning, when the breeze has lulled, and all the sails hang useless in the <b>idle</b> <b>air,</b> shake their despondent heads again, and say, with screwed-up lips, they hope that captain is a sailor - but they shrewdly doubt him.|$|E

6000|$|That small song {{has served}} {{to remind me}} of two small books I brought into the garden to read--the works of two modern minor poets whose [...] "wren-like warblings," [...] I imagined, would suit my mood and the genial morning better than the {{stirring}} or subtle thoughts of greater singers. Possibly in that I was mistaken; for there until now lie the books neglected on a lawn chair within reach of my hand. The chair was dragged hither half-an-hour ago by a maiden all in white, who appeared half inclined to share the mulberry shade with me. She did not continue long in that mind. In a lively manner, she began speaking of some trivial thing; but after a very few moments all interest in the subject evaporated, and she sat humming some <b>idle</b> <b>air,</b> tapping the turf with her fantastic shoe. Presently she picked up one of my books, opened it at random and read a line or two, her vermilion under-lip curling slightly; then threw it down again, and glanced at me out of the corners of her eyes; then hummed again, and finally became silent, and sat bending forward a little, her dark lustrous eyes gazing with strange intentness through the slight screen of foliage into the vacant space beyond. What to see? The poet has omitted to tell us to what the maiden's fancy lightly turns in spring. Doubtless it turns to thoughts of something real. Life is real; so is passion--the quickening of the blood, the wild pulsation. But the pleasures and pains of the printed book are not real, and are to reality like Japanese flowers made of coloured bits of tissue paper to the living fragrant flowers that bloom to-day and perish to-morrow; they are a simulacrum, a mockery, and present to us a pale phantasmagoric world, peopled with bloodless men and women that chatter meaningless things and laugh without joy. The feeling of unreality affects us all at times, but in very different degrees. And perhaps I was too long a doer, herding too much with narrow foreheads, drinking too deeply of the sweet and bitter cup, to experience that pure unfailing delight in literature which some have. Its charm, I fancy, is greatest to those in whom the natural man, deprived in early life of his proper aliment, grows sickly and pale, and perishes at last of inanition. There is ample room then for the latter higher growth--the unnatural cultivated man. Lovers of literature are accustomed to say that they find certain works [...] "helpful" [...] to them; and doubtless, being all intellect, they are right. But we, the less highly developed, are compounded of two natures, and while this spiritual pabulum sustains one, the other and larger nature is starved; for the larger nature is earthly, and draws its sustenance from the earth. I must look at a leaf, or smell the sod, or touch a rough pebble, or hear some natural sound, if only the chirp of a cricket, or feel the sun or wind or rain on my face. The book itself may spoil the pleasure it was designed to give me, and instead of satisfying my hunger, increase it until the craving and sensation of emptiness becomes intolerable. Not any day spent in a library would I live again, but rather some lurid day of labour and anxiety, of strife, or peril, or passion.|$|E

5000|$|Most rotaries had normal inlet valves, so {{that the}} fuel (and {{lubricating}} oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine. Although a conventional carburetor, {{with the ability to}} keep the fuel/air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings, was precluded by the spinning crankcase; it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate flap valve or [...] "bloctube". The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a manual choke control). Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to <b>idle,</b> the <b>air</b> valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{heavy-duty}} trucks idle a significant amount. Heavy-duty line-haul engines idle about 20 - 40 % {{of the time the}} engine is running, depending on season and operation. Drivers idle engines to power climate control devices (e. g., heaters and air conditioners) and sleeper compartment accessories (e. g., refrigerators, microwave ovens, and televisions) and to avoid start-up problems in cold weather. <b>Idling</b> increases <b>air</b> pollution and energy use, as well as wear and tear on engines. Efforts to reduce truck idling in the US have been sporadic, in part because it is widely viewed in the trucking industry that further idling restriction would unduly compromise driver comfort and truck operations. The auxiliary power unites (APUs) available to replace the idling of the diesel traction engine all have had limited trucking industry acceptance. Fuel cells are a promising APU technology. Fuel cell APUs have the potential to greatly reduce emissions and energy use and save money. IN this paper, we estimate costs and benefits of fuel cell APUs. We calculate the payback period for fuel cell APUs to be about 2. 6 - 4. 5 years. This estimate is uncertain since future fuel cell costs are unknown and cost savings from idling vary greatly across the truck fleet. The payback period is particularly sensitive to diesel fuel consumption at idle. Given the large potential environmental and economic benefits of fuel cell APUs, the first major commercial application of fuel cells may be as truck APUs. fuel cell, truck, diesel, power unit, evaluation...|$|R
5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough <b>idle</b> when the <b>air</b> conditioning was on.

Revised engine materials and an integrated crank-case cover reduced the engine weight by 2 kg. The VTEC operation was further refined such that in gears 1-5 four-valve operation engaged at 6,300 rpm for wide open throttle, otherwise at 6,750 rpm, and remaining at 6,750 rpm in 6th gear.

The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the Oxygen sensor (O2), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and Coolant Temperature sensor (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC's outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the <b>Idle</b> <b>Air</b> Control (IAC) valve.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} cab comfort truck drivers have to idle their engine to obtain the required power for accessories, such as the air conditioner, heater, television, refrigerator, and lights. This idling of the engine has {{a major impact on}} its fuel consumption and exhaust emission. Idling emissions can be as high as 86. 4 g/h, 16, 500 g/h, 5130 g/h, 4 g/h, and 375 g/h for HC, CO 2, CO, PM, and NOx, respectively. Idling fuel consumption rate can be as high as 1. 85 gal/h. The accessory loading, truck model, fuel-injection system, ambient temperature, idling speed, etc., also affect significantly the emission levels and fuel consumption rate. An increase in accessory loading and ambient temperature increases the emissions and fuel consumption. During idling, electronic fuel-injection systems reduce HC, PM, and CO emission, but increase NOx emissions compared with a mechanical fuel-injection system. An increase of idling speed increases fuel consumption rate. There are many systems available on the market to reduce engine <b>idling</b> and improve <b>air</b> quality and fuel consumption rate, such as an auxiliary power unit (APU), truck stop electrification, thermal storage systems, fuel cells, and direct fire heaters. A direct fire heater reduces fuel consumption by 94 - 96 % and an APU reduces consumption by 60 - 87 %. Furthermore, these technologies increase air quality significantly by reducing idling emissions, which is the reason why they are considered as key alternatives to engine idling.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. An analytical model was developed for predicting the thermal joint resistance of nonconforming rough surfaces {{in contact with the}} presence of air under atmospheric pressure as a TIM. Accordingly four models were developed in the present work. The thermal macrocontact resistance was modeled for the transition case, with the existence of surface roughness and surface out of flatness. The microcontact radius was modeled correlating the microcontact radius to the relative applied pressure, which was used with the !henna! constriction parameter to develop an accurate nondimensional contact conductance and thermal microcontact resistance. The thermal microgap resistance model is derived assuming the TIM is air under atmospheric pressure and taking into account the effect of surface curvature. The microgap resistance has the largest values among the other components, since the TIM which was air has very low !henna! conductivity and a small microgap area. The !henna! macrogap resistance builds up in the region surrounding the macrocontact area which was also <b>IDled</b> with <b>air</b> under atmospheric pressure as TIM. Throughout the above analytical work it was assumed that the surface asperities deform plastically while the bulk material deform elastically as been assumed by almost the majority of the researchers in this field. On the other hand and in order to support the present theoretical models, an experimental investigation was carried out to measure the !henna! joint resistance for the contact of nonconforming rough surfaces with air under atmospheric pressure as a TIM. A laboratory experimental setup was designed and implemented. The examined contacting surfaces were aluminium and brass. Many surface processes were done comprising cutting, chemical cleaning, and ultrasonic cleaning. Also many geometrical and mechanical parameters were measured for the contacting samples that include, surface roughness, surface asperity slope, surface out-<lf-flatness, and material bulk hardness. Collected data are tabulated and the related equations were used to calculate the heat flux, temperature drop, and the thermal joint resistance, as well as their estimated error. The measured results were compared with the theoretical model mentioned above and a good agreement is observed. The differential error estimated for the thermal joint resistance is ranged from (0. 00248) to (0. 00557) °C/w. ksb 201...|$|R
6000|$|There {{they were}} yet again, accordingly, {{for two days}} more; when Strether, on being, at Mrs. Pocock's hotel, ushered into that lady's salon, found himself at first {{assuming}} a mistake {{on the part of}} the servant who had introduced him and retired. The occupants hadn't come in, for the room looked empty as only a room can look in Paris, of a fine afternoon when the faint murmur of the huge collective life, carried on out of doors, strays among scattered objects even as a summer <b>air</b> <b>idles</b> in a lonely garden. Our friend looked about and hesitated; observed, on the evidence of a table charged with purchases and other matters, that Sarah had become possessed--by no aid from HIM--of the last number of the salmon-coloured Revue; noted further that Mamie appeared to have received a present of Fromentin's [...] "Maitres d'Autrefois" [...] from Chad, who had written her name on the cover; and pulled up at the sight of a heavy letter addressed in a hand he knew. This letter, forwarded by a banker and arriving in Mrs. Pocock's absence, had been placed in evidence, and it drew from the fact of its being unopened a sudden queer power to intensify the reach of its author. It brought home to him the scale on which Mrs. Newsome--for she had been copious indeed this time--was writing to her daughter while she kept HIM in durance; and it had altogether such an effect upon him as made him for a few minutes stand still and breathe low. In his own room, at his own hotel, he had dozens of well-filled envelopes superscribed in that character; and there was actually something in the renewal of his interrupted vision of the character that played straight into the so frequent question of whether he weren't already disinherited beyond appeal. It was such an assurance as the sharp downstrokes of her pen hadn't yet had occasion to give him; but they somehow at the present crisis stood for a probable absoluteness in any decree of the writer. He looked at Sarah's name and address, in short, as if he had been looking hard into her mother's face, and then turned from it as if the face had declined to relax. But since it was in a manner as if Mrs. Newsome were thereby all the more, instead of the less, in the room, and were conscious, sharply and sorely conscious, of himself, so he felt both held and hushed, summoned to stay at least and take his punishment. By staying, accordingly, he took it--creeping softly and vaguely about and waiting for Sarah to come in. She WOULD come in if he stayed long enough, and he had now more than ever the sense of her success in leaving him a prey to anxiety. It wasn't to be denied that she had had a happy instinct, from the point of view of Woollett, in placing him thus at the mercy of her own initiative. It was very well to try to say he didn't care--that she might break ground when she would, might never break it at all if she wouldn't, and that he had no confession whatever to wait upon her with: he breathed from day to day an air that damnably required clearing, and there were moments when he quite ached to precipitate that process. He couldn't doubt that, should she only oblige him by surprising him just as he then was, a clarifying scene of some sort would result from the concussion.|$|R
