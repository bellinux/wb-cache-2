5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions <b>it</b> <b>raises.</b> <b>The</b> third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E
25|$|Choline {{deficiency}} {{may play}} a role in liver disease, atherosclerosis, and possibly neurological disorders. One sign of choline deficiency is an elevated level of the liver enzyme ALT. If low choline intake causes an elevated homocysteine level, <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> risk for preeclampsia, premature birth, and very low birth weight.|$|E

25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of testicular cancer requires examining the histology of tissue obtained from an inguinal orchiectomy - that is, surgical excision {{of the entire}} testis along with attached structures (epididymis and spermatic cord).

25|$|In December 2016, Knights of the Eternal Throne was {{released}} as the sixth expansion that {{coincided with the}} game's five-year anniversary. It continues {{the story of the}} Outlander. Subscribers received one level 65 character token, with additional tokens available at the cartel store.

25|$|If {{civilian}} control {{is the critical}} variable for military effectiveness, <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> question of how {{civilian control}} is then to be determined. Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for civilian control – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, he meant a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, he meant the legal-constitutional framework that guided political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.|$|E

25|$|The {{occurrence}} of gout {{is connected with}} an excess production of uric acid. A diet rich in sucrose may lead to gout as <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> level of insulin, which prevents excretion of uric acid from the body. As the concentration of uric acid in the body increases, so does the concentration of uric acid in the joint liquid and beyond a critical concentration, the uric acid begins to precipitate into crystals. Researchers have implicated sugary drinks high in fructose in a surge in cases of gout.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen (H2) {{has been}} used in deep diving gas mixes but is very {{explosive}} when mixed with more than about 4 to 5% oxygen (such as the oxygen found in breathing gas). This limits use of hydrogen to deep dives and imposes complicated protocols to ensure that excess oxygen is cleared from the breathing equipment before breathing hydrogen starts. Like helium, <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> timbre of the diver's voice. The hydrogen-oxygen mix when used as a diving gas is sometimes referred to as Hydrox. Mixtures containing both hydrogen and helium as diluents are termed Hydreliox.|$|E

25|$|Considerable scepticism is {{therefore}} warranted {{as to whether}} this type of south-pointing chariot, using a differential gear for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south-pointing doll was fixed {{to the body of}} the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do this just before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This could have been done without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{manufacturers}} {{are faced with}} problems stemming from their leverage, from aspects of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, from their visibility, and from the logistics of managing the testing of large varieties of products. Large manufacturers {{tend to be very}} leveraged, and use their eligible inventory as their borrowing base. Because the inventory is going to become unsalable on 10 February 2009, there will be an abrupt change in their borrowing base. This {{raises the question of whether}} corporate officers can legitimately claim inventory in their current borrowing base. Because many of these loan agreements and all publicly traded companies require audited financial statements at the end of the year, inventories will be tested. This will result in a negative change in valuation and a sharp reduction or termination of available credit. For public companies, <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> issue of whether those officers are making false representations, introducing the specter of criminal liability under Sarbanes-Oxley.|$|E

500|$|A University of California {{research}} team, led by Nobel Prize winner Stanley Prusiner, {{has provided}} evidence for the theory that infection can occur from prions in manure. [...] And, since manure is present in many areas surrounding water reservoirs, as well as used on many crop fields, <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> possibility of widespread transmission. [...] It was reported in January 2011 that researchers had discovered prions spreading through airborne transmission on aerosol particles, in an animal testing experiment focusing on scrapie infection in laboratory mice.

The Baker-Ripley Neighborhood Center, in Greater Sharpstown, was scheduled to open in December 2009. The center consists of a [...] campus with five buildings. Designed by New Orleans-based Concordia architects and landscaped by Asakura Robinson Company, the site contains a farmers market, health clinic, outdoor film venue, publicly accessible library, school, and some outdoor recreation areas. The center design incorporates architectural influences from Mexican and South American art. Rosa Gomez, an employee of Neighborhood Centers, said that the organization did not want Baker-Ripley to appear [...] "too fancy or official looking" [...] so as not to intimidate recent immigrants. The non-profit organization Project for Public Spaces assisted in the development of Baker-Ripley. The organizers consulted residents of Gulfton and Sharpstown on the design of the center. Susan Baker, the wife of James Baker, a former U.S. Secretary of State, organized a fundraising campaign for the center. The center offers English and computer classes. Neighborhood Centers received a United States Department of Education Promise Neighborhood planning grant, used to fund its Gulfton Promise Project, a program to guide residents from birth until they obtain careers.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} since 1992 of extrasolar planets, or planet-sized objects {{around other}} stars ( [...] such planets in [...] planetary systems including [...] multiple planetary systems as of [...] ), has widened {{the debate on}} the nature of planethood in unexpected ways. Many of these planets are of considerable size, approaching the mass of small stars, while many newly discovered brown dwarfs are, conversely, small enough to be considered planets. [...] The material difference between a low-mass star and a large gas giant is not clearcut; apart from size and relative temperature, there is little to separate a gas giant like Jupiter from its host star. Both have similar overall compositions: hydrogen and helium, with trace levels of heavier elements in their atmospheres. The generally accepted difference is one of formation; stars are said to have formed from the [...] "top down," [...] out of the gases in a nebula as they underwent gravitational collapse, and thus would be composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, while planets are said to have formed from the [...] "bottom up," [...] from the accretion of dust and gas in orbit around the young star, and thus should have cores of silicates or ices. As yet it is uncertain whether gas giants possess such cores, though the Juno mission to Jupiter could resolve the issue. If it is indeed possible that a gas giant could form as a star does, then <b>it</b> <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> question of whether such an object should be considered an orbiting low-mass star rather than a planet.|$|E
