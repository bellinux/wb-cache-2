5|$|Miskovsky {{was born}} on May 11, 1926 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Jaroslav Miskovsky, an {{immigrant}} from Czechoslovakia, and Ruth Miskovsky (nee Patera). He grew up during the Great Depression, but his family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> significant economic harm. Miskovsky's father was heavily involved in Chicago politics, and Miskovsky would frequently help him deliver food and clothes to people unable to afford them.|$|E

A Breusch-Godfrey test 5 was also applied {{in order to test}} for higher order autocorrelation [23]. The null hypothesis of no autocorrelation could not be rejected on a 5  % level, {{indicating that the}} model <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from autocorrelation of higher order. The model was also tested for heteroscedasticity using White’s general test. 6 The null hypothesis of no could not be rejected indicating that the model <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from heteroscedasticity.|$|R

On {{one of her}} homeward {{journeys}} from China, she struck an uncharted rock at , near the island of Pulo Goondy (modern day Pulau Legundi), located just south of Sumatra. She <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> any ill effects {{as a result of}} this incident however, which is mentioned in journals of the time only for its noteworthiness as a navigation hazard to other shipping.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, Headley's {{average in}} Test matches of 60.83 is third highest {{among those with}} 2,000 runs, behind Bradman and Graeme Pollock, and but for the Tests he played after the war, {{he would have been}} above Pollock. In all {{first-class}} matches, he has the third highest average with 69.86, behind Bradman and Vijay Merchant among those who played 50 innings. He averaged a century every fourth innings in which he batted, second again to Bradman, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> a poor series in his career before the war.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28January, the 4thDestroyer Flotilla resumed its journey south and put into Bergen. Z31 entered one of the town's docks to be {{repaired}} while Z34 and Z38 departed on the evening of 28January. The two ships were attacked from the air the next day, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> any damage and sheltered in a fjord south of Stavanger during daylight hours. They put to sea again on the evening of 29January and eventually reached Kiel in Germany on 1February.|$|E
5|$|The German {{attacks on}} Nauru {{refers to the}} two attacks on Nauru in December 1940. These attacks were {{conducted}} by auxiliary cruisers between 6 and 8December and on 27 December. The raiders sank five Allied merchant ships and inflicted serious damage on Nauru's economically important phosphate-loading facilities. Despite {{the significance of the}} island to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru was not defended and the German force <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> any losses.|$|E
5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were {{responsive to the}} helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the rudder hard over.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E
5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia has, on the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much {{larger numbers of}} mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he believes it is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E

5|$|Muntz {{designed}} a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver {{to concentrate on the}} road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness was {{composed}} by Peter Connelly and Martin Iveson. The soundtrack, compared to earlier {{entries in the}} franchise, was far more orchestral. It {{was also one of}} the few areas of the game's development that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> setbacks or similar problems. The score was recorded live by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, London, in 2002. It was orchestrated by Peter Wraight and conducted by David Snell. The Europe-exclusive 'Collector's Edition' of the game included eight tracks from the game's soundtrack on the bonus documentary DVD. These tracks were later release as a stand-alone Audio CD.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many places}} in London, the Old Kent Road area <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> {{significant}} bomb damage during World War II. In 1968, a flyover {{opened at the}} northern end allowing access to New Kent Road which catered for the main flow of traffic. During the 1970s, run-down Victorian properties on and around Old Kent Road were demolished {{to make way for}} new housing estates. Burgess Park was created as part of the County of London Plan in 1943, which recommended new parkland in the area. Several tower blocks were built along the road, although some earlier 19th-century buildings, such as Nos.360–386, survived.|$|E
30|$|The {{popularity}} of automatic stabilizers arises {{because they are}} rule based and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from information and implementation lags. Moreover, they are by nature symmetric; that is, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> from a pro-cyclical bias {{or any of the}} other problems associated with discretionary policies. The virtues of automatic stabilizers are commonly shared and therefore the calls to strengthen them in the wake of the Great Recession.|$|R

5|$|With {{the units}} in the rear, the only {{communications}} method was via the intercom. Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the voice channel for 15 seconds every minute for the pip-squeak system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied that addressed this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A speaking tube was tried but found to be useless. Newer VHF radios being developed through this same period <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> these problems, and the Blenheims were moved {{to the front of}} the queue to receive these units.|$|E
5|$|American {{aircraft}} also attacked {{several other}} ships docked at Yokosuka. The unfinished Matsu class destroyer Yaezakura broke {{in two and}} sank after being bombed, and the submarine I-372 was destroyed by another bomb; {{at the time the}} submarine's crew was ashore and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> any fatalities. Two escort vessels and a torpedo boat were also sunk. In addition to these losses, five other ships, including the obsolete destroyer Yakaze and training ships Fuji and Kasuga were damaged. Despite their proximity to Nagato, Fukugawa Maru No.7 and Ushio were not damaged. The British and United States aircraft dispatched against airfields claimed to have destroyed 43 Japanese aircraft and damaged another 77. The pilots of these aircraft also claimed the destruction of several railway locomotives. Allied losses in the attacks made on 18July were 12 U.S.Navy aircraft, two Royal Navy aircraft and 18 aircrew. The Allied pilots were disappointed they had not sunk Nagato, despite the battleship being the primary target of the raid.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career alternating between the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons. At the outbreak of World War I, she escorted troop convoys from North Africa to France. She then joined the naval operations off the Dardanelles, where she participated in a major attack on the Turkish fortresses in the straits on 18 March 1915. During the attack, she was hit approximately eight times by shellfire, though <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>suffer</b> fatal damage. She struck a mine at around 3:15, and sank within two minutes; only some 50 men were rescued from a complement of 710. Two British battleships were also sunk by mines that day, and the disaster convinced the Allies to abandon the naval campaign {{in favor of an}} amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E
