25|$|After {{five years}} of non stop {{recording}} and touring and having lost touch with reality, the band {{decided to take a}} sabbatical in 1997. They worked on some demos in January 1998, but did not find the band dynamics revitalized, and the trio decided to split up on 10 March 1998 when discussing the future of the band on a bench in the Rosenborg Castle Gardens. The split occurred amidst a wave of prominent Danish bands disbanding. Critics would later explain their decision as the band <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> stop in time despite enormous success, although it was largely due to fatigue that the trio could not bring themselves to continuing to play. Their tastes in music had also become less compatible, with Christensen wanting a more vintage Beatles-like sound and Nielsen and Friis preferring to make heavy metal music.|$|E

The bill was her first major initiative as a minister. She said that at present in Italy, [...] "as in {{the great majority of}} Western countries", brothels and the exploitation of prostitutes by pimps were illegal but prostitution as such was not. She described street prostitution as a [...] "shameful phenomenon". Carfagna was criticized by prostitutes' representatives and other charities for introducing the bill. However, some Catholic charities praised her for <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> [...] "take on prostitution as a serious social evil".|$|E
500|$|The October 1970 Quebec FLQ Crisis put Lewis in the spotlight, {{as he was}} {{the only}} NDP MP with any roots in Quebec. He and Douglas were opposed to the October 16 {{implementation}} of the War Measures Act. The Act, enacted previously only for wartime purposes, imposed extreme limitations on civil liberties, and gave the police and military vastly expanded powers for arresting and detaining suspects, usually with little to no evidence required. Although it was only meant to be used in Quebec, since it was federal legislation, it was in-force throughout Canada. Some police services, from outside of Quebec, took advantage of it for their own purposes, which mostly had nothing even remotely related to the Quebec situation, as Lewis and Douglas suspected. Sixteen of the 20 members of the NDP parliamentary caucus voted against the implementation of the War Measures Act in the House of Commons. They took much grief for being the only parliamentarians to vote against it. [...] Lewis stated at a press scrum that day: [...] "The information we do have, showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec. But, there is no information that there was unintended, or apprehended, or planned insurrection, which alone, would justify invoking the War Measures Act." [...] About five years later, many of the MPs who voted to implement it regretted doing so, and belatedly honoured Douglas and Lewis for their stand against it. [...] Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield {{went so far as to}} say that, [...] "Quite frankly, I've admired Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, and those fellows in the NDP for <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> vote against that, although they took a lot of abuse at the time....I don't brood about it.

500|$|The Secretary General of Amnesty International, said: [...] "the Chinese {{government}} might see {{this is as}} a victory, but they would be mistaken... Because, while the other chairs in the packed hall {{on the day of}} the awards ceremony will each hold only one person, Liu's empty chair will hold... the thousands of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience [...] victims of prosecution and persecution simply for <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> voice their views." [...] On the other hand, in an article appearing in China Daily, David Gosset of the China Europe International Business School said the award was [...] "a sad paradox, a prize without any real winner, which generates mistrust and perplexity when understanding and clarity are most needed". Gosset believed that only citizens were able to define the exact terms and pace of democratisation in their own country, and lamented the [...] "fallacy" [...] of implicitly associating the PRC with German Nazism or South African apartheid, and emphasised that China, a developing country with a per capita GDP of $3,700, could hardly adopt the socio-political standards of the developed world without attenuating its development. He also argued that the choice of Liu was divisive in view of China's memory of Western imperialism, and of Alfred Nobel's dying wish to reward a person [...] "who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations". Professor Sidney Rittenberg said: [...] "One does not have to approve of Mr Liu's imprisonment in order to disapprove of his choice as a Nobel laureate... Not only have courageous, intelligent individuals like Mr Liu made no tangible contribution to China's advance, not only have their activities and his choice for a Nobel Prize made life more difficult for China's dissidents—but the main point is that his advocacy of a multiparty system for the China of today would almost certainly lead to disaster, if carried out. To wit, Iran after the overthrow of the shah." ...|$|E

Glenn {{claims that}} Speak [...] "has generated more academic response {{than any other}} novel Anderson has written." [...] Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with [...] "mature subject matter," [...] English teachers are implementing Speak in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives {{students the opportunity to}} talk about several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching Speak in the classroom Jackett says, [...] "We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students' lives. <b>Having</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> discuss the issues found in Speak is one way to do just that." [...] By sharing in Melinda's struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching Speak in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. Students may not feel comfortable talking about their own experiences, but they are willing to talk about what happens to Melinda. Elaine O'Quinn claims that books like Speak allow students to explore inner dialogue. Speak provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.|$|E

60|$|But this Shavian {{worship of}} life {{is by no means}} lively. It has nothing in common either with the braver or the baser forms of what we {{commonly}} call optimism. It has none of the omnivorous exultation of Walt Whitman or the fiery pantheism of Shelley. Bernard Shaw wishes to show himself not so much as an optimist, but rather as a sort of faithful and contented pessimist. This contradiction is the key to nearly all his early and more obvious contradictions and to many which remain to the end. Whitman and many modern idealists have talked of taking even duty as a pleasure; {{it seems to me that}} Shaw takes even pleasure as a duty. In a queer way he seems to see existence as an illusion and yet as an obligation. To every man and woman, bird, beast, and flower, life is a love-call to be eagerly followed. To Bernard Shaw it is merely a military bugle to be obeyed. In short, he fails to feel that the command of Nature (if one must use the anthropomorphic fable of Nature instead of the philosophic term God) can be enjoyed as well as obeyed. He paints life at its darkest and then tells the babe unborn to take the leap in the dark. That is heroic; and to my instinct at least Schopenhauer looks like a pigmy beside his pupil. But it is the heroism of a morbid and almost asphyxiated age. It is awful to think that this world which so many poets have praised has even for a time been depicted as a man-trap into which we may just have the manhood to jump. Think of all those ages through which men have talked of <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> die. And then remember that we have actually fallen to talking about <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> live.|$|E
