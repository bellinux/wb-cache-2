This chapter has been written as if Elin has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, for her contribution to design, resource use, material innovation, and evolving new value systems - through her pioneering work in fashion. The speech is being given at a school in Stockholm, to students {{between the ages of}} 16 - 18, and reflects upon the various phases of her career. Elin is being recognised for the way in which she strategically built her knowledge and skillset - and her fashion label ‘’INNER/OUTER’ - over a fifteen year period. Her work as a fashion designer has {{had a profound effect on}} the industry through her approach to the circular economy; her experimentation with materials, process, technology and systems design; her empathy and progressive social vision for production workers; and her political activism. Although she is a fictitious character, everything the authors say she has achieved is technically possible, and is based on current academic or industry research.

40|$|The {{framework}} {{of this study}} is the potential use of molten salts in the nuclear <b>industry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Those systems properties have been determined from finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations with a realistic representation of the interatomic interactions (the dipole-polarizable ion model, DIPPIM). Among the quantities that can be obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, structural and dynamic properties hold particular interest for this work : those are mandatory to determine the various molten salts capabilities for being used as coolants in nuclear reactors, or the speciation of fission products in silicate glasses. This work has been particularly focused on the effect of adding small amounts of oxides in a fluorozirconate based molten salt. The formation of molecular ions based on strong Zr–O–Zr bonds results in an important medium-range ordering of the system and in a noticeable slowing of the dynamics of the ions, accompanied by an increase of the viscosity.
