In a 2014 interview, Cudi spoke on his struggles with depression and suicide throughout the years: [...] "I’ve dealt with suicide {{for the past five}} years. There wasn’t a week or a day that didn’t go by where I was just like, ‘You know, I wanna check out.’ I know what that <b>feels</b> <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> know it comes from loneliness, I know it comes from not having self-worth, not loving yourself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Waverley {{arrived as}} a love {{interest}} for Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) {{and as part}} of the McKenna family unit. Sixteen-year-old Claire Chitham auditioned for the role and ended up winning it. After several months on the show, producers decided the character of Waverley had run her desired course and she was written off. Chitham believed her time on the soap was over and finished school, started a degree and began acting in other jobs. However, in 1998 Chitham was contacted by the show with a pitch that would see Waverley return in a 3-month stint. Chitham was hugely surprised as nothing of that calibre had happened before in the show and she happily accepted. She stated, [...] "It’s good to be back. When you know how the system of this place operates it’s very easy to slip back in, so it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> never was away." ...|$|E

50|$|An individual’s {{experience}} of mortification may {{be accompanied by}} both physical and psychological sensations. Physical sensations such as: burning, painful tingling over the body, pain in the chest that slowly expands and spreads throughout the torso, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, blanching, coldness and numbness can be experienced by the individual suffering from mortification. The psychological sensations described are feeling shocked, exposed, and humiliated. Descriptions of this experience can be, for example: “It <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> won’t survive” and “I have the absolute conviction {{that he or she}} hates me and it’s my fault”. These sensations are always followed by shock, although they may have happened on various occasions, they also prompt the need for the individual suffering to do something both internally and externally, to effect a positive self-image in the eyes of their narcissistic object. Narcissistic mortification is extreme in its intensity, global nature, and its lack of perspective, causing the anxiety associated with it to become traumatic.|$|E
5000|$|Okami {{was next}} {{scheduled}} to return at UFC 104 against Chael Sonnen. Okami lost to Sonnen via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27). After the fight, Okami trained at Team Quest with Sonnen {{for one month}} before returning to Japan. Sonnen stated in an interview “I want {{to say hello to}} my brother, Yushin through this interview. I am saddened that he returned to Japan - it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> parted with a close friend. Though Yushin lost against me, he came forward and asked to train with me: Is this a Japanese thing? It is admirable that he tried to learn from an opponent who defeated him. While at Team Quest in Portland, he thoroughly handled me during training. I was lucky that I managed to defeat him in our fight. I probably won’t agree to a rematch with him (laughs). The one fighter whom I never want to fight again - that is Yushin Okami.” ...|$|E

Following Kyle being rapidly aged and returning to town, Hood stated that his new agenda was to [...] "be close to his dad and move on with his life". However, Hood talked about how Kyle's goal to [...] "live a happy full life" [...] may not happen because he just happened to have [...] "stepped into this situation where the woman who killed his mother is still here." [...] Kyle was [...] "less than pleased" [...] that his father Jack was re-developing a relationship with his ex-wife Nikki, who killed his mother in self-defense. Hood further said: [...] "What’s great is that Kyle’s come back and is so much older now. It really <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> can do whatever I want with the character ... Kyle hasn’t seen these people in 15 years or so." ...|$|E

5000|$|Hilton has {{received}} steady acclaim for her compositions. She cites Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and Horace Silver as her most important compositional influences. Hilton continues to evolve as a composer, using jazz concepts like improv, free jazz and shifting modal key centers for impressionistic compositions like [...] "When it Rains." [...] Hilton continues to use ideas from other art forms, using jazz concepts in a [...] "painterly" [...] fashion. [...] "French composers like Debussy used harmonic 'impressionism,' but I {{like to use}} improvisational ideas in an impressionistic way," [...] she told Phil Freeman of Burning Ambulance. [...] "Seurat's pointillism technique is something I have applied to music, for example." [...] "Music feels like my first language," [...] she added. [...] "It <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> can create an experience compositionally that allows others to also feel that experience, much like a good writer being able to describe love, or a painter or photographer creating an image. I think I can compose and play the sound of twilight, of a warm summer's day, of love or grief, of a subway or dolphins even. I think of my - and our - music as abstract or non-figurative paintings." ...|$|E
5000|$|Six {{had success}} with the film The Human Centipede. Although met with mixed reviews and reactions, The Human Centipede {{garnered}} widespread attention. The first film's success gave Six the flexibility he needed {{to work on a}} sequel, The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence), eventually leading to a trilogy. He made the first film to get viewers comfortable with the idea of the Human Centipede. Both the controversial content of the first film and the second's brutal depictions of sexual violence have generated controversy. In the United Kingdom, the BBFC declined to issue an 18 certificate for The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence), highlighting the antagonist's [...] "total degradation, humiliation, mutilation, torture, and murder of his naked victims". Six then submitted a new cut with two minutes and 37 seconds removed and received the 18 certificate. Six responded with mixed feelings. On one hand, he was devastated that he had to cut his film, on the other hand, the decision of the BBFC gained a lot of press and notoriety. About cutting the film he says: [...] "In the UK, censors cut many minutes from The Human Centipede 2 by law. It <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> made a comedy and they cut out all the good jokes. It’s appalling. Nobody is forced to see a movie." ...|$|E

Speaking of his studio sessions on the album, Ne-Yo told his producers that he wanted the album - which he described to Blues & Soul as [...] "lyrically honest to a fault" [...] - to be meaningful. [...] "One thing that I told everybody going into this is, 'I don't want you making a track like you're making a track for Ne-Yo. Just {{do what you do}} and let the fact that I'm on it be the Ne-Yo element. There is no way to expand and grow if everybody you're working with wants to keep you in a box." [...] Some critics responded to the comments made by Ne-Yo and {{came to the conclusion that}} the singer had [...] "lost touch" [...] with his R&B roots. During a visit to Angie Martinez' Hot 97 radio show, Ne-Yo addressed his critics saying [...] "I know where I came from. I know that R&B is where it started at for me... When this new album comes out, it will shut the mouths of everybody who <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> have 'crossed over'."

5000|$|Wigmore {{accepted}} the role after confirming with producers {{that she would}} not be replicating Foell's interpretation of Justine. Despite playing the role of a middle aged mother, Wigmore was only 29 when she was cast, just 6 years older than her onscreen son Lee Donoghue. Wigmore quit the role in 2008 to travel overseas, she stated, [...] "it was sad to say goodbye, {{to a lot of people}} on Shortland Street, I’ll be sad to say goodbye to a regular job too. The show’s been incredible and has given me so much experience as an actress. But a couple of years working there is about right for me." [...] Following her departure from the soap on 11 September 2008, the media began to speculate that Justine would return to finish off [...] "loose-ends". The following year, Wigmore's agent was contacted by producers of the show, inquiring if Wigmore was able to return in a guest stint. Wigmore was happy to return, [...] "I couldn't wait to catch up with all of the cast and crew. Everyone is such fun to work with. It's strange though, now that I'm back, it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> only left yesterday!" [...] Producer, Steven Zanoski was pleased Justine was back, [...] "Justine's storyline left audiences with lots of unanswered questions, so it's brilliant to have her back to tie up those loose ends." ...|$|E
5000|$|The record's {{lyrics are}} very {{personal}} in nature. The first track, [...] "This Is Gospel", whose lyrics {{were written by}} Urie and bassist Dallon Weekes, was written about Spencer's drug addiction. The original demo sat on Urie's laptop for months before he finally shared it {{with the rest of}} the band. The album's lead single, [...] "Miss Jackson", was written about Urie's first sexual experiences during his youth. [...] "When I was younger, I would mess around; I'd sleep with one girl one night, sleep with her friend the next night, and not care about how they felt, or how I made them feel. And then it happened to me and I realized 'Wow, that's what that <b>feels</b> <b>like?</b> <b>I</b> feel really shitty.'" [...] A hidden preview of [...] "Vegas Lights" [...] was featured in the announcement video of Fall Out Boy's Save Rock and Roll fall arena tour. [...] "Vegas Lights" [...] was intended as an anthem for carefree nights in Las Vegas, that most prominently reflected how Urie felt clubbing. [...] "I felt this weird energy where everybody was having a good time, and it didn't matter," [...] he remarked. [...] "Dancing like nobody's watching. It was kind of beautiful.". The song also uses a sample from [...] "Number 5", (a song used on Sesame Street in the 1970s) at the beginning of the song. [...] "Girl That You Love" [...] was originally written in French following a five-day vacation in France. Bassist Dallon Weekes, who also performed lyrical duties for the album, later penned the English lyrics for the song based on Urie's French demo.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the success}} of the 2017 American superhero film Wonder Woman based on the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, directed by Patty Jenkins, Carter was recently asked about how playing the Diana Prince/Wonder Woman character for a long time, and having so closely identified with her, what it was like seeing someone else play her? Carter responded, [...] "When it was first given a green light, it would be dishonest of me to say I didn't have a little pang of [...] "well, here it goes." [...] But after my first conversation with Patty Jenkins, I felt I had linked arms with a woman who I would go though {{the rest of my life}} with. And then when I met Gal, I linked the other arm with her. The three of us really understand what being on the inside of Wonder Woman's skin <b>feels</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> mean, so does anyone who ever believed in herself as Wonder Woman, whether it was a little girl or a gay boy - they know, too. But there's a perspective that comes from being famous for it. She is strong, and she can do anything, and there's this goodness to her. There's beauty and strength that transcend time and events. People relate to her - we are her. You and I are her, and that's why you see those little signs and T-shirts that say things like [...] "Wonder Woman works here" [...] or [...] "My mom is Wonder Woman." [...] Patty Jenkins was able to bring that all to the big screen".|$|E
