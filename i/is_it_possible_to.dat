25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> speak of a gene for long legs? It {{is because of the}} phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|As {{was shown}} in the section on {{properties}} of linear representations, we can, by restricting to a subgroup, obtain a representation of a subgroup starting from a representation of a group. Naturally {{we are interested in}} the reverse process: <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> obtain the representation of a group starting from a representation of a subgroup? We will see, that the induced representation, which will be defined in the following, provides us with the necessary concept. Admittedly, this construction is not inverse but adjoint to the restriction.|$|E

Disney heir Abigail Disney made her directorial debut with The Armor of Light, which follows pro-life Evangelical minister Rev. Rob Schenck, Lucy McBath, the mother of teenager Jordan Davis, and attorney John Michael Phillips as they interact in the years post shooting. The film follows Rev. Schenck as he meets McBath, a pro-choice Christian, and her attorney John Phillips. It leads to the question: <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> be both pro-gun and pro-life? The Armor of Light premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2015 before opening theatrically on October 30, 2015. In 2017, it was nominated for an Emmy Award.|$|E
25|$|This {{branch of}} {{recursion}} theory analyzed the following question: For fixed m and n with 0<m<n, for which functions A <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> compute for any different n inputs x1,x2,...,xn a tuple of n numbers y1,y2,...,yn such {{that at least}} m of the equations A(xk) = yk are true. Such sets are known as (m,n)-recursive sets. The first major result in this branch of Recursion Theory is Trakhtenbrot's result that a set is computable if it is (m,n)-recursive for some m,n with 2m>n. On the other hand, Jockusch's semirecursive sets (which were already known informally before Jockusch introduced them 1968) are examples of a set which is (m,n)-recursive {{if and only if}} 2m<n+1. There are uncountably many of these sets and also some recursively enumerable but noncomputable sets of this type. Later, Degtev established a hierarchy of recursively enumerable sets that are (1,n+1)-recursive but not (1,n)-recursive. After a long phase of research by Russian scientists, this subject became repopularized in the west by Beigel's thesis on bounded queries, which linked frequency computation to the above-mentioned bounded reducibilities and other related notions. One of the major results was Kummer's Cardinality Theory which states that a set A is computable if and only if there is an n such that some algorithm enumerates for each tuple of n different numbers up to n many possible choices of the cardinality of this set of n numbers intersected with A; these choices must contain the true cardinality but leave out at least one false one.|$|E
500|$|When {{constructing}} continuous-time stochastic processes certain mathematical difficulties arise, {{due to the}} uncountable index sets, {{which do}} not occur with discrete-time processes. [...] One problem is that <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> have [...] more than one stochastic process with the same finite-dimensional distributions. For example, both the left-continuous modification and the right-continuous modification of a Poisson process have the same finite-dimensional distributions. This means that {{the distribution of the}} stochastic process does not uniquely specify the properties of the sample functions of the stochastic process.|$|E

500|$|In {{classical}} Athens, women ideally remained {{apart from}} men. This ideology of separation {{was so strong}} that a party to a lawsuit (Lysias' Against Simon) could claim that his sister and nieces were ashamed to be in the presence of their male relatives as evidence that they were respectable. Some historians have accepted this ideology as an accurate description of how Athenian women lived their lives; W. B. Tyrrell, for example, said: [...] "The outer door of the house is the boundary for the free women". [...] However, even in antiquity it was recognised that an ideology of separation could not be practiced by many Athenians.

500|$|Philosophy of {{economics}} is {{the branch of}} philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to economics.

The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods {{rise to the level of}} epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society? ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 25, 2009, by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane. It was written by fellow executive producer and series regular Danny Smith and directed by Joseph Lee, during the show's eighth production season. The storyline was pitched by series regular Tom Devanney, and periodically references Billions and Billions (1997), a book of essays by Carl Sagan. [...] Seth MacFarlane asked Danny Smith to read Sagan's essay, [...] "Abortion: <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>Possible</b> <b>to</b> Be Both 'Pro-Life' and 'Pro-Choice'", before beginning to write the script. The episode was originally intended to air {{along with the rest}} of the eighth season schedule, and was approved for production by 20th Century Fox. However, the Fox Broadcasting Company asserted their right not to air the episode due to the subject matter. This was the second time that MacFarlane had been warned by Fox about the sensitive nature of an episode's subject. Previously, the network had also disapproved of the season 3 episode [...] "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein", which was originally prevented from airing on Fox, but finally aired on Adult Swim, and eventually on Fox more than four years after it was rejected. Thinking the same would happen with [...] "Partial Terms of Endearment", MacFarlane believed that Fox would eventually run the episode on their network, stating, [...] "Most of the time these things turn out to be nothing." [...] In a statement released by Fox, they noted their full support of [...] "the producers' right to make the episode and distribute it in whatever way they want." ...|$|E
