50|$|Most of the {{law will}} {{be found in the}} German Civil Code, ss. 2064 - 2273. A <b>holograph</b> <b>will,</b> either single or joint, is allowed. Other wills must be notarially executed, {{declared}} before a judge, or (if outside Germany) a consul. Two witnesses are required, unless the witness is a notary or a clerk of court (court registrar), any of whom will suffice. The formalities may be relaxed in certain cases, such as imminent death, a state of siege, a prevailing epidemic, etc. Freedom of testation is constrained by the rules of forced heirship: descendants, ascendants, and the spouse are all entitled to forced shares (aka legal right shares). Forced heirs may only be disinherited for certain specified kinds of misconduct. Will contracts are invalid; however, a pactum successorium (aka contract concerning succession) made inter vivos is valid in certain cases and will operate on the death of the deceased. The two main types of pacta successoria are the contractual disclaimer of interest (Erbverzichtvertrag) and deed of variation (Erbauskaufvertrag). Revoking a will works much the same as in England, except with respect to marriage. One particular form of revocation in Germany occurs when a will is found to be inconsistent with a pactum successorium; in such an event the will is wholly or pro tanto revoked.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the morbidity structure among testators whose wills were challenged as well as to reveal if there is a specific relationship between certain diagnostic categories in the testators’ health status and forensic psychiatry expert opinion on testamentary incapacity. Subjects and methods: The authors analyzed 156 consecutive forensic psychiatry reports on retrospective, determination of testamentary capacity made in the Forensic Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Belgrade in the period 1965 - 2005. The wills covered by this study were mostly made by male, 65 years old or older testators, with primary education, who executed a <b>holograph</b> <b>will</b> and survived it for less than a year. Results: Testamentary incapacity for medical reasons was established in 47 % of the testators, while a strong, statistically significant relationship between a diagnostic category and testamentary incapacity was established among the testators suffering from an organic mental disorder (Chi-square = 133. 256, p = 0. 000) or a substance induced mental disorder (Chi-square = 6. 971, p = 0. 008). Conclusion: Testamentary capacity is a specific focus of medical assessment given that the evidence for overturning a will is generally dependent upon medical assessment. In that respect, much litigation and expenses could be avoided if medical experts were given a chance to correctly assess the testamentary capacity of a person at the time of making a will. The fact remains that our findings may not be a representative cross-section of the general population, and this important issue certainly deserves to be addressed by future research based on a larger sample...|$|E
