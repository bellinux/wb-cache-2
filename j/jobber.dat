5|$|Two {{months later}} Bob Holly made his initial {{appearance}} in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Again, he was portrayed as a <b>jobber.</b> His sole match was a teaming with Mike Sample in a loss to The Bushwhackers on the March 30 edition of WWF Superstars (match was taped on March 11 in Pensacola, Florida).|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{there were}} nearly 25,000 filling {{stations}} in the UK, of which 10,000 were independents (typically, privately owned and supplied by a major or <b>jobber</b> while using a brand under license). By the end of 1999, the number of filling stations had dropped to 13,700 and to 9,700 {{at the end of}} 2005. In recent years, filling stations have been closing at a rate of 50 per month. Many of the smaller and independent stations have succumbed to competition from out-of-town supermarkets that undercut local enterprises through sheer volume of sales and shared overheads.|$|E
5|$|Well Dunn {{continued}} {{to face the}} top teams in the WWF, including The Smoking Gunns, The Headshrinkers, and the newly formed team of Sparky Plugg and the 1-2-3 Kid. When The Smoking Gunns were unable to compete due {{to the birth of}} Billy Gunn's son, Well Dunn competed against The Heavenly Bodies instead; these matches were unusual, as they pitted heel tag teams against each other. As in 1993, Well Dunn lost more matches than they won in each series, but they had occasional victories against established tag teams and were often booked to defeat <b>jobber</b> tag teams.|$|E
50|$|World Championship Wrestling, (WCW) {{just like}} the WWE, made huge use of <b>jobbers</b> during the late 1980s and 1990s. <b>Jobbers</b> like Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker, Bobby Walker and Trent Knight lost the {{majority}} of their matches. However, they usually scored clean victories against other pure <b>jobbers.</b> Wrestlers who worked as <b>jobbers</b> for WWE were also employed as <b>jobbers</b> in WCW during this period.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{downfall}} of the NIRA, the majors continued to operate the dancing partner program to stabilize oil prices on a voluntary basis. (It had always been voluntary.) Although the majors accomplished their goal of price stabilization by decreasing the amount of gasoline placed on the market, the reduced volume caused some independent <b>jobbers</b> to complain. The dancing-partner cartel benefited the majors and the small, independent refiners. But the <b>jobbers</b> were compensated on a cost-plus basis. They sold to retailers at approximately 3½ cents per gallon over the spot-market wholesale price that <b>jobbers</b> paid refiners. When gasoline prices were depressed, consumers bought more gasoline, and <b>jobbers</b> made more money; when gasoline prices were higher, consumers bought less gasoline, and <b>jobbers</b> made less money. By increasing the spot market price and hence lessening demand, the dancing-partner program hurt the <b>jobbers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The club played {{mostly in}} the Western League. However, the club began play as the Wichita <b>Jobbers,</b> {{a member of the}} Western Association. The <b>Jobbers</b> played in the Western Association from 1905-1908, winning the league {{championship}} in 1905 and 1907. The 1907 <b>Jobbers</b> were {{recognized as one of the}} 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.|$|R
25|$|After {{a year in}} New Japan, Tanaka started wrestling as a <b>jobber</b> in Jim Crockett Promotions in 1985.|$|E
25|$|While Paul Diamond left WCW soon after, Tanaka would {{continue}} to appear on WCW programming (as Pat Tanaka) as a <b>jobber</b> to the stars.|$|E
25|$|Guerrero {{debuted in}} WCW in 1989 as a <b>jobber,</b> most notably wrestling Terry Funk. In 1991, {{he would return}} for Wrestle War, wrestling a dark match, teaming with Ultraman to defeat Huichol and Rudy Boy Gonzalez.|$|E
50|$|The American Wrestling Association (AWA) {{also made}} {{moderate}} use of <b>jobbers</b> in their shows. In independent promotions <b>jobbers</b> rarely appear, {{but when they}} do, it is mostly in squash matches.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{said that}} Ethyl used its patents and {{licensing}} program to obtainthe power to exclude at will from {{participation in the}} nationwide market for lead-treated motor fuel all of the 12,000 motor fuel <b>jobbers</b> of the country, by refusing to license any of the 1,000 unlicensed <b>jobbers,</b> or by cancelling, as it may at will, the licenses {{of any of the}} 11,000 licensed <b>jobbers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A small {{food service}} {{distributor}} {{is often referred}} to as a [...] "wagon-jobber". These wagon-jobbers will purchase food in bulk and deliver small quantities to independent retail stores keeping their shelves stocked. Independent distributors and <b>jobbers</b> service independent convenience store markets, bodegas and niche grocery stores. While these distributors are unorganized, networks of independent distributors and wagon <b>jobbers</b> have emerged to give these <b>jobbers</b> the ability to identify trends in the market.|$|R
25|$|On 31 March 2005, Akebono made an {{appearance}} on SmackDown! to accept the Big Show's challenge to a (kayfabe) sumo match at WrestleMania 21. Akebono made his wrestling debut later that night, defeating <b>jobber</b> Eddie Vegas. At WrestleMania 21, Akebono defeated Big Show with a koshinage, throwing him entirely out of the ring.|$|E
25|$|Shark Boy {{debuted in}} 2002, wrestling {{for the company}} but was used mostly as a <b>jobber</b> in the X Division. On the August 14, 2002 weekly TNA pay-per-view, Shark Boy showed up on Disco Inferno's talk segment Jive Talkin without his mask playing the {{character}} Dean Baldwin, a fictional brother of the famous Baldwin actors.|$|E
25|$|As The Lightning Kid, Waltman had his WWF tryout {{match in}} Phoenix, Arizona, {{the day after}} WrestleMania IX, against fellow hopeful Louie Spicolli (soon known as Rad Radford in the WWF). He reminisced that he was lucky to have an {{opponent}} with {{a vested interest in}} an impressive match, rather than (as was then typical) a disinterested WWF veteran <b>jobber</b> like Virgil or Jim Powers.|$|E
50|$|Wichita <b>Jobbers</b> renamed Wichita Wolves.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the game}} was to include fictional <b>jobbers</b> that players would face {{early on in the}} Career Mode. For unknown reasons, the fictional <b>jobbers</b> were removed from the game; however, their voices, ring attires, and {{entrance}} theme songs remain accessible in the Create-A-Wrestler mode.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, 44.3% of all {{gasoline}} in the U.S. {{was sold}} through <b>jobbers.</b> Approximately {{the same percentage}} was sold through integrated oil company owned and operated stores or franchise arrangements. The percentage of <b>jobbers</b> responsible for fuel sale in the USA in 2004 fell to 37.3%.|$|R
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Blonds {{dropped the}} titles, the team was again {{temporarily}} split up. Austin and Pillman both claimed that it was for political reasons. Austin was given a singles push challenging Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. After Pillman finally recovered, he and Austin had a few more matches together taking on teams such as Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio, Scorpio and Ron Simmons, Simmons and Ice Train, and <b>jobber</b> tag team Frankie Rowe and Jimmy Rogers. The Blonds also confronted The Nasty Boys and Missy Hyatt during an interview after The Nasty Boys had won the titles from Anderson and Roma. The Blonds last match as a team {{took place on the}} October 30, 1993 episode of Saturday Night. After the Blonds had defeated a <b>jobber</b> tag team, Col. Rob Parker (who had just become Austin's new manager) came to ringside to congratulate Austin (and not Pillman) on winning the match. Pillman took exception to Parker snubbing him. Parker brought up Pillman's bad leg and said if he was a race horse, he would put him down. Pillman attacked Parker, which in turn led to Austin attacking and turning on Pillman, turning Pillman face and the Blonds broke up for the third and final time.|$|E
25|$|In 1870 Omaha {{began its}} role as a {{wholesale}} jobbing center for the United States. The wholesale <b>jobber</b> purchased goods directly from the manufacturer, transported these goods via the railroads, and sold them directly to small businesses through traveling salesmen. Omaha jobbers handled a wide variety of wholesale products along the Great Platte River Road and beyond, including groceries, dry goods, hardware, fruits, paper, and liquor. The city created a market house and a food-oriented warehousing district {{to meet the needs of}} this sector of the economy.|$|E
25|$|Sayama {{debuted in}} New Japan Pro Wrestling, against Shoji Kai, a <b>jobber</b> {{known to have}} been the debut {{opponent}} for future stars (Rusher Kimura, Masa Saito, Osamu Kido, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Mitsuo Momota had debuted against him before). Sayama weighed only 160 pounds, which, even given his training, impaired him from getting a permanent spot on NJPW cards. So they sent him abroad, to England (where he wrestled as Sammy Lee) and Mexico, where he wrestled under his real name. It was in Mexico where he started to grow not only in physical stature but also in prominence, winning the NWA World Middleweight Title in EMLL.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jobbers</b> {{was born}} on August 13, 1892 in Russian Empire, in {{the family of the}} Minister of the Interior, Nikolai <b>Jobbers.</b> He {{graduated}} from the Imperial College of Law, participating in World War I, after the Russian Revolution, he emigrated to France, where he later converted to Catholicism from Russian Orthodoxy. For more than 30 years he researched and taught activities in the Catholic University of Lille, where he held the chair of Russian language and literature, and taught Russian literature at the Catholic University of Paris. He studied the Fiodor Dostoievski. <b>Jobbers</b> has founded the Russian Institute at the Catholic University. He was awarded the Papal Order of Saint Gregory the Great. Yuri <b>Jobbers</b> died on 3 April 1969. He was buried in the cemetery of Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois.|$|R

5000|$|The National Park Service officially delisted the {{non-existent}} <b>Jobbers</b> Canyon Historic District in 2002. In 2005 {{a restaurant}} called [...] "Jobber's Canyon" [...] {{opened in the}} Old Market, but later closed. Some critics charge that Omaha's dual losses of <b>Jobbers</b> Canyon and the Union Stockyards represent a blatant disregard for the city's working class history.|$|R
25|$|At The Great American Bash, in June, JBL {{defeated}} Eddie Guerrero in a Texas Bullrope {{match to}} win the WWE Championship. On the July 22 episode of SmackDown!, JBL defeated a <b>jobber</b> to retain the title. After the match, Undertaker came out and challenged JBL to a match at SummerSlam. On the August 5 episode of SmackDown!, as JBL called out The Undertaker, a midget wrestler came out and began to imitate the real Undertaker. The real Undertaker came out shortly afterwards and attacked JBL, until Orlando Jordan came out to help him. The next week, Undertaker defeated Jordan by disqualification after JBL interfered and executed a Clothesline from Hell on Undertaker.|$|E
25|$|Cardona's first WWE {{appearance}} was on April 21, 2005 on SmackDown! where he, performing as a <b>jobber,</b> took on Matt Morgan. On February 24, 2006, Matthew Cardona signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. In Deep South Wrestling (DSW) in Georgia, he was renamed Brett Majors while Myers was renamed Bryan Majors. By October {{they won the}} DSW Tag Team Championship from The Untouchables (Dice Domino and Deuce Shade) and held them {{until the end of}} November, losing them to Urban Assault (Eric Pérez and Sonny Siaki). After the titles were vacated in the following year, they became two-time champions defeating the new team of Siaki and Afa Jr (The Samoan Swat Team) and The Blue Bloods (William Regal and Dave Taylor).|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} his run, Gabriel was {{primarily}} used as a <b>jobber.</b> His last televised match was a loss to Rusev on the 14 January 2015 episode of Main Event. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported on 24 January 2015 that Gabriel had quit WWE, one day before the 2015 Royal Rumble in which he was scheduled to compete. WWE confirmed his release on 25 January 2015. In March 2015, he did an interview with Chris Jericho on the podcast Talk is Jericho, where he revealed that he was the popular bunny character of Adam Rose's Exotic Express and that the Adam Rose character was intended for him. He also mentioned that Triple H did not approve of his ideas for a wolf-themed daredevil persona he had written his own promos for.|$|E

He debuted on the main roster that same year as part of The Nexus and The Corre, becoming a three-time WWE Tag Team Champion with Justin Gabriel. After The Corre disbanded, Miller mainly wrestled as a <b>jobber</b> from 2011 to 2016, forming several teams and losing numerous feuds.

25|$|Born in Hendersonville, Tennessee, Jarrett became {{involved}} with basketball {{when he was in}} high school, but he worked for his father Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) as a referee in March 1986 and trained as a wrestler under his father and Tojo Yamamoto. Jarrett made his in-ring debut at the age of 18 in April 1986 when <b>jobber</b> Tony Falk attempted to end his lengthy losing streak by challenging Jarrett, then a referee, to a match. Jarrett accepted the challenge, wrestling Falk to a 10-minute draw. Jarrett is a third-generation wrestler: his father wrestled, as did his maternal grandfather, Eddie Marlin, while his paternal grandmother, Christine, was employed by Nashville-based wrestling promotion Gulas/Welch Promotions. He also wrestled with the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Pain {{left the}} CWA {{after a year}} before {{returning}} to Utah, where he opened his own promotion, featuring wrestlers such as Louie Spicolli. He also made an appearance under his real name as a <b>jobber</b> on a February 1989 episode of WWF Prime Time Wrestling, losing to Bret Hart. After his employees began to leave the territory, Peterson applied for a job with WordPerfect. Soon after, he {{received a phone call}} from Benoit, who invited him to join an upcoming tour of Germany. Peterson received his plane ticket to Germany half an hour before he received a job offer from WordPerfect, so decided to join the tour. He spent six months in the German Catch Wrestling Association as Heavy Metal Buffalo, and won the vacant CWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on December 19, 1992, defeating The Warlord in Bremen. He vacated the title the following year when he returned to America.|$|E
