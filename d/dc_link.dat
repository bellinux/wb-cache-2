5|$|Certain {{high-performance}} applications involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) {{where the}} speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, elevators, and hilly conveyors.

5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (<b>DC)</b> <b>link,</b> and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the <b>DC</b> <b>link</b> consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's <b>DC</b> <b>link</b> element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} high capacitance values aluminum electrolytic capacitors have low impedance values even at lower frequencies like mains frequency. They are typically used in power supplies, {{switched-mode power supplies}} and DC-DC converters for smoothing and buffering rectified DC voltages in many electronic devices {{as well as in}} industrial power supplies and frequency converters as <b>DC</b> <b>link</b> capacitors for drives, inverters for photovoltaic, and converters in wind power plants.

40|$|Control {{strategies}} for power swing damping which use wide-area feedback signals {{need to be}} robust to partial/complete loss of communication and changes in operating points and topology. In addition, {{they should have a}} positive effect on all controllable swing modes and ensure adequate stability margins to avoid destabilization of untargeted modes. This paper proposes a control strategy for multiple embedded <b>dc</b> <b>links</b> (multiterminal or multiinfeed), which has all these attributes and is inherently able to provide wideband damping. The strategy uses only a limited set of nonlocal signals. These signals may be directly communicated to the <b>dc</b> <b>links</b> without having to be centrally collated with other system-wide measurements, thereby reducing communication delays. The strategy can easily be adapted during power system operation to achieve targeted damping of the critical swing modes...|$|R

50|$|Because HVDC allows power {{transmission}} between unsynchronized AC distribution systems, {{it can help}} increase system stability, by preventing cascading failures from propagating {{from one part of}} a wider {{power transmission}} grid to another. Changes in load that would cause portions of an AC network to become unsynchronized and to separate, would not similarly affect a <b>DC</b> <b>link,</b> and the power flow through the <b>DC</b> <b>link</b> would tend to stabilize the AC network. The magnitude and direction of power flow through a <b>DC</b> <b>link</b> can be directly controlled, and changed as needed to support the AC networks {{at either end of the}} <b>DC</b> <b>link.</b> This has caused many power system operators to contemplate wider use of HVDC technology for its stability benefits alone.|$|E

40|$|For power-flow {{solution}} of power systems incorporating multiterminal DC (MTDC) network(s), five quantities {{are required to}} be solved per converter. On the other hand, only three independent equations comprising two basic converter equations and one DC network equation exist per converter. Thus, for solution, two additional equations are required. These two equations are derived from the control specifications adopted for the <b>DC</b> <b>links.</b> Depending on the application, several combinations of valid control specifications are possible. Each combination {{of a set of}} valid control specifications is known as a control strategy. The number of control strategies increases with {{an increase in the number}} of the DC terminals or converters. It is observed that the power-flow convergence of integrated AC-MTDC power systems is strongly affected by the control strategy adopted for the <b>DC</b> <b>links.</b> This work investigates the mechanism by which different control strategies affect the power-flow convergence pattern of AC-MTDC power systems.

50|$|<b>DC</b> <b>link</b> converters: <b>DC</b> <b>Link</b> Converters, also {{referred}} to as AC/DC/AC converters, convert an AC input to an AC output {{with the use of a}} <b>DC</b> <b>link</b> in the middle. Meaning that the power in the converter is converted to DC from AC with the use of a rectifier, and then it is converted back to AC from DC with the use of an inverter. The end result is an output with a lower voltage and variable (higher or lower) frequency. Due to their wide area of application, the AC/DC/AC converters are the most common contemporary solution. Other advantages to AC/DC/AC converters is that they are stable in overload and no-load conditions, as well as they can be disengaged from a load without damage.|$|E

50|$|HVDC links {{can be used}} {{to control}} {{problems}} in the grid with AC electricity flow.
