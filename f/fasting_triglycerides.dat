40|$|Background]The {{nature of}} dietary fats and <b>fasting</b> {{concentrations}} of <b>triglycerides</b> affect postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and glucose homeostasis. [Objectives] The objectives were {{to examine the}} effects of meals enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or saturated fatty acids (SFAs) on postprandial lipid, glucose, and insulin concentrations and to examine the extent of β cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with high <b>fasting</b> <b>triglyceride</b> concentrations. [Design] Fourteen men with fasting hypertriglyceridemia and normal glucose tolerance were given meals (≈ 10 kcal/kg body weight) containing MUFAs, SFAs, or no fat. Blood samples were collected at baseline and hourly over 8 h for analysis. [Results] The high-fat meals significantly increased postprandial concentrations of triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, and insulin and postprandial indexes of β cell function. However, postprandial indexes of insulin sensitivity decreased significantly. These effects were significantly attenuated with MUFAs relative to SFAs. [Conclusions]MUFAs postprandially buffered β cell hyperactivity and insulin intolerance relative to SFAs in subjects with high <b>fasting</b> <b>triglyceride</b> concentrations. These data suggest that, in contrast with SFAs, MUFA-based strategies may provide cardiovascular benefits to persons at risk by limiting lipid and insulin excursions and may contribute to optimal glycemic control after meal challenges. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition.

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the relationship between postprandial triglyceride (PPTG) levels and coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: A total of 80 patients were included in this prospective cohort study. Oral lipid loading was used {{in order to measure}} PPTG levels. In the fasting state and after the high fat breakfast, triglyceride levels were measured by enzymatic methods at 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th and 8 th hours. We made subgroup analysis to show the effects of lipid loading on triglyceride levels in patients with and without fasting hypertriglyceridemia. We evaluated triglyceride levels and changes of triglyceride levels in percentages after lipid loading using a general linear model for repeated measures. Sample size analysis was performed. Results: Baseline clinical, demographic and laboratory characteristics of both groups were similar. The peak triglyceride levels were seen at the 4 th hour in both groups. Triglyceride levels were significantly increased after lipid-rich-breakfast loading compared to baseline levels in both groups (p< 0. 001) but these changes were not significant (p= 0. 279).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The goal of {{the study}} was to examine risk factors in the {{prediction}} of coronary heart disease (CHD) and differences in men and women in the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Baseline risk factors and CHD at follow-up were assessed in 2, 329 type 1 diabetic patients without prior CHD. CHD was defined as physician-diagnosed myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and/or Minnesota-coded ischemic electrocardiograms or fatal CHD. RESULTS—There were 151 patients who developed CHD, and the 7 -year incidence rate was 8. 0 (per 1, 000 person-years) in men and 10. 2 in women. After adjustment for age and/or duration of diabetes, the following risk factors were related to CHD in men: age, GHb, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), HDL cholesterol, smoking, albumin excretion rate (AER), and autonomic neuropathy. The following risk factors were related to CHD in women: age, systolic blood pressure (BP), <b>fasting</b> <b>triglycerides,</b> AER, and retinopathy. Multivariate standardized Cox proportional hazards models showed that age (hazard ratio 1. 5), AER (1. 3 in men and 1. 6 in women), WHR (1. 3 in men), smoking (1. 5 in men), <b>fasting</b> <b>triglycerides</b> (1. 3 in women) or HDL cholesterol (0. 74 in women), and systolic BP (1. 3 in women) were predictors of CHD.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether metabolic syndrome traits influence the postprandial lipemia response of coronary patients, and whether this influence {{depends on the}} number of MetS criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1002 coronary artery disease patients from the CORDIOPREV study were submitted to an oral fat load test meal with 0. 7 g fat/kg body weight (12 % saturated fatty acids, 10 % polyunsaturated fatty acids, 43 % monounsaturated fatty acids), 10 % protein and 25 % carbohydrates. Serial blood test analyzing lipid fractions were drawn at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours during the postprandial state. Total and incremental area under the curves of the different postprandial parameters were calculated following the trapezoid rule to assess the magnitude of change during the postprandial state. RESULTS: Postprandial lipemia response was directly related to the presence of metabolic syndrome. We found a positive association between the number of metabolic syndrome criteria and the response of postprandial plasma triglycerides (p< 0. 001), area under the curve of triglycerides (p< 0. 001) and incremental area under the curve of triglycerides (p< 0. 001). However, the influence of them on postprandial triglycerides remained statistically significant only in those patients without basal hypertriglyceridemia. Interestingly, in stepwise multiple linear regression analysis with the AUC of triglycerides as the dependent variable, only <b>fasting</b> <b>triglycerides,</b> fasting glucose and waist circumference appeared as significant independent (P< 0. 05) contributors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypertriglyceridemia is a {{cardiovascular}} risk factor. Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is {{an important}} determinant of the catabolic rate of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prognostic value of plasma apoC-III concentrations for cardiovascular mortality. METHODS: We performed this prospective study in 2244 subjects (ages 49 - 77 years) who participated in the Hoorn Study. During a mean follow-up of 15 years, 504 individuals died: 231 of cardiovascular disease, 180 of cancer, and 93 of other causes. Cardiovascular disease risk factors and plasma apoC-III concentrations were measured at baseline. RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted plasma apoC-III concentration was prospectively associated with cardiovascular mortality (P < 0. 001). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, including <b>fasting</b> <b>triglycerides,</b> the hazard ratio (95 % CI) for cardiovascular death between the highest and the lowest quartile of apoC-III was 1. 85 (1. 02 - 3. 38).

An ancillary study including 66 premenopausal women who participated to a 5 -year observational, longitudinal study (2004 to 2009 in Ottawa) on the effects of menopause transition on body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors. Women underwent a graded exercise test on treadmill to measure peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) at year 1 and 5 and physical activity levels were measured using accelerometers. Cardiometabolic risk factors included: waist circumference, fasting plasma lipids, glucose and insulin levels, HOMA-IR score, c-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B (apoB) and resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Change in fitness was not associated with changes in cardiometabolic risk factors.

Causal role for alcohol in cardioprotection remains however uncertain as such protection may partly arise from confounders and misclassification. The aim of our study was to evaluate potential confounders which {{may contribute to the}} putative cardioprotection by alcohol. Subjects/Methods:We evaluated clinical and biological characteristics, including CV risk factors and health status, of 149, 773 subjects undergoing examination in our Center for CVD Prevention (The Urban Paris-Ile-de-France Cohort). Subjects were divided into four groups according to alcohol consumption: never, low (≤ 10 g/day), moderate (10 to 30 g/day) and high (> 30 g/day); former drinkers were analysed as a separate group. Results:After adjustment for age, moderate male drinkers were more likely to display clinical and biological characteristics associated with lower CV risk, including low BMI, heart rate, pulse pressure, <b>fasting</b> <b>triglycerides,</b> fasting glucose, stress and depression scores together with superior subjective health status, respiratory function, social status and physical activity. Moderate female drinkers equally displayed low waist circumference, blood pressure and <b>fasting</b> <b>triglycerides</b> and LDL-cholesterol. Alcohol intake was strongly associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol in both sexes. Multivariate analysis confirmed that moderate and low drinkers displayed better health status than never drinkers. Importantly, few factors were causally related to alcohol intake. Conclusion:Moderate alcohol drinkers display a more favourable clinical and biological profile, consistent with lower CV risk as compared to non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. Moderate alcohol consumption may therefore represent a marker of higher social level, superior health status and lower CV risk...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} whether fasting modifies the prognostic {{value of}} these measurements for the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Analyses used mixed effect models and Poisson regression. After confounders were controlled for, <b>fasting</b> <b>triglyceride</b> levels were, on average, 0. 122 mmol/L lower than nonfasting levels. Each 2 -fold increase in the latest triglyceride level {{was associated with a}} 38 % increase in MI risk (relative rate, 1. 38; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 26 - 1. 51); fasting status did not modify this association. Our results suggest that it may not be necessary to restrict analyses to fasting measurements when considering MI ris...|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to recent}} {{advances}} in DNA sequencing, it is now technically feasible to evaluate the contribution of rare variation to complex traits and diseases. However, it is still cost prohibitive to sequence the whole genome (or exome) of all individuals in each study. For quantitative traits, one strategy to reduce cost is to sequence individuals in the tails of the trait distribution. However, the next challenge becomes how to prioritize traits and individuals for sequencing since individuals are often characterized for dozens of medically relevant traits. In this article, we describe a new method, the Rare Variant Kinship Test (RVKT), which leverages relationship information in family-based studies to identify quantitative traits that are likely influenced by rare variants. Conditional on nuclear families and extended pedigrees, we evaluate {{the power of the}} RVKT via simulation. Not unexpectedly, the power of our method depends strongly on effect size, and to a lesser extent, on the frequency of the rare variant and the number and type of relationships in the sample. As an illustration, we also apply our method to data from two genetic studies in the Old Order Amish, a founder population with extensive genealogical records. Remarkably, we implicate the presence of a rare variant that lowers <b>fasting</b> <b>triglyceride</b> levels in the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention (HAPI) Heart study (p =  0. 044), consistent with the presence of a previously identified null mutation in the APOC 3 gene that lowers <b>fasting</b> <b>triglyceride</b> levels in HAPI Heart study participants...|$|R
