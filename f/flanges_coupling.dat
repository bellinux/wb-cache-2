Two different systems will be analyzed: {{the first is a}} six bolts <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> working in nominal conditions, the second is a five bolts <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> working in some failure conditions with only five bolts distributed in a six holes <b>flange</b> <b>coupling.</b> In certain conditions the <b>flange</b> <b>coupling</b> design allows the same torque to be transmitted by six, but also by only five bolts. However, the non-uniformity of the five bolts distribution around the six holes flanges will generate some other unwanted phenomena.

Achieving proper alignment involves far more than merely setting the machines so that the shafts remain coaxial.

Bearings with three fault patterns (ball, inner ring or outer ring defect) are analyzed under radial loading conditions and broad speed range (10 - 3000 rpm). Moreover, single and double cardanic joints and torsionally flexible jaw type couplings are tested under radial and angular shaft misalignment.

Contrary to the previous assumption in developing axisymmetric models, the 3 D results showed that the contact pressure is non-uniform around the circumference of V-band with maximum contact pressure near the T-bolt area.

40|$|Misalignment {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sources of trouble of {{rotating}} machinery having couplings between the shafts. Ideal alignment is a chimera and the <b>coupling</b> <b>flanges</b> of the shafts are never ideally aligned, presenting angular and/or parallel misalignment (defined also as radial misalignment or offset). In particular, during the shaft rotation, if coupling misalignment between the shafts of a statically aligned line is excessive, a periodical change, of the load on the bearings in hyperstatic shaft-lines, occurs. If the rotating machine is equipped with oil-film bearings, the change of the loads on the bearings causes also the variation of their oil-film dynamic characteristics, i. e. damping and stiffness, and the complete system cannot be considered as linear. In the paper, this phenomenon is modelled accurately and analyzed by considering the simulated response of a misaligned rotor train in the time domain. A finite element model is used for the hyperstatic rotor, while bearing characteristics are calculated by integrating Reynolds equation (considering the actual type and dimensions of the bearings) as a function of the instantaneous load acting on the bearings, caused by the coupling misalignment. Nonlinear effects are highlighted and the spectral components of system response are analyzed, in order to give pertinent diagnostic information...|$|R

Therefore, this study investigates the strength capacity of bolted shear connectors with cold-formed steel (CFS) section integrated as composite beam in self-compacting concrete. In this paper, four composite beam specimens of dimensions (4500 mm x 1500 mm x 75 mm) with bolted shear connectors of M 12 and M 14 of grade 8. 8 installed on the upper <b>flanges</b> of the <b>coupled</b> back-to-back CFS I-section with longitudinal spacing’s of 250 mm and 300 mm centers and spaced 75 mm laterally were fabricated, cast and tested to failure using four-point bending test.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of current aircraft turbofan engines consists of multi-stage assemblies {{resulting from the}} coupling of bladed disks by means of bolted flange joints. The efficiency of such systems in real working condition is strictly related to the dynamic properties of blades and disks constituting them. According to the current design practices, blades and disks are designed so that their weights are reduced and their slenderness increased. Therefore, latest generation turbofan engine thus result much more sensible to mechanical vibrations that may cause failure by high cycle fatigue phenomena. For these reasons robust computational techniques and innovative measurement systems have become necessary tools for the design and validation of multi-stage bladed disks assemblies, {{in order to preserve}} their structural integrity while operating in real working conditions. The topics developed in this Ph. D. thesis concern aspects of linear and non-linear dynamics in the turbomachinery field and give a series of important guidelines for the study of multi-stage bladed disks systems from both a numerical and experimental point of view. The research activity has been mainly focused on the following two topics: 1. Development of reduced order model techniques for the prediction of forced response of multi-stage bladed disk assemblies. The main challenge associated with modeling multi-stage assemblies is strictly related to the possible different cyclic symmetry characterizing the coupled stages. In such case a sector representative of the whole multi-stage system does not exist in general and typical dynamic calculations based on cyclic constraints can not be performed {{as in the case of}} single bladed disks. Therefore, two novel reduced order model techniques for multi-stage systems have been developed in order to overcome the mentioned drawback while guaranteeing high fidelity in modeling the system dynamics. Furthermore, for the first time the bolted <b>flange</b> joint <b>coupling</b> two bladed disks is considered as a possible source of damping due to friction phenomena. Understanding the effects of such non-linearities in damping blade vibrations could be crucial in design of bolted flange joint. The proposed reduction techniques then also allow the prediction of the forced response of a multi-stage system when friction contacts are present at the flange joint interface while maintaining low computational costs. 2. Validation of the Blade Tip-Timing measurement technique, for the identification of the modal properties of two laboratory dummy disks. In this frame an experimental procedure to validate the Blade Tip-Timing system against the strain gauges measurement has been proposed. Furthermore, a novel methodology for the identification of the operative deflection shape of a vibrating bladed disks in presence of small mistuning has been developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to create a}} low-cost, modest-power RF coupler for a SRF spoke cavity beam test of electrons test to be done at LANL. Developing the design for this magnetically-coupled SRF spoke cavity testing coupler was basically straightforward since the cavity coupling port needed {{to be one of the}} 1. 22 -inch ID ports, and the power level was limited by the available RF to less than 400 W TW power. In addition, the coupler would be immersed in bath cryostat filled with liquid helium, and ultimately used in a pulsed mode to accelerate beam, thereby significantly relaxing the thermal loads on the coupler. Combining the above considerations with the level of resources available for this task, emphasis was placed on rapidly developing a robust, reliable design that would use commercially-available components as available to save design, engineering, and fabrication costs. Analysis was also kept to a minimum. As such, the design incorporates the following features: (1) Use of a commercially-available Type-N ceramic feedthrough. For the power and frequency range of the test, with the feedthrough immersed in LHe, it was felt the Type-N feedthrough would provide a robust, low-cost vacuum window solution. (2) The coupler outer conductors would be solid OFE copper that is brazed into two 2. 75 -inch CFF, with the cavity-sde flange being rotatable to allow minor Qx adjustments by rotating the coupler. The braze joint shown has the copper brazed into a groove in the SST to ensure maximum strength for successive thermal cyclings. The outer wall of the copper between the two flanges serves as the heat sink for depositing coupler heat to the liquid helium. (3) The inner conductor would be solid OFE copper brazed to the outer conductor at the top to ensure maximum thermal conductivity from the outer thermal sink area to the base of the feedthrough. A mass-reducing hole is placed down the center of the inner conductor to decrease thermal mass and weight. (4) This assembly would be mated to the Type-N feedthrough by pushing the pin from the feedthrough into a spring-loaded connector on the base of the inner conductor, then bolting the flanges together.
