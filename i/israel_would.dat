5|$|By 1972 the United States and the Soviet Union {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their {{military}} situation in regards to <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make {{the solution of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E
5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> have {{to be carried out}} simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E
5|$|In Libya {{and other}} {{countries}} of the region, mass celebrations erupted, with the Lufthansa hijackers and the liberated Munich perpetrators being treated as heroes. Right after their arrival at the airport, a press conference was held, which was broadcast live around the world. The Libyan government led by Muammar Gaddafi allowed the Munich attackers to take refuge and go into hiding, ignoring the demands of West German foreign minister Scheel {{to put them on}} trial. In a large scale covert operation dubbed Wrath of God, <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> subsequently aim at them being tracked down and killed.|$|E

5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised {{to do everything in}} their power to achieve the release of the hostages. Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E

25|$|According to the Jewish Virtual Library, <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> have {{withdrawn}} from 63 settlements. According to Robert Wright, <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> only keep the settlements with large populations. Wright states that all others would be dismantled, {{with the exception}} of Kiryat Arba (adjacent to the holy city of Hebron), which would be an Israeli enclave inside the Palestinian state, and would be linked to Israel by a bypass road. The West Bank would be split in the middle by an Israeli-controlled road from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea, with free passage for Palestinians, although Israel reserved the right to close the road to passage in case of emergency. In return, <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> allow the Palestinians to use a highway in the Negev to connect the West Bank with Gaza. Wright states that in the Israeli proposal, the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be linked by an elevated highway and an elevated railroad running through the Negev, ensuring safe and free passage for Palestinians. This highway would be under the sovereignty of Israel, and Israel reserved the right to close the highway to passage in case of emergency.|$|E

Palin questioned whether Obama's call for a [...] "sovereign and contiguous" [...] Palestinian state could mean [...] "carving Israel in half" [...] and echoed The Independent, which asked, [...] "Was the President implying that the new improved Israel will border neither Jordan nor Egypt, as it does now?

25|$|The Israeli negotiators {{denied that}} Israel was {{responsible}} for the refugee problem, and were concerned that any right of return would pose a threat to Israel's Jewish character. In the Israeli proposal, a maximum of 100,000 refugees would be allowed to return to Israel on the basis of humanitarian considerations or family reunification. All other people classified as Palestinian refugees would be settled in their present place of inhabitance, the Palestinian state, or third-party countries. <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> help fund their resettlement and absorption. An international fund of $30 billion would be set up, which <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> help contribute to, along with other countries, that would register claims for compensation of property lost by Palestinian refugees and make payments within the limits of its resources.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{on various}} points of view, a one-state {{solution}} to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict {{is presented as a}} situation in which <b>Israel</b> <b>would</b> ostensibly lose its character as a Jewish state and the Palestinians would fail to achieve their national independence within a two-state solution or, alternatively, as the best, most just, and only way to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.|$|E
