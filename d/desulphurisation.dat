5|$|Mitsui Babcock fitted {{flue-gas}} <b>desulphurisation</b> (FGD) equipment between 1988 and 1995.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1973 and {{extended}} in the mid-1980s, {{the station was}} initially operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board. Since privatisation in 1990 ownership has changed several times, and it is operated by the Drax Group. Completed in 1986, it is the newest coal-fired power station in England, flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> equipment was fitted between 1988 and 1995; high and low pressure turbines were replaced between 2007 and 2012. Because of its large size, the station is the UK's single largest emitter of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|The station {{would have}} had an {{efficiency}} of 46%, which in comparison to conventional subcritical coal-fired power stations, equates {{to a reduction in}} carbon dioxide (CO2) of 23% per unit of electricity generated. The station would have utilised pollution abatement and gas cleaning systems, including selective catalytic reduction, to remove nitrogen oxide, and Flue-gas <b>desulphurisation,</b> to remove sulphur dioxide. The station would also have been able to allow the installation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, when it becomes technically and commercially viable. There was also a possibility that the station may have co-fired biomass, and cogenerated heat as a combined heat and power plant.|$|E
5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|E

50|$|Eggborough Power Station {{was built}} between 1962 and 1970, and first began {{generating}} electricity in 1967. The station comprises four 500 megawatt (MW) coal-fired units, giving the station a total electrical output of 1,960 MW. Units 3 and 4 have been installed with Flue Gas <b>Desulphurisation</b> equipment, which reduces the units' emissions of Sulphur Dioxide by around 90%.|$|E
50|$|In February 2006, 51 British {{workers at}} the station walked out on Wildcat strike action due to the {{underpayment}} of Hungarian workers during construction of Flue Gas <b>Desulphurisation</b> equipment. The Hungarians had worse working conditions than the British workers and were underpaid £1 million by employer SFL. 15 British workers who walked out in solidarity were made redundant.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to crude and vacuum distillation units, the major refining units are catalytic reforming unit, once-through Hydrocracker unit, Resid Fluidised Catalytic Cracking unit, visbreaker unit, delayed coking unit, bitumen blowing unit, hydrogen generation unit, sulphur block and associated auxiliary facilities. In {{order to produce}} low sulphur diesel, a Diesel Hydro <b>Desulphurisation</b> Unit (DHDS) was commissioned in 1999.|$|E

50|$|The {{power plant}} {{is a joint}} venture between a {{subsidiary}} of Hopewell Holdings and the Shenzhen Energy Group for 2 x 600 megawatts ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plant built in Heyuan City, Guangdong Province. Besides being one of the province's most efficient and environmentally friendly coal-fired power plants, it was also the first in China to be equipped with a flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> wastewater treatment system.|$|E
50|$|Ratcliffe {{power station}} is {{compliant}} with the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD), an EU directive {{that aims to}} reduce acidification, ground level ozone and particulates by controlling the emissions of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and dust from large combustion plants. To reduce emissions of sulphur the plant is fitted with Flue Gas <b>Desulphurisation,</b> and also with a Boosted Over Fire Air system to reduce the concentration of oxides of nitrogen in the flue gas.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} {{currently}} {{one of the}} cleanest coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, and is fitted with Flue Gas <b>Desulphurisation</b> equipment and low NOx burners. It also burns biomass, as well as coal, for its emissions to be considered closer to being carbon neutral. The station does not take water from or dump waste water into the River Usk. It instead uses secondary treated sewage water in its cooling system.|$|E
50|$|After a {{pollutant}} emissions reduction plan {{as required by}} EU directive 2001/80 has been approved, the environmental permits of Amyntaio were renewed in 2008. With its lifetime being limited to 2023, the Amyntaio power plant however remains excluded from compliance with the stricter emission limits set by the EU directive 2010/75. Subsequently, neither the implementation of <b>desulphurisation</b> technology nor the replacement of electrostatic precipitators to reduce particle emissions is planned for this power plant, though preliminary studies have been completed.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes were {{a series}} of wildcat strikes that {{affected}} the energy industry in the United Kingdom in 2009. The action involved workers at around a dozen energy sites across the UK who walked out in support of other British workers at the Total's Lindsey Oil Refinery. The Lindsey Oil Refinery construction workers went on strike because employment was not offered to them on a £200 million construction contract to build a hydro <b>desulphurisation</b> unit at the site.|$|E

50|$|The RSP {{has many}} firsts to its credit. It {{is the first}} plant in Asia to adopt the {{energy-efficient}} LD process of steel making and the first integrated steel plant of SAIL which adopted the cost-effective and quality-centered continuous casting route to process 100% of steel produced. The plant has also, {{for the first time}} in India, had adopted external <b>desulphurisation</b> of hot metal by calcium carbide injection process. RSP is one of the unique units under the SAIL umbrella with a wide variety of special purpose steels.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 SSE {{took the}} {{decision}} to fit Flue Gas <b>Desulphurisation</b> (FGD) to the plant, installing equipment to scrub half of Ferrybridge's output; the decision was required to partially meet the specifications of the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD); in 2008 the boilers were fitted with Boosted Over Fire Air {{in order to reduce}} the NOx emissions. In 2009 FGD was commissioned on Units 3 and 4. The installation of FGD allowed SSE sign a 5-year agreement with UK Coal for 3.5 million tonnes of higher sulphur coal.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{power station}} was built around 1901 by Fulham Borough Council. A second, 'B' station opened in 1936, occupying a 124 acre site with a river frontage of 1300 ft. The station {{was designed to}} have a capacity of at least 310 megawatts (MW), the largest of any municipally-owned station in the UK. It was designed by G.E. Baker and Preece, Cardew and Rider. Fulham {{was one of the}} first stations to be fitted with flue-gas <b>Desulphurisation</b> equipment. This was operated on 120MW of capacity between 1936 and 1940, but later removed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power station}} {{was built in}} the 1960s and opened in 1968. In 1981, the station was burning 5.5 million tonnes of coal a year, {{consuming}} 65% of the output of south Nottinghamshire's coal-mines. Emissions of sulphur dioxide, which cause acid rain, were greatly reduced in 1993 when a flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> system using a wet limestone-gypsum process became operational on all of the station's boilers. Emissions of oxides of nitrogen, greenhouse gases which also cause damage to the ozone layer, were reduced in 2004 when new equipment was fitted to Unit 1 by Alstom.|$|E
50|$|In 1884 the Hull-based company Reckitt & Sons {{established}} a factory at Morley Street to manufacture synthetic Ultramarine. This later {{became part of}} Reckitt & Colman, and was later sold to Yule Catto becoming Holliday Pigments. In 2003 it had a capacity of about 9,000 t.p.a. The factory's 141 m chimney, the tallest structure in Hull, known as Reckitt's chimney was used to discharge Sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, a Flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> plant was installed {{at the beginning of}} the 21st century, making the chimney practically obsolete. The plant closed in 2007 due to restructuring.|$|E
50|$|The {{second phase}} began in 1985. Tarmac Construction {{undertook}} the civil engineering works; Holst Civil Engineers built the chimney; N.G. Bailey installed cabling; Reyrolle, English Electric and South Wales Switchgear produced and installed the switchgear; English Electric manufactured the generator cooling water pumps; T.W. Broadbent maintained the temporary electrical supplies; and Sulzer Brothers manufactured the boiler feed pumps. The second phase {{was completed in}} 1986. In both stages the boilers were made by Babcock Power Ltd and the generators by C. A. Parsons and Company. Mitsui Babcock fitted flue-gas <b>desulphurisation</b> (FGD) equipment between 1988 and 1995.|$|E
50|$|Coal usage may be {{expected}} to decline steadily because of eroding cost advantages and pressure to reduce sulphur and carbon (carbon dioxide) emissions, notwithstanding ongoing subsidy policies designed to retain jobs in the coal mining industry. Future coal usage is highly dependent on legislative drivers on emissions and the need to have security of supply. Whilst the costs of burning coal with <b>desulphurisation</b> and carbon capture facilities is greatly increased, it is still being actively considered as part of the UK energy strategy due to large domestic reserves, higher price stability than natural gas and reduced capital expenditure and construction time for plant compared to nuclear power.|$|E

50|$|The station {{closed as}} a result of the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD), which {{requires}} stations that are not equipped with Flue Gas <b>Desulphurisation</b> (FGD) technology to close after 20,000 hours of operation from 1 January 2008 or the end of 2015, whichever comes first. Kingsnorth ceased generation on 17 December 2012, having consumed all its LCPD hours.Demolition of the coal handling plant commenced on Thursday 23 October 2014 with series of controlled explosions. The station's turbine hall was demolished on 9 July 2015. The final part of the boiler house was demolished by explosion on 27 July 2017, with only the concrete chimney remaining.|$|E
