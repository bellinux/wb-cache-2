50|$|A {{track circuit}} {{typically}} has power applied to each rail and a relay coil wired across them. When no train is present, the relay is <b>energised</b> by the <b>current</b> {{flowing from the}} power source through the rails. When a train is present, its axles short (shunt) the rails together; the current to the track relay coil drops, and it is de-energised. Circuits through the relay contacts therefore report {{whether or not the}} track is occupied.|$|R
40|$|In the mise-a-la-masse method, {{conducting}} {{bodies are}} <b>energised</b> using <b>current</b> electrodes in mineralized outcrops or borehole intersections, {{and the resulting}} potential distribution mapped and used to indicate qualitatively {{the form of the}} conductor. In this thesis a quantitative three dimensional integral equation technique implemented on the Vax 8600 computer at Leicester University is used to develop interpretation schemes and carry out detailed modelling of mineralization in two field areas. The interpretation technique was evaluated by comparing theoretical data derived for bodies of simple shape - spheres, discs and slabs. It is shown that for a thin slab or disk, the potential gradient in a borehole at the intersection of the ore hosting the current electrode is inversely proportional to the area of the upper side of the body. This is also shown to be true for a spherical body, but only if the borehole in which measurements are taken intersects the centre of the sphere. The mise-a-la-masse method was employed at two field sites where borehole and other geophysical data were available. At Gairloch, NW Scotland the data allowed a three-dimensional model of the complex structure of the mineralization to be developed. In San Telmo, in the Spanish Pyrite Belt, an estimate of {{the size of a large}} mineralized lens was made by the use of the interpretation scheme and later by modelling. This result was used in planning further boreholes by the company in charge of the site. Downhole resistivity and IP were carried out together with a comprehensive suite of geophysical surveys over the outcropping mineralization at Gairloch. These are evaluated and contribute to the final interpretation of the area. The results from parametric model studies show that the use of the method can provide fast, in-field determination of the approximate size of an intersected conducting body with only one available drillhole. The implementation of the numerical method for modelling the data has also allowed more detailed interpretation of deep conductors...|$|R
40|$|Don 2 ̆ 7 t {{bury the}} {{benefits}} of research to improve the health system By Stephen Leeder, Director, Menzies Centre for Health Policy at University of Sydney If you missed {{the release of the}} McKeon review on Friday you’re not alone. The Commonwealth government released the Strategic Review of Health and Medical Research just before the weekend – a time usually reserved for reports the government would rather bury – and it barely got a mention in the mainstream media. The government commissioned the review panel, headed by Simon McKeon, in 2011 to investigate the state of health and medical research in Australia. The panel released a consultation paper October and delivered the final report to government in March. The review sets out a ten-year strategy to better integrate health and medical research into the public health system. To improve the health system and contain its rising cost, the report states that “research must be routinely performed as a part of health-care delivery and there must be greater linkage between health-care providers and research organisations. ” This is an <b>energising</b> vision. The <b>current</b> reality could hardly be more different. Apart for pockets of clinical research, such as drug trials and evaluation research by specialist clinical groups to assess the effectiveness and worth of medical interventions in real-life scenarios, research is not a strong player in the health system. As a result, the connection of health services to research is informal and erratic, with estimates that 43...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The multi-order response of the tuned secondary circuit of a Tesla transformer, following impulse excitation from its tuned primary circuit, is presented and analysed at the fundamental resonant frequency and at higher-order mode frequencies. A novel way of modifying the frequency response of the secondary coil is then investigated by utilising a technique normally applied {{to the design of}} a certain type of filter known as a helical filter. In general, these are used in radio and microwave frequency circuits in order to pass certain frequencies with little attenuation whilst significantly attenuating other frequencies. Design techniques, developed over several decades, modify and optimise the performance of such filters. The frequency response of the helical filter is modified by altering the geometry of the helical resonator component therein, which is typically {{in the form of an}} air-cored single-layer solenoid. A Tesla transformer whose secondary is constructed to be some form of single-layer solenoidal winding resonates at its designed frequency - its fundamental mode - but also at non-integer harmonics (higher-order anharmonic frequencies, also known as overtones). Those multi-order oscillatory voltages and <b>currents</b> <b>energised</b> in the secondary circuit have been identified and measured and research has determined the fundamental and higher-order mode frequencies and amplitudes for various experimental secondary winding configurations derived from helical filter design techniques. Applied to the Tesla transformer secondary winding, such techniques lead to a new design with a performance that is improved by the suppression of higher- order anharmonic frequencies whilst imparting little change to the fundamental response. It is anticipated that this feature will lead to Tesla transformers which exhibit enhanced spectral purity and which will be better suited to use in certain pulsed power applications than conventionally wound designs...|$|R
