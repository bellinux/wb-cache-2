This study tests {{the hypothesis that}} shorter median length of stay (LOS) as a dialysis <b>facility</b> <b>practice</b> is associated with higher rates of early readmission. Methods: Readmission within 30 days of each hospitalization was evaluated for participants in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, an observational study of randomly selected hemo-dialysis patients in the United States (142 facilities, 5095 patients with hospitalizations), five European countries (101 facilities, 2281 patients with hospitalizations), and Japan (58 facilities, 883 patients with hospitalizations).

This study evaluates a sample population in Wichita, KS of 17 independent, long-term care facilities by charting their bed numbers and occupancy rates over a five year period. In comparison to the 17 care facilities, the study evaluates over 200 regionally printed articles associated to long-term facility care between the dates of January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008. By using thematic analysis, a correlation was discovered between the use of negative media and the projected occupancy rates for subsequent years. Although not statistically significant, the data collected by this study provides substantial information concerning the relationship between regional print media and long-term care facilities...|$|E

In addition, this study investigates how receptive PCWs are to being trained and conducting brief assessments of clients to help determine if they are exhibiting any signs of depression. Data were gathered by telephone and/or by face-to-face structured interviews with directors of elderly assisted living facilities.

40|$|In the United States, the {{practices}} and opinions of healthcare providers regarding eating on dialysis are unknown. The {{purpose of this}} study was to understand healthcare provider opinions and in-center hemodialysis patient practices regarding eating while at the dialysis center. In June 2011, over 1200 registered dietitians within a large dialysis organization in the US were surveyed on current practices and opinions of patient food consumption during dialysis treatment using an online survey. 1223 of 1665 (73 %) dialysis facilities responded to the food consumption survey. n= 1222 Permitted No Guidelines Not allowed n (%) n (%) n (%) Eating on dialysis 803 (66 %) 67 (5 %) 352 (29 %) Drinking on dialysis 907 (75 %) 87 (7 %) 228 (19 %) 218 (18 %) of the respondents stated that the <b>facility</b> <b>practice</b> for consuming nutritional supplements (eg., liquid nutritional supplements and/or protein bars) while on dialysis was different than the policy for consuming food while on dialysis. Interestingly, 1203 (98 %) of the respondents stated consuming food before or after dialysis was allowed. The top reasons for facility practices that allowed eating during dialysis were: prevention of hypoglycemia on dialysis, improved kcal intake on dialysis days, and the opportunity to provide counseling on food products currently chosen by the patient. The top reasons for facility practices not permitting eating during dialysis included: potential adverse events associated with hypotension, GI symptoms, choking, infection, pest control, and spills. Further analyses are warranted to determine whether there is a correlation between allowing patients to eat during dialysis treatment and an improvement in the nutritional status of the patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Diabetic foot {{infections are}} common, serious, and diverse. There is {{uncertainty}} about optimal antibiotic treatment, and probably substantial variation in practice. Our {{aim was to}} document whether this is the case: A finding that would {{raise questions about the}} comparative cost-effectiveness of different regimens and also open the possibility of examining costs and outcomes to determine which should be preferred. Methods We used the Veterans Health Administration (VA) Diabetes Epidemiology Cohorts (DEpiC) database to conduct a retrospective observational study of hospitalized patients with diabetic foot infections. DEpiC contains computerized VA and Medicare patient-level data for VA patients with diabetes since 1998, including demographics, ICD- 9 -CM diagnostic codes, antibiotics prescribed, and VA facility. We identified all patients with ICD- 9 -CM codes for cellulitis/abscess of the foot and then sub-grouped them according to whether they had cellulitis/abscess plus codes for gangrene, osteomyelitis, skin ulcer, or none of these. For each facility, we determined: 1) The proportion of patients treated with an antibiotic and the initial route of administration; 2) The first antibiotic regimen prescribed for each patient, defined as treatment with the same antibiotic, or combination of antibiotics, for at least 5 continuous days; and 3) The antibacterial spectrum of the first regimen. Results We identified 3, 792 patients with cellulitis/abscess of the foot either alone (16. 4 %), or with ulcer (32. 6 %), osteomyelitis (19. 0 %) or gangrene (32. 0 %). Antibiotics were prescribed for 98. 9 %. At least 5 continuous days of treatment with an unchanged regimen of one or more antibiotics was prescribed for 59. 3 %. The means and (ranges) across facilities of the three most common regimens were: 16. 4 %, (22. 8 %); 15. 7 %, (36. 1 %); and 10. 8 %, (50. 5 %). The range of variation across facilities proved substantially greater than that across the different categories of foot infection. We found similar variation in the spectrum of the antibiotic regimen. Conclusions The large variations in regimen appear to reflect differences in <b>facility</b> <b>practice</b> styles rather than case mix. It is unlikely that all regimens are equally cost-effective. Our methods make possible evaluation of many regimens across many facilities, and can be applied in further studies to determine which antibiotic regimens should be preferred. </p...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Background: Childhood obesity affects {{millions}} {{of children in the}} United States; the estimated prevalence of obesity among two to five year olds has doubled between 1980 and 2008. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and many agencies of the United States Department of Health and Human Services identify screen time as an important risk factor for childhood obesity. Screen time is commonly defined as time spent watching TV, videotapes, or DVDs, playing video or computer games, surfing the Internet, and anything else that requires watching a screen. Child care environments and the policies that impact those environments are a prime area for obesity prevention efforts including screen time reduction because a large proportion of children spend time in these settings. Objectives: This study aims to 1) describe child care providers' screen time knowledge, provider advocacy with families around screen time issues, and child care <b>facility</b> screen time <b>practices</b> 2) examine whether factors such as child care facility type (home-based versus center-based) and years of child care experience are associated with knowledge, provider advocacy for screen time recommendations with families, and <b>facility</b> <b>practices</b> regarding screen time issues 3) investigate associations between screen time policies in child care facilities and child care provider knowledge, provider advocacy, and <b>facility</b> <b>practices</b> regarding screen time issues. Methods: Training questions from a Washington State Training and Registry System (STARS) screen time training module called Media Aware Child Care were used to collect information regarding child care provider screen time knowledge, provider advocacy for screen time recommendations with families, <b>facility</b> screen time <b>practices,</b> type of child care program provider works at (home-based or center-based facility), and whether the facility possesses a screen time policy. Knowledge, advocacy, and <b>facility</b> <b>practices</b> scores were calculated for each participant based on their answers to training questions. Two-sample t tests were used to compare knowledge, advocacy, and <b>facility</b> <b>practices</b> scores by <b>facility</b> type, years of child care experience and presence of screen time policy. Results: Participants in this study were somewhat knowledgeable about screen time viewing statistics, adverse effects of screen time, and national screen recommendations. They reported feeling strongly towards educating family members about screen time issues. One-third of all participants reported they did not have or use TV in their child care facility. Center-based providers {{were more likely to report}} that their facility did not have/use TV compared to home-based providers (p <. 001). Average knowledge scores were significantly higher for providers that worked at home-based facilities versus center-based facilities (P = 0. 003). Years of child care experience was not a determinant of provider screen time knowledge, provider advocacy, and <b>facility</b> <b>practices.</b> In settings where a TV was used, child care providers who worked at child care facilities with an established screen time policy reported more positive screen time behaviors than providers who worked at facilities that did not have a screen time policy (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: This study supports the recommendation for child care facilities to develop screen time policies. Home-based facilities should specifically be targeted for intervention because of the high rates of screen time viewing. More efforts are needed to educate all child care providers about screen time issues and promote site-based screen time policy implementation...|$|R
