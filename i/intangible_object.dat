By this term (“book production”) we refer only to the segment of scientific books and publications (periodical or non-periodical ones) which has a specific, well-defined and usually not {{a large number of}} consumers – at least on a restricted geographical area. A book is viewed here not only as a commodity, in its physical sense, but as a bearer of information which is an <b>intangible</b> <b>object</b> with a perennial feature. Our idea concerning the relationship between demand and supply in this field of scientific publications is that the subjects/ domains proposed and/ or treated in these materials influence both demand and supply the stress being laid mainly on the supply.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{psychological}} ownership originates from literature in philosophy, sociology, psychology, and human development, describing a possessive {{feeling of being}} psychologically attached to an object (Pierce et al. 2001). When psychological ownership is perceived, this possessive feeling can cause the object to become intertwined with the self, where an object becomes an extended self of the owner (Pierce and Jussila 2011). Within the work context, the potential targets of ownership can include tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>objects.</b> Tangible objects can include one’s workspace, or work tools, whereas <b>intangible</b> <b>objects</b> may include the organisation itself or a project that one leads (Pierce and Jussila 2011). Technology {{can also be a}} target object for which psychological ownership can be developed, as evidenced by research carried out in contexts such as clinical information system (Barki et al. 2008), the virtual world (Lee and Chen 2011), and social media (Karahanna et al. 2015). Barki et al. (2008) defined psychological ownership in the technological context as the sense of ownership individuals feel for an information system (IS). The aforementioned study found psychological ownership to be prevalent among physicians who participated in developing a clinical IS, where ownership was developed for the IS and subsequently influence users’ beliefs about its usefulness and ease of use (Barki et al. 2008).|$|R

I have supplemented, {{and in some cases}} corrected, their conclusions by investigating the first millenium of moralists 2 ̆ 7 reflection on avarice and the influence of such thought on Old English literature. This dissertation is the first step towards writing a history of the vice {{to the end of the}} Middle Ages. ^ I have used methods common to the history of ideas and, in literary studies, historical criticism, concentrating not only on the terminology expressing the concept of greed, but on the spectrum of ideas denoted by these terms, and their accompanying imagery, in discursive and literary texts. Chapter I deals with avarice in the early Cardinal Vice tradition and chapter II with the beginnings of greed as a Deadly Sin, from the earliest Christian texts to Lactantius. Chapters III and IV, respectively, examine the deadly sin in the fourth/early fifth century in the East and in the Latin West. Chapter V investigates the merging of the Cardinal Vice and Deadly Sin traditions in the early Middle Ages. Finally, chapter VI applies the results of these historical analyses to the interpretation of some Old English poetry (Almsgiving, The Riming Poem). ^ The patristic and early medieval understanding of avarice included the narrowest sense of 2 ̆ 2 the love of money 2 ̆ 2 and the most comprehensive definition of it as a desire to possess anything, even an <b>intangible</b> <b>object,</b> not leading to God. The same extremes will also be found in the Old English poems chosen for analysis. The widest definition of the vice is a result of theological concerns of the fourth and fifth centuries and it remained an important component of moral thought on avarice to the end of the medieval period. The High and Late Middle Ages can no longer be seen as the eras during which moralists first concentrated their attention on avarice, for theologians of late antiquity had already recognized in greed the most dangerous opponent to the well-being of society and the individual. ...|$|E

More specifically, we analyse the interactions between the different regulatory layers and provisions that govern the possibility of bringing IPRs {{under the protection of}} IIAs. After some general remarks on the references to IPRs in investment agreements (II), we focus on three main understandings of such interactions (III), namely delegation (by an investment agreement to domestic law), autonomy (of the definition of IPRs in investment agreements), and articulation (of all the relevant regulatory layers to circumscribe the scope of the legally-protected object). In a final section, we draw some conclusions with a view to guide current and future practice (IV) ...|$|R

In this article we point out the importance of cataloguing not only the documentation object or related events, but the actual cultural process, such as a craftsmanship skill.

Additionally, Larsson defined a group of metaphors in legal system. Bound with them are metaphors outside of law.

Awareness is generally defined as a state of consciousness in which we perceive and recognize the relevance of a certain object.

Awareness might thus relate to other people, to other life forms, to tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>objects.</b> Indeed, many argue that “self-awareness ” – our ability to consciously recognize ourselves – is a key defining property of humans. The concept of awareness has also been used to conceptualize our state of recognition of how organizations work: organizational awareness in this sense refers to the state of recognition of the organization's mission and functions, and how it’s social, political, and technological systems work and operate effectively. Organizational awareness typically includes knowledge of the programs, policies, procedures, rules, and regulations of the organization.

The more recent introduction of digital technologies has reinforced {{this focus on}} the construction, representation and animation of both realistic and fantastic scenarios. Research in recent animation techniques therefore focuses on processes and methods that assist with fabrication. John Hughes’ research into animation processes and techniques uncovers methods that combine traditional animation techniques – stop-frame – and ‘found’ rather than fabricated objects. His research opens the field of contemporary animation to both tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>objects</b> pre-existing in the environment. Removed is an innovative animation in two respects. First, on a technical level its stop-frame techniques capture found and ready-made scenes and objects in the environment in order to construct a narrative. Second, in using stop-frame animation it enacts a physical process to capture an intangible figure – that of the shadow. In its techniques it embodies {{a new approach to}} animation that places contemporary digital preoccupations with the fantastic and intangible alongside the tangible material world of objects and physical labour.

40|$|This thesis {{adopts a}} {{primarily}} process-based methodology {{to put a}} museum in its place as a site of knowledge-making. It examines the practices of space which were productive of a government-funded (‘national’) museum in Edinburgh. Taking a spatial perspective, and recognising that place is both material and metaphorical, the thesis explores how the Museum’s material and intellectual architectures were produced over the period 1854 - 1939. The thesis is concerned to bring into focus the dynamic processes by which the Museum was in a continual state of becoming; a constellation of tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>objects</b> constantly being produced and reproduced through mobility of objects, people and ideas. Its concern is to chart the flows through space which produced the Museum. The thesis comprises nine chapters. An introduction and a literature review are followed by chapters concerned, respectively, with the built space of the museum and {{with the people who}} worked there. A further three chapters consider the nature of that work and the practices of space which constituted the processes of collecting, displaying, and educating, whilst another focuses on visiting. The final chapter discusses how the analysis has constructed the museum as constituted through a complex diversity of material and metaphorical settings on a variety of geographical scales. This critical scrutiny of the museum has, in turn, brought to the fore the place of the Museum in contributing to civic and national identity. Through a case-study of a particular museum, the concern has been to explore how critical geographies of science may be applied to the examination of a museum.
