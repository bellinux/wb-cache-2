40|$|Projections {{regarding}} the rapidly {{increasing number of}} Spanish speakers in the United States combined with the increasing incidence of bilingual aphasia have inspired researchers to collect normative data on confrontation naming tasks {{that can be used}} in bilingual patient populations. Studies that have reported normative data for English/Spanish bilingual speakers have found that relatively more English proficient bilingual speakers do not perform like English monolinguals and, therefore, bilingual performance has to be compared to bilingual norms and not to monolingual norms. Using An Object and Action Naming Battery, this study aims to 1) provide Spanish/English bilingual normative data for nouns and verbs, 2) evaluate performance in naming across three proficiency groups: English dominant, balanced, and Spanish dominant, 3) conduct an error analysis to examine the error patterns according to proficiency group. Consistent with the predictions, overall results showed overall accuracy was higher in English than Spanish, but three proficiency groups did emerge, with each proficiency group scoring better in the stronger language, and the balanced group scoring similarly across languages. The balanced group was the only group that benefited from the use of a composite score, which provides credit for all responses regardless of language.

This kind of project has a strong social responsibility and impact on the city.

Rather than understanding the changes the Internet might permit, and rather than taking time to let common sense resolve how best to respond, we are allowing those most threatened by the changes to use their power to change the law and more importantly, to use their power to change something fundamental about who we have always been. We allow this, I believe, not because it is right, and not because most of us really believe in these changes. We allow it because the interests most threatened are among the most powerful players in our depressingly compromised process of making law.

40|$|Conducting mediatization {{research}} {{is no easy}} task. Linked with this term {{is not only the}} idea that media have a certain 'specificity', which as such exerts an 'influence' on culture and society: the term also implies a process of change. But how can we find a practical approach to mediatization research when the time we live in is shaped by the 'mediation of everything'? How can we carry out this kind of analysis if the focus is not to be merely on any one single media - the television, the mobile phone, the social web - but all different kinds of media in their entirety? These questions are the departure point of this article, which has the aim to develop a transmedial approach of mediatization research. I start with a short review of two of the main traditions of mediatization research. This builds the foundation for an understanding of mediatization that focuses on the 2 ̆ 2 communicative figurations 2 ̆ 2 through which we construct our 2 ̆ 2 mediatized worlds 2 ̆ 2. Such a conceptualisation makes it possible to re-theorise mediatization research from a diachronous and synchronous perspective. In order to develop this kind of argument, it is necessary to clarify the underlying understanding of 'media'. When I use this term in the following, <b>I</b> <b>don</b> <b>t</b> mean 2 ̆ 2 primary media 2 ̆ 2 like, for example, language or acting theatre. Also I don't have 2 ̆ 2 generalised 2 ̆ 2 media in mind - like money, love or power.

Nowadays, while some people are still one or more tantalising steps removed from having the basic {{information}} they need on agriculture and rural development, {{there is a growing}} feeling that many others have, at first sight, perhaps too much. The emphasis is coming to lie on being able to select what is important from what is less important, and to manage it efficiently. Here, the complex skill of priority setting can help in raising the quality of agricultural information services, from defining user needs to delivery. Over the last three years, CTA has been steadily refining a methodology for the determination of priority themes for agricultural information, and it recently completed a series of six pilot studies at national level. The studies were undertaken in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Senegal and Zambia. They centred around workshops involving representatives of National Agricultural Systems as well as related non-governmental organisations and rural organisations. As a result, the next phase of this programme will enable other ACP countries to be able to conduct similar exercises, although the issue of their funding remains an item.

Recent advances in design theories open new possibilities to answer these questions. In this paper we use C-K design theory and a matroid-based model of the set of techniques to propose a new model (C-K/Ma) of the dynamics of techniques, accounting for the design of generic technologies. We show:  F 1 : C-K/Ma offers a computational model for designing a technique with systemic impact.

However, like most other young engineers, I also learned to use the RFI as a weapon in the ongoing battle between owners. or their designer and the construction contractors. Recently, our project team has done a few simple things to greatly reduce the waste and frustration that comes from this type of battle.

But this seemingly simple process is plagued by a number of problems.

40|$|Biodiversity is {{the most}} {{important}} foundation for food security. This is particularly true in the isolated, resource-poor, small island developing states of the Pacific Islands. Food security will ultimately depend on the protection of the cultural and natural ecosystems and services, as well as the knowledge and materials needed to produce and process our food and drinks, for example our forests, reefs, rivers, agricultural systems, firewood and knowledge about farming, fishing, food preservation, processing and cooking, etc. Food security, here, as elsewhere, depends on three sources: wild harvest, agricultural production, and trade. Islanders originally depended almost exclusively on the first two: wild food and water from our forests, non-forest land, rivers and seas, and plant and animal products from our agricultural systems. In terms of wild harvest, Pacific Islanders eat wild yams, ferns, birds, bats, guavas, citrus fruits, tropical almonds, wild leafy greens, and an extremely wide variety of freshwater and marine foods. For example, in eastern Viti Levu, Fiji Islands, the people eat over 200 different types of finfish and over 70 different types of shellfish, crustaceans and marine invertebrates. Over half of these are sold to provide cash incomes and feed the growing urban population. A rich heritage In terms of agricultural production, staple root crops include four taro species, five yam species, sweet potato, and cassava. Important tree crops include coconut, banana and plantain, breadfruit, pandanus, Tahitian chestnut and a wide range of fruit and nut trees. Other locally grown foods include taro leaf spinach, hibiscus spinach, sugarcane and sugarcane inflorescence, corn and many other vegetables, beans and pulses and a wide range of spice and beverage plants. There are wild and locally-raised chickens, ducks, pigs, goats and cows to supply fresh lean meat, eggs and dairy products. These local foods traditionally provided us with all the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients, and the fibre and water needed for good health. They are low in salt, sugar and saturated fats. Most of these plants and animals have many different varieties or breeds. For example, in Fiji there are at least 100 named taro varieties, 7 cattle and 5 traditional pig breeds. In the atoll country of Kiribati, there are over 200 edible varieties of pandanus, a staple food plant that will produce during the severest droughts when no other plants can. This genetic diversity adds insurance to our food system, protecting our Today, Pacific Islanders are increasingly dependent on trade and imported foods food plants and animals against diseases and natural disasters, such as hurricanes and drought. Unfortunately, many of these have already disappeared or are disappearing because they have been replaced by new or imported varieties and breeds. Traditional knowledge But perhaps most important is the great knowledge of our diverse cultures, through which we have traditionally known how to collect, hunt, fish, farm and care for wild and domestic plants and animals. Such knowledge includes beliefs, seasonal migrations, recipes, ways of preserving and preparing food, how to breastfeed and nurture babies, as well as the language and names associated with the plants and animals that supply our foods and drinks, and how they affect our health. Today, Pacific Islanders are increasingly dependent on trade and imported foods. This is partly because they live in towns and some of these local foods are now rare or too expensive, or because people no longer know how to catch, produce or prepare them, or have even lost the taste for these foods. Unfortunately, given the purchasing power and low level of nutritional awareness of most of our people, much of the imported food they eat consists of nutritionally inferior products that are high in animal fat, sugar and salt and low in high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals, fibre and water. As a result, Pacific Islanders now have some of the highest and most rapidly increasing levels of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, obesity, dental disease and cancer. An irreplaceable loss Sadly, many of the sources of our nutritious food plants and animals are now endangered. Our mangrove forests and coral reefs are dying or being destroyed. Many of the fish that were common in the past are now rare. Our coastal and inland forests are disappearing and our agricultural lands are being eroded. Many of the traditional varieties of taro, sugarcane, rice, breadfruit, coconut, pandanus and wild yam are dwindling, as are fruit and medicinal trees. Our traditional chicken, pig and goat breeds are disappearing. Of at least equal concern is that the current generation often know few of the names of our fish, shellfish, crabs, wild and cultivated plants and cultivars. They <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> how to hunt, fish, farm, preserve, prepare or eat many of our traditional foods. Young farmers, who <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> the names of our fruit trees and medicinal plants, no longer protect or plant them. In short, because of our ignorance and the shortsightedness of our national planners, we are losing our biodiversity. It is our choice. The sustainable use and protection of island and marine biodiversity is vital for food security for all of our island people. Email: Thaman_r@usp. ac. fj The opinions expressed in Viewpoint are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the views of CTA.

It {{sought to determine}} if internationally trained medical doctors have similar work qualifications as Scandinavian trained physicians and if the current national integration process is a cause of concern. It addresses {{the issue of the}} quality of the primary health care provided by IMGs, resident in Norway, as experienced by their Norwegian professional peers. Questionnaires were sent to 485 physicians. 327 returned the filled-in questionnaires and reported about their experiences with colleagues with a non-Scandinavian medical education. The returned questionnaires show how the respondents assess the professional, cultural, and communication skills of the foreign-trained physicians after their authorization as medical doctors in Norway. Interviews were conducted with representatives from the medical faculty, SAFH and the Norwegian Board of Health to discuss their plans for the future assessment and support of IMGs. Results: 1. Respondents express low satisfaction with IMGs trained in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, and point to inadequate language and communication skills as the number-one problem among these physicians. 2. Respondents report that the problems they see with the foreign trained physicians were compromising the quality of health care provided. Substantial proportions (5 %) of all reports conclude that poor communication skills are a very or fairly serious problem for patients, and of even greater concern, 4, 6 % of all respondents say that as a result of poor communication quality of care suffers and may put patients at risk. 3. Beyond the problems with communication, the Eastern Europe and World groups are united when it comes to IMGs medical professional skills (core medical knowledge, technical skills). Almost one third of the respondents pointed out that they are poorly satisfied with the quality of the professional skills of these IMGs. 4. Only a minority of respondents had concerns about IMGs respect for the autonomy of patients. 5. The solutions to the quality problems identified by the respondents and the interviewees include mandatory increased support and good parenting practices, better opportunities for continuing education and a stronger social and cultural training. To conclude, this study indicates that there are greater variations in the skill mix among internationally trained medical doctors than among their Scandinavian trained colleagues in tertiary health care. About one third of the reports point to more or less impaired quality of care. In 5 per cent of the reports these quality problems are closely linked to patient and colleague (dis) satisfaction. The problems are so grave in these cases that they may affect patient safety. The single most important problem identified in this report is inadequate language and communication skills. Given these results, it is clearly not a problem limited to certain facilities, professions, regions or places of education. Those working closely with foreign-trained physicians do, however, think that it is possible to introduce an educational program that might significantly alleviate the problems identified through this study...|$|R
