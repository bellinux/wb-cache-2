50|$|The S160's were {{designed}} for quick and efficient building, not long-term operations, thus compromises in design led to some difficulties in operation. The axle-box grease-lubricators were not very efficient, particularly when maintenance procedures lapsed or were delayed for operational war reasons, and so axle-boxes often ran <b>hot.</b> <b>Braking</b> was poor by European standards, with a Westinghouse steam brake used for the locomotive, which was woefully insufficient, due to the long distance from the driver's valve to the brake cylinder.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of self-similar hot viscous {{radiative}} accretion flow onto a rapidly spinning neutron star has recently been discovered. This “hot brake ” flow forms in the two-temperature zone (close to a central object), but at a sufficiently low accretion rate and a high spin it may extend in the radial direction beyond ∼ 300 Schwarzchild radii into a one-temperature zone. When the spin of the star is small enough, the flow transforms smoothly to an advection-dominated accretion flow. The properties of the <b>hot</b> <b>brake</b> flow are rather exceptional and surprising. All gas parameters (density, angular velocity, temperature, luminosity, angular momentum flux) except for the radial velocity are independent of the mass accretion rate; these quantities do depend sensitively on the spin of the neutron star. The gas angular momentum is transported outward under most conditions, hence the central star is nearly always spun-down. The luminosity of the <b>hot</b> <b>brake</b> flow arises from the rotational energy that is released as the star is braked by viscosity. The contribution from gravity is small, therefore the radiative efficiency may be arbitrarily large as ˙ M → 0. We demonstrate that the flow is also convectively stable and is unlikely to produce a strong outflow or wind...|$|R

2500|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{were unable to}} shut down the No.1 engine, which had to be doused by {{emergency}} crews for three hours after landing until flameout was achieved. The pilots considered whether to evacuate the plane immediately after landing as fuel was leaking from the left wing onto the brakes, which were extremely <b>hot</b> from maximum <b>braking.</b> The SCC pilot, David Evans, noted in an interview, [...] "We’ve got a situation where there is fuel, <b>hot</b> <b>brakes</b> and an engine that we can’t shut down. And really the safest place was on board the aircraft until such time as things changed. So we had the cabin crew with an alert phase the whole time through ready to evacuate, open doors, inflate slides at any moment. As time went by, that danger abated and, thankfully, we were lucky enough to get everybody off very calmly and very methodically through one set of stairs." [...] The plane was on battery power and had to contend with only one VHF radio to coordinate emergency procedure with the local fire crew.|$|R
40|$|Abridged) A {{new type}} of self-similar hot viscous {{radiative}} accretion flow onto a rapidly spinning neutron star has recently been discovered. This ``hot brake'' flow forms in the two-temperature zone (close to a central object), but at a sufficiently low accretion rate and a high spin it may extend in the radial direction beyond ~ 300 Schwarzchild radii into a one-temperature zone. When the spin of the star is small enough, the flow transforms smoothly to an advection-dominated accretion flow. All gas parameters (density, angular velocity, temperature, luminosity, angular momentum flux) except for the radial velocity are independent of the mass accretion rate. The radiative efficiency may be arbitrarily large as M-dot -> 0. The gas angular momentum is transported outward under most conditions, hence the central star is nearly always spun-down. The flow is convectively stable. We also find that themal conduction in the flow {{is strong enough to}} make the flow thermally stable. The very fact that the density, temperature and angular velocity of the gas at any radius in the <b>hot</b> <b>brake</b> flow are completely independent of the outer and inner (except for the star spin) boundary conditions implies that the flow cannot be smoothly matched to a general external medium as well as to general conditions on the star surface. We demonstrate that there are two extra self-similar solutions: one bridges the gap between the original solution and the external medium, and another represents a boundary layer between the bulk of the flow and the star surface, in which the gas temperature rapidly drops while the density builds up. Finally, we briefly discuss that a <b>hot</b> <b>brake</b> flow may form around other rapidly spinning compact objects: white dwarfs and black holes.

60|$|He worked mechanically. When a {{small bobbin}} ran out, {{he used his}} left hand for a <b>brake,</b> <b>stopping</b> the large bobbin {{and at the same}} time, with thumb and forefinger, {{catching}} the flying end of twine. Also, at the same time, with his right hand, he caught up the loose twine-end of a small bobbin. These various acts with both hands were performed simultaneously and swiftly. Then there would come a flash of his hands as he looped the weaver's knot and released the bobbin. There was nothing difficult about weaver's knots. He once boasted he could tie them in his sleep. And for that matter, he sometimes did, toiling centuries long in a single night at tying an endless succession of weaver's knots.|$|R
50|$|The Golconda Express {{passenger}} {{service from}} Guntur to Secunderabad {{was scheduled to}} stop at Warangal station in mid-morning, but the driver failed to halt the train. He has subsequently claimed that the <b>brakes</b> <b>stopped</b> working long before the service arrived at Warangal, and that his train {{was supposed to have}} been put onto a loop line around the station until the problem was fixed. This was done but due to the speed it jumped over the loop line and onto the road below the bridge situated just after the station as the driver lost control causing the engine and two carriages to break through a concrete barrier and fall into the crowded street below, crushing several cars, market stalls and rickshaws beneath it.|$|R
50|$|The primary set of <b>brakes</b> that <b>stops</b> the trains' {{movement}} {{at the end}} of the ride are known as the reduction brakes.

50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch <b>brake</b> <b>stops</b> the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|R
