In July 2012, the European Commission's ERA Communication gave renewed impetus to the realisation of ERA, targeting its completion in 2014. Transnational coordination of research at the programming level was identified as playing a prominent role in this, with ERA-NETs being a key instrument. These developments highlight the need to understand better the impact of the ERA-NET scheme. NETWATCH has accumulated substantial information on transnational research programme collaboration, which provides a solid basis for this impact assessment, together with complementary data from various secondary sources and additional data collection by JRC-IPTS. The issues addressed by the current report are threefold: -The direct impact of the ERA-NET scheme on the collaborative dimensions of national research programming practices, reflecting the extent to which the scheme is meeting its core objectives; -The impact of the scheme on the behaviour of participating organisations and; -The overall impact on the national and European research landscape, particularly the nature and level of transnational collaborative behaviour.

40|$|Salmonellosis {{caused by}} Salmonella {{bacteria}} is a food-borne disease and a worldwide health threat causing millions of infections {{and thousands of}} deaths every year. This pathogen infects an unusually broad range of host organisms including human and plants. A {{better understanding of the}} mechanisms of communication between Salmonella and its hosts requires identifying the interactions between Salmonella and host proteins. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the fundamental building blocks of communication. Here, we utilize the prediction platform BIANA to obtain the putative Salmonella-human and Salmonella-Arabidopsis interactomes based on sequence and domain similarity to known PPIs. A gold standard list of Salmonella-host PPIs served to validate the quality of the human model. 24, 726 and 10, 926 PPIs comprising interactions between 38 and 33 Salmonella effectors and virulence factors with 9, 740 human and 4, 676 Arabidopsis proteins, respectively, were predicted. Putative hub proteins could be identified, and parallels between the two interactomes were discovered. This approach can provide insight into possible biological functions of so far uncharacterized proteins.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new strengthening concept proposed for road bridges {{in the project}} SUREBridge (Sustainable Refurbishment of Existing Bridges), co-funded by the European Commission through the <b>ERA-NET</b> <b>Plus</b> Infravation 2014 Call. The project proposes an innovative and holistic refurbishment approach by using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials. The approach is designed for bridge upgrading, including repair and strengthening actions in {{the most effective and}} efficient way in terms of reducing construction time, resource consumption, and traffic disruption. SUREBridge concept consists of bonding prestressed carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates to the tensile parts of flexural members (such as bottom flange of girders), and installing glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) panels to the compressive parts (such as top of the existing concrete deck). A novel prestressing system is used to apply prestressed CFRP laminates eliminating the need for mechanical anchorage of the composite strips. The GFRP panels contribute by increasing the overall bending stiffness of the section and unloading the compressive concrete which might not be in a good condition. The GFRP panels are fabricated in a robust modified sandwich-type that ensures load-spreading onto the concrete. The bespoke design of the decks allows for widening the bridge and the incorporation of a curb to avoid further water ingress to the concrete substructure. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through lab test of the stepwise prestressing method and a case study of strengthened prototype beams. Furthermore, a theoretical model has been set up to predict the strengthened cross section’s ultimate bending moment...|$|E
40|$|Wiring {{economy has}} {{successfully}} explained the individual placement of neurons in simple nervous systems {{like that of}} Caenorhabditis elegans [[1], [2] and [3]] and the locations of coarser structures like cortical areas in complex vertebrate brains [4]. However, it remains unclear whether wiring economy can explain the placement of individual neurons in brains larger than that of C. elegans. Indeed, given the greater number of neuronal interconnections in larger brains, simply minimizing the length of connections results in unrealistic configurations, with multiple neurons occupying the same position in space. Avoiding such configurations, or volume exclusion, repels neurons from each other, thus counteracting wiring economy. Here we test whether wiring economy together with volume exclusion can explain the placement of neurons in a module of the Drosophila melanogaster brain known as lamina cartridge [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] and [13]]. We used newly developed techniques for semiautomated reconstruction from serial electron microscopy (EM) [14] to obtain the shapes of neurons, the location of synapses, and the resultant synaptic connectivity. We show that wiring length minimization and volume exclusion together can explain {{the structure of the}} lamina microcircuit. Therefore, even in brains larger than that of C. elegans, at least for some circuits, optimization can {{play an important role in}} individual neuron placement.

Several studies on cover/catch crops affecting nutrient leaching have been published but less information is available concerning their applicability for weed management. In our opinion, combinations of crop and cover crop types as well as crop sequencing conform IPM principles and optimize weed management. The PRODIVA project (<b>ERA-Net</b> Core Organic <b>Plus</b> Action, www. coreorganicplus. org) aims at identifying weed community associations with most common crop types in organic crop production systems. We will clarify the characteristics and relative competitiveness of cover crops providing strong weed suppression without severely compromising weed species diversity and crop yields. Long-term cropping system experiments in Denmark, Finland and Latvia provide information on weed dynamics both in terms of weed biomass production and weed community associations with cropping factors such as crop type, crop sequencing and mechanical weed control. We aim at understanding the main factors driving weed pressure and weed community assemblies under northern European circumstances. Perennial weed species (e. g. Cirsium arvense, Elymus repens, Sonchus arvensis) are particular important in organic cropping systems because they heavily constrain crop productivity. Cover crop establishment and early growth are key factors for the suppression of weeds. Poorly developed cover crops can cause extensive proliferation of rhizomatous perennials. Clover species (Trifolium spp.) {{are one of the most}} applicable cover crops thriving in the Nordic/Baltic agroclimate.

The goal of the CloudGrid project is to provide recommendations and strategies {{to meet the challenges of}} the future power system, to facilitate larger amount of intermittent renewable generation together with less nuclear production while providing a secure and reliable electrical power supply. The development of smart grid solutions is a key element to meet the challenges of the future power system. A decreased impact on the environment is the requirement which has started the systemic change which we see in the electrical power system. By developing and implementing solutions which provide an enhanced flexibility of the power system, we will be able to maintain a high reliability of electricity while utilising the power system in a more efficient manner and decreasing the environmental impact. The research in the CloudGrid project will focus on three areas: system stability, ancillary services, and interoperability between converters. These three areas are highly complementary, providing the project with a holistic view of the challenges of the future grid. Stability is a prerequisite for operating the power system, and there is a need to develop new solutions and methods in order to maintain system security in a system which is utilised in an increased and altered manner. With new components and systems integrated in the power system, there will also be new opportunities to support the system through additional ancillary service solutions and novel market concepts. An increased amount of power electronics in the system is a enabler for increased flexibility. However, this places increased requirements on compatibility and interoperability between the various converters. The method used in the CloudGrid project to improve the research is to increase the cooperation between the partners based on an interconnection between smart grid labs. The establishment of this transnational smart grid cloud shall facilitate possibilities to validate research result in different laboratory environment, in this way the project will be able to provide solutions with a broader level of validation and suitable for a wider range of equipment.  The CloudGrid project is a cooperation between the Swedish, Norwegian, Swiss, and Latvian partners: STRI, Chalmers Technical University, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Zurich University of Applied Sciences, and Institute of Physical Energetics.

Using the phosphoprotein data, we scored more than 2, 000 networks submitted by challenge participants. The networks spanned 32 biological contexts and were scored in terms of causal validity with respect to unseen interventional data. A number of approaches were effective, and incorporating known biology was generally advantageous. Additional sub-challenges considered time-course prediction and visualization. Our results suggest that learning causal relationships may be feasible in complex settings such as disease states.

40|$|Reanalysis {{products}} {{have become a}} tool for wind energy users requiring information about the wind speed long-term variability. These users are sensitive to {{many aspects of the}} observational references they employ to estimate the wind resource, such as the mean wind, its seasonality and long-term trends. However, the assessment of the ability of atmospheric reanalyses to reproduce wind speed trends has not been undertaken yet. The wind speed trends have been estimated using the ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERA-I), the second version of the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA- 2) and the Japanese 55 -year Reanalysis (JRA- 55) for the period 1980 – 2015. These trends show a strong spatial and seasonal variability with an overall increase of the wind speed over the ocean and a tendency to a decline over land, although important disagreements between the different reanalyses have been found. In particular, the JRA- 55 reanalysis produces more intense trends over land than ERA-I and MERRA- 2. This can be linked to the negative bias affecting the JRA- 55 near-surface wind speeds over land. In all the reanalyses high wind speeds tend to change faster than both low and average wind speeds. The agreement of the wind speed trends at 850 [*]hPa with those found close to the surface suggests that the main driver of the wind speed trends are the changes in large-scale circulation.

40|$|Climate {{predictions}} {{tailored to}} the wind energy sector represent an innovation {{in the use of}} climate information to better manage the future variability of wind energy resources. Wind energy users have traditionally employed a simple approach that is based on an estimate of retrospective climatological information. Instead, climate predictions can better support the balance between energy demand and supply, as well as decisions relative to the scheduling of maintenance work. One limitation {{for the use of the}} climate predictions is the bias, which has until now prevented their incorporation in wind energy models because they require variables with statistical properties that are similar to those observed. To overcome this problem, two techniques of probabilistic climate forecast bias adjustment are considered here: a simple bias correction and a calibration method. Both approaches assume that the seasonal distributions are Gaussian. These methods are linear and robust and neither requires parameter estimation—essential features for the small sample sizes of current climate forecast systems. This paper is the first to explore the impact of the necessary bias adjustment on the forecast quality of an operational seasonal forecast system, using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts seasonal predictions of near-surface wind speed to produce useful information for wind energy users. The results reveal to what extent the bias adjustment techniques, in particular the calibration method, are indispensable to produce statistically consistent and reliable predictions. The forecast-quality assessment shows that calibration is a fundamental requirement for high-quality climate service.

Electronic supplementary material is available online at: [URL] or [URL] genome of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a herbivore, is missing important elements of the canonical Drosophila immune pathways necessary to fight bacterial infections. However, {{it is not known}} whether spider mites can mount an immune response and survive bacterial infection. In other chelicerates, bacterial infection elicits a response mediated by immune effectors leading to the survival of infected organisms. In T. urticae, infection by either Escherichia coli or Bacillus megaterium did not elicit a response as assessed through genome-wide transcriptomic analysis. In line with this, spider mites died within days even upon injection with low doses of bacteria that are non-pathogenic to Drosophila Moreover, bacterial populations grew exponentially inside the infected spider mites. By contrast, Sancassania berlesei, a litter-dwelling mite, controlled bacterial proliferation and resisted infections with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria lethal to T. urticae This differential mortality between mite species was absent when mites were infected with heat-killed bacteria. Also, we found that spider mites harbour in their gut 1000 -fold less bacteria than S. berlesei We show that T. urticae has lost the capacity to mount an induced immune response against bacteria, in contrast to other mites and chelicerates but similarly to the phloem feeding aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Hence, our results reinforce the putative evolutionary link between ecological conditions regarding exposure to bacteria and the architecture of the immune response.

40|$|In both {{conventional}} and organic European vineyards, {{it is quite}} common to have areas characterized by problems in vine health, grape production and quality. These problems are very often related to sub-optimal soil functionality, caused by an improper land preparation before vine plantation and/or management. Different causes for soil malfunctioning can include: poor organic matter content and plant nutrient availability (both major and trace elements); imbalance of some element ratios (Ca/Mg, K/Mg, P/Fe, and Fe/Mn); pH; water deficiency; soil compaction and/or scarce oxygenation. Fertility related problems can often be compensated in conventional settings with externally introduced fertilizers that are not permitted in organic vineyards. ReSolVe is a transnational and multidisciplinary research project aimed at testing the effects of selected agronomic strategies for restoring optimal soil functionality in degraded areas within organic vineyard. The term "degraded areas within vineyard" means areas showing reduced vine growth, disease resistance, grape yield and quality. These areas may have lost their soil functionality because of either an improper land preparation, or an excessive loss of soil organic matter and nutrients, erosion and/or compaction. The project, financed by Core-Organic plus program of the <b>ERA-NET</b> <b>plus</b> action (2015 - 2018), aims at identifying the main causes of the soil functionality loss and testing different organic recovering methods. The different restoring strategies will implement: i) compost, ii) green manure with winter legumes, iii) dry mulching with cover crops. The strategies will be tested according to their efficiency to improve: i) plant and roots growth and well-being; ii) grape yield and quality; iii) quality of soil ecosystem services and their stability over the years; iv) better express of the “terroir effect”, that is, the linkage of wine quality to the environmental characteristics of the cultivation site.

The experimental vineyards are situated in Italy (Chianti hills and Maremma plain, Tuscany), France (Bordeaux and Languedoc), Spain (La Rioja) and Slovenia (Primorska) for winegrape, and in Turkey (Adana and Mersin) for table grape. The restoration techniques and the monitoring methodologies developed and tested during the ReSolVe project will be described in specific final guidelines.

In this doctoral thesis it is presented the realization of an advanced optical multimodal microscope that integrates coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation and two-photon excitation fluorescence techniques in a single powerful tool. The combination of all these microscopy techniques in a single microscope allows gathering more information during samples imaging, implementing fluorescence technique with label free techniques. A description of the experimental setup of the realized multimodal microscope is presented together with the metrological characterization of the instrument, evaluating the main uncertainty sources that influence the measurement processes. Label free microscopy techniques allow performing measurements on biological samples with low invasiveness, since to image the specimens it is not demanded any specific sample preparation. This characteristic leads to measurements on living samples with a true low impact, opening new avenues on the research in biology and in particular way in regenerative medicine. Novel applications of these microscopy techniques are presented to study the extracellular matrix production in both fixed and living samples, as well as to characterize the scaffolds topology and the scaffold-cells interactions in a time-lapse experiment using living samples. This doctorate thesis is composed by a state of the art chapter in which are discussed the advanced nonlinear optical microscopy techniques from a theoretical point of view, the main experimental implementations of CARS microscopy and the main parameters and properties to be measured relevant in regenerative medicine applications and products. A chapter is dedicated to the experimental setup for the realization of the multimodal CARS-SHG-TPEF microscope at the I. N. Ri. M. laboratory. A specific chapter is dedicated {{to the study of the}} main sources of uncertainty of the measurements using CARS, TPEF and SHG techniques. A chapter in which are discussed the biological experiments realized using the multimodal CARS-SHG-TPEF microscope and at the end a final chapter with the conclusion of this doctorate thesis. This study has been conducted at the Italian institute of metrology (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica, I. N. Ri. M.) as part of the projects REGENMED, METREGEN and ACTIVE with funding respectively from the UE (<b>ERA-NET</b> <b>plus</b> Grant Agreement No 217257) and from Piedmont Region on UE under the programs CIPE 2007 - converging technologies, grant 0126000010 -METREGEN and POR-FESR I-I. 1. 3 -I 1. 1 - ACTIVE. The main accomplished results are: • The development of the whole experimental multimodal CARS-SHG-TPEF microscopy system • The theoretical study of the main sources of uncertainty in the measurements with CARS, TPEF and SHG techniques. • The realization of biological experiments using these microscopy techniques: o To study the collagen production from fixed histological sections of human dermal fibroblasts cultured in fibrin gel scaffold using CARS and SHG techniques o To study the collagen production by live human fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells cultured in fibrin gel scaffold using CARS and SHG techniques o To characterize polymeric scaffolds in culture media with a label-free method using CARS and SHG techniques o To study the colonization in a two days time-lapse experiment of a polymeric scaffold by human mesenchymal stem cells stained with calcein using CARS and TPEF technique...|$|E
