Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a RÃ¼ppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E
25|$|Since 1970, {{reduction}} of farmland {{has resulted in}} reduced environment for, and reduced numbers of various shrubland birds including the American woodcock, brown thrasher, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee,</b> willow flycatcher, golden-winged warbler, blue-winged warbler, field sparrow, and Baltimore oriole.|$|E
500|$|Although {{many species}} of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds, the {{northern}} mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so. Among the species and vocalizations imitated are Carolina wren, northern cardinal, tufted titmouse, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee,</b> house sparrow, wood thrush and eastern bluebird songs, calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher, jeers and pumphandles of the blue jay, and alarm, chups, and chirrs [...] of the American robin. It imitates not only birds, but also other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the Florida scrub-jay.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> {{primarily}} eat on the ground, {{although they}} also glean from vegetation. In a southeastern Massachusetts pitch pine barren, 73.5% {{of male and}} 80.4% of female foraging observations were on the ground. When foraging on the ground <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> use a scratching technique where both feet kick back simultaneously. In a laboratory study 4 <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> used this method to successfully obtain seed buried almost 1 in deep. When foraging above ground the majority of time is spent gleaning foliage. In Massachusetts, 22.5% of male and 16.3% of female foraging observations were of food being gleaned from foliage. <b>Eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> were also observed gleaning from twigs, branches, and trunks. When gleaning, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> occurred significantly (p<0.01) more often on the distal half of tree branches compared to using distal and proximal portions equally. In 0.5% of male and 0.3% of female foraging observations, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> hovered. <b>Eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> were never observed catching food out of the air.|$|R
50|$|Compared to nests, adult towhee {{survival}} rates are high. Average weekly adult survival rate of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> in a South Carolina study area was 99.3%. This rate {{was obtained from}} radio-marked <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> and represented the pooled survival of both sexes and from 2 South Carolina sites, young and mature stands of loblolly and longleaf pine. Between 1962 and 1967 in Pennsylvania, annual survival of breeding <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> calculated from mistnetting recaptures was 58%. According to a literature review, {{both males and females}} become reproductively mature in their second year. <b>Eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> of over 12 years old {{have been reported in the}} wild.|$|R
50|$|Arrival and {{departure}} of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> into summer breeding grounds varies with location. According to a literature review, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> typically arrive in New York in early April and leave {{by the middle}} of November. A review of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> in New Hampshire describes arrival in late April to May with the majority departing in September. Further south, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, migration to high-elevation areas within the Great Smoky Mountains begins as early as March. <b>Eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> typically leave these sites in October. The Pipilo e. erythrophthalmus subspecies is the most migratory of the subspecies.|$|R
50|$|Eastern towhees have fairly strong {{fidelity}} to breeding territories. In an oak forest in New Jersey, adult <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> return rates were 20% the 1st year after banding and 43% in subsequent years. Between 1960 and 1967, {{the maximum number}} of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> returns to the site was 5. In a Pennsylvania woodlot observed between 1962 and 1967, an <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> returned to the site for 4 consecutive years.|$|E
50|$|Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitize <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests. In a South Carolina old field, 5 of 19 <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests were parasitized. Each parasitized nest {{contained}} 1 Brown-headed Cowbird egg. The desertion {{rate for}} parasitized nests was 20%, which {{was similar to}} nests {{that had not been}} parasitized (21%). Two of the five Brown-headed Cowbird eggs produced fledglings. The study did not determine if there was a difference in nest success between parasitized and nonparasitized nests. In West Virginia, only 3 of 41 <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests were parasitized by the Brown-headed Cowbird. Average number of fledged young in nonparasitized nests was 2.8, which was similar to the average of 2.7 fledglings per parasitized nest. In a Pennsylvania study site, only 2 of 36 nests were parasitized and both produced <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> fledglings. In a study of nest parasitism on Sanibel Island, none of 5 <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests found were parasitized.|$|E
5000|$|Although eastern towhees {{generally}} prefer young successional sites, variation between {{habitat types}} and {{years has been}} observed. Krementz and Powell [...] found higher relative abundance of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> in young (2-6 years old) stands of loblolly and longleaf pine than mature (32-98 years old) stands when investigated in 1995. However, in stands compared in 1996, the 95% confidence intervals of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> relative abundance on the 2 sites had a substantial degree of overlap. The degree to which <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> responds to succession is influenced by habitat. For example, in Pennsylvania {{there was a significant}} (p<0.05) difference between <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> densities (number/10 ha) between mature mixed-oak forest and stands that had been clearcut about 5 years previously. However, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> densities did not differ significantly between a 1-year old mixed aspen (Populus tremuloides, P. grandidentata) clearcut, a 5-year old aspen clearcut, and a mature aspen stand. <b>Eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> abundance has been shown to peak at different times in different habitats. For instance, although in central hardwood forests eastern towhees were most abundant in regenerating stands, in loblolly and shortleaf pine forest they were most common in pole timber and mature stands. In addition, Bell and Whitmore concluded that early successional is likely too broad of a term for describing optimal towhee habitat, since high density of small trees was negatively associated with <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> density in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> {{occur in}} many habitats, from tallgrass prairies and marshes to mature forests. However, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> are {{most common in}} early {{successional}} stands, habitat edges, and areas with similar vegetation structure throughout eastern forests.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> {{range from}} near sea level to {{as high as}} 6500 ft along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina during the summer. A {{literature}} review reports <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> up to 3000 ft in New Hampshire.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{begins in}} spring and {{continues}} to late summer. Reports of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> nesting as early as late March in Florida and Georgia, in mid- to late April in some midwestern states, and as late as mid-May in northern New England were summarized in a literature review. Literature reviews also report nest construction by the female, which takes about three to five days. Egg laying typically occurs until August. For example, a review of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> in Indiana notes nesting from 15 April to 20 August. However, a literature review of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> in Florida included a report of a nest observed on 2 September 1983 that contained two eggs. According to several literature reviews, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> may renest after failed nesting attempts and can raise two, and in the south sometimes three, broods per season.|$|R
50|$|Nesting habitat: Eastern towhees {{typically}} nest on or {{near the}} ground. Several literature reviews note the predominance of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests below 5 ft. In a study of cowbird parasitism on Sanibel Island, all 5 <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests located were within 6 ft of the ground. Nests as high as 18 ft have been reported in literature reviews. Nests higher off the ground in mixed aspen stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania had significantly (p<0.001) lower nest success. Of 13 unsuccessful <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests, 11 were greater than 1 ft above the ground.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide range}} of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nest success values have been reported. On Sanibel Island, 1 of the 5 <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests {{observed}} was successful. In Louisiana, average daily nest success rate was 95.3% on a bottomland hardwood forest site. The same study found a 92.6% average daily nest success rate in a 6-year-old managed cottonwood (Populus spp.) plantation in Alabama. Average <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nest success across mixed bigtooth (P. grandidentata) and quaking aspen (P. tremuloides) stands of varying ages in Pennsylvania was 48.1%. In South Carolina, only 1 of 10 nests was successful, and the mean daily nest survival rate was 62.9%. This low value was explained by high levels of predation. Due to lower nest success rates of Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) than the previous year, {{it is suggested that}} <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nest success may have been measured during a comparatively poor year.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{studies have}} {{addressed}} {{the effect of the}} size of habitat patches on eastern towhees. In mixed-oak forest in New Jersey, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> frequency generally increased with patch size, although eastern towhees were detected in all plot sizes (0.5 - 59 acre) except 0.02-acre (0.01 ha) plots. On a site in South Carolina, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> frequency of occurrence increased as clearcut size increased from <2.5 acre to clearcut sizes from 21 to about 32 acres (8.5-12.8 ha). On another site <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> frequency declined as clearcut size increased from 19 to 48 to 62 acre. Eastern towhees only bred in riparian vegetation patches in Iowa that were at least 650 ft wide. In southern and eastern Pennsylvania <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nest success was not significantly (pâ¥0.10) different on sites with gradual edges and those with more distinct edges between [...] "wildlife habitat openings" [...] and oak-hickory forest.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} {{a positive correlation between}} <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> abundance and understory density. In a loblolly pine forest in South Carolina, understory (0 - 10 ft) pine volume was significantly (p<0.001) positively correlated with the average number of <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> territories per experimental unit. Yahner [...] found the average density of eastern towhees over 6 habitat types was significantly (p<0.05) positively correlated with density of short (2-5-foot (0.5-1.5 m)) shrubs. In east-central Florida slash pine (P. elliottii) flatwoods with understories dominated by myrtle oak (Q. myrtifolia) and sand live oak (Q. geminata) and in scrub sites with scattered slash pine and cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> densities were significantly (p=0.01) negatively correlated with mean shrub height.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{literature}} review, Greenlaw [...] reports mean breeding territory size of 4 acre (range 1.6 - 6 acre, n=24) in a mesic oak (Quercus species) forest where eastern towhees {{occurred at a}} density of 21 males/40 ha. In a xeric pine (Pinus species)-oak woodland where the <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> density was 32 males/40 ha, mean <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> territory size was 3 acre (range 1.8 - 4 acre, n=20). In Massachusetts, mean male <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> territory size was about 1.3 acre, and female <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> territory size was 1.1 acre. Territory size changed {{over the course of}} the breeding season and was not significantly (p>0.05) affected by reductions in food availability of 30% or less. During the winter eastern towhees are not as territorial and may be seen in mixed species flocks. Daily movement of eastern towhees in loblolly (P. taeda) and longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests and clearcuts in South Carolina averaged 325 ft per day. Only 2 females, out of 11 females and 9 males, stayed within the stand where they were captured for the duration of a 10-week study.|$|E
40|$|Populations of shrub-breeding {{birds are}} declining in eastern North America, {{and loss of}} habitat has been implicated in these declines. Seasonal use of habitat by shrub-breeding birds in the southeastern US remains understudied {{despite the fact that}} it is well {{documented}} that species resident within a region can shift habitat use dramatically between seasons. To better understand year-round habitat occupancy by shrub-breeding birds, we conducted bird counts and vegetation surveys during summer and winter 2008 â 2009 within Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama. We used multi-season occupancy models to examine use of habitat and to contrast seasonal occupancy patterns of four species of resident shrub-breeding birdsâBrown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum), <b>Eastern</b> <b>Towhees</b> (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Carolina Wrens (Thryothorus ludovicianus). Brown Thrashers and <b>Eastern</b> <b>Towhees</b> are partially migratoryâmeaning some populations have separate breeding and wintering areasâwhereas Carolina Wrens and Northern Cardinals are non-migratory. All four species showed seasonal changes in use of habitat between summer and winter, and all species were associated with both vegetation structure and certain types of cover. Further, partially migratory shrub-breeding species had greater site-turnover and increases in occupancy between summer and winter than non-migratory species. Our results suggest that: (1) management actions based on breeding habitat requirements will likely not create suitable winter habitat, and (2) management of resident shrub-breeding birds will require not only the creation and maintenance of certain types of cover, but also certain structural aspects of vegetation within habitats...|$|R
50|$|BirdsThanks to its {{proximity}} to the Atlantic Ocean, the North River Wildlife Sanctuary offers {{a wide variety of}} bird sightings. Along the riverâs edge, several species of gulls can be seen in season, including great black-backed, herring, ring-billed and Bonaparteâs gulls. Egrets and herons feed in the marshy edges of the river. Red-tailed hawks hunt in the open field, while sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks prey on the smaller birds that inhabit the area. A wide variety of birds breed on the property, including American woodcocks, red-bellied woodpeckers, tree swallows, eastern phoebes, Baltimore orioles, scarlet tanagers, <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees,</b> and more.

50|$|Eastern towhees nest in {{a variety}} of species {{including}} grape and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). The majority of nests observed in South Carolina loblolly and longleaf pine forests and clearcuts were located in grape, tree sparkleberry (V. arboreum), and oak (Quercus spp.). On an oak-hickory site in West Virginia, 27% of 41 <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests were found in grape, 17% in blackberry (Rubus spp.), 12% in greenbrier (Smilax spp.), and 12% in mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Nests also occurred in Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), spice bush (Lindera benzoin), and azalea (Rhododendron spp.). In a power line right-of-way in Pennsylvania, the 6 <b>eastern</b> <b>towhee</b> nests observed occurred in Allegheny blackberry, witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), white oak (Q. alba), eastern hayscented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) and sweetfern (Comptonia peregrina) combined, and on ground level.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} on nearly 18, 000 bird-captures involving 125 species banded between 1992 and 2005 at two Platte Valley study areas {{in central and}} western Nebraska. Weight data for more than 1 1, 500 individuals of 74 species are summarized by age, sex and banding site, including several species having larger samples than in any previously published reports. Breeding evidence was obtained for 67 species in one or both locations, and 108 of the total 125 species banded were migrants, 71 percent of which were Neotropical migrants. The largest banding totals were obtained at Cedar Point Biological Station, in Keith County, but large numbers were also obtained at sites in Dawson County, about 100 miles to the east.

40|$|The Platte River {{has changed}} from a nearly {{treeless}} prairie river to a heavily forested river. These habitat changes have likely benefited many woodland birds, but have harmed other migratory birds such as cranes. In response to this impact on migratory birds, conservation groups implemented a tree-clearing program to enhance habitat for these species. This practice is not without controversy {{because of concerns about}} its effect on woodland birds. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the composition and abundance of breeding birds that use these forests and discuss the potential impacts of tree clearing on woodland birds. Surveys were conducted using the point-count method. I observed 56 breeding species during 1998 and 1999. The most abundant woodland birds were house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), Baltimore orioles (Icterus galbula), American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis), blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata), common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas), <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees</b> (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), and northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis). The avian community is dominated by migratory species that are forest-edge and open-forest generalists. Certainly, conservationists and managers should consider the impact of the river-clearing program on woodland birds. However, a high priority must be placed on those species that are declining or have been severely impacted by the expansion of riparian forests. Ultimately, conservationists and managers must consider both the detriments and benefits of the program and make management decisions accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Early {{successional}} {{birds have}} {{declined in the}} northeastern United States due to the regeneration of forest on abandoned farm fields and the suppression of natural disturbances that once provided appropriate habitat. These species have become increasingly dependent on early successional habitats generated by such activities as timber harvesting. Recent approaches of timber harvesting, which range from single-tree harvesting to clearcutting, create forest openings of different sizes and configurations embedded in landscapes with different land use patterns. To assess the importance of forest openings created by timber harvesting for shrubland birds, we surveyed birds on 50 m radius plots in 34 harvest sites (0. 5 â 21 ha). We collected data on multi-scaled habitat variables ranging from plot-level vegetation characteristics to land use patterns within 1 km of each study site. We also monitored mating and nesting success of Blue-winged Warblers (Vermivora pinus) in 10 forest openings. The abundance of most shrubland species was influenced by plot-level habitat variables, such as tree density and vegetation height, rather than shrubland area or the composition of land uses in the surrounding landscape. Only <b>Eastern</b> <b>Towhees</b> (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) were more frequent in survey plots in larger forest openings. In contrast, neither abundance nor reproductive activity of Blue-winged Warblers was correlated {{with the size of}} the forest opening. Their abundance was negatively related to vegetation height, however. Only 54 % of the territorial male Blue-winged Warblers in forest openings were mated. We documented relatively low nest success rates of 21. 1 % during the egg laying and incubation nest stages, but increased success rates during the later stages of nesting. Our results indicate that even small forest openings with low vegetation provide habitat for Blue-winged Warblers and other shrubland birds. The overall reproductive rate of territorial male Blue-winged Warblers in forests openings was low during the 2 years of the study, however. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term value of this type of habitat for sustaining shrubland bird populations...|$|R

40|$|I {{studied the}} effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on {{floodplain}} and upland forest along the Missouri and Platte Rivers in eastern Nebraska. Analyses included {{the effects of}} deer browsing on vegetation, foliage and litter invertebrates, birds during the breeding season, and birds during migration. Sites with high deer abundances had fewer small woody plants and small trees. Hackberry trees (Celtis occidentalis) were more common and had greater importance values at sites with high deer abundances. Both foliage arthropods and litter invertebrates varied between seasons. Few differences in foliage arthropod and litter invertebrate abundances existed between sites with high and low deer abundances. Canonical correlation analysis distinguished between habitat and bird variables associated with deer-altered and unaltered habitat. Cavity and canopy-nesting birds were more common and shrub-nesting birds were less common at sites with high deer abundances. Aerial foragers were more common at sites with high deer abundances. The majority of species tested were either unaffected or positively affected in deer-altered habitat. Some birds associated with understory, including Rose-breasted Grosbeaks (Pheuticus ludovicianus) and Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum), were less common at sites with high deer abundances. House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon), American Robins (Turdus migatorius), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), and <b>Eastern</b> <b>Towhees</b> (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), responded differently to deer-altered habitat in upland forest than in floodplain forest. Predation on artificial nests was high (88 %) throughout the study area but did not differ between sites with high and low deer abundances. Nest predation frequency on artificial nests was related to total vegetation volume and edge-to-area ratio. During spring and fall migration, short distance migrants and resident birds were more common {{on the ground and}} in the understory at sites with high deer abundances. Resident birds and migrants underutilized hackberries during spring and fall migration. Least Flycatchers (Empidonax minimus) were positively associated with shrub density. The majority of bird species during migration did not differ in their use of deer-altered and unaltered habitat and were not associated with habitat variables. ...|$|R
40|$|Accurate sound-localization {{abilities}} are {{often associated with}} a predatory life style. Barn owls, Tyto alba, for example, use auditory cues to locate prey in the dark (Konishi, 1973) and can resolve azimuth (direction in the horizontal plane) with a minimum resolvable angle of less than 5 Â° (e. g. Bala and Takahashi, 2000). Similarly, female parasitoid flies, Ormia ochracea, use auditory cues to locate their hosts and can resolve azimuth with an error of only 2 Â° (Mason et al., 2001). Nevertheless, and aside from animals who use active echolocation for navigation, there may be little reason to assume that predators alone should possess outstanding sound-localization abilities. Indeed, if accurate sound localization can improve an animalâs ability to hear over distance or in noise (e. g. Dent et al., 1997; Grothe and Neuweiler, 2000), then one might also expect to find notable sound-localization abilities in other animals. Small birds, for example, not only need to localize sound sources accurately to track the locations of signalers over vast areas, but they might also discriminate reverberations separately from direct sound to resolve fine spectral and temporal patterns in complex vocalizations (Dent and Dooling, 2003; Dent et al., 1997). Studies have suggested that small birds may be unremarkable in their abilities to resolve azimuth (Klump, 2000; Klump et al., 1986; Park and Dooling, 1991). Nevertheless, pigeons, Columba livia, were found to resolve azimuth with surprising accuracy (4 â 7 Â°; Lewald, 1987) and a previous investigation demonstrated that <b>eastern</b> <b>towhees,</b> Pipilo erythrophthalmus, resolve azimuth nearly {{as well as the}} pigeon (Nelson and Stoddard, 1998). In this study we describe how towhees were able to assess azimuth across three sound-localization experiments that were conducted in the field. We then report results from a two-alternative forced-choice (2 AFC) experiment in which towhees in the laboratory were required to discriminate between two speaker locations. Animals typically use several cues when localizing sound sources. Humans, for example, use interaural time differences (ITD) when localizing relatively low sound frequencies (<~ 1. 5 Â·kHz) but use interaural level differences (ILD) or spectral cues when localizing relatively high sound frequencie...|$|R
