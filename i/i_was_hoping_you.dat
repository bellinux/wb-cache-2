60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. [In {{her most}} nonchalant manner.] My dear Sir Robert, {{you are a}} man of the world, and you have your price, I suppose. Everybody has nowadays.

[...] "Well, we can't lose time {{in trying}} to investigate. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>you</b> two boys would turn up to-day or to-morrow. Day after to-morrow a boat sails for Juneau, and if I rustle around I think I can secure passage for {{ourselves}} and our traps. If we don't catch this boat, we'll have to wait two weeks, or else take a train for Portland and wait ten days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine. Yours. Ours. Oh, Kirk, darling, I was {{so afraid}} that you would come back bulging with a fortune that would make my little one look like nothing. But you haven't, you haven't, and it's just splendid." [...] She caught his hand and pressed it. [...] "It's simply sweet of you to look so astonished. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>you</b> would.

40|$|Most grammars {{emphasize}} the aspectual {{function of the}} progressive, as in I am running. But the progressive is also used in examples such as Mary is being ironical; John is being an angel; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>you</b> could come to join us for dinner tomorrow; I was wondering whether you could help me. In other words, it does not fulfil an aspectual function, but a function involving a specific interpretation of a situation by the speaker. In this paper, the interpretative function of the progressive will be examined through {{a particular set of}} examples illustrating a `polite' use of the progressive. 1 Introduction Most of the time, the function of the progressive form is analysed in aspectuo-temporal terms. Namely it does not consider the end of an event, i. e. a situation indicating change. This can be illustrated in the following examples: (1) I am running (activity verb).

6000|$|She {{remained}} there, {{with eyes}} fixed on the burning coals, till her mother came up. [...] "What, Madeline," [...] said Lady Staveley, [...] "are you here still? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in <b>hopes</b> <b>you</b> would have <b>been</b> in bed before this." ...|$|R
