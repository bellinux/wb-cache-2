40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on grammatical agreement in order to synthesise and distinguish theoretical arguments and experimental data relative to the maximal and minimal input hypotheses. The maximal input hypothesis assumes that during {{the construction of a}} syntactic frame for the sentence, the <b>grammatical</b> <b>encoder</b> takes advantage of any relevant information, i. e. information within the lexicon, but also from the conceptual and morphophonological levels. In contrast, the minimal input hypothesis assumes that only a limited flow, of lexico-syntactic information reaches the <b>grammatical</b> <b>encoder.</b> Experimental data on adult performance in grammatical agreement tasks are considered in different languages. Major differences are reported between English and romance languages like French, Italian and Spanish as {{to the question of the}} minimal vs. maximal input frameworks. It is suggested that contradictions between results have to be examined in the light of the variability within each language as well as between languages. We suggest that the use of a particular information (conceptual, lexical, morphophonological) depends simultaneously on its validity and on its cost, with these two indexes varying both within and between languages...|$|E
40|$|The patient {{described}} here suffers from Broca's aphasia without a comprehension disorder. She is unique, since {{she has two}} speech styles available and she shifts between them spontaneously. One style {{is characterized by a}} mild syntactic disorder and the other by a quite severe morphological and syntactic disorder. None of the current theories about the underlying disorder in Broca patients without comprehension deficits can account for the fact that two linguistically different speech styles can occur in one patient, except the adaptation theory. It will be argued that both styles {{can be explained by the}} assumption of an impairment to the <b>grammatical</b> <b>encoder</b> (a processor which transforms the preverbal message into a surface structure, Levelt, 1989). This view suggests that the distinction between syntactic and morphological agrammatism could be a matter of strategy, rather than of impairment. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of several corpus studies we carried out into the frequencies of argument NP orderings in the midﬁeld of subordinate and main clauses of German. Comparing the corpus frequencies with grammaticality ratings published by Keller’s (2000), we observe a “grammaticality–frequency gap”: Quite a few argument orderings with zero corpus frequency are nevertheless assigned medium–range grammaticality ratings. We propose an explanation {{in terms of a}} two-factor theory. First, we hypothesize that the grammatical induction component needs a sufficient number of exposures to a syntactic pattern to incorporate it into its repertoire of more or less stable rules of grammar. Moderately to highly frequent argument NP orderings are likely have attained this status, but not their zero-frequency counterparts. This is why the latter argument sequences cannot be produced by the <b>grammatical</b> <b>encoder</b> and are absent from the corpora. Secondly, we assumed that an extraneous (nonlinguistic) judgment process biases the ratings of moderately grammatical linear order patterns: Confronted with such structures, the informants produce their own “ideal delivery” variant of the to-be-rated target sentence and evaluate the similarity between the two versions. A high similarity score yielded by this judgment then exerts a positive bias on the grammaticality rating—a score that should not be mistaken for an authentic grammaticality rating. We conclude that, at least in the linearization domain studied here, the goal of gaining {{a clear view of the}} internal grammar of language users is best served by a combined strategy in which grammar rules are founded on structures that elicit moderate to high grammaticality ratings and attain at least moderate usage frequencies...|$|E
40|$|In present-day spoken German, {{subordinate}} clauses {{introduced by}} the connector weil ‘because’ occur with two orders of subject, finite verb, and object(s). In addition to weil clauses with verb-final word order (“VF”; standard in subordinate clauses) one often hears weil clauses with SVO, the standard order of main clauses (“verb-second”, V 2). The “weil-V 2 ” phenomenon is restricted to sentences where the weil clause follows the main clause, and is virtually absent from formal (written, edited) German, occurring only in extemporaneous speech. Extant accounts of weil-V 2 focus on the interpretation of weil-V 2 clauses by the hearer, in particular {{on the type of}} discourse relation licensed by weil-V 2 vs. weil-VF: causal/propositional or inferential/epistemic. Focusing instead on the production of weil clauses by the speaker, we examine a collection of about 1, 000 sentences featuring a causal connector (weil, da or denn) after the main clause, all extracted from a corpus of spoken German dialogues and annotated with tags denoting major prosodic and syntactic boundaries, and various types of disfluencies (pauses, hesitations). Based on the observed frequency patterns and on known linguistic properties of the connectors, we propose that weil-V 2 is caused by miscoordination between the mechanisms for lexical retrieval and grammatical encoding: Due to its high frequency, the lexical item weil is often selected prematurely, while the <b>grammatical</b> <b>encoder</b> is still working on the syntactic shape of the weil clause. Weil-V 2 arises when pragmatic and processing factors drive the encoder to discontinue the current sentence, and to plan the clause following weil {{in the form of the}} main clause of an independent, new sentence. Thus, the speaker continues with a V 2 clause, seemingly in violation of the VF constraint imposed by the preceding weil. We also explore implications of the model regarding the interpretation of sentences containing causal connectors...|$|E
