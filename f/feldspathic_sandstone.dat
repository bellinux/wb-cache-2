25|$|The Ordovician turbidites, {{consisting}} of greywacke, <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone,</b> micaceous siltstone, micaceous shale, chert, and phyllite, {{are very similar}} {{in all parts of}} the Tasman Orogen, including New Zealand and the Transantarctic Mountains. Detrital zircons from the turbidites have been isotopically dated with age ranges of 0.46 and 0.60 Gya, 1.0 and 1.2 Gya, and at ~1.8 Gya, ~2.2 Gya and ~2.7 Gya. These do not match the age of zircons from the interior of the Australian Shield, so the source of the sediments is from another continent. The other evidence from the Ordovician sediments are chemical composition indicates granitic source, with the absence of feldspar. Secondly the fine grained nature shows the sediments have been transported a long way from their ultimate, source, and could have been second cycle, derived from sedimentary rocks.|$|E

50|$|Rocks {{that were}} {{originally}} sedimentary and rocks that were undoubtedly igneous may be metamorphosed into schists and gneisses. If originally of similar composition {{they may be}} very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A quartz-porphyry, for example, and a fine <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone,</b> may both be metamorphosed into a grey or pink mica-schist.|$|E
50|$|The Mafinga Hills are {{a plateau}} covered by hills, {{situated}} {{on the border between}} Zambia and Malawi, in Southern Africa. These hills are composed of quartzites, phyllites and <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstones</b> of sedimentary origin.|$|R
50|$|In a {{few cases}} rocks are fused and in the dark glassy product minute {{crystals}} of spinel, sillimanite and cordierite may separate out. Shales are occasionally thus altered by basalt dikes, and <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstones</b> may be completely vitrified. Similar changes may be induced in shales by the burning of coal seams or even by an ordinary furnace.|$|R
50|$|Phyllitic mudstones (phyllite being a {{fine-grained}} metamorphic rock) and fine-grained to medium-grained <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstones</b> lie atop an igneous base of dolerites, {{and it is}} {{from these}} dolerites {{that much of the}} soils in the area are formed. These soils are a rich red-brown, fine-grained, sandy clay which, in turn, are under-laid by ferralithic clay. The soils of the Mount Selinda area are typically deep and fertile.|$|R
50|$|The {{best known}} American variety of {{bluestone}} is a <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone,</b> which {{is produced in}} hundreds of small quarries in adjacent areas of Pennsylvania and New York. It is also quarried in the Canadian Appalachians near Deer Lake in Western Newfoundland. The Pennsylvania Bluestone Association has 105 members, {{the vast majority of}} them quarriers. The other, lesser known, type of American bluestone is formed from a different sedimentary rock, limestone. The limestone is abundant in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia yet The Frazier Quarry is the only remaining quarry that cuts dimension stone from it.|$|E
50|$|The Diuri Formation is then overlain by the Setikhola Formation, {{which is}} {{characterized}} by <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone,</b> shale, graywacke, coal lenses and plant fossils. One sequence consists of interbedding of sandstone and shale and is intensely bioturbated with flames structures observed as well. This indicates a depositional environment of beach or mudflat. Also, another sequence of interbedding calcareous greywacke and carbonaceous shale is found. Ripples and cross-laminae can be observed on the greywacke, while small-scaled sun cracks and slump folds {{can be seen on}} shale. It is proposed that this sequence has a depositional environment of semi-isolated basin. The marine fossils contained here indicate a Permian age of the Setikhola Formation.|$|E
50|$|The Puente Formation is a deep-marine {{formation}} that {{is characterized}} by pro-delta sediments and an overlapping fan system. This unit lies above the Topanga Group giving it a Late Miocene depositional age and is divided into four members. The La Vida Member is a micaceous, platy siltstone with subordinate amounts of thin-bedded <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone.</b> The next member is the Soquel, which is a thick bedded to massive micaceous sandstone. Locally abundant siltstone, conglomerate, and intraformational breccia {{can also be seen}} in this member. Above the Soquel lies the Yorba Member. This member is a sandy siltstone that is interbedded with a fine-grained sandstone. The Sycamore Canyon Member contains lenses of conglomerate, conglomeratic sandstone, and sandstone. Sandy siltstone and fine-grained sandstones are interbedded with the aforementioned rock types.|$|E
50|$|The Ma Butte Formation is {{a unit of}} the Blairmore Group. It {{consists}} {{primarily of}} fine-grained sandstones interbedded with siltstones and mudstones. Some coarser grained sandstones and conglomerate beds are also present. Beds of bentonite and tuff increase upward toward the contact with the overlying Crowsnest Formation.

30|$|Stratigraphic {{descriptions}} of the Southern Chad Basin (Nigerian sector) are available in Carter et al. (1963), Okosun (2000) and Petters and Ekweozor (1982). Sediments are mainly continental, sparsely fossiliferous, poorly sorted, and medium to coarse-grained, <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstones</b> called the Bima Sandstone. A transitional calcareous deposit—Gongila Formation that accompanied the onset of marine incursions into the basin, overlies the Bima Sandstones. These are overlain unconformably by graptolitic Keri–Keri Shales while the Chad Formation overlies it to the Earth’s surface.|$|R

5000|$|On King Island now in Bass Strait, {{the oldest}} Tasmanian rocks are found. On {{the west side}} of King Island, there are basalts that have been metamorphosed by {{amphibolite}} grade metamorphism at [...] [...] Sedimentary rocks such as <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone</b> that have been altered to schist and quartzite. Derital zircons have been dated to 1350, 1444, 1600, 1768 and 1900 Ma. A dolerite sill was intruded. Granite intruded [...] in the Cryogenian. The granite contains inherited zircons from [...] The Wickham deformation affected the earlier rocks by heating to 470 to 480 °C at pressures below 300 MPa, and tight folding. This was followed later in the Neoproterozoic on {{the eastern side of the}} island with beds of diamictite, dolomite, mudstone, tholeiite, and picrite interleaved with conglomerate. Also dykes of augite syenite, picrite and 580 Ma tholeiite dolerite were intruded. An interpretation is that deposits occurred in a tidal area, with a continental rift allowing magma from the mantle to intrude. These newer Proterozoic sediments were then tilted and faulted.|$|E
50|$|During metamorphism, rocks {{which were}} {{originally}} sedimentary, igneous or metamorphic are converted into schists and gneisses. If {{the composition of}} the rocks was originally similar, they may be very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A quartz-porphyry, for example, and a fine grained <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone,</b> may both be converted into a grey or pink mica-schist. Usually, however, it is possible to distinguish between sedimentary and igneous schists and gneisses. If, for example, the whole district occupied by these rocks has traces of bedding, clastic structure, or unconformability, then it may be a sign that the original rock was sedimentary. In other cases intrusive junctions, chilled edges, contact alteration or porphyritic structure may prove that in its original condition a metamorphic gneiss was an igneous rock. The last appeal is often to the chemistry, for there are certain rock types which occur only as sediments, while others are found only among igneous masses, and however advanced the metamorphism may be, it rarely modifies the chemical composition of the mass very greatly. Such rocks as limestones, dolomites, quartzites and aluminous shales have very definite chemical characteristics which distinguish them even when completely recrystallized.|$|E
50|$|The peak was {{climbed in}} 2014 by an {{international}} team from the United Kingdom, Malawi and Lithuania, who measured it to be slightly higher than 2337 m Mafinga South, another peak on the watershed close by. A more accurate survey is needed to establish for certain {{which of the two}} peaks is higher. Both peaks are found on the Mafinga Ridge, an area composed of quartzites, phyllites, and <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstones</b> of sedimentary origin. The Luangwa River, one of Zambia's major river systems, rises in the Mafinga Hills on the western side of the ridge.|$|R
50|$|The Sleat Group, which {{outcrops}} on the Sleat peninsula on Skye, {{underlies the}} Torridon Group conformably, {{but the relationship}} with the Stoer Group is nowhere exposed. It is presumed to have been in deposited later that the Stoer Group, but possibly in a separate sub-basin. It is metamorphosed to greenschist facies and sits within the Kishorn Nappe, part of the Caledonian thrust belt, making its exact relationship to the other outcrops difficult to assess. The sequence consists of mainly coarse <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstones</b> deposited in a fluvial environment with some less common grey shales, probably deposited in a lacustrine environment.|$|R
30|$|The {{study area}} lies entirely within Pendjari or Oti mega-sequences which {{represent}} the middle lithostratigraphic unit, a sub-division of the Paleozoic Voltaian sedimentary formation. It is highly heterogeneous {{in terms of}} lithology and dominated by quartzites, shales, mudstones, siltstones, conglomerates, limestones, tillites, barite-bearing dolomitic carbonates and argillaceous and/or calcareous thin-bedded cherts known as silexites. This group overlies the Panabako formation of the Bombouaka mega-sequence or the Lower Voltaian sub-division (Leprun and Trompette 1969; Affaton et al. 1980; Wright et al. 1985; Hoffman 1999).

40|$|Depended on the {{analysis}} of ground snow situation, soil moisture loss speed and soil structure after planting crops of Mu Us Sandy Land remedied with <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone</b> in the fallow period, it is concluded that <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone</b> mixed with sand improved the sand stabilization in the governance of Mu Us Sandy Land in the fallow period. The sandy land remedied with <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone</b> had big snow coverage, 25 %- 75 % higher than normal sand; soil moisture losses slowed down, and moisture content rose by over 3 times; soil structure had been improved, and water stable aggregate content increased by 6. 52 %- 18. 04 %; survival rate of protection forest increased to 85 %; and ground flatness is less than 1 %. The above conditions weakened sand rising conditions of Mu Us Sandy Land in the fallow period and formed two protective layers of snow cover and soil frozen layer under cold weather so as to prevent against wind erosion...|$|E

5000|$|Lake Leopoldo {{is located}} in the strata of the Roraima Group rocks {{preserved}} in erosional remnants that rest on eroded Parguaza Granite. [...] Roraima sandstones in the Cuao table-mountains consist of a basal member characterized by graded sandstones with cross-bedding and ripples, wackes and thin discontinuous conglomerates; a middle member consisting of two strata of black and gray shales inter-bedded with quartzitic sandstones; and an upper member consisting of quartzitic sandstone with traces of carbonate, <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstones</b> and sandstones with abundant hematite. [...] The lake is likely the result of the collapse of sandstones in a process similar to the formation of the caves of Cerro Autana. The bottom of the lake is composed mostly of sand and small quantities of mud. Sand composition is largely quartz arenite and a small percentage of monomineralic components dominated by quartz and some accessory minerals (zircon, feldspar, hematite, and rutile). Of note is the high concentration of mercury in the sediment which is 2.3 higher than the expected concentration on these remote areas. In the absence of human activity around the lake {{and the fact that the}} closest gold mining operation is 250 km (155 miles) to the NE, possible sources of the high concentration of mercury include regional geologic sources through biochemical transformation of the soils, atmospheric transport from remote human sources, and burning of biomasses from the clearing of surrounding forests.|$|R

40|$|The Cygnet Coal Measures is {{a unit of}} {{carbonaceous}} shale, {{coal and}} <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstone</b> in Tasmania of Upper Permian age. It is overlain gradationally or disconformably by the Springs Sandstone, the lower member of which, Barnetts Sandstone, is a thinly-bedded, fine-grained feldspathic to arkosic sandstone, and the upper, the Mountain Lodge Sandstone and a more thickly-bedded, medium-grained protoquartzite. The {{upper part of the}} Springs Sandstone is probably Otoceratan. The Permo-Triassic boundary lies within these gradational non-marine units and cannot yet be fixed accurately.

40|$|The Pb isotopic {{composition}} of detrital K-feldspar grains can be rapidly measured using laser ablation MC-ICPMS. The feldspar Pb signal can survive weathering, transport and diagenesis, and careful targeting avoids problems with inclusions and alteration. As common Pb {{isotopic composition}}s show broad (100 s km scale) variation across the continents, the method provides a powerful provenance tracer for <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sandstones.</b> Here we combine a new Pb domain map for the circum-North Atlantic with detrital feldspar Pb isotopic data for Triassic and Jurassic sandstones from basins on the Irish Atlantic margin. The Pb compositions reveal otherwise cryptic feldspar populations that constrain the evolving drainage pattern. Triassic sandstones were sourced from distant Archean and Paleoproterozoic rocks, probably in Greenland, Labrador and Rockall Bank to the NW, implying long (> 500 km) transport across a nascent rift system. Later Jurassic sandstones had a composite Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic source in more proximal sources {{to the north}} (< 150 km away). Little or no feldspar was recycled from Triassic into Jurassic sandstones, and the change in provenance is consistent with distributed, low relief Triassic extension in a wide rift, followed by narrower Jurassic rifting with more localised fault-controlled sediment sources and sinks...|$|R
