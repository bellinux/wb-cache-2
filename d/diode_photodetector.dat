40|$|We {{describe}} an undergraduate laboratory that combines an accurate {{measurement of the}} speed of light, a fundamental investigation of a basic laser system, and a nontrivial use of statistical analysis. Students grapple with the existence of longitudinal modes in a laser cavity as they change the cavity length of an adjustable-cavity HeNe laser and tune the cavity to produce lasing in the TEM_ 00 mode. For appropriate laser cavity lengths, the laser gain curve of a HeNe laser allows simultaneous operation of multiple longitudinal modes. The difference frequency between the modes is measured using a self-heterodyne detection with a <b>diode</b> <b>photodetector</b> and a radio frequency spectrum analyzer. Asymmetric effects due to frequency pushing and frequency pulling, as well as transverse modes, are minimized by simultaneously monitoring and adjusting the mode structure as viewed with a Fabry-Perot interferometer. The frequency spacing of longitudinal modes is proportional to the inverse of the cavity length with a proportionality constant equal to half the speed of light. By changing the length of the cavity, without changing the path length within the HeNe gas, the speed of light in air can be measured to be (2. 9972 ± 0. 0002) × 10 ^ 8 m/s, which is to high enough precision to distinguish between the speed of light in air and that in a vacuum.

Strong {{change of the}} optical, mechanical and electrical properties of the semiconductors after irradiation by Nd:YAG laser are explained {{by the presence of}} Quantum Confinement Effect (QCE) in nanocones where radius is equal to or smaller than Bohr’ effective radius of electron, hole or exciton. “Blue shift” of photoluminescence spectra (Fig. 1) and “red shift” of phonon LO line in Raman spectrum are explained by exciton and phonon QCE in nanocones, correspondently. Asymmetry of the photoluminescence band in the spectrum of Si nanocones is explained by 1 D graded band gap structure. Experimental data on nanocones formation on a surface of Si, Ge and their solid solution and CdZnTe crystal and their optical properties are presented. Two-stage mechanism of nanocones’ formation on a surface of the semiconductors is proposed [1]. The first stage of the mechanism is characterized by the formation of a thin strained top layer, due to redistribution of point defects in temperature-gradient field induced by laser radiation.
