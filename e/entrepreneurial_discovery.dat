40|$|Although {{entrepreneurs}} {{of promising}} start-ups (Bhide, 2000) usually started their venture without novel ideas, deep experience, high credentials, or ample resources, the companies they eventually built represent {{the majority of}} fast-growing, privately held businesses (e. g. Inc. 500 companies) in the United States, which have significantly contributed to job creation {{and the growth of}} the economy. Instead of conducting extensive prior planning and research, promising start-ups depend on the lead entrepreneurs' capabilities of making good decisions as it goes. Meanwhile, the start-up process and the cognitive studies of entrepreneurial rationality have been increasingly recognized as holding the central place in entrepreneurship research. Despite their clear practical and theoretical importance, current literature does not provide a comprehensive framework of the start-up process of promising start-ups, which can explain the ongoing interactions between entrepreneurs and the market, and the role played by the entrepreneurs' rationality in this process. To pursue this objective, this dissertation proposes that <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery</b> is the process of promising start-ups' adaptation and learning, where entrepreneurs through their actions influence how the market will react and what they will learn from it, dynamically shaping the market process. It makes two major methodological improvements on existing research: 1) it uses lead entrepreneurs' close observation of the entirety of actual start-up process as data; 2) it borrows analytical methods from cognitive science to study <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery</b> as a knowledge-based problem solving process where entrepreneurs' knowledge base becomes the most critical factor in determining their behavioral outputs and influencing their sensory inputs. The results indicate that behavior for effective <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery</b> is compelled by multiple principles, whose applications converge to a common underlying pattern among promising start-ups. Besides breaking new ground in its methodology, this dissertation contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by being the first to explicate the many facets of the rationality of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery</b> as principles of behavior that can not only give the most complete and detailed explanation currently available of the unfolding of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery,</b> but serve as the basis to guide practicing entrepreneurs' behavior and to evaluate and improve entrepreneurship education and learning...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elaborate}} Kirzner’s concepts of entrepreneurial alertness and discovery in the subjectivist perspective. Specifically, it argues that the <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery</b> process is associated with the actor’s interpretation framework, or the stock of knowledge, which is derived from everyday life experiences. Discovery in this context means that the actor interprets incoming information in a way different from perceptions of the general public. Two kinds of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery,</b> namely ordinary and extraordinary, are discussed. In terms of mental constructs, ordinary discovery is a ’backward ’ interpretation in a sense that the entrepreneur endeavours to exploit profit opportunities by doing some things better. This type of discovery largely promotes change within an existing situation. Extraordinary discovery is a ’forward ’ interpretation that involves a new dimension of interpreting events. In this case, the entrepreneur explores profit opportunities by doing some things drastically different from the traditional. This type of discovery enhances revolutionary change to the economy. Inertia is explained, in the subjectivist perspective, as a result of actors taking knowledge for granted and being locked inside the old interpretation frameworks. The argument developed is applied to explain (1) why firms vertically integrate and, (2) why the socialist system impedes entrepreneurial alertness and discovery.

KEY WORDS: <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery,</b> opportunity, social entrepreneurship It is widely acknowledged that social entrepreneur-ship is an effective mechanism for generating value in societal, economic, and environmental forms (Anheier and Themudo, 2002; Gendron, 1996, p. 37; Kolk, 2003). In recent years, commerce has increasingly transcended boundaries around the world, lowering barriers and forming linkages among cultural values, history, politics, national policies, social capital, and economics (Murphy et al., 2006; Roper and Cheney, 2005). Thus, entrepreneurial ventures have increasingly emphasized social and environmental resources as a means to emerge and grow rather than limiting themselves to just eco-nomic resources in standard sectors of industry (Peredo and Chrisman, 2006). Enter the socially purposeful enterprise, which thrives in this dynamic context as a bona fide kind of entrepreneurial venture.

40|$|Abstract. Friedrich Hayek conjectured {{that the}} free {{enterprise}} system is the most effective in making discoveries, and Israel Kirzner refines the conjecture by saying that profit opportunities evoke <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery.</b> Demmert and Klein (2003) present the first attempt to demonstrate the Hayek/Kirzner conjecture. On the whole, Demmert and Klein (2003) classify the results as disappointing but fruitful. In contrast we argue that additional experimental evidence might yield a demonstration of the conjecture. We continued the diligence and good-faith effort started by Demmert and Klein (2003) to devise an experimental setting that would create a genuine context for <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discovery,</b> yet the conjecture eludes our efforts at controlling the experiment. We duplicated the experiment at a Business School in Germany, with two simple variations. First, Demmert and Klein (2003) recruited only male students. We include male and female students. Second, Demmert and Klein (2003) used a payment schedule that includes a flat rate for participation and additional earnings depending on the presented performance. We drop the flat rate and slightly reduce the earnings per unit outperformance. Our results show that overall money matters. Our results are rather like those of Demmert and Klein (2003) and {{do not seem to be}} influenced by a baseline payment. Moreover, there are gender specific divergences showing male students earning significant higher additional earnings than their female fellow students.

40|$|Opportunity {{recognition}} {{characterizes the}} development process from initial business idea, which derives from either discovery or social creation, to a viable business model. Previous research has investigated opportunity recognition largely in either cognitive-individualist or in social-constructionist dimensions with input-output approaches, leading to inconsistent results through differing assumptions. Therefore, this study aims at examining opportunity recognition as a process in the lens of Structuration Theory, enabling an interdisciplinary analysis between cognitive realms of agency and {{the social construction of}} opportunities. The study is designed as an abductive, multi-case study based on a proposed Structurationist Model of Opportunity Recognition (SMOR). The results show that <b>entrepreneurial</b> teams recognize <b>discoveries</b> in separate business and product development streams and socially created opportunities in interdisciplinary teams. <b>Entrepreneurial</b> teams recognizing <b>discoveries</b> are ineffective in reconciling product and business development to create product-market fits, but more effective in innovating. In contrast, entrepreneurial teams creating opportunities socially are ineffective in innovating, but effective in reconciling product and business development. Furthermore, the study finds that (i) prior knowledge supports the opportunity recognition process but only when the entrepreneurial team is aware of its knowledge-related assumptions, (ii) that the team members shall unify empathetic, hard-working, extroverted, and cooperative personalities, and (iii) that the engagement with the opportunity-related external environment, interdisciplinary collaborations, and in-depth projects foster the effectiveness of opportunity recognition process.

40|$|Regarding context {{conditions}} {{and the role of}} territories on competitiveness and innovation, clusters have become progressively a spreading phenomenon all around the world. Recently, the importance of clusters has been mixed with the concept of smart specialization, a territorial development model that seeks to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of economic systems with the aim of contributing to sustainable development. This new model has been strongly incorporated within the new Regional Policy logic defined by the European Commission for the period 2014 - 2020, {{in the shape of the}} upcoming Regional Smart Specialisation Strategies ?RIS 3. The aim of this article is to analyse the concept of both cluster and smart specialization form a twofold perspective: the economic development theoretical approach and the policy perspective. In other words, the implications of new RIS 3 strategies regarding clusters, and vice versa, as well as their role as policy instruments. To do so, the first chapter introduces briefly the traditional cluster approach, differentiating the development model behind it, as well as the cluster policy dimension that has led to the explosion of cluster initiatives around the world. The second chapter introduces the relationship between the clusters and the new smart specialization development model as two perspectives that mutually reinforce and share common elements that contribute one to another. The third chapter analyses deeply the potential involvement of cluster initiatives and cluster policies within the upcoming smart specialisation strategies that are being fostered by the European Commission for the new programming period 2014 - 2020. The fourth chapter analyses all these elements regarding clusters and smart specialisation into the Basque Country case, a region with a cluster policy since the 90 s and where a reflection must be done regarding the upcoming RIS 3. According to the results obtained Basque clusters seem to be drivers for higher productivity and exports, being interesting to consider them as catalysts for contributing to smart specialization principles higher degrees of specialization and open economy. In addition to these, they also could be the key for the third theme in a RIS 3 focused on specialised diversification through related variety exploitation and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>discoveries.</b> Finally, from the results from the Basque case, a fifth chapter adds a number of generalised recommendations about how to reformulate cluster policies regarding smart specialisation model and the likely role of cluster initiatives within the new governance system that regions probably develop under smart specialisation strategies...|$|R
