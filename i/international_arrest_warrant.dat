5000|$|The Polish {{government}} issued <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrants</b> for the murderers, {{in addition}} to offering a 1 million złoty (about $290,000 USD) reward for information {{that would lead to}} the arrest of the suspects. Warsaw also [...] "categorically demands from Pakistan's authorities the capture of the culprits of this crime and their punishment with the full severity this act demands", according to a statement released by the Polish Foreign Ministry. Poland requested help from the United States in their efforts to catch the killers.|$|R
5000|$|Mexican {{officials}} suggested Fujimori was not {{arrested in}} Mexico {{because there was}} no judicial order for his arrest. Chilean officials issued similar statements, reiterating that Chilean courts must process <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrants</b> to make them valid. Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo, after learning of the arrival of Fujimori in Chile, called for an [...] "urgent meeting" [...] in the governmental palace. Toledo called Chile's foreign minister, Ignacio Walker, and requested the detention of Fujimori. A few hours later, Fujimori was detained on an <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant</b> issued by a Chilean judge, who was told by Chile's Supreme Court to consider Lima's request for Fujimori's pre-trial detention, as part of the extradition process.|$|R
25|$|In its 10 April 1997 ruling {{regarding}} the Mykonos restaurant assassinations, the German court issued an <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant</b> for Iranian intelligence minister Hojjat al-Islam Ali Fallahian after {{declaring that the}} assassination had been ordered by him with knowledge of Khamenei and Rafsanjani. Iranian officials, however, have categorically denied their involvement. The then Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri dismissed the ruling as being political, untrue and unsubstantiated. The ruling led to a diplomatic crisis between the governments of Iran and several European countries, which lasted until November 1997. Darabi and Rhayel were finally released from prison on 10 December 2007 and deported back to their home countries.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 2005, Yushchenko {{announced}} that the journalist's suspected killers had been arrested.

Two of the alleged killers {{were said to be}} senior policemen working for the Interior Ministry's criminal investigations directorate (CID). Former Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko, one of those recorded with Leonid Kuchma in the Cassette Scandal, was also said to be under investigation. The two police colonels accused of the killing have been detained and a third senior policeman, identified as CID commander Oleksiy Pukach, was being sought on an <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, a German court {{issued an}} <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant</b> for former {{dictator}} Jorge Videla {{in connection with}} the death of 20-year-old Rolf Stawowiok in Argentina. He was a German citizen born in Argentina while his father was doing development work there. Rolf Stawowiok disappeared on 21 February 1978, after leaving the Argentine factory where he was working as a chemist. His father, Desiderius Stawowiok, said that Rolf was not active in the Argentine underground but was a sympathiser of the urban Montoneros guerrillas. They were largely destroyed under Videla. In earlier cases, France, Italy, and Spain had requested extradition of the Navy captain Alfredo Astiz for war crimes related to his work with ESMA, but were never successful.|$|E
50|$|Customs is an {{authority}} or agency {{in a country}} responsible for collecting tariffs and for controlling the flow of goods, including animals, transports, personal effects, and hazardous items, {{into and out of}} a country. The movement of people into and out of a country is normally monitored by immigration authorities, under a variety of names and arrangements. The immigration authorities normally check for appropriate documentation, verify that a person is entitled to enter the country, apprehend people wanted by domestic or <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrants,</b> and impede the entry of people deemed dangerous to the country. In many places, K9 units are also used.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{demand and}} supply {{reduction}} are important. [...] "the consuming countries {{need to get}} serious about curbing drug addiction. If there was less demand for heroin, the bottom really would fall out of the opium market." [...] Farmers economically dependent on opium must have viable alternatives that give sustainable income. On the supply side, identifying the most-wanted traffickers and subjecting them to <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrants</b> with extradition, asset seizure, and travel bans could help. While {{it is not easy to}} destroy opium storage and heroin production laboratories, it is far easier to destroy drugs at the source than in transit.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2006, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corra issued <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrants</b> for Velayati, {{six other}} Iranians and one Lebanese in {{connection}} with the bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) in Buenos Aires, which resulted in the death of 85 people and serious injuries to 151. Velayati has been on the official Wanted list of Interpol since March 2007, for allegations of [...] "Aggravated Murder and Damages" [...] related to the AMIA bombing. The <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant</b> is based on the allegation that senior Iranian officials planned the attack in an August 1993 meeting, including Khamanei, the Supreme Leader, Mohammad Hejazi, Khamanei's intelligence and security advisor, Rafsanjani, then president, Ali Fallahian, then intelligence minister, and Velayati, then foreign minister.|$|R
25|$|The {{next day}} the Czech {{authorities}} issued an <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant</b> for Dahlgren, who, as was later revealed, had already passed through the passport control at Vienna International Airport before his name appeared in the international database. Subsequently, at around 1PM the Austrian authorities alerted the crew of Austrian Airlines flight OS93 of the arrest warrant. The flight, carrying Dahlgren, had left Vienna at 10:46AM and was at time flying over the United Kingdom. After contemplating an emergency landing or a return to Vienna, the pilots {{decided it would be}} safer to continue the flight. The cabin crew were instructed to pretend not to know anything about the suspect on the flight. Immediately after landing at Washington Dulles International Airport, the plane was stormed by U.S Customs and Border Protection Officers, who arrested Dahlgren and turned him over to the FBI.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Pinochet, {{who still}} had much {{influence}} in Chile, travelled to the United Kingdom for medical treatment—allegations {{have been made}} that he was also there to negotiate arms contracts. While there, he was arrested on 17 October 1998 under an <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant</b> issued by judge Baltasar Garzón of Spain, and was placed under house arrest: initially in the clinic where he had just undergone back surgery, and later in a rented house. The charges included 94 counts of torture of Spanish citizens, the 1975 assassination of Spanish diplomat Carmelo Soria, and one count of conspiracy to commit torture—allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, including {{since the beginning of}} his rule, but never acted upon. Still struggling with the conditions set by the difficult transition to democracy, the Chilean government of the Concertación, then headed by President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, opposed his arrest, extradition to Spain, and trial.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the ongoing Darfur conflict in Sudan, the AU has deployed 7,000 peacekeepers, many from Rwanda and Nigeria, to Darfur. While a donor's conference in Addis Ababa in 2005 helped raise funds to sustain the peacekeepers through that year and into 2006, in July 2006 the AU said it would pull {{out at the end}} of September when its mandate expires. Critics of the AU peacekeepers, including Dr. Eric Reeves, have said these forces are largely ineffective due to lack of funds, personnel, and expertise. Monitoring an area roughly the size of France has made it even more difficult to sustain an effective mission. In June 2006, the United States Congress appropriated US$173million for the AU force. Some, such as the Genocide Intervention Network, have called for UN or NATO intervention to augment and/or replace the AU peacekeepers. The UN has considered deploying a force, though it would not likely enter the country until at least October 2007. The under-funded and badly equipped AU mission was set to expire on 31 December 2006 but was extended to 30 June 2007 and merged with the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur in October 2007. In July 2009 the African Union ceased cooperation with the International Criminal Court, refusing to recognise the <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant</b> it had issued against Sudan's leader, Omar al-Bashir, who was indicted in 2008 for war crimes.|$|E
50|$|On 13 April 2006, the Court of Cassation of the Central African Republic {{investigating}} charges or {{murder and}} rape committed by former President Ange-Felix Patasse and Congolese Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba {{said that they}} could not secure the arrest of the suspects despite <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrants,</b> and they requested the ICC to take responsibility. The allegations against Bemba date to when his Movement for the Liberation of Congo rebel army was invited by Patasse into the capital, Bangui, to fight rebels who were fighting against Patasse. Also referred to the court were the cases of a French policeman and two aides of Patasse who were all involved in the alleged crimes, which human rights groups allege had about 400 victims.|$|R
5000|$|The 2008 (first ever) public {{report of}} the Belgian Sûreté de l'État, {{published}} on line in January 2010, includes a section over the [...] "Belliraj Affair", fairly critical towards the Moroccan version: [...] "Only seven of the fourteen <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrants</b> issued by the Moroccan authorities could undergo examination, because the other persons enjoyed the Belgian citizenship {{at the time of}} the facts, thus making their extradition impossible. Among those detained, no one will finally be extradited, the elements given by Morocco have not been considered pertinent". The conclusion of this section is that [...] "The elements given by Morocco have not indiscutably demonstrated the existence of a network nor its implication in six murders in Belgium".|$|R
50|$|As an NGO {{working on}} a daily basis with the United Nations human rights {{protection}} mechanisms by submitting to these UN bodies detailed information on serious human rights violations committed by States in the region, Alkarama has often been the victim of defamation campaigns, whilst several members of its staff have been targeted - in their own capacity and not necessarily because of their relation with Alkarama - such as Executive Director, Mourad Dhina and Legal Director, Rachid Mesli, both victims of <b>international</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>warrants</b> issued by the Algerian government; as well as founding member and former Chairman of the Foundation’s Council, Abdulrahman Al Naimi, listed by the U.S. Treasury as an “Al Qaeda financier” although the charges were never substantiated.|$|R
