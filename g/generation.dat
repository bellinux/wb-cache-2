40|$|Large {{amount of}} such {{renewable}} energy <b>generations</b> as wind/photovoltaic <b>generations</b> {{directly connected to}} grid acting as distributed <b>generations</b> will cause control, protection, security, and safety problems. Microgrid, which has advantages in usage and control of distributed <b>generations,</b> is a promising approach to coordinate the conflict between distributed <b>generations</b> and the grid. Regarded as mobile power storages, batteries of electric vehicles can depress the fluctuation of power through the {{point of common coupling}} of microgrid. This paper presents a control strategy for microgrid containing renewable energy <b>generations</b> and electric vehicles. The control strategy uses current control for renewable energy <b>generations</b> under parallel-to-grid mode, and uses master-slave control under islanding mode. Simulations and laboratory experiments prove that the control strategy works well for microgrid containing renewable energy <b>generations</b> and electric vehicles and provides maximum power output of renewable energy and a stable and sustainable running under islanding mode...|$|R

The previous knitting technique admits only TT <b>generations</b> among se-quential or concurrent processes and PP <b>generations</b> among sequential or exclusive proc-esses. The synthesized nets, however, are restricted because some <b>generations</b> are prohib-ited.

40|$|Despite the oft-heard {{claims that}} current <b>generations</b> are {{stealing}} from future <b>generations</b> by running fiscal deficits, both theory and evidence {{suggest that this}} is either not true or not knowable. Intergenerational justice is not an appropriate lens through which to analyze fiscal issues, {{because there is no}} obvious starting point from which to build a moral consensus about whether current <b>generations</b> owe anything at all to future <b>generations</b> - and even if we do believe that we owe something to future <b>generations,</b> no one has offered a useful method by which we can determine whether we are doing enough for our progeny. Moreover, if we believe that future <b>generations</b> should be made better off than current <b>generations</b> (2 ̆ 2 I want my kids to be richer than I am. 2 ̆ 2), even pessimistic forecasts indicate that future <b>generations</b> will be much wealthier than current <b>generations,</b> meaning that we are already being quite generous to our children and grandchildren. In addition, the recent significant decline in our economic prospects does not argue for a more contractionary fiscal policy in light of concerns about future <b>generations.</b> In fact, when times are bad, there is no conflict between the interests of current and future <b>generations.</b> Spending by the government helps to improve the economy, which encourages businesses to invest in future productivity. This virtuous cycle is even stronger if the government 2 ̆ 7 s spending is itself used to invest in future productivity...|$|R
