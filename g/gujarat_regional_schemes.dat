40|$|Based on {{previous}} <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> model studies and assumptions, we extend studies from two-level voting scheme models to multi-level voting scheme models. Due to mathematical complexity, {{we use the}} Monte Carlo approach in studying {{the stability of the}} multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> with respect to region sizes and levels. Using this model, we are able to obtain the stability characteristics of the national voting <b>scheme,</b> the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme,</b> and the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme,</b> and apply it in FERET human face database. According to our study, we verify again that the <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> (including the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> and multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme)</b> is always more stable than the national voting scheme. We find that the stability of the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> is not as good as the stability of the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> when region size is within a certain range. Out of this range, the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> may compete with the two-level voting scheme. We conclude that the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> may be comparable to the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> and prove our conclusion in the face recognition application.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{phenomenon}} of creating interstate <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>schemes</b> around the world (regionalism) has achieved high visibility and importance in world politics. The new wave of regionalism, new regionalism, which was initiated {{near the beginning of}} the 1990 s has much increased the importance of this phenomenon hence attracting significant research and academic interest. Moreover, most regions in the so-called developing world have attracted much global attention through their good economic performance and / or their increasing importance to world order and politics. Within most of these regions, neighboring states have initiated <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> (e. g. ASEAN, Mercosur, SADC, COMESA etc) which’s importance has risen along the general importance of regionalism as a worldwide phenomenon. This PhD focused on the comparative analysis of three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> in the developing world, namely the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Southeast Asia, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Mercado Comun del Sur (Mercosur) in South America. The main argument lays on the position that in order for a <b>regional</b> integration <b>scheme</b> to be created in the developing world, the presence of a regional hegemon is needed. The methodology used is that of the comparative analysis of the three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> under focus after a set of hypotheses / conditions has been created. This requires for an in-depth analysis of relevant theories on regionalism and interstate cooperation which in this case resulted in the adoption of an international relations’ theoretical approach as the main analytical tool to be used. The Hegemonic Stability Theory was selected and used for setting three conditions / hypotheses for testing and comparing the three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> under focus. The main conclusion reached is that the theoretical model used, namely the Regional Hegemonic Stability Theory, can be used as the main interpretive tool of the creation of <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> in the developing world, but it seems that recent developments in Mercosur, ASEAN and SADC require a wider use of theories to be soundly explained. The existence of a hegemonic state in the different parts of the developing world has {{played a crucial role in}} the creation and development of <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> but as the world becomes more and more interdependent their impact seems to decrease. ...|$|R
