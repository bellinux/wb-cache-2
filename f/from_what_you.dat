In 2011, she appeared nude in The Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine. Of the experience, she said, [...] "I'm an athlete—that's all I am. If a sex symbol is now a top female athlete, I think that's pretty amazing and it shows how far our country has come from the stick-thin models, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see in most magazines." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{historian}} Nio Joe Lan, Allah jang Palsoe {{was the first}} stage drama in Malay by a Chinese writer. The six-act work was written in vernacular Malay, the lingua franca of the Indies, and was based on E. Phillips Oppenheim's short story [...] "The False Gods". Though in his foreword Kwee Tek Hoay apologised {{for the quality of}} the stage play, writing that [...] "the content and arrangement of this book are far <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> could call neat", Sumardjo praises his language, feeling that the story flowed well.|$|E
500|$|The Persona {{series has}} been {{referred}} to as the most popular spin-off from the Megami Tensei franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right. Io9's James Whitbrook commented that while [...] "here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane [...] "normal" [...] life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.". Nintendo Power, in an article concerning the Megami Tensei series, cited the Persona series' [...] "modern-day horror stories" [...] and [...] "teams of Japanese high-school kids" [...] as the perfect example of the franchise. Persona was mentioned in 1999 by GameSpot's Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying [...] "Examining Persona reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology". The game has been named as a cult classic. Persona 3 was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed Persona 3 and 4 in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list. Persona 3 was listed by Gamasutra as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre. Persona 4 was also listed by Famitsu {{as one of the greatest}} games of all time in a 2010 list.|$|E

It's a grand, shallow, decadent entertainment, which like all good Hollywood gangster movies delivers the punch and counterpunch of glamour and disgust". Jay Scott writes in his review for the Globe and Mail, [...] "For a while, Al Pacino is hypnotic as Montana. But the effort expended on the flawless Cuban accent and the attempts to flesh out a character cut from inch-thick cardboard are hopeless." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Gary Arnold wrote, [...] "A movie that appeared intent on revealing an alarmingly contemporary criminal subculture gradually reverts to underworld cliche, covering its derivative tracks with outrageous decor and an apocalyptic, production number finale, ingeniously choreographed to leave the antihero floating face down in a literal bloodbath." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{parallel}} between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus {{was not lost}} on the early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued: [...] "when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." [...] (1 Apol. 21). There is, however, no belief in a general resurrection in ancient Greek religion, as the Greeks held that not even the gods were able to recreate flesh that had been lost to decay, fire or consumption. The notion of a general resurrection of the dead was therefore apparently quite preposterous to the Greeks. This is made clear in Paul's Areopagus discourse. After having first told about the resurrection of Jesus, which makes the Athenians interested to hear more, Paul goes on, relating how this event relates to a general resurrection of the dead: ...|$|E

Patriarch Amfilohije of Montenegro also blamed Wurst's victory for the floods. Irish television presenter for the BBC and former Eurovision BBC commentator Terry Wogan described that year's performance as a [...] "freak show". Reacting to these critics, Wurst stated [...] "It's so ridiculous! For me a perfect world would be when we don't {{have to talk about}} sexuality, where you're <b>from,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> believe. Is this the worst thing {{in the mind of the}} politicians?" [...] She stated her desire to perform in Russia for the country's LGBT community, [...] "To tell them that they are not alone. The whole community around the world is standing behind them. They have to trust that if they open their mouth, then we can change something." [...] To a reporter from The Observer, she commented: [...] "It's funny that these people think I'm so powerful. I've figured out over the years, you can only hurt me if I love you; if I don't know you, I really don't care. There are people who want to kill me and I'm always like, 'Well, get in line, darling.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Montagu's Turkish {{letters were}} to prove an {{inspiration}} to later generations of European women travellers and writers. In particular, Montagu staked a claim {{to the authority of}} women's writing, due to their ability to access private homes and female-only spaces where men were not permitted. The title of her published letters refers to [...] "Sources that Have Been Inaccessible to Other Travellers". The letters themselves frequently draw {{attention to the fact that}} they present a different (and, Montagu asserts, more accurate) description than that provided by previous (male) travellers: [...] "You will perhaps be surpriz'd at an Account so different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have been entertaind with by the common Voyage-writers who are very fond of speaking of what they don't know.". Montagu provides an intimate description of the women's bathhouse in Sofia, in which she derides male descriptions of the bathhouse as a site for unnatural sexual practices, instead insisting that it was [...] "the Women’s coffee house, where all the news of the Town is told, Scandal invented, etc". However, Montagu's detailed descriptions of nude Oriental beauties provided inspiration for male artists such as Ingres, who restored the explicitly erotic content that Montagu had denied. In general, Montagu dismisses the quality of European travel literature of the 18th century as nothing more than [...] "trite observations…superficial… boys [...] only remember where they met with the best wine or the prettyest women.".|$|E
