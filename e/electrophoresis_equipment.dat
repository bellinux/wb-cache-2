5000|$|Multiple loci VNTR {{analysis}} (MLVA) is {{a method}} employed for the genetic analysis of particular microorganisms, such as pathogenic bacteria, that {{takes advantage of the}} polymorphism of tandemly repeated DNA sequences. A [...] "VNTR" [...] is a [...] "variable-number tandem repeat". This method is well known in forensic science since it is the basis of DNA fingerprinting in humans. When applied to bacteria, it contributes to forensic microbiology through which the source of a particular strain might eventually be traced back, making it a useful technique for outbreak surveillance. In a typical MLVA, a number of well-selected and characterised (in terms of mutation rate and diversity) loci are amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), so that the size of each locus can be measured, usually by electrophoresis of the amplification products together with reference DNA fragments (a so-called DNA size marker). Different <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment</b> can be used depending on the required size estimate accuracy, and the local laboratory set-up, from basic agarose gel electrophoresis up to the more sophisticated and high-throughput capillary electrophoresis devices. From this size estimate, the number of repeat units at each locus can be deduced. The resulting information is a code which can be easily compared to reference databases once the assay has been harmonised and standardised. MLVA has become a major first line typing tool in a number of pathogens where such an harmonisation could be achieved, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus anthracis, Brucella.|$|E
5000|$|Detection of {{amplification}} product can {{be determined}} via photometry for turbidity caused by an increasing quantity of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate in solution as a byproduct of amplification. This allows easy visualization by the naked eye, especially for larger reaction volumes, or via simple detection approaches for smaller volumes. The reaction can be followed in real-time either by measuring the turbidity or by fluorescence using intercalating dyes such as SYTO 9. [...] Dyes such as SYBR green, {{can be used to}} create a visible color change that can be seen with the naked eye without the need for expensive equipment, or a response that can more accurately be measured by instrumentation. Dye molecules intercalate or directly label the DNA, and in turn can be correlated to the number of copies initially present. Hence, LAMP can also be quantitative. In-tube detection of DNA amplification is possible using manganese loaded calcein which starts fluorescing upon complexation of manganese by pyrophosphate during in vitro DNA synthesis.Moreover, visual detection of the LAMP amplicons by the unaided eye was based on their ability to hybridize with the complementary gold-bound ss-DNA and thus prevent the normal red to purple-blue color change that would otherwise occur by salt-induced aggregation of the gold particles. So, a LAMP method combined with amplicon detection by AuNP has advantages over previously other methods in terms of reduced assay time, amplicon confirmation by hybridization and use of simpler equipment (i.e., no need for a thermocycler, <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment</b> or a UV trans-illuminator.|$|E

Previous results about the kinetics of the reaction suggest that only a small amount of MEC should be formed after the ingredients of a drink are mixed.

The separation was performed using a DB- 17 -coated capillary. The influence of instrumental parameters such as field strength and temperature was evaluated.

40|$|Viscosity {{characterization}} of protein formulations {{is of utmost}} importance {{for the development of}} subcutaneously administered formulations. However, viscosity determinations are time-consuming and require large sample volumes in the range of hundreds of microliters to a few milliliters, depending on the method used. In this article, an automated, high-throughput method is described to determine dynamic viscosity of Newtonian fluids using standard capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> (CE) <b>equipment.</b> CE is an analytical method routinely used for the separation and {{characterization of}} proteins. In our set-up, the capillary is filled with the test sample, and a constant pressure is applied. A small aliquot of riboflavin is subsequently loaded into the capillary and used as a dye to monitor movement of protein samples. Migration time of the riboflavin peak moving through the filled capillary is converted to the viscosity by applying the Hagen-Poiseuille's law. The instrument is operated without using an electrical field. Repeatability, robustness, linearity, and reproducibility were demonstrated for different capillary lots and instruments, as well as for different capillary lengths and diameters. Accuracy was verified by comparing the viscosity data obtained by CE instrumentation with those obtained by plate/cone rheometry. The suitability of the method for protein formulations was demonstrated, and limitations were discussed. Typical viscosities in the range of 5 - 40 mPas were reliably measured with this method. Advantages of the CE instrumentation-based method included short measurement times (1 - 15 min), small sample volumes (few microliters) for a capillary with a diameter of 50 mum and a length of 20. 5 cm as well as potential to be suitable for high-throughput measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{proportion}} of counterfeit medicines is dramatically increasing {{these last few}} years. According to numerous official sources, in some pharmaceutical wholesalers in African countries, the proportion has reached 80 %. Unfortunately, this situation is far to be improved {{due to lack of}} suitable analytical equipment allowing rapid actions of the Regulatory Agencies based on scientific consideration, at affordable cost and all over the drug supply chain. For that purpose, a network group considered that mater by building a low-cost original capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> (CE) <b>equipment</b> equipped with a new deep UV detector based on LED technology. The generic conditions for analysis were investigated: capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) performed at acidic pH for basic drug molecules (i. e., quinine, highly used as the last antimalarial rampart), basic pH for compounds such as furosemide (a common diuretic drug) and at neutral pH for a well known antibiotic combination, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol. To evaluate the ability of the CE equipment for quantification, a full validation and a method comparison study were carried out for the CZE method dedicated to quinine determination. The validation involved the use of accuracy profile and total error concept to monitor the adequacy of the results obtained by the new prototype. The method comparison was based on the Bland and Altman approach by comparing results obtained by the low-cost CE and a conventional set-up. Subsequent validation studies were realized with neutral and acidic drug molecules, each focusing on a single concentration level calibration curve in order to maintain as low as possible the expenses due to reagents and thus the cost of analysis, as important advantages of CE for drug quality control.

A second aim of the exercise was to study reproducibility of mtDNA sequencing of hairs between laboratories using differing chemistries, further to the first mtDNA reproducibility study carried out by the EDNAP group. Laboratories were asked to type 2 sections from each of 10 hairs, such that each hair was typed by at least two laboratories. Ten laboratories participated in the study, and a total of 55 hairs were typed. The results showed that the C/T point heteroplasmy observed in blood and buccal cells at position 16234 segregated differentially between hairs, such that some hairs showed only C, others only T and the remainder, C/T heteroplasmy at varying ratios. Additionally, differential segregation of heteroplasmic variants was confirmed in independent extracts at positions 16093 and the poly(C) tract at 302 - 309, whilst a complete A-G transition was confirmed at position 16129 in one hair. Heteroplasmy was observed at position 16195 on both strands of a single extract from one hair segment, but was not observed in the extracts from any other segment of the same hair.

This method uses the Corvaris g-tube for DNA fragmentation, {{eliminating the need for}} a HydroShear apparatus, and a Sage Science BluePippin electrophoresis platform to size select the 8 kb fragments, eliminating the need for agarose gel electrophoresis and sample recovery using a Whatman Elutrap device. These two modifications allow the protocol to be completed in significantly less time (eliminate an overnight step) and require significantly less capital investment in laboratory equipment. This modified library preparation protocol has yielded paired end libraries meeting all the quality control benchmarks the original protocol stipulates and has been combined with sequencing on a GS Junior instrument to generate excellent sequencing results. The equipment substitutions presented allow paired end library preparation to be practical for smaller research groups. ### Introduction In large-scale sequencing centers it is commonplace to have a range of DNA sequencing platforms (e. g. 454, Illumina, SOLiD, and PacBio) and also specialized devices for shearing of DNA molecules common in the preparation of paired-end libraries. With the introduction of laboratory-scale devices like the GS Jr and MiSeq there is a shift occurring where DNA sequencing technology is becoming directly accessible within small labs. The ability to perform whole genome sequencing and assembly within a lab is now reasonable to consider for Bacteria using the GS Jr. A crucial type of data for scaffolding of genome assemblies is paired-end data. By generating information from sequencing reads linked across some known or estimated spanning distance, bioinformatic techniques are capable of ordering and orienting contigs produced from shotgun sequencing. In terms of the GS Jr platform the system is inherently capable of sequencing paired-end libraries but there is a challenge for laboratory-scale use as the conventional protocol for library production includes shearing of DNA molecules using a Hydroshear. As a specialized device the Hydroshear represents a significant investment for a laboratory-scale setting and may present a barrier to the use of paired-end sequencing in lab settings. This protocol describes {{an alternative approach}} to performing Roche’s Paired End Rapid Library Preparation Method for 8 kb span libraries. This method uses the Corvaris g-tube for DNA fragmentation, eliminating the need for a HydroShear apparatus, and a Sage Science BluePippin electrophoresis platform to size select the 8 kb fragments, eliminating the need for agarose gel electrophoresis and sample recovery using a Whatman Elutrap device. These two modifications allow the protocol to be completed in significantly less time (by eliminating an overnight step) and simplify sheared fragment purification. This modified library preparation protocol yielded paired-end libraries meeting all the quality control benchmarks of the original protocol and has been combined with shotgun sequencing on a GS Junior to generate excellent assemblies for a range of Bacteria. The equipment substitutions and associated savings in time provide a practical protocol for laboratory-scale paired-end sequencing on the GS Jr. ### Materials Reagents unique to modified protocol: 1.

Instead, use Covaris g-tubes. - Save a few µL of original genomic DNA to visualize on an agarose gel later. - Add the 150 µL genomic DNA prep to a g-tube. Follow instructions with tubes – Spin in an Eppendorf MiniSpin plus microcentrifuge at 8, 600 rpm for 1 min, flip tube over, repeat spin, remove sample from tube. - Keep 2 µL of the sheared sample to run on an agarose gel later. Section 3. 2 – Fragment End Repair - For 25 °C steps throughout protocol, set waterbath to maintain this temperature. Room temperature does not always work. - Disregard step 3 (don’t need this agarose gel). - Step 4 m – use the arm on the Labquake to keep the tube from flipping completely over when doing this gentle mixing (just rock the tube back and forth). Section 3. 3 – Circularization Adaptor Ligation - Step 1 – change the 2 x rapid ligase buffer for 10 x rapid ligase buffer (New England Biolabs product) and only add 10 µL (reduces mixture to 100 µL from 190 µL). - Stop at the end of Step 4 and disregard Steps 5 - 11. Instead, take the entire sample and load onto a BluePippin cassette. Save a few µL of the sample pre-loading to run on an agarose gel later. - To load the sample, bring the sample volume to 120 µL with Tris-HCl pH 8. 0 and add 40 µL BluePippin loading dye. Follow cassette instructions to prepare Blue Pippin cassette and load 4 lanes of a cassette by adding 40 µL of sample into each lane. Load the 5 th lane with BluePippin marker. - Run the BluePippin with the range selection from 5, 000 - 11, 000 bp. - When finished, remove the size-selected DNA from the elution well into a microfuge tube and rise the elution chamber with 40 µL 0. 1 % Tween 20 solution (supplied with BluePippin), adding this to the tube with the sample. - Concentrate and wash the size-selected sample by loading all the BluePippin eluted DNA into an Amicon filter column (0. 5 mL, 10 K) and spinning for 10 min at 14, 000 x g. Discard flow-thru and add 250 µL Tris-HCl to the column. Spin for 15 min at 14, 000 x g. Invert column in a clean collection tube and spin for 2 min at 1, 000 x g. - Save a few µL of concentrated sample to run on an agarose gel later. - Run an agarose gel of the original genomic DNA (unsheared), g-tube sheared DNA, sample before BluePipping and sample after BluePippin. - Continue to next section Section 3. 5 – Fill-In Reaction - At Step 3, quantify with Life Technologies’s Qubit BR dsDNA quantification kit. You need to achieve at least 6 ng/µL to continue. Section 3. 6 – Circularization - No changes to protocol Section 3. 7 – Nebulizer Assembly (3. 7. 1) and DNA Nebulization and Collection/Purification of the Fragmented DNA (3. 7. 2) - No changes to protocol Section 3. 8 – Fragment End Repair - No changes to protocol Section 3. 9 – Immobilization Bead Preparation - For Step 1 – prepare 2 x Library Binding Buffer by mixing 5 mL Molecular Biology Grade Water, 4 mL of 5 M NaCl and 1 mL of 10 x TE. Section 3. 10 – Adaptor Ligation - For Step 4 – incubate at 25 °C for 1 hour in a thermocycler. Section 3. 11 – Library Immobilization - No changes to protocol Section 3. 12 – Library Amplification - Prepare the PCR mixture as indicated for the sample and a second mixture to run without sample as a negative control. Save a few µL of the sample PCR after amplification and the negative PCR sample to run on the BioAnalyzer chip at the end. Section 3. 13 – Sizing Mix Preparation - No changes to protocol Section 3. 14 – Final Library Size Selection - No changes to protocol Section 3. 15 – Library Quality Assessment - Step 1 – use BioAnalyzer chip and run the PCR sample and negative control from Section 3. 12, as well as the final sample. Also, quantify final sample using Life Technologies’s Qubit ssDNA quantification kit. ### Timing Sections 3. 1 to 3. 5 can be performed in a day (including the BluePippin run). A good spot to pause overnight is either right after the BluePippin run (end of Section 3. 4) or after the fill-in reaction and quantification (end of Section 3. 5). Sections 3. 5 or 3. 6 to the end of Section 3. 11 is a good second day of work. Finishing Section 3. 12 to 3. 15 on the third morning allows for plenty of time to continue on with sequencing emPCR later in that day. ### Troublshooting Things that we have noted: 1. The AMPure size selection at the end (Section 3. 13 and 3. 14) can be variable, depending on the AMPure lot and day you do it. - We have considered running the BluePippin cassette selecting for the tighter ~ 500 bp range (instead of the larger range in the protocol) to standardize the paired end fragment size and make this selection more precise. However, if the genomic DNA shearing wasn’t precisely around the 8 kb mark, keeping the larger size window gives more DNA to work with and appears to work just fine. ### Anticipated Results Figure 1 shows typical results of shearing with the Covaris g-tubes and the purification of appropriately sized fragments using the Blue Pippin.

40|$|A {{continuous}} free-flow electrophoresis {{study was}} conducted during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Mission to investigate and evaluate the increase in sample flow rate and sample resolution achievable in space. The <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment</b> was designed for the separation of four mixtures of biological cells with variable sample flow rates, buffer flow rates, and electric field gradients. Separation quality was assessed by measuring the light from a quartz lamp through the electrophoresis channel and onto a photodiode system. The data evaluation indicates that all monitored systems operated correctly during the experiment. The optical system produced a light that was too bright to discern true cell distributions, but final analysis of scientific data by computer processing shows the expected distribution of separated cells...|$|E

Ground-based laboratory values of electrophoretic mobilities of a mixture of human and rabbit aldehyde-fixed red blood cells (RBC) were compared with those recorded at 11 minute intervals on the Shuttle STS- 3.

40|$|Genetic {{sequencing}} {{and many}} genetic tests and assays require electrophoretic separation of DNA. In this technique, DNA fragments {{are separated by}} size as they migrate through a sieving gel {{under the influence of}} an applied electric field. In order to conduct these analyses on-orbit, it is essential to acquire the capability to efficiently perform electrophoresis in a microgravity environment. Conventional bench top <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment</b> is large and cumbersome and does not lead itself to on-orbit utilization. Much of the previous research regarding on-orbit electrophoresis involved altering conventional <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment</b> for bioprocessing, purification, and/or separation technology applications. A new and more efficient approach to on-orbit electrophoresis is the use of a microfabricated electrophoresis platform. These platforms are much smaller, less expensive to produce and operate, use less power, require smaller sample sizes (nanoliters), and achieve separation in a much shorter distance (a few centimeters instead of 10 s or 100 s of centimeters.) In contrast to previous applications, this platform would be utilized as an analytical tool for life science/medical research, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnoses. Identification of infectious agents as well as radiation related damage are significant to NASA s efforts to maintain, study, and monitor crew health during and in support of near-Earth and interplanetary missions. The capability to perform genetic assays on-orbit is imperative to conduct relevant and insightful biological and medical research, as well as continuing NASA s search for life elsewhere. This technology would provide an essential analytical tool for research conducted in a microgravity environment (Shuttle, ISS, long duration/interplanetary missions.) In addition, this technology could serve as a critical and invaluable component of a biosentinel system to monitor space environment genotoxic insults to include radiation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two-dimensional {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis (2 -D PAGE) analysis remains the core of proteomic technology because it is currently the most powerful method to analyze large collections of proteins. Advances in <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment</b> are making this technique more accessible but effective computer assisted protein spot detection remains a very labor-intensive endeavor. Protein spot analysis is still time consuming, requires human intervention and {{is in need of}} further development. This study explores a technique of recursively applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in identifying protein. An SVM is a powerful learner capable of optimizing differences between classes. In this context the different classes correspond to the presence/absence of a protein. Different experiments are conducted to assess these differences in class formation {{in the context of a}} normal image and a highly saturated image...|$|E
40|$|Static zone {{electrophoresis}} is an electrokinetic {{method of}} separating macromolecules and small particles. However, its application for {{the isolation of}} biological cells and concentrated protein solutions is limited by sedimentation and convection. Microgravity eliminates or reduces sedimentation, floatation, and density-driven convection arising from either Joule heating or concentration differences. The advantages of such an environment were first demonstrated in space during the Apollo 14 and 16 missions. In 1975 the Electrophoresis Technology Experiment (MA- 011) was conducted during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight. In 1979 a project was initiated to repeat the separations of human kidney cells. One of the major objectives of the <b>Electrophoresis</b> <b>Equipment</b> Verification Tests (EEVT) on STS- 3 was to repeat and thereby validate the first successful electrophoretic separation of human kidney cells.

40|$|Development and {{refinement}} of methods to analyse differential gene expression has been essential in {{the progress of}} molecular biology. A novel approach called iGentifier is presented for profiling known and unknown transcriptomes, thus bypassing a major limitation in microarray analysis. The iGentifier technology combines elements of fragment display (e. g. Differential Display or RMDD) and tag sequencing (e. g. SAGE, MPSS) and allows for analysis of samples in high throughput using current capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment.</b> Application to epidermal tissue of wild-type and mlo 5 barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants, infected with powdery mildew [Blumeria graminis (DC.) E. O. Speer f. sp. hordei], led to the identification of several 100 genes induced or repressed upon infection with many well known for their response to fungal pathogens or other stressors. Ten of these genes are suggested to be classified as marker genes for durable resistance mediated by the mlo 5 resistance gene...|$|E
40|$|Many {{investigations}} of the replication and pathogenesis of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) employ chronically infected cell lines, cell lines stabilized from primary adult T-cell leukemia cells, and noninfected T-cell lines. The validity of data obtained from such studies depends on the unambiguous identification of each cell line, which can be performed by short-tandem-repeat (STR) profiling (DNA fingerprinting). While kit-based profiling represents the standard method for cell line authentication, not all labs have ready access to the required capillary <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{and the costs of}} such tests can become substantial, especially if the cell lines are to be tested frequently. We analyzed DNA from a panel of HTLV- 1 -infected cell lines and noninfected T-cell lines using a commercial STR kit and then analyzed the same DNA for individual STR markers followed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This simplified method should facilitate routine confirmation of cell line identity in diverse laboratory settings...|$|E

Disks were prepared (10 mm × 2 mm) with the modified glass ionomer cements Vitremer (3 M) and Fuji II LC (GC Co.), and immersed in three fluoride-containing solutions: Fluordent Reach (Johnson & Johnson), Fluorgard (Colgate-Palmolive) and Oral B (Gillette do Brasil Ltda). Translucence was measured with <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>equipment</b> (JOUAN) after different immersion times. The results obtained were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey's test, and a statistically significant decrease was observed in the translucence of the materials after immersion in the fluoride-containing solutions. Fuji II LC demonstrated the lowest alteration in translucence, independently of the solution employed. Fluorgard was the fluoride-containing mouthrinse that promoted the highest alteration. It can be concluded that the fluoride-containing mouthrinses influenced the translucence of the resin-modified glass ionomer cements...|$|E
