5|$|Following the Plitvice Lakes {{incident}} of 1 April 1991, SAO Krajina forces captured three Croatian policemen from nearby Drniš, {{with the intention}} of exchanging them for Croatian Serb troops taken prisoner by the Croatian forces at the Plitvice Lakes. In turn, the militia established by the residents of Kijevo captured several Serb civilians and demanded that the captured policemen be released <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> prisoners. On 2 April, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes that threatened to escalate. Kijevo became strategically significant because its location hindered SAO Krajina road communications.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{thought the}} land grants given to {{expanding}} railroads was an unjust practice. He also opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations, {{as well as}} the power sought by workers' unions. Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> positions, were forced to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions.|$|E

5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing the agents to flee.

5|$|Labor {{was always}} in short supply. The most common {{solution}} was indentured servitude of young whites. These were teenagers in Britain or Germany whose parents arranged for them to work for families in the colonies until age 21, <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> ocean passage. The great majority became farmers or farm wives. By the mid-eighteenth century, African American slaves comprised 12% {{of the population of}} New York. Most were house servants in Manhattan, or farmworkers on Dutch estates.|$|E

The government of Soviet Georgia created an autonomous administrative unit for Transcaucasian Ossetians in April 1922, called the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast. Historians such as Stephen F. Jones, Emil Souleimanov and Arsène Saparov {{believe that the}} Bolsheviks granted this autonomy to the Ossetians <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> help in fighting the Democratic Republic of Georgia, since this area {{had never been a}} separate entity prior to the Russian invasion.|$|E

50|$|The {{restoration}} of the planet Rann was not Dox's only reason for relocating it into the Vega system.

Secondly, <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> restoring <b>their</b> planet, the people of Rann agreed to let Dox rebuild L.E.G.I.O.N. headquarters on Rann.|$|R
5|$|The matchup of No.21 Indiana and No.22 Virginia Tech was {{the first}} matchup of ranked teams in Independence Bowl history.

5|$|There {{were several}} {{bilateral}} Minority Treaties, each signed between {{one of the}} countries in question and the League. The treaties were signed between the League and some of the newly established nations: Poland, Yugoslavia (also known then as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes), Czechoslovakia. Similar treaties were also imposed on Greece and Entente-allied Romania <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> territorial enlargement, and on some of the nations defeated in the First World War (Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey). At the same time, Albania, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and, outside of Europe, Iraq were persuaded to accept minority obligations as part of the terms of their admission to the League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and {{a sharp decline in}} living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> bailout of the nation's broken economy.|$|E
50|$|The series {{told the}} story of a team of four (later five) former criminals, all of whom {{incidentally}} had super powers.

50|$|To {{prove to}} his son that money can buy loyalty, he offers Jack a {{reporting}} job with his newspaper <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> shutting <b>their</b> newspaper down, which is what Jack wanted all along. When he accepts, Eric is upset because he thinks Jack is selling out. Jack tells Eric that most men need jobs, just as his priority is to support himself and his wife.|$|R
5|$|Vytautas then {{sought a}} {{military}} {{alliance with the}} Knights, sending captive knight Marquard von Salzbach to negotiate. On January 19, 1390 in Lyck Vytautas signed the Treaty of Lyck affirming the terms of an earlier agreement, the Treaty of Königsberg, signed in 1384 during his first conflict with Jogaila. Under the terms of this treaty, the Knights were promised Samogitia, up to the Nevėžis River, <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> military assistance. Having been earlier betrayed, the Knights asked for hostages as a guarantee of Vytautas' loyalty: his brothers Sigismund and Tautvilas, his wife Anna, his daughter Sophia, his sister Rymgajla, his favorite Ivan Olshanski, {{and a number of}} other nobles.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} La Familia Michoacana, Moreno González {{was in charge}} of forging alliances with other cartels. Reportedly, Moreno González met with several other {{high-ranking}} drug lords, including Fernando Sánchez Arellano of the Tijuana Cartel; Juan José Esparragoza Moreno of the Sinaloa Cartel; and Ezequiel Cárdenas Guillén of the Gulf Cartel. In these agreements, the cartels allowed La Familia Michoacana to move drugs freely in their territories <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> support in fighting off rival gangs like Los Zetas. In 2008, Moreno González agreed to send armed men to help Joaquín Guzmán Loera and Ismael Zambada García fight off rival cartels, a favor which granted him access to the drug corridors in Sinaloa and Sonora. In addition, his friendship with the Gulf Cartel leader Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez allowed him access to the northeastern state of Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip {{engaged in a}} flurry of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, son of the Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.|$|E
50|$|Stefan Hemmerle in 1995 {{designed}} a ring for {{the wife of}} a Munich art collector, in response to her practice of wearing Berlin iron jewellery (which Germans received <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> donating <b>their</b> gold and silver jewels toward funding the War of Liberation). He set a diamond in textured iron rather than in gold or platinum. The combination of common metal with a precious stone was unusual.|$|R

500|$|Likewise, {{therapeutic}} treatment of non-criminals {{with mental health}} problems can be considered in terms of throffers. In community psychiatry, patients with mental health problems will sometimes be presented with the provision of social services, such as financial or housing aid, <b>in</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> changing <b>their</b> lifestyle and reporting for the administration of medicines. Psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez considers these throffers a form of social engineering, and worries that they ...|$|R
