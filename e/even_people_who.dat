5|$|Albert Payson Terhune was an {{established}} newspaperman {{and author of}} several books in various genresincluding histories and thrillerswhen he penned his first canine short story, His Mate. Ray Long, then editor for Red Book Magazine, had jokingly suggested he write a story about Lad one afternoon, when the reticent dog put his head on Long's knee after having snubbed the familiar visitor for the last year. Having already tried to market the idea of his writing dog stories to magazines for several years, Terhune readily agreed. The first story featured three rough collies, Lad, Lady, and Knave, and used a similar formula to his previous works: an average male (Lad) protects a beautiful female (Lady) from a larger villain (Knave). Long purchased the work for Red Book for $200 and it was published in the January 1916 issue. Four magazines requested similar stories, and Terhune complied, finding them easy to write and sell. Additional stories, all featuring Lad and titled Lad Stories, were published in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal, Hartford Courant, and the Atlantic Monthly, though Red Book remained his most consistent publisher. By 1918, the stories had grown in popularity and Terhune was paid an average of $1000 each for the tales, with some selling for as much as $2,500,. Though marketed as fiction, <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were acquainted with the Terhunes and Lad reportedly believed that the stories were real.|$|E

The plots have the Monster pursuing his own, evil agenda, unafraid of the weaker humans. <b>Even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> try to help or reason with him are just as likely to be killed by the inhuman fiend.|$|E
500|$|Elite Forces {{attention}} to immersing the player within the Star Trek universe was praised {{as one of}} the stronger points of the game; GamePro suggested that <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were not fans of the franchise [...] "will marvel at the amount of detail in the ships and characters", further praising the game's [...] "faithful" [...] recreation of key sets of the USS Voyager in the TV series. Many reviewers were positive towards the game's story, GameSpy suggesting that the plot [...] "really draws you in", while IGN praised the story as one in stark contrast to many of the poorly produced storylines used in the TV series. However, many reviewers felt that the game's single-player campaign was too short, while others felt the game's closing levels were disappointing.|$|E

After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans {{revealed}} a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read: [...] "Rest in peace Speedo." [...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was {{a man on a}} mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I'm thankful I got the goal... the crowd started singing – it gave me goose pimples... not one person has a bad word to say about him, he was a gentleman... <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> haven't met him know how much of a nice man he was... it still hasn't hit home, it still feels surreal." ...|$|E

500|$|Kagame {{declared}} {{victory in}} the election on 26 August, after partial results showed he had an almost insurmountable lead, and his win was later confirmed by the National Electoral Commission. The final results showed that Kagame received [...] of the vote, Twagiramungu , and Nayinzira the voter turnout was [...] The campaign, election day, and aftermath were largely peaceful, although an observer from the European Union (EU) raised concerns that opposition supporters may have been intimidated by the RPF. Twagiramungu rejected {{the result of the}} election and also questioned the margin of victory, saying [...] "Almost 100 per cent? That's not possible". Twagiramungu filed a petition at the Supreme Court to nullify the result, but was unsuccessful. The EU observer also questioned the result, citing [...] "numerous irregularities", but praised the election overall, describing it as a [...] "positive step". Kagame himself, in an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, acknowledged that the opposition had been weak, but he believed the result was genuine. He told Kinzer [...] "they wanted security first of all. <b>Even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> didn't know the RPF program in detail saw us as the party that would guarantee that". Kagame was sworn in on 12 September to begin his seven-year term.|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{chose the}} most {{complicated}} scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song ("The Mustard") [...] "to {{get it out of}} the way" [...] for more personal numbers later in the episode. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considers this [...] "brilliant because it frees <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre's conventions". The musical styles span from a jaunty 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya's hard-rock version of [...] "Bunnies". Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang in such a way to him on the set. Spike's [...] "Rest in Peace" [...] is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode's first song, Tara's [...] "Under Your Spell", a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya's duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from Ira Gershwin, a Charleston rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles' [...] "Standing" [...] is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles' distance from her. Buffy's not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, [...] "You can sing to someone in musicals and they can never know how you feel or how much you love them, even if they're standing right in front of you".|$|E
2500|$|Cultural {{activities}} are another major objective. Tetsuo Tanaka, director of JAXA's Space Environment and Utilization Center, says [...] "There {{is something about}} space that touches <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{are not interested in}} science." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yet Wilson {{underscored the}} value of hearing {{viewpoints}} from the sculpture's opponents: [...] "Having dialogue, having the discussion happen, having people {{tell me what they}} thought was really a good thing."

To this end, T-shirts and posters were printed and distributed around Australia at a variety of venues and events, including the Tropfest Film Festival.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his initial}} meeting with President Bush {{regarding}} the surge, Keane said {{he made a}} phone call to Newt Gingrich to ask his advice prior to the meeting. As Keane said in 2014, Gingrich gave me some good advice. He said, [...] "Look, Jack. Most people go in the Oval Office, <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table." [...] He said, [...] "Don’t leave anything on the table." [...] He said, [...] "You’re going to get about 15 minutes at best and put it all out there. And when you walk out of that room, feel good that you got it all out there." [...] So that was sound advice, and I did put it all out there.|$|E
2500|$|After the shooting, some Democrats {{sought to}} tighten federal gun control regulations, [...] "laying blame on {{a culture that}} allows <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are not {{permitted}} to board airplanes to buy guns with ease," [...] while some Republicans criticized what they believe to be [...] "the Obama administration's unwillingness {{to come to terms with}} the true threat posed by Muslim extremists." [...] Members of the California State Legislature also proposed to revisit some gun-control proposals that had previously stalled, with one assemblyman proposing a prohibition of the sale of guns to those on the federal No Fly List. On January 8, 2016, Representative Pete Aguilar of Redlands spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives and called for gun control. After the shooting, gun sales in California increased by more than 18,000, following an overall down year for statewide sales. Applications for concealed carry permits also rose 750 percent in San Bernardino County.|$|E

2500|$|Gibson {{was raised}} a Sedevacantist traditionalist Catholic. When {{asked about the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} of Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus, Gibson replied, [...] "There is no salvation for those outside the Church ... I believe it. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's... Episcopalian, Church of England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement from the chair. I go with it." [...] When he was asked whether [...] is an intolerant position, he said that [...] "through the merits of Jesus' sacrifice... <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> don't know Jesus are able to be saved, but through him." [...] Acquaintance Father William Fulco has said that Gibson denies neither the Pope nor Vatican II. Gibson told Diane Sawyer that he believes non-Catholics and non-Christians can go to Heaven.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the end of}} 2009 {{when the}} {{government}} began soliciting expert opinion for the Animal Protection Act, the focus of public debate has always been on whether one should be eating cats or not, or whether cat-eating is a Chinese tradition or not. There are <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would {{go as far as}} to say that the call to stop eating cat meat is [...] "imposing the will of the minority on the majority". Yet the [...] "majority" [...] does not understand the complete truth of cat-meat trading chains: cat theft, cat trafficking, killing cats, selling cats, and eating cats, all the various stages of the trade and how they are distributed across the country, in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Rugao, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Hebei. This well-organized, smooth-running industry chain of cat abuse, cat killing and skinning has already existed among ordinary Chinese folks for 20 years, or perhaps even longer.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, the book, The Amazing Colossal Episode Guide (written by some MST3K cast members), was released, which {{contained}} a synopsis for every episode from seasons one through six, and even included some behind-the-scenes stories as well. In it, Kevin Murphy related two tales about celebrity reactions he encountered. In one, the cast {{went to a}} taping of Dennis Miller's eponymous show; when they were brought backstage to meet Miller, the comedian proceeded to criticize the MST3K cast for their choice of movie to mock in the then-recent episode [...] "Space Travelers" [...] (a re-branded version of the Oscar-winning film Marooned). Murphy also discussed how he met Kurt Vonnegut, one of his literary heroes. When he had mentioned the show and its premise to Vonnegut, the author suggested that <b>even</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> work hard on bad films deserve some respect. Murphy then invited Vonnegut to dine with his group, which Vonnegut declined, claiming that he had other plans. When Murphy and friends ate later that night, he saw Vonnegut dining alone in the same restaurant, and remarked {{that he had been}} [...] "faced...but nicely faced" [...] by one of his literary heroes.|$|E
