25|$|The EMS {{system in}} New Zealand {{is served by}} three {{dispatch}} centres, located in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. The <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> in Christchurch provides coverage to the entire South Island, and is operated by St. John Ambulance. The <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> in Auckland provides coverage for the north half of North Island, and is also operated by St. John Ambulance. The <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> in Wellington provides coverage for the southern half of the North Island, is jointly operated by Wellington Free Ambulance and St John Ambulance but is staffed by Wellington Free Ambulance personnel. All three dispatch centres collaborate, and are capable of handling overflow of call volume for one another. The call centre technology is fully integrated and seamless, providing a single, 'virtual' national <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre.</b> To illustrate, if an emergency has occurred in Christchurch but those 111 lines are all busy, the call will be forwarded to the dispatch centres in either Auckland or Wellington. The call will be answered, information gathered, and placed into the computer network. It will then appear as a pending call on the desk of the appropriate dispatcher in Christchurch, all seamlessly.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the first}} known {{examples}} of call triage occurring in the <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> occurred in 1975, when the Phoenix, Arizona Fire Department assigned some of its paramedics to their <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> in order to interview callers and prioritize calls. [...] The following year, Dr. Jeff Clawson, a physician employed by the Salt Lake City Fire Department as its Medical Director, developed a series of key questions, pre-arrival instructions, and dispatch priorities {{to be used in}} the processing of EMS calls. [...] These ultimately evolved into the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS), APCO (EMD) and PowerPhone's Total Response Computer aided call handling (CACH) system. [...] Such systems were initially technologically quite primitive; in the mid-1970s the use of computers in dispatching was extremely uncommon, and those that used them were dealing with very large mainframe computers. Most such systems were based on either reference cards or simple flip charts, and have been described by lay people on more than one occasion as being like a [...] "recipe file" [...] for ambulance dispatchers. [...] The development of pre-arrival instructions presented an entirely new challenge for those involved in emergency medical dispatch; it might take eight or more minutes for paramedics to arrive at the patient's side, but dispatchers could be there in seconds. [...] Physicians began to see a dramatic new potential for the saving of lives by means of simple scripted telephone instructions from the dispatcher, and the concept of Dispatch Life Support was born. [...] Suddenly dispatchers were providing complex information and instructions to callers, and even providing guidance on performing procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by telephone. The concept became an area of medical research, and even EMS Medical Directors debated on the best approach to such services.|$|E
2500|$|In large EMS systems, EMDs {{may follow}} a {{progressive}} career path. [...] Actual dispatching {{may lead to}} training positions, {{and from there to}} supervisory or even managerial positions within the <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre.</b> [...] EMDs may move from smaller systems to larger systems, just as paramedics sometimes do, in search of advancement opportunities, or economic improvements. [...] In some cases, EMDs may choose to retrain and move to fire dispatch (EFD), to police dispatch (EPD), or to the 9-1-1 call centre. [...] The inequities in the sheer amount of training required for certification make advancement of EMDs to paramedic status an extremely infrequent event. [...] The required additional training, depending on the jurisdiction, might take two years or more, part-time, in addition to regular full-time employment, putting this option beyond the reach of all but the most determined. Typically, EMDs who are also certified paramedics tend to have been paramedics first.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of EMDs will perform their work in an EMS <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre.</b> [...] Occasionally this may involve some 'site work', such as on-site dispatching for large special events, but this is somewhat rare. [...] EMS dispatching may be a single, independent process, {{or it may be}} a mixed function with {{one or more of the}} other emergency services. [...] In some smaller jurisdictions, the EMS, fire and police dispatch functions, and even the 9-1-1 system may be physically co-located, but with different specialist staff performing each function. Such decisions are frequently made based on the sizes of the services involved, and their call volumes. [...] While some jurisdictions are required, generally through economics or size, to provide a single public safety dispatch system, the three emergency services have requirements and procedures that are sufficiently different that wherever possible, independent dispatching is preferred. Even in truly large, mixed (fire and EMS) services, such as the New York City Fire Department, the functions and requirements are seen as sufficiently different that an independent dispatch function is maintained for each. [...] The emergency services in question all have their own priorities, and while they are extremely important to each, those priorities often simply conflict too greatly to allow reasonable joint dispatch functions. To illustrate, in a scenario with a single dispatcher for both fire and EMS: the truck officer on a fire apparatus is requesting additional resources for a working fire with a possibility of trapped people, and two paramedics are attempting to resuscitate a dying child, but require medical direction, which request gets priority? [...] Another important consideration is workload; in many jurisdictions the call volume of the EMS system is 5-6 times as great as that of the Fire Department. [...] Asking fire service dispatchers to also dispatch EMS resources, or vice versa, may exceed the capabilities of the dispatchers. [...] Even when joint dispatching is pursued by a community, the various types of dispatch functions to support EMS, fire and police are so different that the dispatchers involved will require separate training and certification in each.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{measure the}} {{performance}} of selected Italian emergency medical system (EMS) <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres</b> managing calls for patients suffering from stroke. Data on outcome and on early treatment in the ED were collected. Methods: Prospective data collection for a trimester from interventions for a suspected stroke in 13 EMS <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres</b> over five Italian regions. Results: Altogether, 1041 calls for a suspected stroke were analysed. Mean intervals of the sequential phases were 2. 3 ¡ 2 minutes between call and ambulance dispatch, 8. 4 ¡ 5. 5 minutes to reach the patient, 14. 5 ¡ 8. 5 minutes on the scene, and 40. 2 ¡ 16. 2 minutes between call and arrival at the ED. Interventions were performed in 56 % of cases by a basic life support (BLS) crew, advanced life support (ALS) crews intervened in 28 % of cases, and a combination of ALS and BLS in the remaining 16 %. Mean diagnostic interval was 99 ¡ 85 minutes between emergency system call and the first CT scan. This was performed 71 ¡ 27 minutes after ED admission. Only 1. 6 % were admitted to a stroke unit. One month outcome according to GCS was good recovery in 32 %, moderate disability in 28 %, severe disability in 14 %, and death in 25 % of the patients.

40|$|Considering the {{relation}} between system frequency and power equilibrium, the technical characteristics of primary and secondary power reserve {{and the fact that}} traditional schemes regarding ancillary services are not directly transferable to wind power, a new concept is developed addressing how wind power could provide power reserve, both positive and negative, in a stable and reliable way. The main challenge is to overcome the natural fluctuating characteristic of wind power through a process which provides the structure and the needed data flow allowing wind energy to contribute with both, positive and negative power reserve, within a reliable framework regarding power availability and stability, as happens nowadays with conventional generation. This paper presents a methodology [5] which makes use of the advantages of centralized and decentralized control systems, providing a two layers architecture (TSOs and <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres)</b> as well as giving the <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres</b> t heir own autonomy based on their own monitored and calculated data.
