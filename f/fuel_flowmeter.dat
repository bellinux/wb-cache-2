40|$|The high {{accuracy}} <b>fuel</b> <b>flowmeter</b> development program is described. A flightworthy meter that measures mass flowrate of aircraft fuels to within + or - 0. 25 % of reading over a 50 : 1 range of flow is developed. A study of measurement techniques {{to achieve this}} goal yielded three candidates: (1) a dual turbine flowmeter with density and viscosity compensation; (2) an angular momentum flowmeter with a motor-driven, spring-restrained turbine and viscosity shroud; and (3) a vortex precission flowmeter with density and viscosity compensation. An experimental study of each technique was completed and the first two candidates were selected for prototype development...|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} is derived for the real-time calibration {{of the engine}} <b>fuel</b> <b>flowmeter</b> and the engine mixture ratio during Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) ground testing. Because currently used calibration methods are post-test operations, there exists no fail-safe way of predicting at what mixture ratio a planned test will run. It is proposed that the algorithm developed here be used {{as part of an}} Automated Engine Calibration System (AECS) which could ensure that nearly all SSME tests are run at the proper mixture ratio. In this way, AECS has the potential of increasing the efficiency of the SSME ground test program. In addition to the derivation of the algorithm, an overview of this calibration system is presented along with the list of test stand facility instrumentation necessary for AECS implementation...|$|E
40|$|Anomalous {{behavior}} {{manifested in}} the apparent SSME <b>fuel</b> <b>flowmeter</b> constant which relates the rotor speed to the engine flowrate {{has been shown to}} be the result of wakes of the upstream hexagonal web flow straightener periodically stalling the rotor blades, thereby changing the lift on the blades and the rotation speed of the rotor. Moreover, an unsteady, two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model of the flowmeter has shown this wake-induced stall disappearing as the straightener-rotor distance is doubled, in accord with the existing SSME flowmeter database for the previous "egg crate" flowmeter. These observations have led to a new flowmeter design which has been shown in three-dimensional CFD computations (consistent with both the previous two-dimensional analyses and with existing correlations for airfoil stall) to be much less susceptible to stalling instabilities...|$|E
40|$|A {{facility}} for the precise calibration of mass <b>fuel</b> <b>flowmeters</b> and turbine flowmeters located at AMETEK Aerospace Products Inc., Wilmington, Massachusetts is described. This facility {{is referred to}} as the Test and Calibration System (TACS). It is believed to be the most accurate test facility available for the calibration of jet engine fuel density measurement. The product of the volumetric flow rate measurement and the density measurement, results in a true mass flow rate determination. A dual-turbine flowmeter was designed during this program. The dual-turbine flowmeter was calibrated on the TACS to show the characteristics of this type of flowmeter. An angular momentum flowmeter was also calibrated on the TACS to demonstrate the accuracy of a true mass flowmeter having a 'state-of-the-art' design accuracy...|$|R
50|$|The {{propellant}} {{feed system}} consists of separate fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (the bearings {{of which were}} lubricated by the fluid being pumped because the extremely low operating temperature of the engine precluded use of lubricants or other fluids), several valves (including the main fuel valve, main oxidizer valve, propellant utilization valve and fuel and oxidizer bleed valves), <b>fuel</b> and oxidizer <b>flowmeters,</b> and interconnecting lines.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fuel</b> and {{oxidizer}} <b>flowmeters</b> were helical-vaned, rotor-type flowmeters. They {{were located}} in the fuel and oxidizer high-pressure ducts. The flowmeters measured propellant flowrates in the high-pressure propellant ducts. The four-vane rotor in the hydrogen system produced four electrical impulses per revolution and turned approximately 3,700 rpm at nominal flow. The six-vane rotor in the LOX system produced six electrical impulses per revolution and turned at approximately 2,600 rpm at nominal flow.|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) <b>Fuel</b> <b>Flowmeter</b> {{is located}} in the duct between the low and high {{pressure}} fuel turbopumps. In the flowmeter the rotation rate of a 4 -blade rotor positioned downstream of two flow straighteners is employed to measure the engine fuel flow rate and thereby control the engine mixture ratio via the engine controller. Hence, inaccurate operation of the flowmeter could have serious consequences for SSME engine operation and performance, forcing, for example, tanking of extra fuel to allow for inaccurate flowmeter measurement. Since the current flight flowmeter configuration was incorporated into the SSME in the early eighties, some anomalies in flowmeter behavior have been observed. The initial flowmeter incorporated an "egg crate" design for the two flow straighteners which turn the duct flow to make it more uniform and parallel after it has come out of the 90 degree bend just upstream of the flowmeter...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a part of}} the analysis carried in support of the SSME (Space Shuttle Main Engine) <b>Fuel</b> <b>Flowmeter</b> redesign, addressing an intensely researched phenomenon known as "shifting" of the flowmeter constant value. It consists of a sudden change in the flowmeter indication, which occurs simultaneously with the onset of an oscillatory variation of the rotor speed. The change in the flowmeter indications does not correspond to a real change in the volumetric flow through the device. Several causes have been investigated in detail, in the past, without conclusive evidence towards a cause of this phenomenon. The present analysis addresses the flow physics through the flowmeter by assembling results from 3 -D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) calculations, airfoil C(sub D) /C(sub L) performance curves and mass moment of inertia characteristics of the rotor into a synergistic calculation which simulates the unsteady regime of the flowmeter operation. The results show that the 4 -bladed rotor interacts with the periodic flow pattern created behind the flow straightener upstream in a manner that generates a steady, periodic fluctuation in the rotor's speed. The amplitude of this fluctuation is significantly smaller than the 0. 5 % of mean speed threshold which constitutes a flight operational limit. When manufacturing errors occur, however, the fluctuations are amplified and can generate a significant apparent change in the flowmeter indication. Two types of possible fabrication errors-which can occur even for parts fabricated within the accepted tolerances for the blade airfoil-are presented, together with their effect on the flowmeter operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} {{the process of}} redesigning a new rotor for the SSME <b>Fuel</b> <b>Flowmeter.</b> The new design addresses the specific requirement of a lower rotor speed which would allow the SSME operation at 1 15 % rated power level without reaching a blade excitation by the wakes behind the hexagonal flow straightener upstream at frequencies close to the blade natural frequency. A series of calculations combining fleet flowmeters test data, airfoil fluid dynamics and CFD simulations of flow patterns behind the flowmeter's hexagonal straightener {{has led to a}} blade twist design alpha = alpha (radius) targeting a kf constant of 0. 8256. The kf constant relates the fuel volume flow to the flowmeter rotor speed, for this particular value 17685 GPM at 3650 RPM. Based on this angle distribution, two actual blade designs were developed. A first design using the same blade airfoil as the original design targeted the new kf value only. A second design using a variable blade chord length and airfoil relative thickness targeted simultaneously the new kf value and an optimum blade design destined to provide smooth and stable operation and {{a significant increase in the}} blade natural frequency associated with the first bending mode, such that a comfortable margin could be obtained at 115 % RPL. The second design is a result of a concurrent engineering process, during which several iterations were made in order to achieve a targeted blade natural frequency associated with the first bending mode of 1300 Hz. Water flow tests preliminary results indicate a kf value of 0. 8179 for the f-irst design, which is within 1 % of the target value. The second design rotor shows a natural frequency associated with the first bending mode of 1308 Hz, and a water-flow calibration constant of kf 0. 8169...|$|E
40|$|The Machinery and Engine Technology (MET) Program of the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC) has {{established}} a program {{for the evaluation of}} sensors to measure gas turbine engine performance accurately. The precise measurement of fuel flow {{is an essential part of}} steady-state gas turbine performance assessment. Prompted by an international engine testing and information exchange program, and a mandate to improve all aspects of gas turbine performance evaluation, the MET Laboratory has critically examined two types of <b>fuel</b> <b>flowmeters,</b> Coriolis and turbine. The two flowmeter types are different in that the Coriolis flowmeter measures mass flow directly, while the turbine flowmeter measures volumetric flow, which must be converted to mass flow for conventional performance analysis. The direct measurement of mass flow, using a Coriolis flowmeter, has many advantages in field testing of gas turbines, because it reduces the risk of errors resulting from the conversion process. Turbine flowmeters, on the other hand, have been regarded as an industry standard because they are compact, rugged, reliable, and relatively inexpensive. This paper describes the project objectives, the experimental installation, and the results of the comparison of the Coriolis and turbine type flowmeters in steady-state performance testing. Discussed are variations between the two types of <b>flowmeters</b> due to <b>fuel</b> characteristics, fuel handling equipment, acoustic and vibration interference and installation effects. Also included in this paper are estimations of measurement uncertainties for both types of flowmeters. Results indicate that the agreement between Coriolis and turbine type flowmeters is good over the entire steady-state operating range of a typical gas turbine engine. In some cases the repeatability of the Coriolis flowmeter is better than the manufacturers specification. Even a significant variation in fuel density (10...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{related to}} {{aircraft}} <b>fuel</b> mass - <b>flowmeters</b> was reviewed {{to determine what}} flowmeter types could provide 0. 25 %-of-point accuracy over a 50 to one range in flowrates. Three types were selected and were further analyzed to determine what problem areas prevented them from meeting the high accuracy requirement, and what the further development needs were for each. A dual-turbine volumetric flowmeter with densi-viscometer and microprocessor compensation was selected for its relative simplicity and fast response time. An angular momentum type with a motor-driven, spring-restrained turbine and viscosity shroud was selected for its direct mass-flow output. This concept also employed a turbine for fast response and a microcomputer for accurate viscosity compensation. The third concept employed a vortex precession volumetric flowmeter and was selected for its unobtrusive design. Like the turbine flowmeter, it uses a densi-viscometer and microprocessor for density correction and accurate viscosity compensation...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) uses a turbine <b>fuel</b> <b>flowmeter</b> (FFM) in its Low Pressure Fuel Duct (LPFD) {{to measure}} liquid {{hydrogen}} flowrates during engine operation. The flowmeter {{is required to}} provide accurate and robust measurements of flow rates ranging from 10000 to 18000 GPM in an environment contaminated by duct vibration and duct internal acoustic disturbances. Errors exceeding 0. 5 % can {{have a significant impact}} on engine operation and mission completion. The accuracy of each sensor is monitored during hot-fire engine tests on the ground. Flow meters which do not meet requirements are not flown. Among other parameters, the device is screened for a specific behavior in which a small shift in the flow rate reading is registered during a period in which the actual fuel flow as measured by a facility meter does not change. Such behavior has been observed over the years for specific builds of the FFM and must be avoided or limited in magnitude in flight. Various analyses of the recorded data have been made prior to this report in an effort to understand the cause of the phenomenon; however, no conclusive cause for the shift in the instrument behavior has been found. The present report proposes an explanation of the phenomenon based on interactions between acoustic pressure disturbances in the duct and the wakes produced by the FFM flow straightener. Physical insight into the effects of acoustic plane wave disturbances was obtained using a simple analytical model. Based on that model, a series of three-dimensional unsteady viscous flow computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed using the MSFC PHANTOM turbomachinery code. The code was customized to allow the FFM rotor speed to change at every time step according to the instantaneous fluid forces on the rotor, that, in turn, are affected by acoustic plane pressure waves propagating through the device. The results of the simulations show the variation in the rotation rate of the flowmeter due to the interaction of the flow straightener wakes and the upstream propagating acoustic waves. A detailed analysis of the acoustic disturbance effects is presented along with an assessment of the impact on measurement accuracy...|$|E
