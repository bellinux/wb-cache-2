40|$|The {{effects of}} solar heating {{at a variety}} of solar zenith angles (o) on the vapor depositional growth of cloud drops, and hence the {{potential}} for collection enhancement, is investigated. A large eddy simulation (LES) model is used to predict the evolution of marine stratocumulus clouds subject to changes in o. During the course of each simulation, LES output is stored for 600 parcel trajectories and is used to drive an offline microphysical model that includes the influence of radiation on drop growth. Smaller o, such as when the sun is overhead, provide strong solar heating, which tends to confine circulations to the cloud layer and leads to long in-cloud residence times for cloud drops. At larger o, when solar heating is weak, circulations are stronger and penetrate through the depth of the boundary layer, which causes much shorter in-cloud residence times for cloud drops. Simulations show that this leads to a more rapid collection process in strongly, as compared to weakly solar-heated clouds provided that the liquid water contents of each cloud are similar. When drop vapor growth includes radiative effects, three main results emerge: 1) Solar heating at smaller o (0 ° to 45 °) dominates over longwave cooling effects causing a suppression of collection for lower <b>drop</b> <b>concentrations</b> (100 to 200 cm 3). 2) At larger <b>drop</b> <b>concentrations</b> (300 cm 3) longwave cooling dominates over solar heating and collection is enhanced. 3) At large o (60 ° to 90 °), solar heating is ineffective at modifying the drop size spectrum thus allowing longwave cooling to significantly enhance collection at all <b>drop</b> <b>concentrations</b> above approximately 100 cm 3. 1...|$|R

The new parameterization {{is intended to be}} used in large scale models in order to obtain regional and global estimates of the effect of nitric acid on cloud <b>drop</b> <b>concentrations</b> and the radiative balance. The parameterization is based on numerical air parcel model simulations and can be applied for unimodal and bimodal lognormal aerosol particle size distributions in a large variety of different conditions. In addition to the aerosol particle distribution and gas-phase HNO 3 concentration, the parameterization requires temperature, total pressure, updraft velocity, and the number concentration of cloud droplets formed at zero nitric acid concentration, as input parameters. The parameterization is also suitable for describing the effect of hydrochloric acid on the cloud <b>drop</b> <b>concentrations,</b> and in practice, the HNO 3 and HCl concentrations can be summed up to yield the total effect.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the cloud drop size distribution near cloud base are initially determined by the aerosol particles that serve as CCN and by the local updraft velocity. Chemical reactions of the emitted gaseous sulfur compounds due to human activities will alter, through gas-to-particle conversion, the aerosol size distribution, total number, and its chemical composition. Recently, Boucher and Rodhe and Jones et. al have each developed parameterizations relating cloud <b>drop</b> <b>concentration</b> to sulfate mass or aerosol number concentration, respectively, and used them to develop estimates of the indirect forcing by anthropogenic sulfate aerosols. THese parameterizations made use of measure relationships in continental and maritime clouds. However, these relationships are inherently noisy, yielding more than a factor of 2 variation in cloud <b>drop</b> <b>concentration</b> for a given aerosol number (or for a given sulfate mass) concentration. The large spatial and temporal variabilities in the concentration, chemical characteristics, and size distribution of aerosols have {{made it difficult to}} develop such a parameterization from data. In this paper, our focus is to develop a means for relating the predicted anthropogenic sulfate mass to cloud drop number concentration over the range of expected conditions associated with continental and marine aerosol. We start with an assumed pre-existing particle size distribution and develop an approximation of the altered distribution after addition of anthropogenic sulfate. We thereby develop a conservative estimate of the possible change in cloud drop number concentration due to anthropogenic sulfate...|$|E

40|$|Most cloud {{radiation}} {{models and}} conventional data processing techniques {{assume that the}} mean number of drops of a given radius is proportional to volume. The analysis of microphysical data on liquid water drop sizes shows that, for sufficiently small volumes, this proportionality breaks down; the number of cloud drops of a given radius is instead proportional to the volume raised to a drop size-dependent nonunit power. The coefficient of proportionality, a generalized <b>drop</b> <b>concentration,</b> {{is a function of the}} drop size. For abundant small drops the power is unity as assumed in the conventional approach. However, for rarer large drops, it falls increasingly below unity. This empirical fact leads to drop clustering, with the larger drops exhibiting a greater degree of clustering. The generalized <b>drop</b> <b>concentration</b> shows {{the mean number of}} drops per cluster, while the power characterizes the occurrence frequency of clusters. With a fixed total number of drops in a cloud, a decrease in frequency of clusters is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the generalized concentration. This initiates a competing process missed in the conventional models: an increase in the number of drops per cluster enhances the impact of rarer large drops on cloud radiation while a decrease in the frequency suppresses it. Because of the nonlinear relationship between the number of clustered drops and the volume, these two opposite tendencies do not necessarily compensate each other. The data analysis suggests that clustered drops likely have a stronger radiative impact compared to their unclustered counterpart; ignoring it results in underestimation of the contribution from large drops to cloud horizontal optical path...|$|E

Our work aims to use a large-eddy simulation (LES) code with embedded size-resolved aerosol and cloud microphysics to identify factors controlling multi-phase arctic stratus. Our preliminary simulations of autumn transition-season clouds observed during the 1994 Beaufort and Arctic Seas Experiment (BASE) indicated that low concentrations of ice nuclei, which were not measured, may have significantly lowered liquid water content and thereby stabilized cloud evolution. However, cloud <b>drop</b> <b>concentrations</b> appeared to be virtually immune to changes in liquid water content, indicating an active Bergeron process with little effect of collection on <b>drop</b> number <b>concentration.</b> We will compare these results with preliminary simulations from October 8 - 13 during MPACE.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of anthropogenic aerosols on the physics and chemistry of clouds in the northeastern United States, aerosol and cloud-drop size distributions, elemental composition of aerosols {{as a function of}} size, and ionic content of cloud water were measured on Whiteface Mountain, NY, during the summers of 1981 and 1982. In several case studies, the data were cross-correlated with different air mass types - background continental, polluted continental, and maritime - that were advected to the sampling site. The results are the following: (1) Anthropogenic sources hundreds of kilometers upwind cause the small-particle (accumulation) mode number to increase from hundreds of thousands per cubic centimeter and the mass loading to increase from a few to several tens of micrograms per cubic meter, mostly in the form of sulfur aerosols. (2) A significant fraction of anthropogenic sulfur appears to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to affect the cloud <b>drop</b> <b>concentration.</b> (3) Clouds in Atlantic maritime air masses have cloud drop spectra that are markedly different from those measured in continental clouds. The <b>drop</b> <b>concentration</b> is significantly lower, and the drop size spectra are heavily skewed toward large drops. (4) Effects of anthropogenic pollutants on cloud water ionic composition are an increase of nitrate by a factor of 50, an increase of sulfate by more than one order of magnitude, and an increase of ammonium ion by a factor of 7. The net effect of the changes in ionic concentrations is an increase in cloud water acidity.

40|$|The two-way {{transition}} between closed and open cellular convection is addressed in an idealized cloud-resolving modeling framework. A series of cloud-resolving simulations {{shows that the}} {{transition between}} closed and open cellular states is asymmetrical and characterized by a rapid ("runaway") transition from the closed- to the open-cell state but slower recovery to the closed-cell state. Given that precipitation initiates the closed–open cell transition and that the recovery requires a suppression of the precipitation, we apply an ad hoc time-varying <b>drop</b> <b>concentration</b> to initiate and suppress precipitation. We show that the asymmetry in the two-way transition occurs even for very rapid <b>drop</b> <b>concentration</b> replenishment. The primary barrier to recovery is the loss in turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) associated with the loss in cloud water (and associated radiative cooling) and the vertical stratification of the boundary layer during the open-cell period. In transitioning from the open to the closed state, the system faces the task of replenishing cloud water fast enough to counter precipitation losses, such that it can generate radiative cooling and TKE. It is hampered by a stable layer below cloud base {{that has to be}} overcome before water vapor can be transported more efficiently into the cloud layer. Recovery to the closed-cell state is slower when radiative cooling is inefficient such as in the presence of free tropospheric clouds or after sunrise, when it is hampered by the absorption of shortwave radiation. Tests suggest that recovery to the closed-cell state is faster when the drizzle is smaller in amount and of shorter duration, i. e., when the precipitation causes less boundary layer stratification. Cloud-resolving model results on recovery rates are supported by simulations with a simple predator–prey dynamical system analogue. It is suggested that the observed closing of open cells by ship effluent likely occurs when aerosol intrusions are large, when contact comes prior to the heaviest drizzle in the early morning hours, and when the free troposphere is cloud free...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} a 2 -D axisymmetric, non-hydrostatic, bin-resolved cloud model to {{examine the impact of}} aerosol changes on the {{development}} of mixed-phase convective clouds. We have simulated convective clouds from four different sites (three continental and one tropical marine) {{with a wide range of}} realistic aerosol loadings and initial thermodynamic conditions (a total of 93 different clouds). It is found that the accumulated precipitation responds very differently to changing aerosol in the marine and continental environments. For the continental clouds, the scaled total precipitation reaches a maximum for aerosol that produce drop numbers at cloud base between 180 – 430 cm − 3 when other conditions are the same. In contrast, all the tropical marine clouds show an increase in accumulated precipitation and deeper convection with increasing aerosol loading. For continental clouds, drops are rapidly depleted by ice particles shortly after the onset of precipitation. The precipitation is dominantly produced by melting ice particles. The riming rate increases with aerosol when the loading is very low, and decreases when the loading is high. Peak precipitation intensities tend to increase with aerosol up to <b>drop</b> <b>concentrations</b> (at cloud base) of ~ 500 cm − 3 then decrease with further aerosol increases. This behaviour is caused by the initial transition from warm to mixed-phase rain followed by reduced efficiency of mixed-phase rain at very high <b>drop</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The response of tropical marine clouds to increasing aerosol is different to, and larger than, that of continental clouds. In the more humid tropical marine environment with low cloud bases we find that accumulated precipitation increases with increasing aerosol.

40|$|Tests {{were made}} with Newtonian {{paraffin}} oil as the disperse phase (drops) and surfactant solutions in demineralized water as the continuous phase. Surfactant used was non-ionic polyoxyethylenesorbitantrioleate TweenTM 85 at 5 vol %. The oil-in-water emulsions were tested at two different average drop sizes, 1 and 20 m and quasimonomodal drop size distribution. Rheological behavior was studied in stationary shear flow and oscillating shear stress. The rheological properties of the emulsions were determined {{in terms of the}} material behavior of the continuous and disperse phases. The influence of the disperse phase related not only to <b>drop</b> <b>concentration</b> and mass properties concerning the average drop size, but also to the drop size distribution and the boundary layer properties of the drops which generated the interparticle transfer effects, and the deformation of the disperse phase in the total system. The influence of the disperse phase on flow behavior was illustrated i n a plot of shear velocity in reciprocal seconds vs. viscosity in Pascal-seconds for the emulsion, surfactant solution, and water...|$|E
40|$|We {{proposed}} to analyze data {{collected during the}} Routine Aerial Facilities (AAF) Clouds with Low Optical Water Depths (CLOWD) Optical Radiative Observations (RACORO) {{in order to develop}} an integrated product of cloud microphysical properties (number concentration of drops in different size bins, total liquid <b>drop</b> <b>concentration</b> integrated over all bin sizes, liquid water content LWC, extinction of liquid clouds bw, effective radius of water drops re, and radar reflectivity factor) {{that could be used to}} evaluate large-eddy simulations (LES), general circulation models (GCMs) and ground-based remote sensing retrievals, and to develop cloud parameterizations with the end goal of improving the modeling of cloud processes and properties and their impact on atmospheric radiation. We have completed the development of this microphysical database and have submitted it to ARM for consideration of its inclusion on the ARM database as a PI product. This report describes the development of this database, and also describes research that has been conducted on cloud-aerosol interactions using the data obtained during RACORO. A list of conference proceedings and publications is also included...|$|E
