5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel,</b> wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{such as the}} California ground squirrel, western <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel,</b> and dusky-footed woodrat live in this region. Birds such as grosbeaks, flycatchers, western tanagers, and lazuli {{buntings}} {{are common}} in the area. Nine species of warblers, three species of vireos, and two species of thrushes can also be found. The pileated woodpecker has been spotted rarely in large pine trees.|$|E
5|$|Large mammals {{found in}} the city {{includes}} urbanized coyotes and numerous whitetail deer. Eastern <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel,</b> and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum and raccoon. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally {{be seen on the}} MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife.|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{vertebrate}} {{species can}} act as hosts for endemic pathogens andmay alter pathogen community composition and dynam-ics. For the zoonotic pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, recent work shows invasive rodent species can be of high epidemiological importance andmay support host-specific strains. This study examined the role of <b>gray</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus carolinensis) (n 679), an invasive species in the United Kingdom, as B. burgdorferi sensu lato hosts. We found that <b>gray</b> <b>squirrels</b> were frequently infested with Ixodes ricinus, the main vector of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the United Kingdom, and 11. 9 % were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato. All four genospecies {{that occur in the}} United Kingdom were detected in <b>gray</b> <b>squirrels,</b> and unexpectedly, the bird-associated genospecies Borrelia gariniiwas most common. The second most frequent infection was with Borrelia afzelii. Genotyping of B. garinii and B. afzelii produced no evidence for strains associ-ated with <b>gray</b> <b>squirrels.</b> Generalized linear mixedmodels (GLMM) identified tick infestation and date of capture as significant factors associated with B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection in <b>gray</b> <b>squirrels,</b> with infection elevated in early summer in squirrels infested with ticks. Invasive <b>gray</b> <b>squirrels</b> appear to become infected with locally circulating strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato, and further studies are required to determine their role in community disease dynamics. Our findings highlight the fact that th...|$|R

5|$|Mammals include white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, Virginia opossum, gray fox, red fox, {{and eastern}} cottontail rabbit. Other mammals include: nutria, fox squirrel, <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel,</b> flying squirrel, chipmunk, brown bat, and weasel. Birds include {{cardinals}} (the state bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, brown pelicans, quail, seagulls, bald eagles, and wild turkeys. Virginia {{is also home}} to the pileated woodpecker as well as the red-bellied woodpecker. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid-1990s. Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish (also known as striped bass).|$|E

25|$|A {{prolific}} and adaptable species, {{the eastern}} <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel</b> {{has been introduced}} to, and thrives in, several regions of the western United States. The <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel</b> is an invasive species in Britain; it has spread {{across the country and}} has largely displaced the native red squirrel, S. vulgaris. In Ireland, the red squirrel has been displaced in several eastern counties, though it still remains common in the south and west of the country. That such displacement might happen in Italy is of concern, and gray squirrels might spread from Italy to other parts of mainland Europe.|$|E

25|$|The eastern <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel</b> is an {{introduced}} species {{in a variety}} of locations in western North America: in western Canada, to the southwest corner of British Columbia and to the city of Calgary, Alberta; in the United States, to the states of Washington and Oregon and, in California, to the city of San Francisco and the San Francisco Peninsula area in San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, south of the city. It has become the most common squirrel in many urban and suburban habitats in western North America, from north of central California to southwest British Columbia. At the turn of the 20th century, the eastern <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel</b> was introduced into South Africa, Ireland, Hawaii, Bermuda, Madeira Island, the Azores, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Sciurus carolinensis is {{native to}} the eastern and midwestern United States, and to the southerly {{portions}} of the eastern provinces of Canada. The native range of the eastern <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel</b> overlaps {{with that of the}} fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), with which it is sometimes confused, although the core of the fox squirrel's range is slightly more to the west. The eastern <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel</b> is found from New Brunswick to Manitoba, south to East Texas and Florida. Breeding eastern gray squirrels are found in Nova Scotia, but whether this population was introduced or came from natural range expansion is not known. It has also been introduced into Ireland, Britain, Italy, South Africa, and Australia (where it was extirpated by 1973). Eastern grey squirrels in Europe are a concern because they have displaced some of the native squirrels there.|$|E
25|$|Sciurus carolinensis, {{common name}} eastern <b>gray</b> <b>{{squirrel}}</b> or grey squirrel depending on region, is a tree squirrel in the genus Sciurus.

25|$|The grasslands have {{native and}} nonnative plants brought by cows, though native wildflowers {{grow in the}} spring. The cattle have a feisty reputation. Black-tailed deer are abundant. Pronghorn and tule elk were extirpated in the late 19th century. Tule elk were reintroduced to Alameda County, and now visit occasionally.

Small mammals include the black-tailed jackrabbit, the western <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel,</b> and California ground squirrels.|$|E
25|$|Although {{complex and}} controversial, the main {{factor in the}} eastern gray squirrel's {{displacement}} of the red squirrel {{is thought to be}} its greater fitness, hence a competitive advantage over the red squirrel on all measures. The eastern <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel</b> tends to be larger and stronger than the red squirrel and has been shown to have a greater ability to store fat for winter. The squirrel can, therefore, compete more effectively for a larger share of the available food, resulting in relatively lower survival and breeding rates among the red squirrel. Parapoxvirus may also be a strongly contributing factor; red squirrels have long been fatally affected by the disease, while the eastern gray squirrels are unaffected, but thought to be carriers – although how the virus is transmitted has yet to be determined. However, several cases of red squirrels surviving have been reported, as they have developed an immunity – although their population is still being massively affected. The red squirrel is also less tolerant of habitat destruction and fragmentation, which has led to its population decline, while the more adaptable eastern <b>gray</b> <b>squirrel</b> has taken advantage and expanded.|$|E
