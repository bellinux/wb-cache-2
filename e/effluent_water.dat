25|$|Recreational usage {{is usually}} non-consumptive. Golf courses are often {{targeted}} as using excessive amounts of water, especially in drier regions. It is, however, unclear whether recreational irrigation (which would include private gardens) has a noticeable effect on water resources.

Additionally, many golf courses utilize either primarily or exclusively treated <b>effluent</b> <b>water,</b> which has little impact on potable water availability.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{light can}} be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other {{chemicals}}. Because no chemicals are used, the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as {{may be the case}} with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the genetic structure of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of UV disinfection are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> disinfection.|$|E

Data is also provided for these same samples using USEPA Method 552. 2. The sample matrices contain up to 170 mg/L chloride and 243 mg/L sulfate. Matrix ions are separated from the analytes using a high capacity anion exchange analytical column and diverted to a waste stream during each analysis to avoid signal suppression and contamination of the detector. No derivatization, offline matrix elimination, or preconcentration is used. Four isotopically-labeled HAAs are used for quantification, and detection limits are in the range of 400 – 1000 µg/L with R 2 of at least 0. 997 over two orders of magnitude for all analytes in matrix. A trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) internal standard with the label on the alpha carbon is found to be more stable than the TCAA- 1 - 13 C. Amounts found using IC–MS–MS are 65 – 130 % of amounts found using Method 552. 2 for all analytes in the real world treated <b>effluent</b> <b>waters.</b> Detection limits for all nine analytes in matrix are in the range of 100 – 700 ng/L...|$|R

50|$|A {{portion of}} the {{clarified}} <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> leaving the DAF tank is pumped into a small pressure vessel (called the air drum) into which compressed air is also introduced. This results in saturating the pressurized <b>effluent</b> <b>water</b> with air. The air-saturated water stream is recycled {{to the front of}} the float tank and flows through a pressure reduction valve just as it enters the front of the float tank, which results in the air being released in the form of tiny bubbles. Bubbles form at nucleation sites on the surface of the suspended particles, adhering to the particles. As more bubbles form, the lift from the bubbles eventually overcomes the force of gravity. This causes the suspended matter to float to the surface where it forms a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the DAF unit.|$|E

40|$|Cresting in {{horizontal}} wells is {{a well-known}} reservoir problem usually described as the insurgence of <b>effluent(s)</b> (unwanted <b>water</b> and or gas) through the perforation of the well, which is produced together with oil. Cresting is majorly affected by pressure drop, resulting in uneconomic oil production rates and large volumes of oil could be left behind due to premature shut-in of the well.

A time, half the approximated initial effluents breakthrough time, was pre-set for the electromagnetic valve to close. The valve closed almost immediately at the set-time thereby shutting oil production temporarily, causing the water and gas height levels to recede by gravity and capillarity. The efficiency of this technique was compared with an uncontrolled simulation case, in terms of cumulative oil produced and water produced at the same overall production time. Using the cresting control procedure, higher percentages in oil produced and water reduction were observed in the cases controlled proactively. An increment of 3. 56...|$|R
