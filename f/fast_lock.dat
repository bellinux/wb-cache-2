40|$|Abstract. Speeding up a synthesizer’s locking {{process can}} be {{considered}} as speeding up the charge pump PLL. Several methods have been introduced to increase the speed of the locking process. One way to achieve <b>fast</b> <b>locking</b> is to use a bangbang frequency comparator (BBFC) in the feed-trough path to achieve a <b>faster</b> <b>locking</b> process. In this paper, we present a differential equation for this fast CPPLL which shows how the BBFC can decrease the settling time in a charge pump PLL. Simulations in MATLAB are confirmed by a differential equation solved in Maple using a numerical method. Using the extracted equation and solving it by numerical method we can predict the system’s behavior.

5000|$|The Model 44 or Large Frame Dan Wesson was {{initially}} offered with 4", 6", 8", or 10" [...] interchangeable barrel/shroud options, and most guns shipped with a 6-inch barrel. A 2 1/2" [...] barrel/shroud was later introduced, {{available as a}} separate option from the factory. Like the Model 15-2, the Model 44 could also be purchased {{with a variety of}} shroud configurations - either partial lug or full lug with a solid rib or ventilated-rib barrel. The Model 44 could also be obtained with a [...] "Power Control" [...] barrel compensator. [...] This was a stainless steel barrel drilled radially at the muzzle end with a series of small ports. Two small vents cut into the top of the barrel shroud vented excess gas and reduced apparent recoil of the gun, although this feature eliminated the option of using cast lead bullets due to lead and carbon accumulation. At the time, Dan Wesson M44 was the lightest recoiling [...]44 magnum ever produced. [...] Light recoil was a side benefit in IHMSA silhouette competitions. The Model 44's high level of intrinsic accuracy, combined with an excellent trigger, and <b>fast</b> <b>lock</b> time, caused a surge in popularity of the M44 in heavy-caliber revolver competition, though the gun was also popular with handgun hunters and sportsmen who desired a gun for personal protection against bears or other large predators. The Power Control barrel and vented shroud were eventually dropped, though DW did experiment with an external shroud-mounted compensator in later models.|$|E
