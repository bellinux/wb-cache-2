40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with three interrelated issues on our proposal of double cascades intended {{to serve as a}} more realistic theory of twodimensional turbulence. We begin by examining the approach to the KLB limit. We present improved proofs of the result by Fjortoft. We also explain why in that limit the subleading <b>downscale</b> energy cascade and upscale enstrophy cascade are hidden in the energy spectrum. Then we review the experimental evidence from numerical simulations concerning the realizability of the energy and enstrophy cascade. The inverse energy cascade is found to be affected by the presense of a particular solution, and the <b>downscale</b> enstrophy cascade forms only under certain configurations of the dissipative terms. Finally, we amplify the hypothesis that the energy spectrum of the atmosphere reflects a combined <b>downscale</b> cascade of energy and enstrophy.

2500|$|Between 1925 and 1935 Pinus radiata {{was first}} {{introduced}} as a commercial tree crop, to the district - as the trees were found not to be adversely affected by the local soil deficiencies. [...] As the initial crops matured, Tokoroa was then developed as a residential satellite for Kinleith Mill workers (New Zealand Forest Products Limited's integrated timber, pulp and paper mill), approximately 8km south of the township. [...] In 1948, Tokoroa had a population of 1,100. By the early 1970s, however, Tokoroa reached, for a time, a population of over 20,000 - the number necessary to be officially deemed a city. [...] In the 1980s years NZFP (and later, mill-owner Carter Holt Harvey Ltd) began to downscale and restructure operations at Kinleith. Tokoroa's population fell to approximately 18,000. Since the late 1980s ongoing <b>downscaling</b> at Kinleith - and closing of other local industries - {{has resulted in a}} marked drop in population.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{accuracy}} of statistically <b>downscaled</b> precipitation estimates from numerical weather prediction models, a set of experiments to study what space and time scales are appropriate to obtain <b>downscaled</b> precipitation forecasts with maximum skill have been carried out. Fourteen-day forecasts from the 1998 version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Medium-Range Forecast (MRF) model were used in this study. It has been previously found that <b>downscaled</b> temperature fields have significant skill even up to 5 days of forecast lead time, but there is practically no valuable skill in the <b>downscaled</b> precipitation forecasts. Low skill in precipitation forecasts revolves around two main issues. First, the (intermittent) precipitation variability on daily and subdaily time scales could be too noisy to derive meaningful relationships with atmospheric predictors. Second, the model parameterizations and the coarse spatial resolution of {{the current generation of}} global-scale forecast models might be unable to resolve the local-scale variability in precipitation. Both of these issues may be addressed by spatial and temporal averaging. In this paper the authors present a diagnostic study using a set of numerical experiments to understand how spatial and temporal aggregations affect the skill of <b>downscaled</b> precipitation forecasts in the upper Colorado River basin.

50|$|To {{overcome}} this problem <b>downscaling</b> methods are developed to obtain local-scale weather and climate, particularly at the surface level, from regional-scale atmospheric variables that are provided by GCMs. Two main forms of <b>downscaling</b> technique exist. One form is dynamical <b>downscaling,</b> where output from the GCM is used to drive a regional, numerical model in higher spatial resolution, which therefore is able to simulate local conditions in greater detail. The other form is statistical <b>downscaling,</b> where a statistical relationship is established from observations between large scale variables, like atmospheric surface pressure, and a local variable, like the wind speed at a particular site. The relationship is then subsequently used on the GCM data to obtain the local variables from the GCM output.|$|E
