40|$|The {{concept of}} the career <b>guidance</b> <b>practitioner</b> viewing {{themselves}} as a professional is currently being challenged (Colley and Lewin, 2008; Greer, 2009). During the last decade {{there has been a}} concerted effort to support practitioners in engaging with research both as an agent and as a recipient to enhance practice and to drive forward the {{concept of the}} professional. This paper presents examples of progress within this endeavour and the views of practitioners who have engaged in research activities, either as part of their role or as dedicated continuing professional development (CPD). Throughout this paper we explore the role of research within the concepts of profession and professional practice; drawing on literature and primary research that captures views from two groups of practitioners. That careers guidance is a profession is an assumed reality for many practitioners and the organisations that represent them (and our own stance is that it is indeed a profession and we refer to it as such throughout this paper) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} quotation {{raises an}} issue fundamental to career guidance practitioners’ professional the identity: "We {{need to be}} mindful {{that the concept of}} guidance doesn’t get undermined, because one of the issues is everybody thinks they can do guidance. " (Senior career guidance manager, England, 2001). The complex multi-faceted environment within which career guidance is delivered requires practitioners to respond positively and operate ‘professionally’ to achieve visions created by social planners who may not share the same understanding of what constitutes guidance. In an age where everyone now lays claim to being a ‘professional’ (Fournier, 1999), guidance practitioners’ professional identity is threatened, changed and subtly redesigned to accommodate new circumstances. This paper examines influences on the formation of professional identity, and outlines research based in Aotearoa New Zealand. By drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, the location of the subject (i. e. the career <b>guidance</b> <b>practitioner)</b> in relation to these discourses becomes significant, and the concept of ‘care of the self’ relating to identity formation becomes important in understanding practitioners’ own attitudes and feelings towards their work...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} presents EAF Accreditation Framework for the European Career <b>Guidance</b> <b>Practitioners,</b> {{a framework}} developed to accredit at European level people delivering career guidance. EAF accredits main tasks, i. e. the 4 main identifiable and self standing activities a person delivering career guidance can accomplish: 1. Deliver {{information related to}} career guidance as a separate activity 2. Perform career guidance interviews 3. Carry out career guidance activities in small groups 4. Support clients on 1 : 1 base during a time span, including by networking and advocating on their behalf. EAF assessment is based on main tasks performance, i. e. during the assessment, the candidate must demonstrate to be capable {{to carry out the}} main task(s) for which he/she seeks accreditation. The framework solves most of the challenges incurred when accrediting career <b>guidance</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Europe. EAF focuses on what the person does in practice, notwithstanding the many diverse occupational roles in career guidance in Europe.

40|$|Social {{skills can}} be defined as the skills to be gained to the {{students}} {{at the beginning of the}} academic year, like engaging in, self introducing, and asking questions. Those {{skills can be}} gained by the teachers. Reflective teaching is very significant for teachers. Teachers pay attention to everything in the classroom during their instruction. They think of the objectives and the targets to be advanced, do objective observations, and then diversify the methods with respect to the classroom atmosphere. Reflective teaching is among the most popular practices studied recently. In this study, the value of reflective teaching for both the <b>guidance</b> <b>practitioner</b> (psychological counselor) and the teachers (secondary education teachers) is reported. Reflective teaching requires a lasting self-observation and self-evaluation in order to figure out both own and students ’ behaviors and responses. In this study, the effect of an application of reflective teaching in group counseling on teaching social skills is investigated. The teacher arranged a group counseling meeting with other teachers in order to give orientation to first grade secondary students. In the study, the researcher clarifies the importance of reflective teaching for teacher development. Instead of listening the teacher responses like “They do not know”, “They are disregardful”, “They haven’t learned ” or the whimpers like “These are all utopia, here come and do yourself”, it is better to explain them the reflective teaching as a counseling action. Although the reflective teaching is not common in our country, the professionals of this area found abroad, especially in United Kingdom and United States, can be invited to our country. In order to have a maximum efficacy, teachers should improve themselves for systematically researching the education context...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. We live in {{a dynamic}} world characterised by {{constant}} change. These changes occur on a paradigmatic as well as practical level {{and the result is}} that the needs and expectations of individuals are also changing. These changes have an influence on the world of work as well as on the individual in all his or her different roles. Changes in the world of work and in the individual's needs and expectations, challenge career counselling practitioners to adapt their interventions to satisfy career-related, as well as personal needs and expectations of clients. One of the intervention strategies that addresses the needs of post-modern career counselling is the use of a career guidance process with narratives. This study investigates a career guidance process that makes use of narratives. The aim is two-fold — firstly investigating the experiences of clients in a constructivist-based approach to career counselling, using narratives, and secondly, making recommendations based on the findings, regarding the process and training. The researched career guidance process includes three narratives. The first narrative is written by the client and deals with his or her life story. The second narrative is also written by the client but is futuristic and includes expectations, needs and dreams for the future. The third narrative is the end product of the process. It is written by the career <b>guidance</b> <b>practitioner</b> and serves as a summary of information gained from the activities and discussions with the client. Activities, other than the narratives, used in this process include a Myers- Briggs personality type profile, two collages, incomplete sentences and checklists. This study was researched from a constructivist framework. A generic qualitative research strategy was used. Three participants that have already undergone the studied career guidance process was selected for case studies. Each of the particpants was interviewed by means of unstructured interviews and the data was analysed according to categories and themes, using a Constant Comparative method. From the findings it was found that the participants experienced the career guidance process studied in this research as positive and valuable. They specifically referred to their experiences of the therapist, the specific activities, the career guidance sessions, the final product narrative, as well as their changed subject choices. The data also showed that clients have specific needs regarding careers, career guidance in general, as well as developed needs from the studied process. These findings also confirm that the career guidance process as studied in this research is relevant to the changing needs and expectations of clients. Training of Educational Psychologists in the underlying theory and the use of constructivist-based career guidance, using narratives, are recommended...|$|E

Several theories are briefly presented as suggestive examples. The author recommends use of a list or collection of theoretical materials, adjacent to their workplace settings, for guidance and human service professionals and paraprofessionals...|$|R

40|$|One area of {{technical}} and vocational {{education and training}} (TVET) that has been increasing in importance has been work-related learning that is grounded in practice at the workplace.

The first example of collaborative work-related learning is drawn from the experience of inter-organizational learning in manufacturing supply-chain networks.
