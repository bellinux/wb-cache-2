Let her speak for herself, sir. And <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> grog. For your own sake, <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> grog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well! But, Frank, {{where will}} you live? The old house is big enough for us all. But how would Mary <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, drily, [...] "I guess I have a notion. I've been {{finding out}} {{a good deal}} about him. But <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> objections." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Very likely,’ said Miss Twinkleton, still {{from her}} distant eminence; ‘and {{very much to}} be deplored.—Rosa, my dear, how are you <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Dias; {{then this}} day week {{we shall be}} ready to start. However, I suppose I shall see you every day, and learn how you are <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> preparations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you have}} come to that very soon," [...] said Mrs. Westley; {{and then they were}} both silent, till she added, [...] "How are you <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> picture of Miss Maybough?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just so, just so. But <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work, Smith. We are {{a little}} behind-hand. I think {{perhaps it would be}} as well not to leave it just yet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{account of}} your matrimonial intentions," [...] {{answered}} Carton, with a careless air; [...] "I {{wish you would}} keep to that. As to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit {{down and}} <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work," [...] said MacShaughnassy {{from the sofa}} where he lay at full length with his heels on a chair; [...] "we're {{discussing}} the novel. Paradoxes not admitted during business hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't know as I {{want to stay}} up here gossiping," [...] she remarked. [...] "You'd {{much better}} be <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work. Give me one of those cigarettes, anyway," [...] she added abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> medical studies? Never forget, my boy, {{that your}} father's son has every claim upon me, {{and that if}} I can serve {{you in any way}} I am always at your command.--Ever affectionately yours, ...|$|R
60|$|Your {{hint that}} you were <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> story and liked {{it was more than}} golden {{intelligence}} to me in foreign parts. The intensity of the heat, both in Paris and the provinces, was such that I found nothing else so refreshing {{in the course of my}} rambles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never you mind," [...] said Mr. Kybird, {{who was not}} in a {{position}} to satisfy his curiosity--"never you mind. You go and <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work, Charles, and p'r'aps by the time your moustache 'as grown big enough to be seen, you'll 'ear something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, master, as it {{happened}} you were {{in such a hurry}} to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> story that I think you forgot to mention that she was present at the burying of the barrels. Her name was coming when I dropped the sword upon your foot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, I'm {{all right}} now," [...] {{she said in}} a cheerful voice; [...] "I'm used to {{accidents}} of that sort, and they never leave any bad effects beyond a little stiffness of the lungs. Come, Grasshopper, I'll finish that story. <b>Get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> dancing, good people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{all make}} {{mistakes}}, dear, so just put it behind you. We should regret our mistakes and learn from them, but never carry them forward into the future with us. There goes Gilbert Blythe on his wheel [...] . home for his vacation too, I suppose. How are you and he <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> studies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Then,’ resumed Miss Twinkleton, ‘all I can say is, that I am {{bound to}} believe, on your asseveration, {{that it is}} very poor indeed. I cannot forbear adding, that if that unfortunate {{circumstance}} influences your conversation, it is much to be lamented, and it is eminently desirable that your blood were richer.—Rosa, my dear, how are you <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] {{interpolated}} Sylvia to me, [...] "that we {{had kept}} on in English. It {{would have been}} much more satisfactory. I expect one of the other sisters will be here before very long, and before she comes I wish you would tell me how you are <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> book. I have been thinking about it, ever and ever so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] I {{answered}} impatiently, [...] "I {{have already}} {{told you that you}} are the first hare I have ever seen upon the Road. Please <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> story, or the Lights will change and the Gates be opened before I hear its end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] she said, [...] "I {{believe that}} Mr. Lessingham, by some means or another, would keep any promise he ever made. I am {{expecting to see}} Dick at any moment now, so you can <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> lunch, dear, and not sit looking at the curry with tears in your eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make it think! Hasn't it {{got enough}} to think about? Aren't there ten {{thousand}} penny-a-liners, poets, tragedians, tub-thumpers, long-eared philosophers, boring it to death? Who are you to turn up your nose at your work and tell the Almighty His own business? You are here to make us laugh. <b>Get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work, you confounded young idiot!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 'How are you <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> flying-machine?' she asked. ('I {{wonder if}} I shall ever meet anyone {{with the sense}} not to ask that,' thought Monson.) 'It will be very {{dangerous}} at first, will it not?' ('Thinks I'm afraid.').... 'You must {{let me know when}} your flying-machine is finished, Mr. Monson, and then I will consider the advisability of taking a ticket.'('One would think I was still playing inventions in the nursery.') ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} very pleasant," [...] said the doctor, envisaging his own rash proposal, [...] "in travelling along roads you don't know and seeing houses and parks and villages and towns {{for which you}} do not feel in the slightest degree responsible. They hide all their troubles from the road. Their backyards are tucked away out of sight, they show a brave face; there's none of the nasty self-betrayals of the railway approach. And everything will be fresh still. There will still {{be a lot of}} apple-blossom--and bluebells.... And all the while we can be <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> affair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, my dear, pray don't take fancies {{into your}} head! He is a very, very good man, {{and has been}} most kind to me, far more than I deserve, and he is your uncle, Nuttie. I do so hope you will <b>get</b> <b>on</b> well <b>with</b> <b>your</b> cousins.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! Come, Jenkins. <b>Get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> patter. Gaskell," [...] {{he called}} to his man, [...] "stand forward here." [...] Then he took his place beside the lady, who had risen, and stood pale, with eyes cast down and--as Mr. Caryll alone saw--the faintest quiver {{at the corners of}} her lips. This served to {{increase}} Mr. Caryll's already considerable cogitations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] Maraton {{declared}} cheerfully. [...] "These {{people with}} homes {{lose sight of}} the real thing. What do you think of your Labour Members, honestly, Aaron? Ah, I can see that they have been little gods to you! Little tin gods, I am afraid, Aaron. Do they {{know what it is to}} go hungry, I wonder? Not often! [...] . <b>Get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> letters. I am going out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll never write a {{play like}} it, Philip!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "There never was {{anything}} like it before. Now, Mr. Dane, {{what is it you}} say in America when you want to introduce anybody?--shake hands with Mr. Douglas Romilly--that's it. Shake hands with the dead man here and then <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> arresting. He must be dead if you say so, but he doesn't look it, does he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{know the}} Senator here well enough." [...] This {{was said in}} the inner room by Mounser Green to Morton, who had breakfasted with the Senator that morning and had made an {{appointment}} {{to meet him at}} the Foreign Office. The Senator wanted to secure a seat for himself at the opening of Parliament which was appointed to take place {{in the course of the}} next month, and being a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the American Senate of course thought himself entitled to have things done for him by the Foreign Office clerks. [...] "Oh yes, I'll see him. Lord Drummond will get him a seat as a matter of course. How is he <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> neighbour at Dillsborough?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now I do not grumble at letters. You {{can read}} them instead of <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> breakfast. They are {{entertaining}} in a way, {{and you can}} tear them up at the end, and in that respect at least they are better than {{people who come to}} see you. Usually, too, you need not make a reply. But sometimes Euphemia gets hold of some still untorn, and says in her dictatorial way that they have to be answered--insists--says I must. Yet she knows that nothing fills me with a livelier horror than having to answer letters. It paralyses me. I waste whole days sometimes mourning over the time that I shall have to throw away presently, answering some needless impertinence--requests for me to return books lent to me; reminders from the London Library that my subscription is overdue; proposals for me to renew my ticket at the stores--Euphemia's business really; invitations for me to go and be abashed before impertinent distinguished people: all kinds of bothering things.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear you}} are <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> so well <b>with</b> <b>your</b> writings. I hope you are not {{neglecting}} the revision of your poems for the press, from which I expect more than you do." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{discussion}} waxed so warm {{that the}} purr of the milk-streams became jerky, till {{a voice from}} another cow's belly cried with authority, 'Now then, what the Turk do it matter to us about Farmer Lodge's age, or Farmer Lodge's new mis'ess? I shall have to pay him nine pound {{a year for the}} rent of every one of these milchers, whatever his age or hers. <b>Get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work, or 'twill be dark afore we have done. The evening is pinking in a'ready.' This speaker was the dairyman himself; by whom the milkmaids and men were employed.|$|E
6000|$|... "'DEAR MID--I am {{too busy}} to come to-day. <b>Get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work, for Heaven's sake! The new sailing-master {{is a man of}} ten thousand. He has got an Englishman whom he knows to serve as mate on board already; and he is {{positively}} certain of getting the crew together in three or four days' time. I am dying for a whiff of the sea, and so are you, or you are no sailor. The rigging is set up, the stores are coming on board, and we shall bend the sails to-morrow or next day. I never was in such spirits in my life. Remember me to your wife, and tell her she will be doing me a favor if she will come at once, and order everything she wants in the lady's cabin. Yours affectionately, A. A.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{how do you}} <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> signatures?' said Mr. Pilgrim, the doctor, who had {{presented}} his large top-booted person within the bar while Mr. Dempster was speaking. Mr. Pilgrim {{had just returned from}} one of his long day's rounds among the farm-houses, in the course of which he had sat down to two hearty meals that might have been mistaken for dinners if he had not declared them to be 'snaps'; and as each snap had been followed by a few glasses of 'mixture'; containing a less liberal proportion of water than the articles he himself labelled with that broadly generic name, he was in that condition which his groom indicated with poetic ambiguity by saying that 'master had been in the sunshine'. Under these circumstances, after a hard day, in which he had really had no regular meal, it seemed a natural relaxation to step into the bar of the Red Lion, where, as it was Saturday evening, he should be sure to find Dempster, and hear the latest news about the protest against the evening lecture.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is but a}} hasty visit,' {{she said}} when, after putting up her mouth to be kissed, she had seated herself in the low chair used for observations, panting a little with the labour of ascent. 'But I {{hope to be able}} to come more freely soon. My brother is still living <b>on</b> <b>with</b> me. Yes, he is going to stay until the {{confirmation}} is over. After the confirmation he will certainly leave. So good it is of you, dear, to please me by agreeing to the ceremony. The Bishop, you know, is going to lunch with us. It is a wonder he has promised to come, for he is a man averse to society, and mostly keeps entirely <b>with</b> the clergy <b>on</b> these confirmation tours, or circuits, or whatever they call them. But Mr. Torkingham's house is so very small, and mine is so close at hand, that this arrangement to relieve him of the fuss of one meal, at least, naturally suggested itself; and the Bishop has fallen in with it very readily. How are you <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> observations? Have you not wanted me dreadfully, to write down notes?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a pity {{you forgot}} to wipe that smudge of paint off your nose, Laura," [...] she said sarcastically. [...] "You don't seem to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> very fast <b>with</b> <b>your</b> lace. How long is it since you began it? Over three months, isn't it?" ...|$|R
40|$|Job sharing offers {{advantages}} to both employer and employee {{but it is}} still uncommon in medicine. Based on the experiences of two psychiatrists sharing a consultant post this article describes some of the problems in obtaining a job share. The most difficult part can be getting an interview, and once a post has been obtained the terms and conditions of service may have to be modified to suit job sharing. <b>Getting</b> <b>on</b> well <b>with</b> <b>your</b> job sharing partner and good communication will not only help overcome the obstacles but ensure that the sharing is successful...|$|R
