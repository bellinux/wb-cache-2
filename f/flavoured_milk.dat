With over 4000 products already voluntary featuring the DIG, the industry argues that government regulation of FOP nutrition labelling is simply unnecessary. However, no independent audit of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s self-regulation has ever been undertaken and we present the first such Australian data. Subjects/Methods: Energy-dense nutrient-poor (EDNP) snacks were audited at nine Australian supermarkets, including biscuits, candy, ice creams, chocolates, crisps, sports drinks, energy drinks, <b>flavoured</b> <b>milks,</b> sweetened juices and soft drinks. In these categories nutrition labels were recorded for 728 EDNP products in various packaging sizes. Results: The DIG was displayed on 66...|$|R
40|$|Abstract –Today <b>flavoured</b> <b>milks</b> {{have become}} very popular as they contain {{nutrients}} compared to soft drinks. Coffee {{is the second most}} important product in the international market in terms of volume trade and the most important in terms of value. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model was developed to predict the shelf life of roasted coffee sterilized milk drink. Colour and appearance, flavour, viscosity and sediment were taken as independent variables, and overall acceptability as dependent variable. MSE, RMSE, R 2 and E 2 were used in order to compare the prediction potential of the developed model. The MLR model was found to be effective for estimating the shelf life of roasted coffee sterilized milk drink, as it showed high correlation between the actual and the predicted values...|$|R

40|$|UHT processing, {{leads to}} the {{formation}} of “cooked ” and “flat ” <b>flavours</b> in <b>milk.</b> These undesirable notes occur due to the volatile formation of a variety of sulphur containing compounds, methyl ketones and aliphatic aldehydes derived from the constituents of the milks matrix during thermal processing and storage. The “cooked ” <b>flavour</b> of UHT <b>milk</b> is associated with the presence of a variety of sulphur containing compounds while the “stale ” flavour is characterised by the dissipation of these sulphur volatiles and an increase of the formation and presence of both methyl ketones and aliphatic aldehydes over time. The extent that the individual volatiles contribute to the overall <b>flavour</b> of UHT <b>milk</b> is not clear. The proposed formation of these volatiles; methods to control the intensity of “cooked ” and “stale ” flavours associated with UHT milk and extraction techniques for the isolation of these volatiles from milk have been reviewed...|$|R

50|$|Big M is a {{brand of}} <b>flavoured</b> <b>milk</b> that was founded in Melton, Victoria, Australia, in 1977-78. It was {{launched}} by the newly formed Victorian Dairy Industry Authority (VDIA), which replaced the more regulatory-oriented Victorian Milk Board. The VDIA was given a greater marketing role by the Minister of Agriculture, Ian Smith. He appointed Des Cooper (MD of the Victorian Oat Growers Pool) as chairman, and Brian Purtell as general manager. Purtell appointed agricultural-science graduate Peter Granger as Marketing Manager. Granger conceived the VDIA Marketing Plan to introduce branding and promotion to <b>flavoured</b> <b>milk</b> (Big M) and reduced-fat milk (Rev), and it was embraced by the board. Until this time there had been dozens of small 'zoned' dairies, some with their own <b>flavoured</b> <b>milk</b> brands - but {{with the exception of}} a dairy in Shepparton (Ducats), sales were minuscule. A reduced-fat milk called 2:10 had been launched years earlier http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1974-76No83.pdf by the Milk Board and failed due to lack of co-operation by dairy processors, and the inability of the Board to overcome this resistance. Similarly, there was resistance to the launch of Big M and Rev, but it was ultimately embraced by the industry following consumer interest and demand the advertising promotion generated. Granger was principally the creative input, with Cooper and Purtell administrators who maneuvered the launch in the face of industry reluctance and scepticism. The advertising agency George Paterson was appointed to handle the campaigns. They conceived the brand names and contracted Paddington Films to produce the highly successful Big M surfing ads. This was a very rare occasion where a government department launched a successful and contemporary consumer product. Big M accounted for sales of 19 million lites per year, and licence fees of $6 - 6.5 million pa prior to the trademarks being sold in 2000 for almost $62 million. Big M <b>flavoured</b> <b>milk</b> is available primarily in Melbourne, regional and rural areas of Victoria and the southern and western Riverina regions of New South Wales near the state border of Victoria. In recent years distribution of the Big M brand has expanded further north into the rest of New South Wales and into Queensland as well as its state of origin. The brand has gained popularity through television ad campaigns in Victoria such as 'Think Big, but not too big'. It is sold in cartons, Tetra Briks and plastic bottles in both fresh and UHT varieties. The Big M brand is currently owned by Lion (formerly National Foods).|$|E

40|$|For centuries, coffee {{has been}} brewed and {{consumed}} in households, hot shops and restaurants.

Sterilized milk is the product made by heating milk to high temperature (121 o C) with 15 m holding time so that it remains fit for human consumption for longer time at room temperature. Efficiency of single and double hidden layers of Cascade neurocomputing models for prediction of sensory quality of roasted coffee flavoured sterilized drink were studied. Colour and appearance, viscosity, flavour and sediment were taken as input parameters, while overall acceptability was used as output parameter. The results of cascade neurocomputing models were calculated with two types of prediction performance measures, viz., {{root mean square error}} and coefficient of determination R 2. The study revealed that more the number of neurons in single hidden layer, less the error for cascade neurocomputing models (RMSE: 0. 00011; R 2 : 0. 999999; neurons: 50) ...|$|R
