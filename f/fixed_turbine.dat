The gas generator RPM was kept at 100% to maintain maximum thrust. The transition to partial ramjet operation may be viewed as complete when, at cruise, the exhaust gas from the gas generator had no residual energy left for thrust production and all the engine thrust came from the afterburner. The afterburner may be viewed as a ramjet combustor with energy transfer from the turbine exhaust gas. In this characterization as a partial-ramjet the ram air burned in the combustor was about 8% of the turbine exhaust that was reheated (most of the 20% ram air was used for cooling [...] ). The airflow through the intake was being induced, or pumped, by the gas generator and heated with maximum afterburner, which gave a thrust distribution, at Mach 3+, of 54% inlet, 17.6% engine, 28.4% propelling nozzle.|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} were performed, where {{the development of}} the wake of a model wind turbine was measured using stereo Particle Image Velocimetry to observe the influence of platform pitch motion. The wakes of a classical bottom <b>fixed</b> <b>turbine</b> and a streamwise oscillating turbine are compared. Results indicate that platform pitch creates an upward shift in all components of the flow and their fluctuations. The vertical flow created by the pitch motion as well as the reduced entrainment of kinetic energy from undisturbed flows above the turbine result in potentially higher loads and less available kinetic energy for a downwind turbine. Experimental results are compared with four wake models. The wake models employed are consistent with experimental results in describing the shapes and magnitudes of the streamwise velocity component of the wake for a <b>fixed</b> <b>turbine.</b> Inconsistencies between the model predictions and experimental results arise in the floating case particularly regarding the vertical displacement of the velocity components of the flow. Furthermore, it is found that the additional degrees of freedom of a floating wind turbine add to the complexity of the wake aerodynamics and improved wake models are needed, considering vertical flows and displacements due to pitch motion...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable energy {{generation}} through renewable sources is a rapidly expanding industry within {{the energy sector}} {{and as part of}} that the industry applies floating turbines to convert the kinetic energy into electrical energy. Moreover the maintenance cost of the floating turbine is lower compared to the <b>fixed</b> <b>turbine,</b> although the hydrodynamic interaction is not completely understood. This work, firstly studies the effect of the thrust and power generation of an horizontal axis tidal turbine under imposed surge and pitch motion. Secondly, a 2 D numerical model of a floating moored platform with the turbine is used to analyse the influence of the hydrodynamic interaction between the platform and the tidal turbine in time domain. To gain understanding in the coupled dynamic system, it will be subjected to a single harmonic wave and constant current profile. Tidal turbine models are typically used from the quasi-static wind turbine models, which are known as the Actuator Disk Momentum (ADM) Model and Blade Element Momentum (BEM) model. Furthermore the quasi-static models are compared with the reproduced experimental data from existing literature. Both models are analysed at blade pitch angles (θ) of 5 o, 7 o and 9 o. For analysing the dynamic model, the quasi-static BEM model is extended to account for the added mass effects in the axial direction of the blade. As with the most turbine system, a control system regulates the turbine to maintain the desired power output. The quasi-static BEM model as well as the dynamic BEM model is analysed from an optimal operation criteria especially for the fixed rotational speed and control rotational speed. Also the models are analysed at different oscillatory frequencies at θ = 5 o, examined under the same hydrodynamic conditions. The results provide an insight into the added mass effect (force) in the axial direction on the blade and will support our understanding with this kind of phenomenon, for a rotor operating in unsteady flow. The outcomes for the thrust and power generation of the floating turbine and <b>fixed</b> <b>turbine</b> are compared at a water depth of 105 m and a single harmonic wave, with an amplitude of 1 m. The results for thrust and power extracted from the floating turbine are higher due to the relative velocity acting on each blade section.

They are merely scaled down versions of their larger siblings, gas-turbines powering commercial airplanes on generating megawatts of electrical energy throughout the world. The basic components of a micro gas-turbine and that of a turbocharger unit on internal combustion engines are quite similar. Both have a compressor, a heat source and a turbine. This study investigates the possibility of using a commercial turbocharger, designed for use on internal combustion engines, to function as a micro gas-turbine. The literature study discusses the components that make up a typical gas-turbine. Importantly, the literature explains the principles of operation and thermodynamic and/or mechanical relevance in a gas-turbine. Furthermore, the study shows a hand calculation procedure in order to calculate the excess power available from a turbocharger based on a <b>fixed</b> <b>turbine</b> inlet temperature, calculating the excess power for four different turbocharger Units. After the compressor and turbine characteristics are imported into FLOWNEX (a network solving software package) to recalculate the excess power, the results are compared with the results of the hand calculation.

40|$|An {{oscillating}} {{water column}} (OWC) wave energy converter (WEC) is a device designed to extract energy from waves at sea by using the water to move trapped air and thus drive an air turbine. Because the incident waves and the force caused by the power take-off (PTO) interact, control of the power take off (PTO) system can increase the total energy converted. A numerical model was developed to study the interaction of an OWC with the water and other structures around it. ANSYS AQWA is used here to find the effects on the water surface {{in and around the}} central column of a five-column, breakwater-mounted OWC. For open OWC structures, coupled modes were seen which lead to sensitivity to incident wave period and direction. The frequency-domain displacements of the internal water surface of the central column were turned into a force-displacement, time-domain model in MATLAB Simulink using a state space approximation. The model of the hydrodynamics was then combined with the thermodynamic and turbine equations for a Wells turbine. A baseline situation was tested for <b>fixed</b> <b>turbine</b> speed operation using a wave climate for a region off the north coast of Devon. A linear feedforward controller and a controller based on maximising turbine efficiency were tested for the system. The linear controller was optimised to find the combination of turbine speed offset and proportional constant that gave maximum energy in the most energy abundant sea state. This increased the converted energy by 31 % in comparison to the fixed speed case. For the turbine efficiency control method, the increase was 36 %. Energy conversion increases are therefore clearly possible using simple controllers. If increased converted energy is the only criterion for controller choice, then the turbine efficiency control is the best method, however the control action involves using very slow turbine speeds which may not be physically desirable...|$|E

The study is performed in collaboration with Hexicon AB which has a patent family for innovative floating platforms, which are able to turn automatically.

The present study starts with wind speed and wind direction data analysis for the specific site that Hexicon AB plans to construct its first platform. Data analysis is followed by wake interaction studies for H 4 - 24 MW type Hexicon AB platform. Wake interaction simulations were performed for three different cases. <b>Fixed</b> <b>turbine</b> and platform, Nacelle yawing and fixed platform and Nacelle yawing and turned platform. Different cases were investigated {{in order to see}} wake interactions for different wind directions. Wind direction effect on wake interactions were performed between _ 90 _ and 90 _ with an increment of 10 _. After having the simulation results for Nacelle yawing and turned platform case the results were compared with ANSYS - CFX simulations results. The results didn’t match exactly but they were very close, which is an indicator to the validity of the Jensen Model. After finding out the possible behavior of wake interactions for different wind directions, power calculations were performed for the same three cases. In order to perform the power calculations the wake interactions for different wind directions were taken into account. In case of platform turning it was assumed that power losses were caused both by wake interactions and in case of thrusters activation. The losses that would be caused by different thrust forces on the turbine blades were not included. The last study was performed to suggest different layouts. In the second case, Nacelle yawing and fixed platform, it was found out that nacelle yawing for most of the angles is not possible because it creates wake regions in front of the rotor area. It was decided to propose new turbine configurations on the platform which are tolerant to different nacelle yawing angles.

The simplest though most effective correction developed is To=Tf (1 −k cos(ωot)) 2, (1) where ωo is the frequency of oscillation in rad/s, and k is the ratio of the maximum oscillation speed for a certain section of the turbine over the freestream wind speed. Three different corrective functions were evaluated, that is one for the effect of the angles of attack, one for the relative wind speed and one considering both at the same time (Eq. (1)). Moreover, the correction may depend on just one representative section, the middle one in this case, or the entire rotor.

For the higher oscillation frequency a 4. 4 % increase was observed. The theorical model was able to reproduce the behaviour of the oscillating turbine with satisfactory accuracy. To quantify the matching, absolute error was divided by the peak torque of the fixed axis turbine. For the lower oscillation frequency worst accuracy is 13. 8 %, while mean accuracy is 5. 3 %. As the frequency grows the hypothesis which the model is based on become less valid, so for the higher oscillation frequency precision decreases, in fact worst accuracy is 29. 0 % while mean is 9. 1 %. The theory proved to attain reasonably accurate results notwithstanding its simplicity, making it a cost-effective tool for quick analysis or optimization. Moreover, the theory could insight the way in which oscillation affects the torque. Considering relative wind speed separately showed that it has little influence, so it can be concluded that torque is affected by oscillation mainly by the change in the angles of attack. By comparing theorical and computational results, it was possible to show the dynamic effect on the downwind blade created by the wake of the upwind passage, a phenomenon which momentum models tailored for floating turbines should take into account.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} in floating wind turbines in deep waters, however, {{there are also}} significant technological challenges associated with it too. The dynamic excitation of wind and waves can induce excessive motions along each of the {{6 degrees of freedom}} (6 -DOF) of the floating platforms. These motions will then be transferred to the turbine, and directly impact the wake characteristics of the floating wind turbines, and consequently the resultant wind loadings and performances of the wind turbines sited in offshore wind farms. In the present study, a comprehensive experimental study was performed to analyze the near wake characteristics of a wind turbine model subjected to surge, heave, and pitch motions. The experimental study was performed in a large-scale atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel with a scaled three-blade Horizontal Axial Wind Turbine model placed in a turbulent boundary layer airflow with similar mean and turbulence characteristics as those over a typical offshore wind farm. The base of a 1 : 300 scaled model wind turbine was mounted on a translation stage. The translation stage can be controlled to generate surge, pitch and heave motions to simulate the dynamic motions experienced by floating offshore wind turbines. During the experiments, the velocity scaling method was chosen to maintain the similar velocity ratios (i. e., the ratios of the incoming airflow flow to that of turbine base motion) between the model and the prototype. During the experiments, a high resolution digital particle image velocimetry (PIV) system was used to achieve flow field measurements to quantify the characteristics of the turbulent vortex flow in the near wake of the wind turbine model. Besides conducting "free run 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 PIV measurements to determine the ensemble-averaged statistics of the flow quantities such as mean velocity, Reynolds stress, and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) distributions in the wake flow, "phase-locked 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 PIV measurements were also performed to elucidate further details about evolution of the unsteady vortex structures in the wake flow in relation to the position of the rotating turbine blades. The effects of the surge, heave, and pitch motions of the wind turbine base on the wake flow characteristics were examined in great details based on the PIV measurements. The findings derived from the present study can be used to improve the understanding of the underlying physics for optimal mechanical design of floating offshore wind turbines, as well as the layout optimization of floating offshore wind farms. The results of the wake study reveal that the wake of a wind turbine subjected to base motions, is highly dependent on which direction the turbine is oscillating. Furthermore, the velocity, frequency, and the range of oscillation also play an important role on the behavior and the wake pattern of the moving turbine. In the case of the surge and pitch motions, the wake accelerates as the turbine is moving with the flow, hence, reducing the power extraction by the turbine. A decrease in Reynolds shear stress and the turbulent kinetic energy production was noted as the turbine was oscillating with the flow. However, as the turbine was moving into the flow, these effects reverse, and causes a deceleration {{in the wake of the}} moving turbine, hence increases the power production by the turbine, and increases the Reynolds shear stress and the turbulent kinetic energy. In the case of the heave motion, the wake tends to shift upward as the turbine was moving downward and vice versa. However, no significant difference in the Reynolds shear stress and the T. K. E. between the wake of the bottom <b>fixed</b> <b>turbine</b> and the oscillating turbine in heave motion was noted...|$|E

Results are shown for two turbines located in two different wind farms; wind turbine 1 is a <b>fixed</b> speed <b>turbine</b> with induction generator, and wind turbine 2 is a variable speed turbine with converter-interfaced synchronous generator. Simulated active and reactive power transient responses to voltage dips have been compared to measured responses, as suggested by IEA Wind Annex 21. For the <b>fixed</b> speed <b>turbine</b> quite good agreement between measurement and simulation is obtained. Shaft parameters are seen to have significant influence on the simulated active power response. For the variable speed turbine the active and reactive power responses are to a high degree determined by the power electronics interface and corresponding controllers, and particularly the control strategy applied during voltage dips. Wind turbine manufacturers are generally very restrictive on giving out this type of information, and thus typical configurations and parameters {{have been used in}} this work. The agreement between measurement and simulation can to some degree be improved by changing the inverter controller parameters by trialand error, but detailed knowledge on the control of the converter would be required in order to achieve a very good agreement...|$|R
40|$|For {{the design}} of a {{floating}} wind turbine it is necessary to take the loading due to the wind, wave and current in equal consideration. The PHATAS computer program from ECN (Energy research Centre of the Netherlands) is a time-domain aero-elastic simulation program, that accounts for the complete mutual interaction of unsteady rotor aerodynamics, structural dynamics of the rotor blades and tower, and interaction with the turbine controller under influence of turbulent wind and wave loading for <b>fixed</b> wind <b>turbines.</b> The aNySIM computer program from MARIN is a multi rigid body time domain model that accounts for wave loadings, current loadings, wind loadings, floating body dynamics, mooring dynamics. The coupled computer program aNySIM / PHATAS accounts for all loadings acting on a floating wind turbine and its response whereas PHATAS can only be used for <b>fixed</b> wind <b>turbines</b> onshore and offshore. This paper reports on the dynamic coupling between PHATAS and aNySIM. As a typical case study, the controller for floating offshore wind turbines is evaluated. This new tool has been used to repeat phase IV of the Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration (OC 3) within IEA Wind Task 23, regarding floating wind turbine modelling. The results of these simulations are presented in this paper...|$|R

Because {{the demand}} for {{renewable}} energy has increased significantly and <b>fixed</b> wind <b>turbine</b> supporting platform meets difficulty when used in about more than 30 m water depths, offshoring floating wind turbine supporting platform becomes an active research field. A numberof initial designs have been studied in literature based on a limited and simple requirement not considering whole-life cycle of the offshoring floating wind turbine platform.

40|$|Offshore wind is an {{attractive}} source of renewable energy. In order to harvest this abundant energy source wind turbine farms are needed. In order to extend the application of offshore <b>fixed</b> wind <b>turbine</b> (OFWT) in deep water where winds are stronger and steadier, there are research works on <b>fixed</b> wind <b>turbine</b> which is ongoing on larger water depth like 70 - 100 m. The focus in this thesis is analyses to support design of OFWT jacket substructure piled to the seabed, with a particular focus the modeling and ultimate capacity behavior of such facilities subjected to extreme wind and wave forces. During modelling, Genie and USFOS are applied to re-design and modify the finite element model of wind turbine substructure given by Aker Solutions. New design jacket substructures are both for the intermediate water depth 70 meters and 100 meters with the soil and pile modelling based on the Ekofisk data. Based on design load case, both of the static pushover analysis and API design code check is performed on the jacket substructure model to check the ultimate capacity. The pushover analysis is performed through nonlinear finite elemnt code USFOS. The API code check is based on hand calculation. The response of the jacket substructures under design load case is most interested in, which could indicate the critical position on jacekt, furthermore {{the effect of the}} direction and size of the wind and wave load. Meanwhile, through comaprission of results, the two methods could confirm each other, which could help to get the deeper understanding of ULS of offshore jacket structure. </p...|$|R

The main idea of this technique is to allow the turbine speed to change in accordance with hydraulic conditions, thus improving the overall unit efficiency. General technical aspects of ASO are further discussed with special emphasis on the energy and operational benefits that may potentially result from its application. In order to assess these benefits, annual operation of a hydropower plant associated to an irrigation reservoir has been simulated under different scenarios, with both adjustable and <b>fixed</b> speed. <b>Turbine</b> operating range proved to be wider with ASO. In addition, simulation results confirm that considerable energy gains are expected to be obtained...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} electrical parameters of the induction generator on the transient voltage stability of a <b>fixed</b> speed wind <b>turbine</b> connected to a simple grid; the dynamic behavior of a wind turbine connected to the grid is examined. The model of the <b>fixed</b> speed wind <b>turbine</b> has been developed in the simulation tool Matlab/Simulink. It’s composed by the induction generator, the shaft system, the aerodynamic model of the wind turbine rotor and the pitch control system. Using this model, a threephases fault is applied close to the wind turbine and cleared by disconnecting the faulted line. The effect of different electrical parameters of the induction generator on the voltage stability of this simple case is evaluated and discussed.

For each parameter, the terminal voltage and the generator rotor speed for different fault-clearing time are drawn. The obtained results will help to understand the transient stability phenomena in wind farms...|$|R
