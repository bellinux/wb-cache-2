40|$|Abstract. In this study, a new dilute {{sulphuric acid}} {{hydrolysis}} method {{was used for}} hemicelluloses secession from birch wood. The <b>furfural</b> <b>extraction</b> was investigated at different process temperatures (132 ºC- 162 ºC, increasing it by 5 ºC) and at constant amount of catalyst 3. 0 %, calculated on oven-dried wood. The greatest amount of furfural 11. 09 %, which is 75. 6 % from the theoretical possible yield, was formed at temperature 147 ºC after 90 min {{from the beginning of}} the birch wood pentoses monosaccharides dehydration process...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} suggest relations for estimating yield and properties of the improved light lubricating oil fraction produced from <b>furfural</b> <b>extraction</b> process by using specified regression. Mass transfer in mixer-settler has been studied. Mass transfer coefficient of continuous phase, mass transfer coefficient of dispersed phase and the overall mass transfer coefficient extraction of light lubes oil distillate fraction by furfural are calculated {{in addition to all}} physical properties of individual components and the extraction mixtures. The effect of extraction variables were studied such as extraction temperature which ranges from 70 to 110 °C and solvent to oil ratio which ranges from 1 : 1 to 4 : 1 (wt/wt) were studied. The results of this investigation show that the extract yield E decreased with decreasing solvent to oil ratio in extract layer and increased with increasing temperature. The fraction of total solvent in the raffinate phase decreased with increasing oil to solvent ratio in raffinate layer and increased with increasing temperature. Solvent to oil ratio in extract layer decreased with increasing temperature and increased with increasing solvent to charge oil ratio at constant temperature. Oil to solvent ratio in raffinate decreased with increasing temperature and increased with increasing solvent to charge oil ratio at constant temperature. Estimated functions are the best modeling function for prediction extraction data at various operating conditions. Mass transfer coefficient of continuous phase kc and mass transfer coefficient of dispersed phase kd are increased with increasing temperature and solvent charge to oil ratio at constant temperature. The over all mass transfer coefficient Kod is increased with increasing temperature and solvent to charge oil ratio; while Kod a is increased with temperature and decreased with solvent to charge oil ratio. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Furan, a {{possibly}} carcinogenic compound to humans, and furfural, {{a naturally}} occurring aroma compound, {{can be produced}} in heat - processed foods [1, 2]. Therefore, their simultaneous determination is important for food safety and quality purposes. Headspace techniques coupled to gas chromatography - mass spectro metr y (G C - M S) are often used to analyze process - induced compounds. Although headspace trap (H S Trap) extraction has been recently used for furan quantitation in bread crust [3], this technique has not been used for the simultaneous determination of furan and furfural before. This work presents an optimal design of experiments (O - D O E) approach using random blocks for the multicriteria optimization of H S Trap extraction of furan and furfural from sponge cake for their quantification by G C - M S. A bias related to sample preservation was observed during preliminary tests and eliminated in further assays by considering it as a blocking factor. A tailor - made experimental plan including four instrumental factors (i. e. thermostatting temperature and time, dry purge time, pressurization cycles) and two sample preparation variables (i. e. ratio of water and sample weight [dry basis] and total amount [dry basis]), considering the blocking factor was designed. Response surface models (P - value < 0. 0001; R 2 0. 974 for a ll mode ls) resulted in the identification o f most linear and so me quadratic terms and a few second order interactions as influencing the extraction of furan, furfural and their internal standards, d 4 - furan and d 4 - furfura l. Interestingly, one of the samp e preparation variables, namely the ratio of water and samp le weight (dry basis), showed no effect on <b>furfural</b> <b>extraction,</b> while different profiles for furan and d 4 - furan were observed regarding this factor. A set of optimal conditions for a H S Trap extraction method was, for the first time, success fully defined by using the optima design of experiments methodology and a desirability function...|$|E
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  3 after {{removing}} the basic nitrogen compounds, the yield of LPG did not change sensibly but the yield of gasoline increased dramatically. And when both the basic nitrogen and non-basic nitrogen, condensed aromatics were removed, the yields of LPG and gasoline increased from 14.38 and 28.90 to 20.21 and 36.97  %, respectively. In addition, the yield of diesel kept constant and even decreased after extraction treatment. This may because the competitive adsorption effect between nitrogen compounds, aromatic compounds, crackable components and themselves. Acid centers on catalysts must be provided for cracking during FCC process. Nitrogen compounds in shale oil are a key factor in competitive adsorption effect since they can strongly adsorb on the acid centers and hardly crack. Condensed aromatics have the ability of strong adsorption and dehydrogenation, which may form coke and therefore block the pore openings. Thus, the acid centers for crackable compounds are less since the existence of competitive adsorption effect. Once the strong adsorptive compounds are removed, the reactions of cracking compounds are no longer restricted. The oil sample using both furfural and HCl extracted contains the least amount of strong adsorptive compounds. So it has more acid sites for diesel further crack into gasoline. And the yield of coke decreased from 8.90 to 7.12  % after HCl extraction and then decreased to 5.55  % after <b>furfural</b> and HCl <b>extraction.</b> This is due to the different content of nitrogen compounds and condensed aromatics, which adsorb on acid centers and evolve toward coke in each oil sample.|$|R
