The difference between the two observations is in the excitation mechanism of the turbulence; the turbulence in the plasma trough detected by Ogo 5 is due to natural origins, whereas the ionospheric topside sounder makes the plasma wave turbulence artificially by submitting strong stimulation pulses. Electron density values in the plasma trough are deduced by applying the f sub Dn-f sub N/f sub H relationship obtained from the Alouette 2 experiment as well as by applying the condition for the wave-particle nonlinear interactions.

Instability caused by a gradient in either the ion-temperature profile or by shear in the parallel flow has been discussed extensively in the literature. In this paper, hydrodynamic plasma stability is investigated, real and imaginary frequency are quantified over a range of the shear parameter, the normalized wavenumber, and the ratio of density-gradient and ion-temperature-gradient scale lengths, {{and the role of}} <b>inverse</b> <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> is illustrated for the case of combined ion-temperature gradient and parallel-flow shear. We find that increasing the ion-temperature gradient reduces the instability threshold for the hydrodynamic parallel-flow shear instability, also known as the parallel Kelvin-Helmholtz instability or the D'Angelo instability. We also find that a kinetic instability arises from the coupled, reinforcing action of both free-energy sources. For the case of comparable electron and ion temperature, we illustrate analytically the transition of the D'Angelo instability to the kinetic instability as the shear parameter, the normalized wavenumber, and the ratio of density-gradient and ion-temperature-gradient scale lengths are varied and we attribute the changes in stability to changes in the amount of inverse ion Landau damping.

We describe the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the vorticity in a full 3 D system using the reduced MHD equations, density and parallel velocity moments for the energetic particles {{as well as the}} geodesic acoustic wave dynamics. A closure relation adds the Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects in the model. We apply the model to study the Alfven modes stability in TJ-II, performing a parametric analysis in a range of realistic values of energetic particle β (beta_f), ratios of thermal/Alfven velocities (Vth/VA 0), energetic particle density profiles and toroidal modes (n) including toroidal and helical couplings. The study predicts a large helical coupling between different toroidal modes and the destabilization of helical Alfven Eigenmodes (HAE) with frequencies similar to the AE activity measured in TJ-II, between 50 - 400 kHz. The analysis has also revealed the destabilization of GAE (Global Alfven Eigenmodes), TAE (Toroidal Alfven Eigenmodes) and EPM (Energetic Particle Modes). For the modes considered here, optimized TJ-II operations require a iota profile in the range of [0. 845, 0. 979] to stabilize AEs in the inner and middle plasma. AEs in the plasma periphery cannot be fully stabilized, although for a configuration with iota = [0. 945, 1. 079], only n= 7, 11, 15 AE are unstable with a growth rate 4 times smaller compared to the standard iota = [1. 54, 1. 68] case and a frequency of 100 kHz.

40|$|I study dusty plasma {{produced}} by electrostatically confining melamine formaldehyde microparticles in a radio-frequency glow discharge plasma. Dusty plasma {{is a mixture}} of particles of solid matter (dust), electrons, ions, and neutral gas atoms. The dust particles have a very high charge and a mass compared to the electrons and ions in the ambient plasma. As a consequence, a dusty plasma exhibits collective phenomena such as dust acoustic waves, crystallization, and melting. The discrete nature of dust particles gives rise to compressibility. In this thesis I report findings of four tasks that were performed to investigate dust acoustic waves, compressibility, and melting. First, the nonlinear phenomenon of synchronization was characterized experimentally for the dust acoustic wave propagating in a dust cloud with many layers. I find four synchronized states, with frequencies that are multiples of 1, 2, 3, and 1 / 2 of the driving frequency. Comparing to phenomena that are typical of the van der Pol paradigm, I find that synchronization of the dust acoustic wave exhibits the signature of the suppression mechanism but not that of the phaselocking mechanism. Additionally, I find that the synchronization of the dust acoustic wave exhibits three characteristics that differ from the van der Pol paradigm: a threshold amplitude that {{can be seen in the}} Arnold tongue diagram, a branching of the 1 : 1 harmonic tongue at its lower extremity, and a nonharmonic state. Second, to assess which physical processes are important for a dust acoustic instability, I derived dispersion relations that encompass more physical processes than commonly done. I investigated how various physical processes affect a dust acoustic wave by solving these dispersion relations using parameters from a typical dust acoustic wave experiment. I find that the growth rate diminishes for large ion currents. I also find that the compressibility, a measure of the coupling between the dust particles, have a strong effect on the wave propagation. Comparing the kinetic vs. hydrodynamic descriptions for ions, I find that under typical laboratory conditions the <b>inverse</b> <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> and the ion-neutral collisions contribute about equally to the dust acoustic instability. Third, I performed dust acoustic wave experiments to resolve a previously unremarked discrepancy in the literature regarding the sign of the compressibility of a strongly-coupled dust component in a dusty plasma. According to theories compressibility is negative, whereas experiments suggest that it is positive. I find that the compressibility is positive. This conclusion was reached after allowing for a wide range of experimental uncertainties and model dependent systematic errors. Finally, the polygon construction method of Glaser and Clark was used to characterize crystallization and melting in a single-layer dusty plasma. Using particle positions measured in a previous dusty plasma experiment, I identified geometrical defects, which are polygons with four or more sides. These geometrical defects are found to proliferate during melting. I also identify a possibility of latent heat involvement in melting and crystallization processes of a dusty plasma...|$|E
40|$|Energetic {{particle}} driven instabilities {{are important}} issues for fusion plasmas because they lead to energetic particle transport and losses. Especially for fusion burning plasmas, where the getic alpha particles play {{the leading role}} in the fuel plasma heating, the energetic particle driven instabilities should be suppressed or mitigated for the better confinement of the energetic alpha particles. Then, the understanding of the fundamental properties of energetic particle driven instabilities will contribute to the successful operation of the future fusion reactors. In this dissertation, the linear properties and the nonlinear evolution of energetic particle driven Alfvén eigenmodes and geodesic acoustic modes (GAM) are investigated using a hybrid simulation code for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and energetic particles. The interaction between energetic particles and Alfvén eigenmodes in reversed shear tokamak plasmas are investigated for different minimum safety-factor values. When the energetic particle distribution is isotropic in velocity space, it is demonstrated that the transition from low-frequency reversed shear Alfvén eigenmode (RSAE mode) to toroidal Alfvén eigenmode (TAE mode) takes place as the minimum safety-factor value decreases. The frequency rises up from a level above the GAM frequency to the TAE frequency. It is found that the energetic particles both co- and counter-going to the plasma current are transported by the TAE mode, whereas the co-going particles are primarily transported by the low-frequency RSAE mode. When only the co-passing particles are retained, the low-frequency RSAE modes are primarily destabilized. On the other hand, the high-frequency RSAE modes are destabilized when only the counter-passing particles are retained. The linear properties and the nonlinear evolution of energetic particle driven GAM (EGAM) are explored for the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasmas. Since the kinetic GAM frequency in LHD is close to that in tokamaks, tokamak type equilibria are examined with concentric magnetic surfaces, and with the safety factor profiles and the aspect ratio similar to the LHD plasmas. For the linear properties, it is found that the EGAM is a global mode because the fluctuation frequency is spatially constant, whereas the conventional local GAM frequency constitutes a continuous spectrum that varies depending on the plasma temperature and the safety-factor. The frequency of the EGAM intersects with the GAM continuous spectrum. The EGAM frequency is lower for the higher energetic particle pressure. The poloidal mode numbers of poloidal velocity fluctuation, plasma density fluctuation, and magnetic fluctuation are m= 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Good agreement is found between the LHD experiment and the simulation result in the EGAM frequency and the mode numbers. The EGAM spatial profile depends on the energetic particle spatial distribution and the equilibrium magnetic shear. The wider energetic particle spatial profile broadens the EGAM spatial profile. The EGAM spatial profile is wider for the reversed magnetic shear than for the normal shear. The nonlinear evolution of EGAM is studied using the hybrid simulation code. The frequency chirping of EGAM has been observed in LHD and tokamaks. The frequency chirping up and down is found to take place in the simulation results. In order to understand the physics mechanism of the frequency chirping, the energetic particle distribution function and the energy transfer rate from the particles to the wave are analyzed in 2 -dimensional velocity space of energy and pitch angle variable. In the linearly growing phase of the instability, two resonant regions, one destabilizing and the other stabilizing the EGAM, are found in the velocity space. In the nonlinearly frequency chirping phase, a pair of hole and clump is created at each resonant region. A hole and a clump correspond to negative and positive fluctuation, respectively in the distribution function. Then, two pairs of hole and clump are created, one at the destabilizing region and the other at the stabilizing region. The transit frequencies of the holes and clumps are compared with the EGAM frequency. The transit frequencies of the holes and clumps are in good agreement with the two branches of the EGAM frequency, one chirping up and the other chirping down. This indicates that the holes and clumps are kept resonant with the EGAM and the frequency chirping {{can be attributed to the}} hole-clump pair creation. The hole-clump pair creation and the associated frequency chirping are known to take place when the system is close to the instability threshold for the <b>inverse</b> <b>Landau</b> <b>damping.</b> However, the direct numerical simulations have so far been limited to the hole-clump pair creation at the destabilizing region in 1 -dimensional velocity space.

It is experimentally found that when quantity δ=w/kvth is nearly equal to the value deltamax, the nonthermal electron tails appear, where δmax is the argument corresponding to the maximum <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> rate. This result strongly suggests that the tail electrons are generated by the <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> of helicon wave...|$|R
40|$|Damping in 2 D and 3 D dilute gases is {{investigated}} {{using both}} the hydrodynamical approach and the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation. We {{found that the}} both methods are good for the Beliaev damping at zero temperature and <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> at very low temperature, however, at high temperature, the hydrodynamical approach overestimates the <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> and the HFB gives a better approximation. This result shows that the comparison of the theoretical calculation using the hydrodynamical approach and the experimental data for high temperature done by Vincent Liu (PRL 21 4056 (1997)) is not proper. For two-dimensional systems, we show that the Beliaev damping rate is proportional to k^ 3 and the <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> rate is proportional to T^ 2 for low temperature and to T for high temperature. We also show that in two dimensions the hydrodynamical approach gives the same result for zero temperature and for low temperature as HFB, but overestimates the <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> for high temperature.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{theory of}} dust-acoustic waves (DAWs) with <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> is studied in an unmagnetized dusty negative-ion plasma {{in the extreme}} conditions when the free electrons are absent. The cold massive charged dusts are described by fluid equations, whereas the two-species of ions (positive and negative) are described by the kinetic Vlasov equations. A Korteweg de-Vries (KdV) equation with <b>Landau</b> <b>damping,</b> governing the dynamics of weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive DAWs, is derived following Ott and Sudan [Phys. Fluids 12, 2388 (1969) ]. It is shown that for some typical laboratory and space plasmas, the <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> (and the nonlinear) effects are more pronounced than the finite Debye length (dispersive) effects for which the KdV soliton theory is not applicable to DAWs in dusty pair-ion plasmas. The properties of the linear phase velocity, solitary wave amplitudes (in presence and absence of the <b>Landau</b> <b>damping)</b> {{as well as the}} <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> rate are studied with the effects of the positive ion to dust density ratio (μ_pd) as well as the ratios of positive to negative ion temperatures (σ) and masses (m).

40|$|Abstract. We {{calculate}} the partial electron shear viscosity ηee limited by electronelectron collisions in a strongly degenerate electron gas {{taking into account}} the <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> of transverse plasmons. The <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> strongly suppresses ηee in the domain of ultrarelativistic degenerate electrons and modifies its temperature behavior. The efficiency of the electron shear viscosity in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutron stars is analyzed...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{approximate}} dynamical equations describing the behavior of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in the semiclassical limit and Yang-Mills equation, the kinetic equation for longitudinal waves (plasmons) is obtained. With the Ward identities the gauge invariance of obtained nonlinear <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> rate is proved. The physical mechanisms defining nonlinear scattering of a plasmon by QGP particles are analyzed. The problem on a connection of nonlinear <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> rate of longitudinal oscillations with damping rate, obtained in the framework of hard thermal loops approximation, is considered. It is shown that the gauge-dependent part of nonlinear <b>Landau</b> <b>damping</b> rate for the plasmons with zero momentum vanishes on mass-shell. Comment: 45 pages, LaTe...|$|R
