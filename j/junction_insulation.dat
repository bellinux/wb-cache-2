40|$|We present {{ferromagnetic}} Nb/Al 2 O 3 /Ni 60 Cu 40 /Nb Josephson junctions (SIFS) with an ultrathin Al 2 O 3 tunnel barrier. The junction fabrication was optimized regarding <b>junction</b> <b>insulation</b> and {{homogeneity of}} current transport. Using ion-beam-etching and anodic oxidation we defined and insulated the junction mesas. The additional 2 nm thin Cu layer below the ferromagnetic NiCu (SINFS) lowered interface roughness and ensured very homogeneous current transport. A high yield of junctional devices with jc spreads less than 2 % was obtained. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figures; VORTEX IV conference contribution; Submitted to Physica...|$|E
40|$|Wet etching, CF 4 and SF 6 {{reactive}} {{ion etching}} (RIE), RIE/wet hybrid etching, Cl-based RIE, ion milling, and liftoff techniques have been investigated for use in superconductive Nb/Al-Al 2 O 3 /Nb fabrication processes. High-quality superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junctions have been fabricated {{using a variety of}} these etching methods; however, each technique offers distinct tradeoffs for a given process an wafer design. In particular, it was shown that SF 6 provides an excellent RIE chemistry for low-voltage anisotropic etching of Nb with high selectivity to Al. The SF 6 tool has greatly improved the trilevel resist <b>junction</b> <b>insulation</b> process. Excellent repeatability, selectivity with respect to quartz, and submicron resolution make Cl 2 + BCl 3 + CHCl 3 RIE a very attractive process for trilayer patterning...|$|E
40|$|A {{semiconductor}} device and method of fabrication using LEGO (Lateral Epitaxial Growth over Oxide) for forming a SOI (Silicon On Insulator) structure (FIG. 1) having a localized buried dielectric layer (2). By patterning the buried dielectric layer, {{covered with a}} thin polysilicon layer by way of an epitaxial reactor a thick semiconductor layer (3) over the buried layer (2) is deposited. By rapid thermal annealing the polycrystalline overlayer {{is transformed into a}} single crystal layer (3). The buried oxide layer (2) provides a vertical dielectrical insulation, and deep diffused or trench regions (4, 5) provide lateral <b>junction</b> <b>insulation.</b> In this manner the SOI area (3) localized between the two deep diffused regions (4, 5) is fully insulated from the silicon substrate (1). This provides the following advantages: the process can be easily integrated in standard wafer fabrication equipment and processing techniques; the process is fully compatible with many existing technologies and their process flow; and low processing cost and low density defectivity should result...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} {{different}} types thermal bridges formed by beams for floor-wall junctions in reinforced concrete structures, with and without balconies, and the optimum configuration of the insulation layers to avoid heat loss were investigated as numerically. Both insulation between the walls and internal insulation was selected for floor-wall <b>junctions</b> and internal <b>insulation</b> was used for floor-wall junctions with balcony. Fluent package program was used to solve the temperature domain numerically. Results showed that high heat transfer rates were obtained {{in the region of}} thermal bridges for all building models. It was also obviously obtained that heat transfer rate decreased with making insulation on the beam surfaces...|$|R
25|$|When wire {{insulation}} disintegrates, it {{can result in}} an unintended electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple {{is used in the}} closed loop control of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing <b>junction</b> temperature. Failed <b>insulation</b> will also typically outgas, which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of the tilt casting process for TiAl alloys was investigated {{to achieve a}} tranquil mould filling and TiAl castings free of defects. Titanium alloys are very reactive in molten state, so they are widely melted in cold crucible, e. g. the Induction Skull Melting (ISM) furnace. Then the crucible holding the molten metal together with the mould is rotated to transfer the metal into the mould - ISM+ tilt casting. This paper emphasizes the effect of crucial parameters on mould filling and solidification of the castings during tilt casting. All crucial parameters, such as rotation rate, rotation profile, venting, initial mould temperature, casting orientation, feeder design, change of radius in 'T' <b>junction</b> and mould <b>insulation</b> have been discussed using numerical modeling data. Simulations were performed using a 3 D CFD code PHYSICA implemented with front tracking, heat transfer algorithms and a turbulence model (which accounts for an advancing solid front) ...|$|R
40|$|ICs can be powered {{directly}} when {{a supply}} voltage source capable of generating {{a multiple of}} the open circuit voltage of one pn-junction is available on a chip. Two schemes have been investigated for cascading photovoltaic cells on the chip. The structures can be made compatible with standard bipolar processes. Deep ion implantations have been used here to realize the multiple-junction structure. Power losses due to photocurrents originating from <b>insulation</b> <b>junctions</b> in the cascade can be kept to a minimum. The surface areas of two adjacent cells have to satisfy a definite relation to ensure the build-up of output voltage. Operating under sunlight conditions, 0. 6 mW/cm 2 has been generated in a cascade of three cells. With appropriate optical coatings on the silicon surface and optimized cell dimensions, {{it should be possible}} to generate a few milliwatts per cm 2. The structures may have applications in electronic circuits for glass fibres or can be used to power small CMOS circuits...|$|R
40|$|Scaling {{conventional}} {{floating gate}} Flash memory faces extremely difficult challenges today. Novel structures {{in both the}} gate stack and channel have been adopted for better scalability while maintaining memory performance. Gate stack designs with discrete-charge storage such as nanocyrstal (NC) memory have demonstrated significant enhancement in retention to programming time (tR / tPE) ratio at low program/erase (P/E) voltages and superior cycling lifetime. A 3 D finite-element method (FEM) simulation was performed to assess the bit-error-rate (BER) due to the non-uniformity in NC size, position, and density distribution below the 30 nm technology node. To address the parametric variation for discrete-charge storage, hybrid approaches with integration of organic molecules, atomic-layer-deposited oxide, and solution-based processes offer better uniform charging capability by utilizing the bottom-up self-assembly method and the monodispersion nature of the molecules. We investigated barriers with thermally and electrically stable redox-active ferrocine (Fc) and cobalt-porphyrin (CoP) as well as alkyl-chain molecules in a well-studied metaloxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure {{to better understand the}} charge storage, dielectric and interface properties of the molecular layers. For charge storage, the density of CoP can be readily controlled to achieve three distinguishable memory states in a single cell at room-temperature. In addition, we employed CoP as a resonant tunneling barrier (RTB) that further extends the retention-to-program time ratio and cycling lifetime. Hybrid solution-based layer-by- layer (LBL) deposition methods are demonstrated with various functional ends of the benzyl and alkyl molecules to create large area, electrically robust molecular <b>junctions</b> and <b>insulation.</b> Our approach provides a practical and promising way for the design and fabrication of silicon-based or all-organic nonvolatile memories...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{have been}} carried out in multi-family houses with two types of cavity brick walls: 150 - 50 - 150 mm (surface mass 525 kg/m 2) and 214 - 52 - 214 mm (surface mass 750 kg/m 2) calcium {{silicate}} bricks in combination with heavy concrete floors. The airborne and impact sound insulation have been determined in horizontal and in vertical direction, as well as the vibration transmission indices Kij across different <b>junctions.</b> The sound <b>insulation</b> has also been calculated, once using the measured vibration transmission indices and once using the calculated vibration transmission indices as input data in the calculation model. For sound transmission 2 ̆ 2 across cavities 2 ̆ 2 the calculated vibration transmission indices were found to considerably exceed the measured ones. Consequently, the calculated sound insulation in horizontal direction sketched a rather positive picture compared to the measured sound insulation when based on the calculated vibration transmission indices. Therefore a closer examination of the calculated values of Kij across cavity walls is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Schwann {{cells in}} the {{peripheral}} nervous systems extend their membranes to wrap axons concentrically and form the insulating sheath, called myelin. The spaces between layers of myelin are sealed by myelin <b>junctions.</b> This tight <b>insulation</b> enables rapid conduction of electric impulses (action potentials) through axons. Demyelination (stripping off the insulating sheath) has been widely {{regarded as one of}} the most important mechanisms altering the action potential propagation in many neurological diseases. However, the effective nerve conduction is also thought to require a proper myelin seal through myelin junctions such as tight junctions and adherens junctions. In the present study, we have demonstrated the disruption of myelin junctions in a mouse model (Pmp 22 +/-) of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) with heterozygous deletion of Pmp 22 gene. We observed a robust increase of F-actin in Pmp 22 +/- nerve regions where myelin junctions were disrupted, leading to increased myelin permeability. These abnormalities were present long before segmental demyelination at the late phase of Pmp 22 +/- mice. Moreover, the increase of F-actin levels correlated with an enhanced activity of p 21 -activated kinase (PAK 1), a molecule known to regulate actin polymerization. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK normalized levels of F-actin, and completely prevented the progression of the myelin junction disruption and nerve conduction failure in Pmp 22 +/- mice. Our findings explain how abnormal myelin permeability is caused in HNPP, leading to impaired action potential propagation in the absence of demyelination. We call it "functional demyelination", a novel mechanism upstream to the actual stripping of myelin that is relevant to many demyelinating diseases. This observation also provides a potential therapeutic approach for HNPP...|$|R
