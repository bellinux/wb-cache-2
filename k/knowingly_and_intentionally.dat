25|$|Individual {{employees}} {{of a local}} government, including the highest-level executives of that body, have no power to bind the local government to a contract that is void due {{to one of the}} above scenarios. This is because the limitations on the power of the local government to contract are a matter of public record. As a general rule, the individual employee is immune from being sued for inadvertently entering into a void contract with a private party. However, this immunity does not extend to the intentional tort of fraud. If a local government employee <b>knowingly</b> <b>and</b> <b>intentionally</b> made a false representation to a third party that the local government would be bound to a particular contract, that employee could be sued for damages suffered by the third party's reliance on that false promise.|$|E
