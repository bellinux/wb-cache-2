500|$|The Margaritaville blender itself {{served as}} a metaphor for {{consumerism}} and the tendency of Americans to buy luxuries that they do not need. Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It {{was one of those things}} where we all screwed up and nobody really knows what's going on, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with buying shit like Margaritavilles." [...] The Margaritaville also serves {{as a metaphor for}} the housing bubble. Parker himself actually owns a Margaritaville, of which he said, [...] "It's pretty stupid because it really is just a blender".|$|E
500|$|Emma Thomas has co-produced all of {{his films}} (including Memento, in which she is {{credited}} as an associate producer). He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with the fact that}} he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at my ideas and flip them around in a way that's {{just a little bit more}} twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who claim}} it has {{symbolic}} meaning cannot explain {{what it would}} have meant. Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum notes that [...] "the engraving is at the point in the cave where the cave's orientation changes by 90 degrees" [...] and speculates whether the scratches were related to the location: [...] "It's almost like Clapham Junction, like it's showing an intersection. I'm speculating, but it does make you wonder whether <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with mapping, or saying: 'This is where you are'." [...] Francesco d'Errico, the director of research at CRNS, comments: [...] "It's in a fixed location so, for example, it could be something to indicate to other Neanderthals visiting the cave that somebody was already using it, or that there was a group that owned that cave." [...] Harrold Dibble comments that [...] "It takes more than a few scratches—deliberate or not—to identify symbolic behaviour on the part of Neanderthals." ...|$|E
60|$|I nodded, for I {{thought it}} better to assent, though I did not quite {{understand}} his dialect. I knew <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the church.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, some alarmist {{tale about}} {{somebody}} robbing father. I didn't quite {{make out what}} it was all about, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the pay-roll." ...|$|R
60|$|Walthew thought <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do {{with his}} arrival. He was no longer suspicious, but puzzled. He was among friends, but they had {{received}} him in a curious manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{never comes}} until the evening train," [...] another said. [...] "He always {{declares}} <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with cross lines not fitting in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Mother," [...] said Juliette. [...] "Leave them alone. Doubtless in {{time they}} will return. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the stars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I can {{see that}} <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with football, so we'll leave it at that. I suppose it's something like our quarter-back. And what's an international?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'There,' said I, 'if I didn't think <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with a}} woman. You {{are always}} running after some one, Rube. They will get you into a scrape some day.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Unsure of his abilities, {{and often}} incompetent, Jack can't {{figure out why}} he keeps getting promoted. Could <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with his father (George Coe) being an {{influential}} (but corrupt) Senator? ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"There," [...] said I, [...] "if I didn't think <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with a}} woman. You {{are always}} running after some one, Rube. They will get you into a scrape some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, May, I know it. Call it sin if you will--and my {{knowledge}} of <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with my present determination, for, weak though I am, and bad though you think me--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All men can try {{to carry}} out orders, Roger, {{but it is not}} all who can do it with intelligence. Doubtless, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the book {{learning}} that you have, and in which you were his instructor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a seasonable statute {{out of the}} testaments," [...] {{explained}} Burrows. [...] "It's {{ordered by}} the Pope or somebody. And <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the Zodiac I don't know exactly, but I think it was invented by the Egyptians." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really I don't know. I {{understood}} that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with a}} party, but I think {{the fact is that}} Mary was too lazy to look after the servants while they packed up." ...|$|R
6000|$|LUBIN [discovering Conrad's {{presence}} for {{the first}} time] Youre right: it was. I knew <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with women. My memory never deceives me. Thank you. Will you introduce me to this gentleman, Barnabas? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a {{good deal}} {{you will have to}} give up," [...] he told her. [...] "You're not afraid of our new and rugged country? But <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> offer--and we need such people as you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't worry, Mother dear. He didn't know I was {{questioning}} him. And I do love a mystery! All I {{learned was}} that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Canada. Whenever I {{talked about the}} prairie he looked so sad, and once I even thought I saw tears in his eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with poachers." [...] Fitzpiers {{was still}} so {{shaken by the}} sense of her danger that he was obliged to sit awhile, {{and it was not}} until Grace said, [...] "If I could only get my skirt out nobody would know {{anything}} about it," [...] that he bestirred himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather think <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with the}} law. If this out-of-the-way place, now, could furnish even a lubberly attorney, we might learn all about it. Harkee, Atwood; you must stand by to make Sir Wycherly's will, {{if he says}} any thing more about it--have you got the heading all written out, as I desired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, not exactly. But Mrs Hearn {{said she}} could {{understand}} there had been words {{between her and the}} squire. It couldn't be anything else, you know. Probably <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with that man, Crosbie." ...|$|R
50|$|The name’s {{meaning is}} unclear. Could <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with an}} early settler named “Wind”, or does the community’s Wendish past yield the name? The leaping {{greyhound}} (a Wendish symbol) in the coat of arms might offer a clue.|$|R
60|$|No, no, {{it was not}} lack {{of enthusiasm}} that killed the Whirlwind Campaign in Mariposa. <b>It</b> must <b>have</b> been <b>something</b> else. I don't just {{know what it was}} but I think <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the financial, the {{book-keeping}} side of the thing.|$|R
60|$|Miss Marchmont {{wanted her}} tea, but could never resist {{a last look}} at the Elgin Marbles. She looked at them sideways, waving her hand and muttering a word or two of salutation which made Jacob and the other man turn round. She smiled at them amiably. It all came into her philosophy--that colour is sound, or perhaps <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with music. And having done her service, she hobbled off to tea. It was closing time. The public {{collected}} in the hall to receive their umbrellas.|$|E
60|$|Now {{though you}} may not guess it, my father, I have told you this tale because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with my story; for {{scarcely}} had the matter been ended when messengers came, saying that Bulalio, chief of the People of the Axe, and his impi were without, having returned with much spoil from the slaying of the Halakazi in Swaziland. Now when I heard this my heart leapt for joy, seeing that I had feared greatly for the fate of Umslopogaas, my fosterling. Dingaan also was very glad, and, springing up, danced to and fro like a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I tell? I believe <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with that}} horrid man I told you of. You {{sent a letter}} upstairs this morning. I met Joseph on the landing, and took the letter to her myself. Why shouldn't I look at the postmark? Where was the harm in saying to her, 'A letter, mamma, from Wurzburg'? She {{looked at me as}} if I had mortally {{offended}} her--and pointed to the door, and locked herself in. I have knocked twice, and asked her to forgive me. Not a word of answer either time! I consider myself insulted. Let me go to Fritz." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] I said slowly, rummaging {{my memory}} half in vain, [...] "I {{remember}} <b>something</b> about <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with photography, hadn't it?...No, no, with the electric light....I can't exactly remember which. Will {{you tell me}} all about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I knew <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with cookin'-things," [...] {{answered}} the cowboy. [...] "Mr. Endicott {{told me to}} be careful and {{tell you not to}} shoot everything there was in the mountains, as he wanted to come out later for a shot or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear me out, sir," [...] {{said the}} archdeacon; [...] "I {{have here in}} my hands the last opinion given in this matter by Sir Abraham Haphazard. I dare say you have already heard of this;--I dare say <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with your visit here to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, signor, and I {{only tell}} you what was the report at Corfu. She {{appeared}} to be a swift craft, rowing a great many oars. Her movements certainly seem mysterious, as she has several times appeared off the coast. Two vessels which sailed from Cyprus, and were to have touched at Corfu, had not arrived there when I left, and they say that several others are overdue. I do not say that {{has anything to do with}} the strange galley, but it is the general opinion in Corfu that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it, and I am the bearer of letters from the governor to the seignory, praying that two or three war ships may at once be sent down to the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing--for you. But, then, {{you were}} born a pagan; I am trying laboriously to make myself one. I can take nothing for granted, I can enjoy nothing as it comes along. Beauty, pleasure, art, women--I have to invent an excuse, a {{justification}} for everything that's delightful. Otherwise I can't enjoy it with an easy conscience. I make up a little story about beauty and pretend that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with truth and goodness. I {{have to say that}} art is the process by which one reconstructs the divine reality out of chaos. Pleasure is one of the mystical roads to union with the infinite--the ecstasies of drinking, dancing, love-making. As for women, I am perpetually assuring myself that they're the broad highway to divinity. And to think that I'm only just beginning to see through the silliness of the whole thing! It's incredible to me that anyone should have escaped these horrors." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man {{had come}} to see me in {{connection}} with some silly society of which I am an enthusiastic member; he was a fresh-coloured, short-sighted young man, like a stray curate who was too helpless even to find his way to the Church of England. He had a curious green necktie and a very long neck; I am always meeting idealists with very long necks. Perhaps it is that their eternal aspiration slowly lifts their heads nearer and nearer to the stars. Or perhaps <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with {{the fact that so many}} of them are vegetarians: perhaps they are slowly evolving the neck of the giraffe so that they can eat all the tops of the trees in Kensington Gardens. These things are in every sense above me. Such, anyhow, was the young man who did not believe in fairy tales; and by a curious coincidence he entered the room when I had just finished looking through a pile of contemporary fiction, and had begun to read [...] "Grimm's Fairy tales" [...] as a natural consequence.|$|E
50|$|She however {{does not}} get on with Sue, and spends little time with Joanna. She left the {{hospital}} with Peter, the Irish director who took her to Toronto. However, soon after, she died of unknown causes; Guy, in the post-series 2 special, said <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with a moose.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know!" [...] {{burst out}} Mr. Jones with amazing heat. [...] "That hotel-keeper {{tried to talk}} to me once of some girl he had lost, but I told him I didn't want to hear any of his beastly women stories. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with you, had it?" ...|$|R
50|$|Tourists {{from all}} over Greece, Europe and the world visit Cephalonia. It is a popular {{vacation}} destination for many Italians, due to its proximity to Italy. As {{one of the largest}} islands in Greece, it is well-equipped to handle the influx of tourists during the summertime and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> offer to everyone.|$|R
