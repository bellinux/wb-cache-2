5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E

This article provides a framework for both analyzing <b>flow</b> <b>through,</b> and for evaluating whether or not <b>flow</b> <b>through,</b> properly defined, occurs in the long distance telecommunications industry. We focus on the effects of changes in switches access charges on domestic long distance prices for the largest long distance carriers in the late 1990 s. Utilizing a double bootstrap technique uniquely suited to this problem, we find <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> occurred over the sample period.

5|$|Larrys Creek flows {{south from}} the {{dissected}} Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. It rises in Cogan House Township and flows south to Green Mountain. There it turns southwest and flows under the Cogan House Covered Bridge, {{which is on}} the National Register of Historic Places and one of only three remaining covered bridges in Lycoming County. At Buckhorn Mountain it turns south through Pennsylvania State Game Lands (SGL) No. 114 and <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> Mifflin and Anthony Townships, passing between Coal Mountain and Harris Point. From Mifflin Township it enters the borough of Salladasburg, where it receives the Second Fork, and just south of the borough the First Fork joins the creek. These two largest tributaries drain parts of Pine, Cogan House, Cummings, and Mifflin Townships (there are named streams in the Larrys Creek watershed in all but Pine Township). Piatt Township is the last municipality the creek <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> and it enters the West Branch Susquehanna River there.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water <b>flows</b> <b>through.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{flanked by}} areas prone to {{flooding}} between {{the point where it}} enters Schuylkill County and its mouth.

5|$|Scotch Run <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> the Scotch Valley. The stream flows {{over the}} lowest point between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain. Scotch Valley is {{relatively}} narrow, but becomes somewhat wider downstream of Mifflin Cross Roads. A pond or small lake {{is located at the}} stream's headwaters. A few patches of wetland on the National Wetlands Inventory are near the stream. It is flanked by a 100 year floodplain throughout its entire length.|$|E
5|$|Solar power towers use {{thousands}} of individual sun-tracking mirrors (called heliostats) to reflect solar energy onto a central receiver located {{on top of}} a tall tower. The receiver collects the sun's heat in a heat-transfer fluid that <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> the receiver. The U.S. Department of Energy, with a consortium of utilities and industry, built the first two large-scale, demonstration solar power towers in the desert near Barstow, California.|$|E
5|$|Sponges' cells absorb oxygen by {{diffusion}} {{from water}} into cells as water <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> body, into which {{carbon dioxide and}} other soluble waste products such as ammonia also diffuse. Archeocytes remove mineral particles that threaten to block the ostia, transport them through the mesohyl and generally dump them into the outgoing water current, although some species incorporate them into their skeletons.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, the {{macroscopic}} {{picture of}} the current <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> the diode involves electrons <b>flowing</b> <b>through</b> the n-type region toward the junction, holes <b>flowing</b> <b>through</b> the p-type region {{in the opposite direction}} toward the junction, and the two species of carriers constantly recombining {{in the vicinity of the}} junction. The electrons and holes travel in opposite directions, but they also have opposite charges, so the overall current is in the same direction on both sides of the diode, as required.|$|R
5|$|The Forrest H. Duttlinger Natural Area {{is located}} on Hammersley Fork. Most of the stream <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> this natural area. It is a 1521-acre area that {{includes}} a 158-acre area of old-growth hemlock trees. The Hammersley Wild Area is also located in the watershed. The stream's watershed is a Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory Biological Diversity Area. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection also classifies the watershed as an exceptional-value area.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> the Somerset Levels to {{the east}} of the Polden Hills. It rises in hills near the {{southern}} border of the county, <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> Bruton, where it is joined by the River Pitt, and on through Baltonsborough. The lower reaches have been diverted into a channel that joins the Parrett at Burnham-on-Sea in Bridgwater Bay. There is a raised bog in the central Brue valley and the surrounding area is a mosaic of swamps, meres and alder woodland. The River Parrett rises in the hills around Chedington in Dorset and flows northwestwards past Aller, Somerset, and through the Somerset Levels to Bridgwater, after which it becomes an estuary with its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The river has a tidal bore, similar to that in the River Severn. The Somerset Levels are only a few feet above sea level and liable to flooding. They are drained by ditches and channels that drain into the Parrett including the King's Sedgemoor Drain, just south of the Polden Hills.|$|E
5|$|The River Parrett <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> the {{counties}} of Dorset and Somerset in South West England, from its source in the Thorney Mills springs in the hills around Chedington in Dorset. Flowing northwest through Somerset and the Somerset Levels to its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea, into the Bridgwater Bay nature reserve on the Bristol Channel, the Parrett and its tributaries drain an area of – about 50per cent of Somerset's land area, {{with a population of}} 300,000.|$|E
