25|$|Type 2 episodic ataxia (EA2) is {{characterized}} by acetazolamide-responsive attacks of ataxia with or without migraine. Patients with EA2 may also present with progressive cerebellar atrophy, nystagmus, vertigo, visual disturbances and dysarthria. These symptoms last from hours to days, in contrast with EA1, which lasts from seconds to minutes. Like EA1, attacks can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress, but also by coffee and alcohol. EA2 is caused by mutations in CACNA1A, which encodes the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel CaV2.1, and is also the gene responsible for causing spinocerebellar ataxia type-6 and familial hemiplegic migraine type-1. EA2 is {{also referred to as}} episodic ataxia with nystagmus, hereditary paroxysmal cerebellopathy, familial paroxysmal ataxia and acetazolamide-responsive hereditary paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia (AHPCA). There are currently 19 mutations associated with EA2, though only 3 have been characterized electrophysiologically, table 2 and figure 2. Of these, all result in decreased current through these channels. It is assumed that the other mutations, especially the splicing and frameshift mutations, also result in a drastic decrease in CaV2.1 currents, though {{this may not be the}} case for all mutations. CACNA1A is heavily expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum where it is involved in coupling action potentials with neurotransmitter release. Thus, decrease in Ca2+ entry through CaV2.1 channels is expected to result in <b>decreased</b> <b>output</b> from Purkinje cells, even though they will fire at an appropriate rate. Alternatively, some CACNA1A mutations, such as those seen in familial hemiplegic migraine type-1, result in increased Ca2+ entry and, thereby, aberrant transmitter release. This can also result in excitotoxicity, as may occur in some cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type-6.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, a few hyperkinesias such as Huntington’s chorea, post-hemiplegic choreoathetosis, Tourette’s syndrome, and {{some forms of}} both tremor and {{dystonia}} were described in a clinical orientation. [...] However, the common pathology was still a mystery. [...] British neurologist William Richard Gowers called these disorders “general and functional diseases of the nervous system” in his 1888 publication entitled A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System. It {{was not until the}} late 1980s and 1990s that sufficient animal models and human clinical trials were utilized to discover the specific involvement of the basal ganglia in the hyperkinesia pathology. In 1998, Wichmann and Delong made the conclusion that hyperkinesia is associated with <b>decreased</b> <b>output</b> from the basal ganglia, and in contrast, hypokinesia is associated with increased output from the basal ganglia. This generalization, however, still leaves a need for more complex models to distinguish the more nuanced pathologies of the numerous diverse hyperkinesias which are still being studied today.|$|E
2500|$|Older, small breeds of {{dogs are}} prone to {{congestive}} heart failure due to degeneration of the mitral valve. This condition {{is known to be}} inherited in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. [...] Degenerative valve disease is {{the most common form of}} heart disease in dogs. [...] Mitral insufficiency leads to turbulent blood flow and increased pressure in the left atrium. This causes increased pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and pulmonary edema (a build-up of fluid in the lungs). [...] <b>Decreased</b> <b>output</b> of blood by the left ventricle causes the body to compensate by increasing sympathetic tone and activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). [...] Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased peripheral vascular resistance and increased heart rate and contractility of the heart muscle. [...] Chronic elevation of sympathetic tone damages the heart muscle. [...] Activation of the RAAS results in increased retention of water and sodium by the kidneys, vasoconstriction, and other effects that result in increased blood volume. [...] It also results in an increase in diastolic pressure and leads to pulmonary edema. Treatment for congestive heart failure has historically focussed on two types of drugs that address these concerns: diuretics (especially furosemide), which decrease blood volume, and ACE inhibitors, which interrupt the RAAS. Recently, pimobendan - which increases the force with which the heart muscle contracts, and is also a vasodilator - is being more widely used in the treatment of congestive heart failure caused by valvular disease. A major veterinary study, called the QUEST study (QUality of life and Extension of Survival Time), published in September 2008 found that dogs with congestive heart failure receiving pimobendan plus furosemide had significantly better survival outcomes than those receiving benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) plus furosemide. However, ACE inhibitors and pimobendan have different mechanisms of action, and many veterinary cardiologists recommend they be used concurrently.|$|E

50|$|Globus pallidusFrom recent studies, {{it is now}} {{thought that}} hemiballismus can be {{associated}} with a <b>decreased</b> <b>output</b> of the globus pallidus.

In addition to a decreased firing rate, degenerative neurological disorders that cause patients to exhibit hemiballistic movements show a marked decrease in the globus pallidus mass as well. Increases in activity in this area causes there to be an inhibition of the motor thalamus. This causes cortical activation and thus a movement inhibition. In the case of hemiballismus, the opposite occurs, leading to the characteristic large, irregular movements.|$|E

It is widely believed by economists that trade diversion is harmful to consumers.The dynamics of trade diversion was described by Ravshanbek Dalimov in 2009. He used similarity of trade flows to the flux of gas or liquid stimulated by the pressure difference, while the flows of trade flows are stimulated by the price difference. This allowed use of Navier-Stokes equations for the interregional dynamics of trade flows.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} {{epilepsy}} may be brought on {{due to a}} splice site mutation.In addition to a mutation in a stop codon, a splice site mutation on the 3' strand {{was found in a}} gene coding for cystatin B in Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy patients. This combination of mutations was not found in unaffected individuals. By comparing sequences with and without the splice site mutation, investigators were able to determine that a G-to-C nucleotide transversion occurs at the last position of the first intron. This transversion occurs in the region that codes for the cystatin B gene. Individuals suffering from Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy possess a mutated form of this gene, which results in <b>decreased</b> <b>output</b> of mature mRNA, and subsequently decreases in protein expression.|$|E
50|$|A {{decrease}} in volume or pressure is a nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone {{production in the}} hypothalamus, which exerts its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. Through unknown mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water, as well as urea (BUN), calcium, uric acid, and bicarbonate. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of {{salt and water retention}} is <b>decreased</b> <b>output</b> and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (< 20 mEq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. This generally leads to a BUN:Cr ratio > 20 and a fractional excretion of Na of < 1% and an elevated urine osmolarity.|$|E
