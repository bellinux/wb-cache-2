50|$|The {{gudgeon pin}} is {{typically}} a forged short <b>hollow</b> <b>rod</b> {{made of a}} steel alloy of high strength and hardness that may be physically separated from both the connecting rod and piston or crosshead. The design of the gudgeon pin, {{especially in the case}} of small, high-revving automotive engines is challenging. The gudgeon pin has to operate under some of the highest temperatures experienced in the engine, with difficulties in lubrication due to its location, while remaining small and light so as to fit into the piston diameter and not unduly add to the reciprocating mass. The requirements for lightness and compactness demand a small diameter rod that is subject to heavy shear and bending loads, with some of the highest pressure loadings of any bearing in the whole engine. To overcome these problems, the materials used to make the gudgeon pin and the way it is manufactured are amongst the most highly engineered of any mechanical component found in internal combustion engines.|$|E

This study had as second aim to fix the locking errors, commom place in interlocking nails, once polyamide 12 allows perforation in any direction by orthopaedic screw. Six groups were used: G 1 - eight whole swine femurs; G 2 - eight whole swine femurs with drilled medullary canal; G 3 - two solid polyamide 12 rods; G 4 - two hollow polyamide 12 rods; G 5 - eight osteotomized drilled swine femurs with a solid polyamide 12 rod implanted in the medullary canal and locked by four 316 L stainless steel screws; and G 6 - similar to G 5 but using <b>hollow</b> <b>rods</b> instead of solid ones.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} the two bio-inspired approaches, confinement and additives, to manipulate the crystallization of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. The first experimental chapter deals with the investigation of calcium phosphate rods grown in confined environments in the absence and presence of polyaspartic acid. Although similar results were obtained in the absence and presence of the additive, growing calcium phosphate in confinement allowed formation of polycrystalline rods with an orientation comparable to bone. This demonstrated that confinement may play a more significant role in bone formation than previously anticipated. The second chapter deals with the effect of positively charged additives on the crystallisation of CaCO 3. Although neglected before in literature, this chapter demonstrates that positively charged additives {{have a profound effect on}} the crystallisation of CaCO 3 changing the morphology to films and fibers. This morphology change was linked to a phase separation process, forming hydrated amorphous droplets of calcium carbonate by a carbonate-polymer interaction, which had the tendency to coalesce and form films. Fiber formation was attributed to oriented attachment of anisotropic particles due to unequal distribution of charge. In the third chapter, based on bone, the mineralisation of collagen by CaCO 3 was investigated. By formation of a highly hydrated liquid-like amorphous phase of CaCO 3, it was possible to infiltrate the nanoscale gaps of collagen. After crystallisation, nanocrystals of calcite and vaterite were formed, 5 nm thick, but randomly oriented, demonstrating collagen templates the shape but not the orientation of the crystals. In a final chapter <b>hollow</b> <b>rods</b> of CaCO 3 were formed by templating them inside membrane pores. The influence of time, pore size, additives and surface chemistry was investigated.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a disease}} that affects the regulation of a person?s blood glucose levels. Fully implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) {{has the potential to}} improve diabetes management by improving patient compliance and more importantly, providing patients with a more detailed trend of their glucose level on a daily basis. One such approach {{in the development of a}} CGM device is the use of the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) in a competitive glucose binding assay. The current set back to these ConA based assay has to do with its stability, and sensitivity. Furthermore, current CGM devices face longevity issues due to the nature of the implant and attack from the immune system. Therefore, the overall goal of the project is to develop a fully implantable, minimally invasive CGM device that would overcome issues pertaining to longevity, stability and sensitivity. Towards this goal, the current work aimed to first develop a non-aggregative thermally stable glucose sensing assay. First, ConA?s thermal stability at body temperature (37 ?C) was evaluated and based on the resulting instability, ConA was modified with poly (ethylene glycol) chains to improve its thermal stability at 37 ?C. Results showed that the presence of these PEG chains improved ConA?s thermal stability without significantly hindering its ability to bind to a competing ligand and sense changes in glucose concentrations within the physiologically relevant range. Next, this worked characterized the sensitivity and FRET efficiency of the newly modified ConA based assay, paired with the recently introduced monovalent competing ligand, mannotetraose. These characteristics was compared to current traditional ConA/dextran based glucose sensing assay. It was determined that across the desired glucose concentration range of 0 to 600 mg/dL, the new PEGylated ConA/mannotetraose based assay had improved sensitivity and FRET efficiency when compared to a PEGylated ConA/dextran based assay. Finally, this work aimed to encapsulate the modified assay within the proposed biocompatible membrane, PNIPAAm, and evaluate its ability to sense changes in external glucose concentration. To accomplish this, different encapsulation techniques such as calcium carbonate microspheres, alginate microspheres and layer by layer (LbL) deposition on PNIPAAm copolymer AMPS (AMPS-PNIPAAm) hydrogels were investigated to achieve minimal leaching without significantly impacting the glucose sensing of the assay within a <b>hollow</b> <b>rod</b> shaped membrane. The work also investigated the modification of the assay to increase the size of the smaller assay component as an alternative means to try and retain the assay within the biocompatible membrane. The deposition of LbL on the inner wall of the AMPS-PNIPAAm rods proved to be more efficient with an approximate 50 % change in FRET signal for changes in glucose concentration ranging from 0 to 600 mg/dL and a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of ~ 10 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{transition from}} vesicles to inverted hexagonally packed (<b>hollow)</b> <b>rods</b> was studied for asymmetric diblock copolymers of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) in dilute solutions. The self-assembled aggregates were {{prepared by the}} addition of water to the copolymer solutions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to induce the aggregation of the PS blocks, and the morphological transition was induced by an increase in the water content. Many intermediates, such as vesicles with hollow regions in the wall running parallel to the surfaces, as well as various quasihexagonal structures, were trapped. The mechanism of the transition involves a thickening of the vesicle walls accompanied by the formation of the <b>hollow</b> <b>rods</b> in the walls and a decrease {{in the size of the}} original water core. Evidence is presented that the transition proceeds in three steps. In the first step, hollow regions form in the walls of the vesicles. The second step involves further thickening of the walls and some alignment of the rods in a hexagonal pattern leading to the formation of quasihexagonal structures. Finally, the fully developed structures of inverted hexagonally packed rods form. This mechanism, especially in the initial step, is different from those found either in polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) diblocks or in small molecule amphiphile systems, both of which involve fusion of vesicles. A comparison of the mechanisms is presented. Because of the ease of trapping of intermediates, the present study of the morphological transition may improve our understanding of the later stages of the process of the biomembrane fusion and the lipid lamellar (L) to inverted hexagonal (HII) phase transition.
