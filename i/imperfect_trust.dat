60|$|This sort of trick, {{which may}} arise either from {{intellectual}} insufficiency or from an <b>imperfect</b> <b>trust</b> in one's own convictions, procured for Mr. Razumov {{a reputation of}} profundity. Amongst a lot of exuberant talkers, {{in the habit of}} exhausting themselves daily by ardent discussion, a comparatively taciturn personality is naturally credited with reserve power. By his comrades at the St. Petersburg University, Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov, third year's student in philosophy, was looked upon as a strong nature--an altogether trustworthy man. This, in a country where an opinion may be a legal crime visited by death or sometimes by a fate worse than mere death, meant that he was worthy of being trusted with forbidden opinions. He was liked also for his amiability and for his quiet readiness to oblige his comrades even at the cost of personal inconvenience.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} four related but self-contained essays, plus a short introductory chapter. The {{central theme}} is the rationality of agents 2 ̆ 7 following rules, {{as opposed to}} discretionary action, in contexts where optimal plans under rational expectations are time-inconsistent. The first essay examines the rationality of keeping promises and of trusting that promises will be kept. The second essay argues that social institutions are identical to agents 2 ̆ 7 following, and being believed to follow, rules of action, and uses this perspective to analyse the existence of property rights. The third essay uses the assumption of costly monitoring of worker malfeasance and hence <b>imperfect</b> <b>trust</b> to explain non-compensating wage-differentials between identical workers and equilibrium unemployment. The fourth essay presents a theory of strikes as the consequence {{of the rules of}} action followed by firm and worker to enforce a contingent wage contract under imperfectly symmetric information...|$|E

Further, a key challenge for multiagent systems {{is how to}} determine trust based on reports from multiple sources, who might themselves be trusted to varying degrees. Hence an ability to combine evidence-based trust reports {{in a manner that}} discounts for <b>imperfect</b> <b>trust</b> in the reporting agents is crucial for multiagent systems. This paper understands trust in terms of belief and certainty: A’s trust in B is reflected in the strength of A’s belief that B is trustworthy. This paper formulates certainty in terms of evidence based on a statistical measure defined over a probability distribution of the probability of positive outcomes. This novel definition supports important mathematical properties, including (1) certainty increases as conflict increases provided the amount of evidence is unchanged, and (2) certainty increases as the amount of evidence increases provided conflict is unchanged. Moreover, despite a more subtle definition than previous approaches, this paper (3) establishes a bijection between evidence and trust spaces, enabling robust combination of trust reports and (4) provides an efficient algorithm for computing this bijection. ...|$|E

Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers {{were randomly assigned to}} receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricul-tural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insur-ance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer’s own receipt of insur-ance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer’s social net-work and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, <b>imperfect</b> <b>trust</b> that promised payouts will be delivered and overweighting recent events.
