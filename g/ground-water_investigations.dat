40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to map the {{thickness}} and the configuration of the base of the unconfined aquifer in southeastern Sussex County, Delaware (figure 1). The unconfined aquifer provides much of the water used in this part of the State and is the first unit to be affected by pollution or waste disposal problems. Contour maps and geologic sections were prepared from available geologic, geophysical, and drillers ' logs and previously published reports and maps. Six test holes (figure 1) were drilled to supplement available data. The information in this report will be useful for water-resources planning and for locating water-supply wells in the unconfined aquifer.

40|$|The {{pediment}} area {{south of}} the Tortolita Mountains was studied by conventional field methods aided by remotesensing images. Investigations of the direction and intensity of fracturing of the quartz monzonite bedrock {{as well as the}} structural control of the surface drainage pattern provided the basis for analysis of the hydrologic setting. Water-level measurements, reconnaissance <b>ground-water</b> <b>investigations,</b> and a flow-net analysis were used to determine quantitative aquifer characteristics. Analyses with transparent overlays suggest the quartz monzonite constitutes a potential aquifer where a high degree of correlation exists between the locations of tectonic features, bedrock-controlled stream channels, and productive water wells. The fractured aquifer of the pediment area is recharged by infiltration of surface water through the course sediments of ephemeral stream channels. The Cañada Agua is the major ephemeral stream draining the southeastern section of the Tortolita Mountains. Numerous water wells in a major structural depression traversed and recharged by the Canada Agua serve most of the residents of the pediment area...|$|E
40|$|Title: <b>Ground-Water</b> <b>Investigations</b> for Siting the Superconducting Super Collider in North-eastern Illinois. Abstract: The Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) {{study area}} {{comprises}} 36 townships in Kane County and portions of Cook, De Kalb, Du Page, Kendall, and Will Counties. An inventory and mass measurement of water levels in 389 private domestic wells was {{conducted during the}} sum-mer of 1986. Potentiometric surface maps constructed from these data indicate that {{the general direction of}} ground-water movement is to the southeast and toward cones of depression resulting from subdivision pumpage in north-central Kane County. Monthly water-level measurements have been made since December 1984 at 26 individual piezometers and at nine nested piezom-eters. The data show that vertical head gradients of from 0. 14 to 3. 35 feet per foot exist between various aquifers. An analysis of water samples collected during the mass measurement and a re-view of water analyses from public water supply wells indicate that the ground water likely to be encountered at the SSC site is a calcium-magnesium bicarbonate. The water is moderately mineralized and would require softening for domestic uses. Ground-water use projections for th...|$|E

40|$|A gravity {{survey was}} {{conducted}} {{as part of a}} <b>ground-water</b> <b>investigation</b> covering 400 mi 2 (1, 000 km 2) in Outagamie County, northeastern Wisconsin. The objective of the gravity survey was to supplement bedrock topography data obtained from well logs and seismic refraction profiles. The gravity method was chosen as it is a rapid and low-cost reconnaissance technique, and conditions in the study area were favorable for a successful gravimetric survey. The simple Bouguer gravity values were referenced to a local base station as only relative gravity values were required. The data were interpolated to a regular grid by an inverse-distance weighted average algorithm. The gravity residual was derived using a five-ring inverse weighted filtering routine. The residual map accurately reflects the major topographic features of the bedrock surface. A two-dimensional geologic model fitted to the residual data agrees well with the simple flat plate approximation used to obtain quantitative estimates of glacial drift thickness. Estimates of drift thickness from the gravity data also agree well with bedrock depths obtained from well logs. The most productive drift aquifers are restricted to the major bedrock valleys. Gravity data were coupled with seismic refraction and well data to produce a bedrock elevation map, from which it is possible to predict the extent and distribution of the major drift aquifers...|$|R

Stream-aquifer {{relations}} in a 31, 835 -square-mile area {{in parts of}} Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina were evaluated in support of <b>ground-water</b> modeling <b>investigations</b> using hydrograph-separation and a linear-regression analysis of streamflow duration curves. The study area consists of three major river systems—the Altamaha-Satilla-St Marys, Salkehatchie-Savannah-Ogeechee, and Suwannee—that interact with the underlying ground-water system to varying degrees largely based {{on the degree of}} incision of a river into an aquifer and on topography. Average mean-annual baseflow in the three basins ranged from about 42 to 69 percent of total mean-annual streamflow during 1981, 1997, and 2000. Baseflow provided a larger percentage of streamflow at sites in the Salkehatchie-Savannah-Ogeechee River Basin than in the other two basins, which probably results from their proximity to the upper Coastal Plain where there is greater topographic relief and interconnection between streams and aquifers. Linear-regression analysis of baseflow and streamflow duration indicate that the 65 -percent flow duration is a reasonable estimate of mean-annual baseflow...|$|R

The Georgia Geologic Survey Branch of the Environmental Protection Division, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, {{established}} the North Georgia Hydrogeology Program {{to study the}} occurrence and movement of ground water in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge Physiographic Provinces. Many previous investigations on the ground-water resources of these areas have been descriptive in nature and lacking comprehensive data. To date, three research sites have been selected in the Piedmont Physiographic Province. The major purpose of these sites is to perform pumping tests to measure the area of influence and to determine the source of water that supplies the production wells. If {{the source of the}} water is known then steps can be taken to protect this vital resource from contamination. One research site is located in Lamar County, about 50 miles south of Atlanta and two miles northwest of Barnesville. <b>Ground-water</b> <b>investigations</b> conducted at the site will provide data on the response of observation wells to pumping. This information will be used by hydrogeologists, engineers and other professionals for future ground-water protection activities. Sponsored by U. S.

40|$|Detailed {{information}} on subsurface conditions {{is essential for}} the development and management of ground-water resources and the characterization and remediation of contaminated sites. Borehole geophysics provides a highly efficient means for the collection of such information. Recent advances in methods and equipment have greatly increased the ability of geoscientists to obtain subsurface information in <b>ground-water</b> <b>investigations</b> through the use of borehole-geophysical techniques. Portable geophysical loggers that are specifically designed for ground-water applications (fig. 1) are now available. The geophysical loggers are PC-based and have menu-driven software for the collection, real-time display, and subsequent analysis of digital log data. Drawworks for shallow investigations are highly portable, and some have plastic-coated logging cables for easy decontamination. Logging probes are available {{that can be used in}} boreholes with a diameter as small as 5 centimeters. Many probes are capable of collecting multiple parameters with a single logging run, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency of the logging operation and taking full advantage of the synergistic nature of geophysical log data. Figure 1. A PC-based geophysical logger with portable drawworks and plastic-coated logging cable in use at a contaminated ground-water site. Electromagnetic-induction logging replaced normal-resistivity logging in the oil industry many years ago. Induction probes recently have been designed for small-diameter monitoring wells. Induction logs can be collected in water-, air-, and mud-filled holes and through PVC casing. Major factors that affect induction-log response in sand-and-gravel aquifers are the concentration of dissolved solids in the ground water and the silt and clay content of the aquifer. Induction logs, which are commonly run in combinal ion with gamma logs, can be used to identify lithology and zones of electrically conductive contamination such as landfill leachate (fig. 2) and saltwater intrusion...|$|E

The taxonomy is a nested hierarchy of discrete elastic, sedimentary structures distinguished by the bounding surfaces created during their emplacement and rearrangement. The investigation and characterization of a specific ground-water flow system in elastic, sedimentary porous media can be improved by imposing a structural context on lithologie observations, geophysical measurements, head measurements, and hydraulic conductivity estimates. Globally-valid and transferable descriptions of structures in the taxonomy from modern exposures, outcrops, and densely sampled subsurface systems are modified to fit site-specific geologic observations and measurements. A specific procedure is developed for applying the taxonomy in the investigation and analysis of ground-water flow. The procedure quantitatively measures the hydraulic validity of alternative geologic interpretations of site-specific data under the taxonomy. The application of the taxonomy and procedure to a typical set of data types, densities, and quality is illustrated with data from a site of <b>ground-water</b> contamination <b>investigation...</b>|$|R

The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to characterize salvageable water resources in the semi-arid Tucson basin and to evaluate appropriate treatment and control methods and management procedures for reuse of these salvageable waters. A preliminary inventory of salvageable water resources in the Tucson basin indicated a conservatively estimated annual total of 30, 000 acre-feet available, as follows: municipal system effluents, 25, 000 acre-feet; industrial cooling effluents, 1, 000 acre-feet; urban runoff, 2, 000 acre-feet; and industrial processing waters and other minor sources, 2, 000 acre-feet per year. The City water utility has ample information on hand regarding quality of municipal effluents; data collected during this study are sufficient to define representative quality of industrial effluents; and presently developed processes evidently are adequate for the control and treatment of salvageable waters. However, little was known of the quality of urban runoff in this semi-arid environment, and efforts were directed toward exploratory sampling and analysis as indicators of potential problem areas in runoff quality. A <b>ground-water</b> recharge <b>investigation</b> at the Rillito Creek recharge site near Tucson produced a mathematical model which can be used to represent fluctuations of ground-water levels resulting from line-source recharge. Findings can be applied to alternative management schemes in the utilization or storage of salvaged waters. Initial formulation of management alternatives by examination of local salvaged-water subsystems appeared not to require elegant mathematical solution but rather an improved system framework defining community objectives and criteria for salvaged water allocation...|$|R

Field hydrogeological investigations including mapping of the water table, identification of hydrogeologic boundaries, and calculating the thickness of the fresh-water lens were conducted in northwestern Yucatan, Mexico, from June, 1987, to April, 1989. As a result of these <b>investigations,</b> <b>ground-water</b> flow was simulated successfully using a numerical model. Results show that the water table under most of northwestern Yucatan is less than 2 m above mean sea level and that normal variations between the dry/wet season are on the order of 0. 5 m. The thickness of the freshwater lens (estimated from limited observations and the Ghyben-Herzberg relation) ranges from a low of 18 m near the coast, to over 80 m in the southeastern section of the study area. Numerical simulations of aquifer characteristics show that although the study area consists of a well-developed karst system, it can be treated as equivalent porous media. The numerical model that best corresponds to field measurements is a two-layer system with a deep layer of high hydraulic conductivity (1 m/s) overlain by a layer of lower hydraulic conductivity (0. 1 m/s) ...|$|R
40|$|Geotechnical {{engineers}} {{have been using}} vegetation indicators of terrain conditions for engineering purposes in southern Saskatchewan. This terrain evaluation technique was based on empirical observations {{and there was a}} need for a formal investigation of the characteristics of vegetation indicators. This project undertook this formal investigation. Documented information pertaining to vegetation-terrain relationships was consolidated from publications in botany, plant ecology, plant physiology, geobotany and geology. This information is presented to provide a basic understanding of the characteristics of vegetation indicators. Subsequently, a field study area was selected on the North Saskatchewan River near Langham, Saskatchewan, in order to study the characteristics of vegetation-terrain relationships and to assess the applicability of vegetation indicators of terrain conditions for engineer in purposes in southern Saskatchewan. Field investigations sought to describe the total physical environment of the study area. These investigations involved aerial photography using several formats, terrain evaluation, geodetic surveying, subsurface <b>investigations,</b> <b>ground-water</b> studies, climatic studies and vegetation studies. The result of the investigations was a description of the study area in terms of geomorphology, stratigraphy, ground-water regime, climate and vegetation. The correlation between vegetation and environment was then analyzed. As a result of this analysis, vegetation indicators of terrain conditions are recommended as a complimentary technique to traditional forms of evaluating the physical environment for engineering purposes in southern Saskatchewan...|$|R
40|$|It {{is evident}} that several cities in China have {{experienced}} a variety of global impacts. Beijing for instance, has become synonymous with mass-migration over the years. The immense scale of projected rural migration, the unmanageable intervention of new housing urban developments, and {{the high levels of}} air pollution in Beijing have become a global dilemma. In order to alleviate Beijing 2 ̆ 7 s critical ecological conditions, the introduction of 2 ̆ 2 new lungs 2 ̆ 2, as an urban environmental design to the city should be examined. This thesis project illustrates how urban productive landscape and bike infrastructure can be essential in urban development through the implementation of an innovative dynamic Urban Eco-Filter that would respond to the active circumstances of the city of Beijing. The enormous amount of air pollution, ground-water depletion/pollution and particularly the lack of an ecological footprint are some of the challenges the city of Beijing continually battles. As a potential solution to assist the citizens of Beijing, who continually struggle to maintain a better quality of life, this thesis project proposes a new Urban Eco-Filter approach that will serve as a green corridor incorporating environmental resources. This innovative urban infrastructure would become the exceptional and unquestionable tool to create a holistic environment including productive urban landscape, bike infrastructure and sustainable themes. As a solution this project proposes the implementation of an elevated eco-network infrastructure {{in the center of the}} city of Beijing. In addition, the proposal would focus on developing a new productive landscape connection prototype at the Guomao Bridge on the 3 rd Ring Road. The procedures analyzed are: case observation, case studies, strategies of 3 -D modeling, and the design and qualitative investigation through workshops. In order to further validate the proposed solution, an in depth evaluation of the research techniques is necessary. It is indispensable to analyze the existing hazardous urban conditions and consider the uncontrollable growth of metropolitan cities, while introducing new ecological bike infrastructure. With the limited environmental footprint, constant amount of air pollution and the deficiency of <b>ground-water,</b> the <b>investigation</b> of a new Urban Eco-Filter is encouraged to enhance the social and environmental fabric of the city of Beijing...|$|R
