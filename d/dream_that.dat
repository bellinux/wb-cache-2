Around the same time, Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers; the Dev Phone 1 was a SIM- and hardware-unlocked version of the HTC <b>Dream</b> <b>that</b> came pre-configured for superuser access to the internal files of the phone, allowing users to completely replace the bootloader and operating system.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Ramayana by Valmiki, Trijata {{is described as}} an aged rakshasi (demoness) who is prominently featured in two incidents. The first {{takes place in the}} Sundara Kanda, the epic's fifth book. The kidnapped princess Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika of Lanka. The demon-king of Lanka, Ravana has ordered the raskshasis who guard Sita to convince her to marry him by any means possible, since Sita adamantly refuses and is still faithful to her husband Rama. After Ravana leaves, the rakshasis start to harass Sita to compel her to change her will. The aged Trijata intervenes and narrates a prophetic <b>dream</b> <b>that</b> predicts Ravana's doom and Rama's victory.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1934, deHavilland was offered a {{scholarship}} to Mills College in Oakland to pursue her chosen career as an English teacher. She was also offered the role of Puck in the Saratoga Community Theater production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's <b>Dream.</b> <b>That</b> summer, Austrian director Max Reinhardt came to California for a major new production of the same play to premiere at the Hollywood Bowl. After one of Reinhardt's assistants saw her perform in Saratoga, he offered her the second understudy position for the role of Hermia. One week before the premiere, the understudy Jean Rouverol and lead actress Gloria Stuart both left the project, leaving 18-year-old deHavilland to play Hermia. Impressed with her performance, Reinhardt offered her the part in the four-week autumn tour that followed. During that tour, Reinhardt received word that he would direct the Warner Bros. film version of his stage production, and he offered her the film role of Hermia. With her mind still set on becoming a teacher, deHavilland initially wavered, but eventually Reinhardt and executive producer Henry Blanke persuaded her to sign a five-year contract with Warner Bros. on November 12, 1934, with a starting salary of $200 a week.|$|E

5|$|On March 9, 1842, Francisco Lopez, {{the uncle}} of Antonio's second wife, Jacoba Feliz, took a rest under {{an oak tree}} in Placerita Canyon and had a <b>dream</b> <b>that</b> he was {{floating}} on a pool of gold. When he awoke, he pulled a few wild onions from the ground finding flakes of gold in the roots. Contrary to some portraits {{of him as a}} farmer who stumbled upon his discovery by dumb luck, Lopez had studied mineralogy at the University of Mexico and had been actively searching for gold. Evidence suggests that gold had previously been found in the area about thirty years prior, but the Lopez gold find was the first popularly documented incident in the area. This sparked a gold rush on a much smaller scale than the 1849 California Gold Rush. About 2,000 people, mostly from the Mexican state of Sonora, came to Rancho San Francisco to mine the gold.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{character of}} the ceremonies around the memorials changed as grieving took place and many individuals, inevitably, continued with their lives. Some early ceremonies around memorials {{were believed to be}} closely associated with spiritual events. The opening of the Menin Gate memorial, for example, inspired Will Longstaff's <b>dream</b> <b>that</b> led to the famous Menin Gate at Midnight painting, portraying the fallen dead rising and walking through the gateway, while the Cenotaph ceremonies were photographed in 1922, and believed by some to show the ghosts of the war dead. Indeed, early ceremonies at the London Cenotaph after the war were felt to be particularly emotional; commentators felt that by the late 1920s, the events were more formal and less fraught with emotional than previously. Initially foreign diplomats in Britain were expected to lay wreaths on Armistice Day; this requirement was reviewed in the 1930s. In Australia, there were initially many local ceremonies at memorials on Anzac Day specifically for bereaved mothers; by the 1930s, these had been discontinued and incorporated into the wider ceremonial occasion.|$|E
5|$|Veronica has a <b>dream</b> <b>that</b> {{she woke}} {{up in the middle of}} the winter with Logan, but she is plagued with visions of Madison. When she wakes up, she goes to the Hearst library, where Tim Foyle’s (James Jordan) girlfriend, Bonnie, asks her to {{investigate}} who slipped her RU-486, which caused a miscarriage. When Veronica presses Bonnie further, she reveals that Tim or Dick (Ryan Hansen) could be the father, although Tim has been very supportive. Veronica asks Logan point-blank whether Logan had sex with Madison over the winter, and he says yes, leading to a major fight, with Veronica saying she’ll never forgive him. Veronica speaks to Bonnie’s roommate, Phyllis (Toni Trucks), who reiterates that Tim is being very supportive. Veronica successfully breaks into Tim’s office to investigate before realizing she doesn’t have the password. After Keith comforts Veronica due to her breakup, she bugs Tim’s office.|$|E
