25|$|The vehicle {{identification}} number (VIN) plate, a unique serial number used to identify individual motor vehicles, {{had been removed from}} the car's dashboard and the door VIN sticker, but police retrieved the VIN from the bottom of its engine block. The investigators traced the SUV's last registered owner, and the female college student who sold the suspect the Pathfinder. Law enforcement officials recovered the suspect's pre-paid disposable cell phone's number from the cell phone of the seller, and ran it through a number of databases. They determined that the disposable phone had been used for calls to and from a Pakistani telephone number which they knew to be associated with Faisal Shahzad. The phone had also been used to call a fireworks store in rural Pennsylvania. They collected <b>his</b> <b>e-mail</b> address from an email which he sent to the seller’s computer.|$|E

He may also have occasionally prayed there but, {{for a period of}} ten years, he prayed several times a week at the Muslim Community Center in Silver Spring, Maryland, closer to where he lived and worked. He was regularly seen there by the imam and other members. His attendance at the Falls Church mosque was in the same period as that of Nawaf al-Hazmi and Hani Hanjour, two of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks, who went there from April 2001 to later in the summer. A law enforcement official said that the FBI will probably look into whether Hasan associated with the hijackers. A review of Hasan's computer and <b>his</b> <b>e-mail</b> accounts revealed he had visited radical Islamist websites, a senior law enforcement official said.|$|E

500|$|The male parishioner of Manchester, Vermont (in a diocese {{neighboring}} Robinson's) who had alleged the [...] "touching", {{was then}} {{reported to have}} said, during the investigating committee's telephone call with him, that the acts in question were two separate occasions of what felt to him like intentionally seductive arm-squeezing and back-stroking, although in a public setting. The man acknowledged that others might have regarded the two incidents as [...] "natural," [...] yet the incidents were disturbing to him nonetheless. The investigating committee's report also stated that man regretted having used the word [...] "harassment" [...] in <b>his</b> <b>e-mail,</b> and that man declined an invitation to bring formal charges.

500|$|Prior to the album's release, Idol {{was asked}} if he feared his new {{interest}} in technology would be seen as an attempt to co-opt cyberculture. Idol denied this, stating that his belief in the relevancy of cyberpunk culture was genuine, and that he didn't care what others thought of him. However, the reaction by the majority of the online community was openly hostile and suspicious of Idol's motives. It was reported that <b>his</b> <b>e-mail</b> account on the WELL received mail from angry computer users, and was occasionally flooded with e-mail spam to antagonise him. Idol was also cast by many as a naive, tech-illiterate poseur. The charge of illiteracy was not entirely false, as {{at the time of the}} album's release, Idol was still typing using the [...] "hunt and peck" [...] system, and needed notes to log onto the internet.|$|E

[...] Mr. Riva-Palacio wrote that American intelligence agencies coordinated field operations and even interrogated the detainees before Mexican authorities could do their own. According to Mr. Riva, this privileges led to the illegal spying which enabled American intelligence agencies to make a map of the Mexican political world, which (according to him) is demonstrated in many documents where the main concern is the political stability and future of Mexico, and the subsequent spying carried on Mr. Peña while he was running for office. He then criticized Mr. Calderón request to Mr. Peña to investigate the spying carried on <b>his</b> <b>e-mail</b> and his cabinet members e-mails and declared that Calderón should have done that when the first allegations of illegal spying came out in 2009-2010.

2500|$|Brower founded Friends of the Earth (FOE) in 1969, {{soon after}} resigning as {{executive}} director of the Sierra Club.

[...] FOE also benefited from the publicity generated by a series of articles in The New Yorker by John McPhee, later published as Encounters with the Archdruid, which recounted Brower's confrontations with a geologist and mining engineer, a resort developer, and Floyd Dominy, the director of the Bureau of Reclamation.
