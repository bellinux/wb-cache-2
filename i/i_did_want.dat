60|$|HYPATIA. Oh, I daresay it's vulgar; {{but theres}} no other word for it. I'm {{fed up with}} nice things: with respectability, with propriety! When a woman has nothing to do, money and respectability mean that nothing is ever allowed to happen to her. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> to be good; and <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> to be bad: <b>I</b> just <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> to be bothered about either good or bad: I {{want to be an}} active verb.|$|R
