METHODS: Seventy-two cases(78 eyes) with retinal holes were treated with 532 nm frequency-doubled laser. All the eyes were divided according to the quadrants of location of retinal holes {{and the size of}} retinal hole and existence of local retinal detachment accompanying retinal holes. Statistical analysis was made on these data. RESULTS: 1) The retinal holes were located in the upper quadrants of retina in 44 eyes and there were also retinal holes located in the lower quadrants of retina in 31 eyes(there were 3 eyes with retinal holes both located in the upper and lower quadrants of retina, which were not included in control group). The difference of photocoagulation effect between the two groups was statistically significant. 2) The retinal <b>holes</b> <b>diameter</b> ≤ 2 papilla diameter(PD) were present in 37 eyes, the <b>holes</b> <b>diameter</b> of retina > 2 PD were seen in 41 eyes, the difference of photocoagulation effect between the two groups was statistically significant. 3) Retinal holes without local retinal detachment were observed in 45 eyes, retinal holes with local retinal detachment were seen in 33 eyes, the difference of photocoagulation effect between the two groups was statistically significant.
