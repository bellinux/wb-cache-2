50|$|Postoperative {{autotransfusion}} {{is performed}} by connecting the double lumen autotransfusion suction line {{directly to the}} drain line placed {{at the conclusion of}} surgery. Postoperative autotransfusion begins in the operating room when the drain line is placed and the surgical site is closed. Typical postoperative cases are total knee and hip replacements. Autotransfusion is continued and is effective while the patient actively bleeds during the immediate postoperative phase of recovery. Autotransfusion is ended when bleeding is stopped or is significantly slow, and is discontinued by connecting an ordinary self draining device to the <b>drain</b> <b>line(s).</b> Available for postoperative autotransfusion are universal bifurcated connectors which can accommodate two <b>drain</b> <b>lines</b> of any size, these connectors can be attached to the standard ten foot double lumen suction line for postoperative use.|$|E

The manufacturer tries to reach an optimal balance between rapid decomposition (which requires shorter fibres) and sturdiness (which requires longer fibres). Compaction of toilet paper in <b>drain</b> <b>lines,</b> such as in a clog, prevents fiber dispersion and largely halts the breakdown process.|$|E

50|$|Maintaining {{the water}} seal is {{critical}} to trap operation; traps can and do dry out, and poor venting can suction or blow {{water out of the}} traps. This is usually avoided by venting the drain pipes downstream of the trap; by being vented to the atmosphere outside the building, the <b>drain</b> <b>lines</b> never operate at a pressure much higher or lower than atmospheric pressure. Plumbing codes usually provide strict limitations on how far a trap may be located from the nearest vent stack.|$|E
50|$|The field {{which is}} now widely {{considered}} one of the best playing surfaces in New Zealand received a renovation in 2012 by Mexted Performance Sport Surfaces. The park had a build-up of organic matter and contaminants so the surface was holding water and wasn’t draining away, affecting playability. Mexteds’ Contracts used a planer, to take 100mm off the playing surface in two 50mm passes, then re-levelled the sub-grade and installed new primary drainage in between the existing <b>drain</b> <b>lines.</b> The sand based park has a 250mm layer of dune sand and over the years a build-up of organic matter in the top 100mls has stopped the water from draining away. For the majority of times it rained, the surface would hold water. Mexteds introduced a new 50mm layer of clean turf sand.|$|E

Direct alterations in these environments can lead to species diversity reduction and also facilitate biological invasion processes.

40|$|An {{innovative}} interim {{surface barrier}} was constructed {{as a demonstration}} project at the Hanford Site's TY Tank Farm. The purpose of the demonstration barrier is to stop rainwater and snowmelt from entering the soils within the tank farm and driving contamination from past leaks and spills toward the ground water. The interim barrier was constructed using a modified asphalt material with very low permeability developed by MatCon{reg_sign}. Approximately 2, 400 cubic yards of fill material {{were added to the}} tank farm to create a sloped surface that will gravity drain precipitation to collection points where it will be routed through buried <b>drain</b> <b>lines</b> to an evapotranspiration basin adjacent to the farm. The evapotranspiration basin is a lined basin with a network of perforated <b>drain</b> <b>lines</b> covered with soil and planted with native grasses. The evapotranspiration concept was selected because it prevents the runoff from percolating into the soil column and also avoids potential monitoring and maintenance issues associated with standing water in a traditional evaporation pond. Because of issues associated with using standard excavation and earth moving equipment in the farm a number of alternate construction approaches were utilized to perform excavations and prepare the site for the modified asphalt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{specialized}} type of traveling-wave {{field-effect transistor}} (TWFET), {{the gate and}} <b>drain</b> <b>lines</b> of which contain series capacitors, series inductors, shunt capacitors, and shunt inductors, is considered to provide a platform to manage unattenuated dispersion-free envelope pulses.

Including the noted leak, the 222 -S Laboratory has experienced two <b>drain</b> <b>line</b> leaks in approximately {{the last two years}} of operation. As a consequence, CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH 2 M HILL) requested the support of ChemMet, Ltd., PC (ChemMet) at the Hanford Site 222 -S Laboratory. The corrosion expertise from ChemMet was required prior to preparation of a compatibility assessment for the 222 -S Laboratory waste transfer system to assure the expected life of the piping system is extended as much as practicable. The system includes piping within the 222 -S Laboratory and the 219 -S Waste Storage and Transfer Facility and Operations Process. The ChemMet support was required for an assessment by 222 -S staff to analyze what improvements to operational activities may be implemented to extend the tank/piping system life. This assessment will include a summary of the various material types, age, and locations throughout the facility.
