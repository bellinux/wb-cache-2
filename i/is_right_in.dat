In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{designed}} boss {{battles of}} Snake Eater {{to be totally}} different from those in previous Metal Gear games, or any other games. He said that the boss battle with sniper The End best represented free, open gameplay in the game. The battle takes place over a large area of dense jungle, and the player must search extensively for The End, who attacks over long range from an unknown position. This battle of attrition can last for hours, and contrasts with other boss fights in which the enemy <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> front of the player and in view the whole time. In addition, the player {{has the ability to}} both avoid this boss battle altogether by killing The End earlier in the game; or save and quit during the fight, wait a week, and reload the game to find The End having died of old age. Kojima commented that features like this do not appear in other games.|$|E

Both cultural diversity of language, and a learning instinct, can be affirmed; neither need be denied.|$|E

25|$|On September 4, 1972, Barker began {{hosting the}} CBS revival of The Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right.</b> <b>In</b> the 35 {{years of the}} CBS version, Barker became far more {{associated}} with the series than first host Bill Cullen was with the 1956–65 original.

25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E

25|$|The Government of India {{led by the}} Indian National Congress {{which is}} the {{opposition}} party {{in the state of}} Chhattisgarh reacted strongly to international appeals for the release of Dr Binayak Sen.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said that the State Government <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> opposing Dr Sen's appeal.|$|E
25|$|On October 31, 2006, Barker {{made his}} {{announcement}} {{that he would}} retire from The Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> <b>in</b> June 2007.

25|$|The text, in Book 7, {{describes}} {{the legend of}} a bhagavata (devotee) named Prahlada. He {{is described as a}} boy full of virtues, but who is born to a demon king who is persecuting people for their independent and different religious beliefs in favor of Vishnu. Prahlada disagrees with his father, resists him, and pursues what he feels <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> this legend, and many others, the text challenges presumption and stereotypes about a person based on birth and heredity, as well as encourages the readers through the character of Prahlada to resist threats, harassment and indoctrination from anyone. The Purana, state Gupta and Valpey, implies that virtues and vices are an individual's attribute and a person must be seen for who he is, rather than assumed to be following his parents because of hereditary circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Born in Darrington, Washington to modest circumstances, Barker {{enlisted in}} the United States Navy during World War II. Barker worked {{part-time}} in radio while he attended college. In 1950, Barker moved to California in order {{to pursue a career}} in broadcasting. He was given his own radio show, The Bob Barker Show, which ran for the next six years. Barker began his game show career in 1956, hosting Truth or Consequences. From there, he hosted various game shows as well as the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants from 1967 to 1987 giving him the distinction of being the longest serving host of these pageants. Eventually, he began hosting The Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> <b>in</b> 1972. When his wife Dorothy Jo died, Barker became an advocate for animal rights and of animal-rights activism, supporting groups such as the United Activists for Animal Rights and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. In 2007, Barker retired from hosting The Price Is Right after celebrating his 50-year career on television.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the word}} of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying that God had made a {{covenant}} with the Israelites' forefathers when God brought them out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage that in the seventh year they must let every Hebrew slave go free, but their forefathers did not listen. The people had turned and done what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> God's eyes, proclaiming liberty to their neighbors, making a covenant before God in the Temple. But the people turned again and profaned God's name, causing their servants whom they had freed to return to subjugation as servants once again. Therefore, God said that as the people had not listened to God to proclaim liberty to their neighbors, God would proclaim for the people liberty to the sword, pestilence, and famine, and would make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. God would give over to their enemies the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the officers, the priests, and all the people of the land who had transgressed God's covenant, who had sealed the covenant by cutting a calf in half and passing between the two parts of the calf, and their dead bodies would be food for scavengers. And God would give Zedekiah and his princes into the hand of the king of Babylon, who would return to burn Jerusalem and lay desolate the cities of Judah.|$|E
