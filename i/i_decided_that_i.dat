I've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} chapter, Cartwright writes [...] "About {{five years ago}} I decided I wanted to write this book. I knew that The Simpsons would end some day. [...] <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to write it while the show {{was still on the}} air." [...] In an {{interview}} with Scotland on Sunday, she added [...] "I wanted to tell my story and I needed to because I get so much fan mail. People are so interested in the whole process, how it all comes together. This book does that." [...] In a 1995 interview, five years before writing the book, Cartwright remarked that she wanted to write a book and that if she did, it would be titled [...] "My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} made {{available}} for download on April 20, 2005, the sixth anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Ledonne sought to remain anonymous at the game's debut to avoid any possible controversy, which he would later regret as it created the impression {{he had something to}} hide. Under the alias [...] "Columbin", Ledonne regularly engaged gamers and critics alike on a message board he established to discuss the game's depiction of the shooting and the broader implications of the shooting. Ledonne's identity was revealed by Roger Kovacs, a friend of one of the Columbine victims, Rachel Scott. Kovacs found out Ledonne's name by donating to the site via Paypal; after his name and address were posted online, Ledonne stepped forward and was greeted with requests for interviews. [...] "That's when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to grow a backbone and stand up for my creation," [...] Ledonne said.|$|E

500|$|He {{then joined}} Don Carthel's West Texas A University staff as a {{volunteer}} quarterbacks coach in 2006, commenting, [...] "About a year after I retired from playing, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to get back}} to college, where I had the greatest time of my life, and to get involved with college football." [...] He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. [...] He said at the time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's never been this good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what [...] "started about an eight-year run of off-and-on Opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom".|$|E
2500|$|After {{years apart}} the two reunited {{to write their}} own {{material}} and [...] "create music based around our harmonies {{because that was the}} one thing that people really enjoyed about our performances in the band". Lucas had seen a folk group, Tiddas, performing [...] "Inside My Kitchen" [...] on TV music video program, rage, [...] "t was a revelation for me to see three women singing harmonies, playing acoustic guitar and telling their stories through song. Right then and there <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to play acoustic guitar, focus on my vocals and write songs".|$|E
2500|$|Critic Pauline Kael, in {{her famous}} New Yorker review, wrote [...] "The movie {{breakthrough}} has finally come. Bertolucci and Brando {{have altered the}} face of an art form." [...] Brando confessed in his autobiography, [...] "To this day I can't say what Last Tango in Paris was about," [...] and added the film [...] "required me {{to do a lot of}} emotional arm wrestling with myself, and when it was finished, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't ever again going to destroy myself emotionally to make a movie. I felt I had violated my innermost self and I didn't want to suffer like that anymore... You can't fake it." ...|$|E

60|$|The remark {{seemed so}} utterly {{irrelevant}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{did not even}} take the trouble to answer it.

2500|$|In March 2017, Carswell quit UKIP {{to become}} an {{independent}} MP for Clacton, leaving UKIP with no MPs in parliament.

2500|$|Rakoff {{said that}} his first career choice was to be an actor: he wrote, [...] "like generations of other misfits before me, be they morphological, sexual or otherwise, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would make theatre my refuge". Rakoff {{performed}} in the theatre at university and acted while working full-time in the publishing industry and later while freelancing as a writer. For instance, he performed at the first US Comedy Arts Festival in 1995 in a play written by a friend. [...] He {{has said that he}} likes acting because it involves other people, unlike writing. However, his self-assessment of his acting ability was [...] "as it turns out, I'm a deeply uncompelling camera presence".|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 2008, the Drudge Report {{reported}} that Oprah staffers were [...] "sharply {{divided on the}} merits of booking Sarah Palin". Drudge said that he obtained the information from an anonymous source. Winfrey responded in a written statement to news outlets saying, [...] "The item in today’s Drudge Report is categorically untrue. There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on my show. At the beginning of this presidential campaign when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates." [...] Oprah Winfrey's public statement came after she had already endorsed Barack Obama for president on Larry King Live in 2007. Drudge was accused by some commentators of planting a false story for political ends.|$|E
2500|$|On May 19, 1936, Abe went {{shopping}} {{and saw a}} movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in Shinagawa on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Omiya, a friend, and Ishida. She planned to commit suicide {{one week after the}} murder, and practiced necrophilia. [...] "I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 25 March 2017, Carswell {{announced}} that he was quitting UKIP to sit as an independent MP, saying that [...] "I switched to UKIP because I desperately wanted us to leave the EU.

60|$|After I {{had drunk}} {{half a dozen}} glasses, my policy of temperateness in mind, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had had enough for that time. So I {{mentioned}} that I was going aboard the Razzle Dazzle, then lying at the city wharf, a hundred yards away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} quite {{determined}} on my next move, {{and it is}} not improbable <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall go down in this ship and establish myself, for a time, at Martaban; and open a trade in Tenasserim. If <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> on <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> shall only get on shore a portion of my goods, and take the rest on with me there.|$|R
5000|$|So I {{started looking}} at the lives of other billionaires. Almost all the ones I most admired were major philanthropists: Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Mike Bloomberg, George Soros, Eli Broad—each with a passion to do good, each getting so much {{pleasure}} from giving their money away. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>I</b> wanted to do. But to which worthy cause would I direct my money? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{at first}} <b>I</b> would travel {{directly}} {{south in the}} hope <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might in <b>that</b> direction find some familiar landmark. It was as good a direction as any. This much at least might be said of it.|$|R
60|$|One day it {{occurred}} to me that it had been many years since the world had been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake a journey through Europe on foot. After much thought, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle. So I determined to do it. This was in March, 1878.|$|E
60|$|Towards {{the evening}} there arose the {{question}} of return to Sanstead. I had not gathered whether Mr Abney had intended to set any time-limit on my wanderings, or whether I {{was not supposed to}} come back except with the deserters. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had better remain in London, at any rate for another night, and went to the nearest post office to send Mr Abney a telegram to that effect.|$|E
60|$|Twenty {{thousand}} sterling a year! The idea took {{my breath}} away, and reduced me {{once more to}} a state of helpless incapacity. I couldn't talk much more small-talk to Mr. Hitchcock, so I managed to make some small excuse and returned listlessly to Congress Hall. There, over a luncheon of Saddle-Rock oysters (you see I never allow my feelings to interfere with my appetite), <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must give up all idea of Ida Van Rensselaer.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2011 interview, he stated: [...] Recently <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{whenever}} <b>I</b> meet someone, I should {{introduce myself}} as “Water.” Think of it: our brains are about 90 percent water, our bodies about 68 percent. Not even Waterman, simply Water: {{it makes people}} curious, they say, “pardon?” and I say again “Water."This immediately starts a conversation and creates an awareness about it. This new name conveys my deep concern about water. Ulay ...|$|R
5000|$|Since I {{came to this}} House 30 years ago, I {{have always}} felt that the House is at its best when it is united. In order that unity can be maintained, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will {{relinquish}} the office of Speaker on Sunday 21 June. This will allow the House to proceed to elect a new Speaker on Monday 22 June. <b>That</b> is all <b>I</b> have to say on this matter.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{approached}} the lodge, <b>I</b> felt <b>that</b> perhaps <b>I</b> {{had received a}} lesson, but I was not sure. I would wait and let circumstances decide. The gardener was away attending to his duties; but his wife was there, {{and when she came}} forward, with a frank, cheery greeting, <b>I</b> instantly <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had had a lesson. I thanked her, as earnestly as I knew how, for what she had done for me, and then I added: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was O-lo-a herself {{who brought}} word {{to me that}} her father had given the {{commands}} that would set in motion the machinery of the temple. A messenger was on his way in search of me to summon me to Ko-tan's presence. To have refused the priesthood once it was offered me by the king would have been to have affronted the temple and the gods--that would have meant death; but if I did not appear before Ko-tan I would not have to refuse anything. O-lo-a and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must not appear. It was better to fly, carrying in my bosom a shred of hope, than to remain and, with my priesthood, abandon hope forever.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{painting}} in the Lake District all summer, as you know," [...] answered Uncle Blair, [...] "and one day I just got homesick to see my little girl. So I sailed for Montreal without further delay. I got here at eleven last night--the station-master's son drove me down. Nice boy. The old house was in darkness and I {{thought it would be}} a shame to rouse you all out of bed after a hard day's work. So <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would spend the night in the orchard. It was moonlight, you know, and moonlight in an old orchard is one of the few things left over from the Golden Age." ...|$|E
60|$|Although it {{was agreed}} that I was to travel in the motley, yet, in my lately-born shame of that apparel, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would conceal it as best might be, {{revealing}} it only should the need arise. Moreover, it was incumbent that I should afford myself more protection against the inclement January night than that of my foliated cape, my crested cap and silken hose. So, a black cloak, heavy and ample, a broad-brimmed hat, and a pair of riding boots of untanned leather were my further equipment. In the lining of one of those boots I concealed the Lord Cesare's package; his money--some twenty ducats--I carried in a belt about my waist, and his ring I set boldly on my finger.|$|E

5000|$|Butt {{also says}} in her book, Everyday Princess: Daughter of the King, {{that while she}} never drank alcohol or used drugs growing up, she did [...] "date plenty of boys". [...] Those boys drew Butt to Tennessee Technological University where she said boys outnumbered girls 7-to-1. According to Butt, Tennessee Tech was fun, except for that frat party where she said a man pulled his pants down and danced behind her. [...] "Needless to say, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> night <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would not be dancing at parties anymore," [...] Butt wrote. Butt wasn't always a Christian and did not make that {{decision}} until she was 20 years old, according to her book Everyday Princess: Daughter of the King.|$|R
50|$|It becomes {{harder and}} the enthusiasm wanes. I had been {{training}} {{for so many}} years and I had had my best years. I could have ridden a few more but <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> was it. <b>I</b> wasn't going to improve and I was no longer as good as I had been.|$|R
