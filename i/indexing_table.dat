40|$|Directly {{embedding}} {{the secret}} data into the VQ-compressed domain is practical for reducing storage and transmittal bandwidth. Many steganography techniques are currently exploited for the VQ <b>index</b> <b>table.</b> However, embedding strategies extend {{the amount of}} compression needed for embedding secret data and distort the original quality of the VQ decompressed image. To satisfy the essentials of increasing the secret payload, preserve the VQ <b>index</b> <b>table</b> without loss, and reduce the compression rate, the proposed scheme utilizes search order coding to find {{the correlation between the}} VQ indices and neighboring indices. Due to the similarity of adjacent indices, the new scheme can effectively embed the secret stream into the <b>index</b> <b>table</b> and encode the embedded <b>index</b> <b>table</b> with fewer bits.

50|$|With {{selective}} laser melting, thin layers of atomized fine metal powder are evenly distributed using a coating mechanism onto a substrate plate, usually metal, that is fastened to an <b>indexing</b> <b>table</b> that {{moves in the}} vertical (Z) axis. This takes place inside a chamber containing a tightly controlled atmosphere of inert gas, either argon or nitrogen at oxygen levels below 500 parts per million. Once each layer has been distributed, each 2D slice of the part geometry is fused by selectively melting the powder. This is accomplished with a high-power laser beam, usually an ytterbium fiber laser with hundreds of watts. The laser beam is directed in the X and Y directions with two high frequency scanning mirrors. The laser energy is intense enough to permit full melting (welding) of the particles to form solid metal. The process is repeated layer after layer until the part is complete.|$|E

30|$|In the simulator, CACTI [16] {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the memory access latency and power consumption amount, and we followed the estimation methodologies used in [17]. Other data, which are prediction hit/miss rate and cache hit/miss rate, are obtained from the SimpleScalar part of the simulator. In order {{to calculate}} the latency and power consumption amount, cache accesses are categorized into three cases: (1) The first case is a correct way-prediction. In this case, the latency and power dissipation are based on the accesses to the <b>index</b> <b>table</b> and the predicted bank, i.e., analogous to the operation on the direct-mapped cache. (2) The second case is a wrong way-prediction but is a cache hit. In this case, the way-predictor fails to select the correct bank, but the referenced data is found in a different bank. This requires the <b>index</b> <b>table</b> to be updated with the correct bank information after the data access. The latency and power dissipation are based on an access to the <b>index</b> <b>table,</b> an access to one bank, accesses to all other banks in the cache, e.g., n- 1 banks for n-way set, and an access to update the <b>index</b> <b>table.</b> (3) The last case is a cache miss, which is the worst case and consumes time and energy for all the accesses listed in the second case plus a costly access to the lower-level memory to fetch the referenced data.|$|R
40|$|Perceptual hashing {{has been}} {{proved to be an}} {{effective}} solution for multimedia indexing, authentication or watermarking. Traditional perceptual hashing schemes are typical designed only for one purpose. This study presents a multipurpose image-hashing scheme based on Mean-Removed Vector Quantization (MRVQ) for both copyright protection and content authentication. The main idea is to perform MRVQ on the original image to yield two <b>index</b> <b>tables,</b> one for copyright protection and the other for content authentication. The original gray-level image is first divided into non-overlapping small blocks. The mean value for each block is calculated and quantized by the scalar quantizer to get a mean index and the quantized mean is removed from the image block to obtain the residual vector that is further quantized by the vector quantizer to obtain the residual index. All obtained mean indices constructed the mean <b>index</b> <b>table</b> and all obtained residual indices construct the residual <b>index</b> <b>table.</b> The obtained two <b>index</b> <b>tables</b> are then transformed into two intermediate binary images based on two different mapping functions, respectively. One mapping function is based on the variance of indices in a 3 x 3 neighborhood and the other mapping function is {{based on the number of}} indices larger than the mean of indices in a 3 x 3 neighborhood. Finally, the authentication mark and permuted copyright logo are respectively XOR-ed with the two intermediate binary images to obtain final authentication and protection fingerprints.

Conventionally, autocollimator along with <b>indexing</b> <b>table,</b> are used for the calibration of angle gauges and polygons. A novel multiple reflections method is devised at NPLI to improve the uncertainty of measurements during calibrations. A polygon under calibration is fixed at the centre of a Moore’s <b>indexing</b> <b>table</b> within eccentricity offset ± 20 μm. A reference autocollimator is aligned {{to one of the}} face of the polygon. A flat reflector is fixed in the centre of a rotatable table. The rotatable table is arranged to collect the optical beam on to the flat reflector then deflected to same face of the polygon, wherefrom the light beam is received at the autocollimator. Thus the optical beam strikes the same face of the polygon twice. Therefore the resolution of the reference autocollimator is virtually doubled. In this experimental setup, two set of readings are obtained simultaneously. One set of the readings corresponds to conventional method and the second set of the readings belongs to the proposed novel method. The readings of the autocollimator are analysed and the results are discussed in the article. The results thus obtained by conventional method are compared with the results obtained using the proposed method.
