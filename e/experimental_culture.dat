40|$|The {{effects of}} {{transforming}} growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) {{on the growth}} of and collagen production by NRK 52 E cells, a clonal line established from normal rat kidney epithelial cells, have been characterized. NRK 52 E cells were grown in the absence or presence of TGF-beta for 4 days followed by incubation for 24 hours in serum-free medium containing [3 H]proline. The secreted and cell-associated collagens produced by control and <b>experimental</b> <b>cultures</b> were isolated by limited pepsin digestion and differential salt fractionation. TGF-beta inhibited proliferation by about 50 % but did not affect overall culture morphology. Both protein and collagen synthesis were increased in <b>experimental</b> <b>cultures,</b> but the increase in total collagen production exceeded that of total protein synthesis. Although NRK 52 E cells grown {{in the presence of}} TGF-beta continued to produce the same types of collagen (types I, III, IV, and V), their relative amounts were changed. In the <b>experimental</b> <b>cultures,</b> type I collagen production was increased eightfold, types III and V collagen levels were increased two-fold, but type IV production was only slightly enhanced. In addition to increasing total collagen production by about fivefold, TGF-beta increased the ratio of type I to type III about threefold but minimally affected the ratio of secreted to cell-associated molecules. These findings establish that TGF-beta specifically affects collagen production in NRK 52 E cells and that these alterations differ in many ways from the affects of epidermal growth factor. Because TGF-beta increased total collagen expression, these results provide additional evidence implicating this growth factor as a positive mediator of matrix accumulation in renal disease...|$|R
