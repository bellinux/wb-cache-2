5|$|His {{works have}} been {{translated}} into Belorussian, Bulgarian, Czech, <b>Esperanto,</b> Finnish, German, Hungarian, Russian and Slovenian. Almost none of his works have {{been translated into}} English; the only exception is the short story Wyjątkowo trudny teren ("Particularly Difficult Territory") that Zajdel wrote for the English language Tales from the Planet Earth anthology edited by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull.|$|E
5|$|The school's {{curriculum}} {{is based on}} a 30-credit system, requiring a student to receive all 17 mandatory credits and seven optional credits to graduate. Examples of notable courses are law, <b>Esperanto,</b> German, Auto mechanics, carpentry, entrepreneurship, world religions, cooperative education, and leadership. L'Odyssée also offers exclusive courses in work-life development and speaking Acadian.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{scholars}} mention {{a possibility of}} future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue {{to function as a}} koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world. English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world. Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including <b>Esperanto.</b>|$|E
25|$|Words {{and phrases}} reflect what {{speakers}} {{of a language}} talk about. Tellingly, <b>Esperanto</b> has a slang expression krokodili (tocrocodile) for speaking a language other than <b>Esperanto</b> when <b>Esperanto</b> would be more appropriate, such as at an <b>Esperanto</b> convention, whereas there is nothing equivalent in English.|$|E
25|$|In GNOME, {{there exists}} a {{separate}} keyboard layout for <b>Esperanto,</b> replacing unused characters in <b>Esperanto</b> with the non-ASCII characters. A separate keyboard layout for <b>Esperanto</b> is available in KDE, too.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{projects}} to adapt <b>Esperanto</b> to specialized uses. <b>Esperanto</b> de DLT (1983) is one; {{it was an}} adaptation of <b>Esperanto</b> as a pivot language for machine translation.|$|E
25|$|Countering {{a common}} {{criticism}} against <b>Esperanto,</b> the statistician Svend Nielsen has found {{there to be}} no significant correlation {{between the number of}} <b>Esperanto</b> speakers and similarity of a given national mother language to <b>Esperanto.</b> He concludes that <b>Esperanto</b> tends to be more popular in countries that are rich, with widespread Internet access and that tend to contribute more to science and culture. Linguistic diversity within a country was found to have a slight inverse correlation with <b>Esperanto</b> popularity.|$|E

25|$|In 1922 a {{proposal}} by Iran {{and several other}} countries in the League of Nations to have <b>Esperanto</b> taught in member nations' schools failed. <b>Esperanto</b> speakers were subject to persecution under Stalin's regime. In Germany under Hitler, in Spain under Franco for about a decade, in Portugal under Salazar, in Romania under Ceaucescu, and in half a dozen Eastern European countries during the late forties and part of the fifties, <b>Esperanto</b> activities and the formation of <b>Esperanto</b> associations were forbidden. In spite of these factors more people continued to learn <b>Esperanto,</b> and significant literary work (both poetry and novels) appeared in <b>Esperanto</b> in the period between the World Wars and after them. <b>Esperanto</b> is spoken today in a growing number of countries and it has multiple generations of native speakers, although it is primarily used as a second language. Of the various constructed language projects, it is <b>Esperanto</b> that has so far come closest to becoming an officially recognized international auxiliary language; China publishes daily news in <b>Esperanto.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} {{geographical}} and astronomical features named after <b>Esperanto,</b> or after its creator L. L. Zamenhof. These include <b>Esperanto</b> Island in Zed Islands off Livingston Island, and the asteroids 1421 <b>Esperanto</b> and 1462 Zamenhof discovered by Finnish astronomer and Esperantist Yrjö Väisälä.|$|E
25|$|Marcus Sikosek (now Ziko van Dijk) has {{challenged}} this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated. He estimated {{that even if}} <b>Esperanto</b> speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million <b>Esperanto</b> speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 {{in the city of}} Cologne. Van Dijk finds only 30 fluent speakers in that city, and similarly smaller-than-expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of <b>Esperanto</b> speakers. He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various <b>Esperanto</b> organizations (other estimates are higher). Though there are undoubtedly many <b>Esperanto</b> speakers who are not members of any <b>Esperanto</b> organization, he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Esperanto</b> officially uses Latin script, <b>Esperanto</b> alphabets {{based on}} other scripts have been devised. None {{of these are}} in {{widespread}} use.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} shared traditions, such as Zamenhof Day, and shared {{behaviour}} patterns. Esperantists speak primarily in <b>Esperanto</b> at international <b>Esperanto</b> meetings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Esperanto</b> is {{credited}} with influencing or inspiring several later competing language projects, such as Occidental (1922) and Novial (1928). These always lagged far behind <b>Esperanto</b> in their popularity. By contrast, Interlingua (1951) has greatly surpassed Ido in terms of popularity. It shows little or no <b>Esperanto</b> influence, however.|$|E
25|$|<b>Esperanto</b> {{versions}} of international Morse code and braille include the six diacritic letters. An <b>Esperanto</b> Braille magazine, Aŭroro, {{has been published}} since 1920.|$|E
25|$|A longstanding {{member of}} the Norwegian <b>Esperanto</b> League (Norsk Esperanto-Forbund), he never, however, {{accepted}} any formal position in the organization. Tron Øgrim was {{well known in the}} <b>Esperanto</b> movement for his radio series Drømmen om den fullkomne språk (The dream of a perfect language). Beginning in 1989, the programs dealt with linguistic philosophy and planned or constructed languages such as <b>Esperanto</b> and Volapük. He steadily turned up at international <b>Esperanto</b> meetings and was widely regarded as affable and scholarly, with a healthy portion of self-deprecation.|$|E
25|$|After the Great War, {{there was}} a {{proposal}} for the League of Nations to accept <b>Esperanto</b> as their working language, following a report by Nitobe Inazō, an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of <b>Esperanto</b> in Prague. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, Gabriel Hanotaux. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw <b>Esperanto</b> as a threat, effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision. However, two years later, the League recommended that its member states include <b>Esperanto</b> in their educational curricula. For this reason, many people see the 1920s as {{the heyday of the}} <b>Esperanto</b> movement. Anarchism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of anationalism {{as well as of the}} <b>Esperanto</b> language.|$|E
25|$|The {{works of}} Tibor Sekelj, novels and {{recordings}} of his travels, contain interesting ethnographic observations. He also wrote guides and essays on <b>Esperanto,</b> the international language. The {{majority of his}} books were originally written in <b>Esperanto,</b> but were translated into many national languages. Tibor Sekelj is undoubtedly the most often translated <b>Esperanto</b> author.|$|E
25|$|There were {{plans at}} the {{beginning}} of the 20th century to establish Neutral Moresnet as the world's first <b>Esperanto</b> state. In addition, the self-proclaimed artificial island micronation of Rose Island used <b>Esperanto</b> as its official language in 1968, and another micronation, the extant Republic of Molossia, uses <b>Esperanto</b> as an official language alongside English.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} endings {{are the same}} as in <b>Esperanto</b> except for -i, -ir, -ar, -or and -ez. <b>Esperanto</b> marks noun plurals by an agglutinative ending -j (so plural nouns end in -oj), uses -i for verb infinitives (<b>Esperanto</b> infinitives are tenseless), and uses -u for the imperative. Verbs in both <b>Esperanto</b> and Ido do not {{conjugate}} depending on person, number or gender; the -as, -is, and -os endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, or anything else.|$|E
25|$|<b>Esperanto</b> is a {{constructed}} auxiliary language. Because of {{its highly}} regular grammar, <b>Esperanto</b> {{is often said}} to be easier to learn than other languages.|$|E
25|$|Fascist Italy, on {{the other}} hand, made some efforts of {{promoting}} tourism in Italy through <b>Esperanto</b> leaflets and appreciated the similarities of Italian and <b>Esperanto.</b>|$|E

25|$|These {{attempted}} improvements {{were intended}} to replace <b>Esperanto.</b> Limited suggestions for improvement {{within the framework of}} <b>Esperanto,</b> such as orthographic reforms and riism, are not considered Esperantidos.|$|E
25|$|Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran {{called on}} Muslims to learn <b>Esperanto</b> and praised its {{use as a}} medium for better {{understanding}} among peoples of different religious backgrounds. After he suggested that <b>Esperanto</b> replace English as an international lingua franca, it began {{to be used in}} the seminaries of Qom. An <b>Esperanto</b> translation of the Qur'an was published by the state shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} has used <b>Esperanto</b> since 2001 for daily news on china.org.cn. China also uses <b>Esperanto</b> in China Radio International {{and for the}} internet magazine El Popola Ĉinio.|$|E
25|$|The Fundamento de <b>Esperanto</b> does {{allow the}} use of the digraphs ‹ch›, ‹gh›, ‹hh›, ‹jh›, ‹sh› and the single letter ‹u› instead of the {{ordinary}} diacritical letters of <b>Esperanto</b> when those are unavailable. With the advent of computers, another system of surrogate <b>Esperanto</b> writing using ‹cx›, ‹gx›, ‹hx›, ‹jx›, ‹sx› and ‹ux› was introduced. It however remains unofficial.|$|E
25|$|He {{led many}} Master <b>Esperanto</b> classes {{wherever}} he travelled and also {{took part in}} the improvement of the «Zagreb method» textbook. Tibor Sekelj gave between 7000 and 8000 speeches, most often with photos of his travels, wrote innumerable articles about <b>Esperanto</b> in the national press and was interviewed hundreds of times for national radios, newspapers and television. He always spoke about <b>Esperanto.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1926 {{he learned}} <b>Esperanto</b> {{and tried to}} {{translate}} some of his Japanese poems into the <b>Esperanto</b> language; the translated pieces were published in 1953, long after his death.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 the Prague Manifesto {{was adopted}} {{at the annual}} {{congress}} of the World <b>Esperanto</b> Association (UEA); it was subscribed by individual participants and later by other <b>Esperanto</b> speakers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Esperanto</b> was {{recommended}} by the French Academy of Sciences in 1921 and recognized by UNESCO in 1954, which recommended in 1985 that international non-governmental organizations use <b>Esperanto.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conclusions: <b>Esperanto</b> {{students}} achieved {{better results}} {{compared to those}} studying Danish, {{in part because of}} Esperanto's internal structure, as well as the interest and enthusiasm aroused by <b>Esperanto</b> in the students' minds.|$|E
25|$|Portugal's right-wing governments {{cracked down}} on the {{language}} from 1936 until the Carnation Revolution of 1974. After the Spanish Civil War, Francoist Spain {{cracked down on}} the Anarchists and Catalan nationalists among whom the speaking of <b>Esperanto</b> had been quite widespread; but in the 1950s, the <b>Esperanto</b> movement was tolerated again, with Francisco Franco accepting the honorary patronage of the Madrid World <b>Esperanto</b> Congress.|$|E
