40|$|When {{electrons}} {{pass through}} a cylindrical electrical conductor aligned in a magnetic field, their wave-like nature manifests itself as a periodic oscillation in the electrical resistance {{as a function of}} the enclosed magnetic Flux. This phenomenon reflects the dependence of the phase of the electron wave on the magnetic field, known as the Aharonov-Bohm effect, which causes a phase difference, and hence interference, between partial waves encircling the conductor in opposite directions. Such oscillations have been observed in micrometre-sized thin-walled metallic cylinders and lithographically fabricated rings. Carbon nanotubes are composed of individual graphene sheets rolled into seamless hollow cylinders with diameters ranging from 1 nm to about 20 nm. They are able to act as conducting molecular wires, making them ideally suited for the investigation of quantum interference at the single-molecule level caused by the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Here we report magnetoresistance measurements on individual multi-walled nanotubes, which display pronounced resistance oscillations as a function of magnetic flux. We find that the oscillations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the Aharonov-Bohm effect in a <b>hollow</b> <b>conductor</b> with a diameter equal to that of the outermost shell of the nanotubes.

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic waves can be emitted into the open space by an antenna; it is called free propagation of waves, {{a process that is}} widely used in telecommunication systems [1]. When the frequency and / or the power increases, the use of transmission lines is very limited by the appearance of higher order modes that occur as soon as the transverse dimensions of the structures used are no longer negligible compared to the wavelength and also by increasing dielectric losses in the insulators which also often causes an important attenuation [2] in this case, it becomes necessary to use structures called generally "waveguide " for the transmission of this electromagnetic energy. It’s about a <b>hollow</b> <b>conductor</b> in which electromagnetic waves are propagated by successive reflections on the internal walls. The metal waveguides are the basis for the design of many microwave devices such as filters, transformers, adapters, polarizers [...] In this chapter we’ll have a detailed overview on the use of waveguides (filters in general), their characteristics, advantages, disadvantages compared to other guiding structures...|$|E

The paper notes {{that there are two}} families of solutions: (1) In "isolated charge-free" regions electric free field does not exist in the context of Maxwell's equations, but there may exist a time-independent background magnetic field.

40|$|Wind {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{compelling}} forms of indirect solar energy. Available now, the conversion of wind power into electricity is and will continue to be an important element of energy self-sufficiency planning. This paper is one in a series intended to report on the development of a new type of generator for wind energy; a compact, high-power, direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (DD-PMSG) that uses direct liquid cooling (LC) of the stator windings to manage Joule heating losses. The main param-eters of the subject LC DD-PMSG are 8 MW, 3. 3 kV, and 11 Hz. The stator winding is cooled directly by deionized water, which flows through the continuous <b>hollow</b> <b>conductor</b> of each stator tooth-coil winding. The design of the machine is to a large degree subordinate to the use of these solid-copper tooth-coils. Both steady-state and timedependent temperature distributions for LC DD-PMSG were examined with calculations based on a lumpedparameter thermal model, which makes it possible to account for uneven heat loss distribution in the stator conductors and the conductor cooling system. Transient calculations reveal the copper winding temperature distribution for an example duty cycle during variable-speed wind turbine operation. The cooling performance of the liquid cooled tooth-coil design was predicted via finite element analysis. An instrumented cooling loop featuring a pair of LC tooth-coils embedded in a lamination stack was built and laboratory tested to verify the analytical model. Predicted and measured results were in agreement, confirming the predicted satisfactory operation of the LC DD-PMSG cooling technology approach as a whole. Post-print / final draf...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that solutions of so called “free” Maxwell equations for  = 0 (null charge density at every {{point of the}} whole space) describe a free electromagnetic field for which flux lines neither begin nor end in a charge). In order to avoid ambiguities and unacceptable approximation which have place in the conventional approach in respect to the free field concept, we explicitly consider three possible types of space regions: (i) “isolated charge-free” region, where a resultant electric field with the flux lines which either begin or end in a charge is zero in every point, for example, inside a <b>hollow</b> <b>conductor</b> of any shape or in a free-charge universe; (ii) “non-isolated charge-free” region, where this electric [see (i) ] field is not zero in every point; and (iii) “charge-neutral” region, where point charges exist but their algebraic sum is zero. According to these definitions a strict mathematical interpretation of Maxwell's equations gives following conclusions: (1) In “isolated charge-free” regions electric free field cannot be unconditionally understood neither as {{a direct consequence of}} Maxwell's equations nor as a valid approximation: it may be introduced only as a postulate; nevertheless, this case is compatible is the existence of a time-independent background magnetic field. (2) In both “charge-neutral” and “non-isolated charge-free” regions, where the condition  =  function or  = 0 respectively holds, Maxwell's equation for the total electric field have non-zero solutions, as in the conventional approach. However, these solution cannot be strictly identified with the electric free field.

Copper coated glass fibers can, in principle, be manufactured, but in these tests, the conductors were capillaries internally coated with silver as these are easily obtainable, relatively inexpensive and serve to test the concept. The performance of these experimental twin lead cables corresponds to calculations, confirming the general principle.
