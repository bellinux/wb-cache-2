The aim of the article is to assess the role of infrastructure potential of the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> in ensuring its flexibility and security. Threats to the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> security are systematized by sources of formation, scale, duration and nature of influence. The essence of security and flexibility of the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> is defined. There systematized indicators of security and flexibility of the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> in interrelation with the components of infrastructure potential of the <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> The methodology for determining the level of economic safety and flexibility of the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> is substantiated, the corresponding calculations are made. Also the methodology for calculating the normalized index of the infrastructure potential of the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> is developed. The correlation-regression analysis {{of the connection between}} development of the infrastructure potential of the <b>financial</b> <b>market,</b> its security and flexibility is carried out. The results of the calculations showed that the degree of implementation of the <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> infrastructure potential at the current stage of development of the Ukrainian economy is insufficient. It does not contribute to achieving the necessary level of flexibility and security of the <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> Each of the components of infrastructure potential requires changing approaches to regulation aimed at ensuring the systematic development of the <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> Most of the identified problems are mainly related to dysfunctionality of the technological and information components of the infrastructural potential of the <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> This is manifested in the low level of confidence in it from the part of the household sector {{as well as in the}} poor efficiency of regulation of certain segments of the <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> That is why the prospects for further research are to identify areas for increasing the role of technological and information components of the infrastructure potential of the <b>financial</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{synthesis}} of two Schumpeterian views: that growth is driven by innovation, and {{that the level of}} <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> development affects the growth process. We adopt an endogenous growth model where growth is driven by R&D activities of entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs must borrow to fund R&D, but heterogeneity and unobservability of entrepreneurial ability creates credit restriction. The extent of <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> development is defined as the number of high ability agents in the <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> Having a more developed <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> facilitates the allocatin of resources to the innovation sector, at the same time reduces the number of entrepreneurs available to the innovation sector. We characterize equilibrium in the <b>financial</b> <b>market,</b> and find that market allocation of entrepreneurs only coincides with the growth maximising allocation when all value created by innovation are divided by entrepreneurs, otherwise the market allocation is typically not growth maximising, and low grow trap may exist.

5|$|Other economists {{focused more}} on theory in their {{business}} cycle analysis. Most business cycle theories focused on a single factor, such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although business cycle theory was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had little impact on public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early business cycle theories treated goods markets and <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> separately.
