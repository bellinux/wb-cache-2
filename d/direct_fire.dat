5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from <b>direct</b> <b>fire,</b> but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|The 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion was an Australian Army unit {{raised for}} service with the all {{volunteer}} Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) during the Second World War. Formed in late 1940 {{as part of}} the 8th Division, the battalion was established to provide <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support to the division's infantry brigades. It was the fourth, and last, such unit raised within the 2nd AIF. The unit's personnel were largely drawn from the state of Western Australia and after formation, the battalion concentrated near Perth for basic individual training before moving to the Adelaide Hills to complete more advance manouevres.|$|E
5|$|The Port Said Sector was an {{independent}} military command in the Egyptian Military, unattached to the Second Army. It incorporated Port Said, Port Fouad and their vicinity. The sector contained two infantry brigades. Military operations {{in this area}} were directed against three fortifications: Budapest, Orkal and Lahtzanit. As {{with the rest of}} the front, the offensive here began with a fire preparation. However, high trajectory weapons were not employed because Egyptian aircraft were flying through the sector's airspace, hence only <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> guns were used to bombard Israeli positions.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from North Africa, No. 6 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. The grouping of the commandos into brigades underneath the divisional-sized Special Service Group headquarters was part of the general reorganisation that took place in late 1943 as the evolution of their role from raiding to assault infantry was formalised. This saw a change in the individual unit establishments, with the addition of organic transport assets, as well as an increase in the allocation of indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support weapons at commando level. Further support units were added at brigade level, including administration, transport, logistics and signals.|$|E
5|$|In early 1916, the {{battalion}} sailed to Alexandria on the Empress of Britain. From Alexandria, it travelled by train to bivouac at Tall al Kabir. At this time, {{the battalion}} received 367 reinforcements from Australia before undertaking defensive duties around Gebel Habieta, guarding the Suez Canal. In February, the AIF was re-organised and expanded. This saw the veteran battalions split to provide cadres for new battalions {{and as a}} part of this process, the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 51st Battalion, by transferring the even numbered sections to the new battalion. At this time, the battalion received four Lewis Guns for organic <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support.|$|E
5|$|In the {{long-range}} reconnaissance role, the SASR typically operates in small patrols of {{between five and}} six operators {{with the task of}} infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on enemy activities and capabilities. During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support including air strikes to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, parachute or high altitude parachute), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by submarine, small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable of covering long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain. SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.|$|E

5|$|Mickl {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the 42nd Panzerjäger Battalion during the invasion. He got along well with Rommel, and his battalion fought well but suffered serious casualties during the Battle of Arras on 21 May while trying to stop the heavily armoured tanks of the British 1st Army Tank Brigade with its 37 mm anti-tank guns. His soldiers derided their guns as Panzeranklopfgerät (tank-door knocker), due to their failure to penetrate the British Matilda I and Matilda II tanks. Mickl's battalion tried to protect the exposed flank of the division, but was overrun. The situation was saved by anti-aircraft guns and field artillery which were able to knock out the British tanks with <b>direct</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|That evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's {{rear echelon}} at Barara, along the Toko–Mosigetta–Buin Road, came under attack. Under {{the command of}} the {{battalion}} second-in-command, and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter.|$|E
5|$|The 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion {{attacked}} the defensive positions {{held by the}} 42nd Guards Rifle Division and the remaining armour of the 18th Tank Corps, while the panzer units {{attacked the}} defences of 9th Guards Airborne Division and the 29th Tank Corps. These German attacks were repelled by concentrated anti-tank artillery fire. The 29th Tank Corps responded with a counterattack and penetrated German lines, reaching Komsomolets State Farm before being beaten back by <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> from German artillery. That afternoon, Totenkopf was ordered to abandon their positions northwest of Prokhorovka and return to tenable positions around Hill 226.6. Soviet attempts to sever the narrow salient were unsuccessful, and Totenkopf completed its withdrawal by nightfall.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} {{first saw}} frontline service on 28 November, when two companies {{were attached to}} the 397th Infantry Regiment (100th Infantry Division), which was itself temporarily attached to the 45th Infantry Division, fighting in the Vosges Mountains under the Seventh Army. The battalion took its first casualties the following day, with four men in A Company killed and three wounded by artillery and mortar fire. The following day, a gun crew of the same company fired the battalion's first shots in anger, destroying a machine-gun position. The battalion pushed eastwards with the 100th and 45th Divisions until mid-December, with individual gun crews providing <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support to infantrymen assaulting German defensive positions, as well as indirect artillery fire.|$|E
5|$|If {{forced to}} assault a castle, {{there were many}} options {{available}} to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would be made to set them alight {{as can be seen}} in the Bayeux Tapestry. Projectile weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria– from Roman and Eastern origins respectively– were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13thcentury, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> by the curtain walls.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1940, {{amid the}} tide of German successes in Europe, there was an influx of volunteers for the 2nd AIF. As a result, the Australian {{government}} decided to raise a third volunteer division for overseas service, named the 8th Division. Established around three infantry brigades—the 22nd, 23rd and 27th—the division was supported by corps troops including engineers, cavalry, artillery, pioneers and a machine gun battalion for <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support. Within this formation, the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion came into being on 25 November 1940, when Lieutenant Colonel Michael Anketell, a First World War veteran who had commanded a Militia infantry battalion before the war, established his headquarters at Northam Camp, near Perth, Western Australia. While {{the rest of the}} 8th Division had drawn its personnel mainly from the more populous eastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, {{the decision was made to}} select personnel for the 2/4th only from those who were already enlisted and conducting training in the west. While potentially parochial, it was a primarily a pragmatic decision to reduce the time it would take to concentrate the unit and complete its training.|$|E

5|$|Late that afternoon, {{after about}} a week of dry weather, it began to rain. As a result, the track became more {{difficult}} and mobility was reduced; the tanks found the track impassable {{and as a consequence}} the advancing Australian infantry lost their <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support. Resupply also proved to be a problem for them. The jeeps that had been bringing up supplies could not get forward and there were not enough native porters to meet the demand. As a result, the Australians had to resort to using one of their infantry battalions, the 2/24th, to bring supplies forward from Palanko while the 2/23rd continued the advance on Kuanko. Several isolated pockets of Japanese defenders were located along the track holding and so, while their sister battalion struggled up and down the steep track under the weight of their portage, on 1 December elements of the 2/23rd, leaving their heavy stores and equipment behind, advanced up a steep, muddy slope and set about clearing these positions. The Japanese resistance was overwhelmed and by midday the Australians entered Kuanko. Exploiting beyond the village in the afternoon, the lead Australian company took fire from a ridge line to the north-west and the advance was halted for the day.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vrbanja Bridge was {{an armed}} {{confrontation}} which occurred on 27 May 1995 between United Nations (UN) peacekeepers from the French Army and {{elements of the}} Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). It occurred after the VRS seized French-manned United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) observation posts {{on both ends of}} the Vrbanja Bridge crossing of the Miljacka river in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War. Upon seizing the bridge, the VRS took the French peacekeepers hostage. A platoon of 30 French peacekeepers subsequently re-captured the bridge with the support of 70 French infantrymen and <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> from armoured vehicles, in an action which saw the first French Army bayonet charge since the Korean War. During the French assault, elements of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) opened fire on the VRS-held observation posts, accidentally wounding one French hostage.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{was scheduled}} to begin shortly following the misdirected airstrike, and was to be preceded by an artillery bombardment with high explosive and smoke at 16:00. The American tanks were subsequently moved forward to provide cover, and when the New Zealand artillery failed to fire at the appointed hour, they provided the <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> support. Still in contact, the Australians began to pull back, fighting a number of well-disciplined rearguard actions as the companies leapfrogged each other. Meanwhile, the New Zealand artillery kept the Chinese at bay, after it finally commenced firing. B Company had taken 39 Chinese prisoners during the earlier fighting, and unable to leave these behind, {{they were used to}} carry many of the Australian wounded and much of their equipment as well. O'Dowd's fear that the Chinese might have blocked the withdrawal route was not realised, and B Company moved back along the ridge and down to the ford without incident, reaching the Middlesex area after dark. C Company was the next to withdraw, departing at 16:30, just after suffering another casualty from sniper fire. Saunders led his company up the spur and then south down the main ridge without incident, followed by A Company during the next hour with the Chinese in close pursuit.|$|E
