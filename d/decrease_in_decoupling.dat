However it remains unknown whether modulation of dendritic excitability is controlled by synaptic changes or whether it can be distinct from them. Here we report the first observation of the induction of a persistent plastic <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> dendritic excitability <b>decoupled</b> from synaptic stimulation, which is localized and purely activity-based. In rats this local plasticity decrease is conferred by CamKII mediated phosphorylation of A-type potassium channels upon interaction of a back propagating action potential (bAP) with dendritic depolarization...|$|R
40|$|Distributing {{power and}} {{ground to a}} {{vertically}} integrated system is a complex and difficult task. Interplane communication and power delivery are achieved by through silicon vias (TSVs) {{in most of the}} manufacturing techniques for three-dimensional (3 -D) circuits. As shown in this paper, these vertical interconnects provide additional low impedance paths for distributing power and ground within a 3 -D circuit. These paths, however, have not been considered in the design process of 3 -D power and ground distribution networks. By exploiting these additional paths, the IR drop within each plane is reduced. Alternatively, the routing congestion caused by the TSVs can be decreased by removing stacks of metal vias that are used within a power distribution network. Additionally, the required decoupling capacitance for a circuit can be reduced, resulting in significant savings in area. Case studies of power grids demonstrate a significant reduction of 22 % in the number of intraplane vias. Alternatively, a 25 % <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the <b>decoupling</b> capacitance can be achieved. through the vertical interconnects. Within each plane a power distribution network as in 2 -D circuits provides sufficient current to the devices. In planar (2 -D) circuits, several power distribution networks have been developed with power grids being a commonly used topology [2]. The portion of the power grid implemented with the top metal layers is typically utilized to globally distribute current across the circuit. Multiple stacks of metal vias connecting adjacent metal layers are used to carry the current from the upper to the lower metal layers. The thin and more resistive metal layers (e. g., M 1) are used to locally provide current to the transistors. Ground pad Power pa...|$|R

Despite such developments, characterizing regulation and cerebral representation of mind wandering, which occurs unavoidably during resting-state fMRI scans and may induce variability of the acquired data, remains a work in progress. Here, we demonstrate that a <b>decrease</b> or <b>decoupling</b> <b>in</b> functional connectivity involving the caudate nucleus, insula, medial prefrontal cortex and other domain-specific regions was associated with more sustained mind wandering in particular thought domains during resting-state fMRI. Importantly, our findings suggest that temporal and between-subject variations in functional connectivity of above-mentioned regions might be linked with the continuity of mind wandering. Our study not only provides a preliminary framework for characterizing the maintenance and cerebral representation of different types of mind wandering, but also highlights the importance of taking mind wandering into consideration when studying brain organization with resting-state fMRI in the future...|$|R

30|$|In {{all of the}} models, {{there is}} a strong {{positive}} relationship between increases <b>in</b> <b>decoupled</b> farm payments and market income variation. These results appear to be intuitive given that changes <b>in</b> <b>decoupled</b> payments can be accompanied by changes to the farm size thereby impacting on the farm income variability over the period. In terms of the initial size of the payments, the decoupled subsidy effect is found to be significantly positive for the full sample but is not found to be significant for dairy or tillage farms. This suggests that subsidies are less important in altering the risk profile of the more market-oriented, higher income dairy and tillage farms. Coupled subsidy payments are much smaller and have a much weaker effect on income risk overall. High gross output is also correlated with high income variability. This effect is particularly strong for tillage farms which may use their higher market revenue as a buffer against income variability.|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{heterogeneous}} networks (HetNets) {{are going}} to be one of the key enablers for 5 G. Downlink/Uplink decoupling (DUDe) is a concept in which a mobile device is connected with Macro cell for downlink communication and with small cell for uplink communication in LTE/LTE-A HetNets. It improves uplink data rate, reduces power consumption of devices, balances load between Macro cell and small cells. Due to incorporation of DUDe, a mobile device has to perform separate uplink and downlink handovers unlike traditional handovers in coupled LTE networks. In this paper, we propose various handover schemes for DUDe LTE networks. Apart from this, we have mathematically analysed the received SINR by small cells taken part <b>in</b> <b>decoupling,</b> with respect to a device moving <b>in</b> <b>decoupling</b> regions of these small cells, in multiple cell interference scenario.

Rates could be reliably measured for the 2 main groups, diatoms and prymnesiophytes. Mean phytoplankton intrinsic growth rates were around 0. 23 d− 1, without a significant temporal trend. Mortality rates, however, decreased with time (from ~ 0. 3 to ~ 0. 06 d− 1), leading to an increase <b>in</b> <b>decoupling</b> between phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing. The <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> grazing was correlated with the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> concentrations of small microprotozooplankton (< 60 μm). As a consequence, net growth in the dilution experiments increased from around 0 d− 1 up to 0. 13 d− 1 {{in the last days}} of the experiment, 35 d after the initial iron fertilization. This pattern did not reflect the dynamics of net phytoplankton accumulation in the fertilized patch, which increased until Days 24 to 27 and decreased thereafter. The difference between experimental and natural phytoplankton net growth is the biomass that escapes microzooplankton grazing and does not accumulate in the surface mixed layer, i. e. the biomass that went to higher trophic levels plus that exported out of the mixed layer. It increased throughout EIFEX and suggests a shift from a predominantly recycling system towards a more exporting one. REN 2002 - 12076 -E/ANTVersión del editor 2, 483...|$|R
