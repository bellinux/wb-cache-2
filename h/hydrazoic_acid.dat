50|$|The acid {{is usually}} formed by {{acidification}} of an azide salt like sodium azide. Normally solutions of sodium azide in water contain trace quantities of <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> in equilibrium with the azide salt, but {{introduction of a}} stronger acid can convert the primary species in solution to <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid.</b> The pure acid may be subsequently obtained by fractional distillation as an extremely explosive colorless liquid with an unpleasant smell.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{volatile}} and highly toxic. It has a pungent smell and its vapor can cause violent headaches. The compound {{acts as a}} non-cumulative poison.|$|E
50|$|The all gas-phase iodine laser (AGIL) mixes gaseous <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> with {{chlorine}} {{to produce}} excited nitrogen chloride, {{which is then}} used to cause iodine to lase; this avoids the liquid chemistry requirements of COIL lasers.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} organic azides, this {{compound}} is potentially explosive both in use and in preparation. The hydrochloride salt was initially {{reported to be}} insensitive to impact, vigorous grinding, and prolonged heating at 80 °C, although heating above 150 °C resulted in violent decomposition. Further reported impact studies indicated otherwise, showing the sensitivity {{to be similar to}} RDX. Subsequent reports noted that the hydrochloride salt is hygroscopic, and upon prolonged storage was hydrolyzed to produce <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which made the material sensitive. Synthesis of the HCl salt has led to a significant explosion, with expected explosive byproducts of sulfonyl diazide or <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> being present.|$|E

50|$|Pentamethylantimony {{reacts with}} many very weak acids {{to form a}} tetramethylstibonium salt or tetramethylstibonium {{derivative}} with the acid. Such acids include water (H2O), alcohols, thiols, phenol, carboxylic acids, hydrogen fluoride, thiocyanic acid, <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid,</b> difluorophosphoric acid, thiophosphinic acids, and alkylsilols.|$|E
5000|$|KN3 is {{prepared}} by treating potassium carbonate with <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is generated in situ. [...] In contrast, the analogous sodium azide {{is prepared}} (industrially) by the [...] "Wislicenus process," [...] which proceeds via the reaction sodium amide with nitrous oxide.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Furonitrile, a {{pharmaceutical}} intermediate and potential artificial sweetening agent has been prepared in good yield by treating furfural {{with a mixture}} of <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> (HN3) and perchloric acid in the presence of magnesium perchlorate in the benzene solution at 35 °C.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{properties}} <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{shows some}} analogy to the halogen acids, since it forms poorly soluble (in water) lead, silver and mercury(I) salts. The metallic salts all crystallize in the anhydrous form and decompose on heating, leaving a residue of the pure metal. It is a weak acid (pKa = 4.75.) Its heavy metal salts are explosive and readily {{interact with the}} alkyl iodides. Azides of heavier alkali metals (excluding lithium) or alkaline earth metals are not explosive, but decompose in a more controlled way upon heating, releasing spectroscopically-pure [...] gas. Solutions of <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> dissolve many metals (e.g. zinc, iron) with liberation of hydrogen and formation of salts, which are called azides (formerly also called azoimides or hydrazoates).|$|E
50|$|Hippuric acid {{is readily}} {{hydrolysed}} by hot caustic alkalis to benzoic acid and glycine. Nitrous acid converts it into benzoyl glycolic acid, C6H5C(=O)OCH2CO2H. Its ethyl ester reacts with hydrazine to form hippuryl hydrazine, C6H5CONHCH2CONHNH2, {{which was used}} by Theodor Curtius for the preparation of <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} unusual (and more unstable) salts of hydrazinium is the azide. Hydrazine azide (N5H5), the salt of {{hydrazine}} and <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid,</b> is of scientific interest, because of its high nitrogen content and explosive properties. Structurally, it is [...] It decomposes explosively into hydrazine, ammonia, and nitrogen gas: ...|$|E
5000|$|AGIL was {{developed}} in order to eliminate the problems with aqueous chemistry of the COILs. AGIL uses a reaction of chlorine atoms with gaseous <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid,</b> resulting in excited molecules of chloronitrene (...) , which then pass their energy to the iodine atoms much like the singlet oxygen does in COIL. The iodine atoms then emit the laser radiation itself.|$|E
50|$|Tetrazole {{was first}} {{prepared}} by the reaction of anhydrous <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> and hydrogen cyanide under pressure. Treatment of organic nitriles with sodium azide {{in the presence of}} iodine or silica-supported sodium bisulfate as a heterogeneous catalyst enables an advantageous synthesis of 5-substituted 1H-tetrazoles. 2-Aryl-2H-tetrazoles are synthesized by a 3+2 cycloaddition reaction between an aryl diazonium and trimethylsilyldiazomethane.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium azide is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula NH4N3, being the salt of ammonia and <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Like other inorganic azides, this colourless crystalline salt {{is a powerful}} explosive, although it has a remarkably low sensitivity. NH4N3 is physiologically active and inhalation of small amounts causes headaches and palpitations. It was first obtained by Theodor Curtius in 1890, along with other azides.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} {{industrial}} route involves {{formation of the}} oxime from cyclohexane using nitrosyl chloride. The advantage of this method is that cyclohexane is less expensive than cyclohexanone. In earlier times, caprolactam was prepared by treatment of caprolactone with ammonia.Cyclohexanone with <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> (and H2SO4 or Lewis acid cat.) has also been reported. This {{is known as a}} Schmidt ring expansion.|$|E
50|$|When the {{condition}} of the munitions was originally assessed there was concern that copper azide, an extremely sensitive explosive, would be produced through reaction between lead azide and copper from fuse components (lead azide would react with water vapour, rather than liquid water, to form <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which could react with copper in the detonating cap to form copper azide).|$|E
5000|$|The {{product of}} {{reduction}} reactions with nitrite ion are varied, {{depending on the}} reducing agent used and its strength. With sulfur dioxide, the products are NO and N2O; with tin(II) (Sn2+) the product is hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2); reduction {{all the way to}} ammonia (NH3) occurs with hydrogen sulfide. With the hydrazinium cation (...) the product is <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> (HN3), an explosive compound: ...|$|E
5000|$|Many {{inorganic}} azides can {{be prepared}} directly or indirectly from sodium azide. For example, lead azide, used in detonators, may be prepared from the metathesis reaction between lead nitrate and sodium azide. An alternative route is direct reaction of the metal with silver azide dissolved in liquid ammonia. [...] Some azides are produced by treating the carbonate salts with <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{carboxylic}} acid Schmidt reaction starts with acylium ion 1 obtained from protonation {{and loss of}} water. Reaction with <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> forms the protonated azido ketone 2, which goes through a rearrangement reaction with the alkyl group R, migrating over the C-N bond with expulsion of nitrogen. The protonated isocyanate is attacked by water forming carbamate 4, which after deprotonation loses carbon dioxide to the amine.|$|E
5000|$|The Schmidt {{reaction}} is an organic reaction {{in which an}} azide reacts with a carbonyl group to give an amine or amide, with expulsion of nitrogen. It is named after Karl Friedrich Schmidt (1887-1971), who first reported it in 1924 by successfully converting benzophenone and <b>hydrazoic</b> <b>acid</b> to benzanilide. Surprisingly, the intramolecular reaction wasn't reported until 1991 but has become important in the synthesis of natural products ...|$|E
