5|$|Seabird {{mortality}} {{caused by}} long-line fisheries can be greatly reduced by {{techniques such as}} setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and by using bird scarers, and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets. The international ban on the use of <b>drift</b> <b>nets</b> has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife.|$|E

25|$|<b>Drift</b> <b>nets</b> {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net haulers are usually {{used to set}} and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of <b>drift</b> <b>nets</b> longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, <b>drift</b> <b>nets</b> were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, {{the annual}} global harvest of edible {{jellyfish}} {{was estimated to}} be around 321,000 metric tons. The most prominent countries involved in edible jellyfish production are Burma, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. In China, jellyfish larvae are reared in ponds before being released as juveniles into the sea to grow and mature. In Southeast Asia, edible species of jellyfish may be harvested using various nets such as <b>drift</b> <b>nets,</b> scoop nets, set nets and hand nets, hooks and beach seines. In 2001, the estimated annual catch in Southeast Asia in net weight was at around 169,000 metric tons. The amount of jellyfish caught annually in this region can vary significantly, and the fishing season for them is relatively short, at two to four months.|$|E

500|$|Chinese {{paddlefish}} are {{the closest}} extant relative of American paddlefish. [...] They are currently listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. [...] Several reports {{have suggested that}} Chinese paddlefish may now be extinct. The primary reasons for their decline {{are similar to those}} of American paddlefish and include overfishing, the construction of dams, and destruction of habitat. Unlike the planktivorous American paddlefish, Chinese paddlefish are strong swimmers, grow larger, and are opportunistic piscivores that feed on small fishes and crustaceans. [...] Some distinct morphological differences of Chinese paddlefish include a narrower, sword-like rostrum, and a protrusible mouth. [...] They also have fewer, thicker gill rakers than American paddlefish. The last confirmed sighting of a live Chinese paddlefish was made on the Yangtzee River on January 24, 2003. [...] From 2006 to 2008, scientists conducted surveys in an effort to locate the fish. [...] They used several boats, deployed 4762 setlines, 111 anchored setlines and 950 <b>drift</b> <b>nets</b> covering [...] on the upper Yangtze River, most of which lies within the protected area of the Upper Yangtze National Nature Reserve.

40|$|Abstract. —Pallid {{sturgeon}} Scaphirhynchus albus and shovelnose sturgeon S. platorynchus {{are commonly}} sampled using <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> in the Missouri and Mississippi river basins. Despite {{the fact that}} <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> {{have been used for}} decades to sample these species, {{little is known about the}} capture efficiency of this gear. We estimated conditional capture probability for <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> over known locations of pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon. In addition, we examined several variables that were predicted to influence the success of capturing a pallid sturgeon or shovelnose sturgeon in a <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>net.</b> Conditional capture probability (the conditioning factor was known presence) varied from 0. 37 on the first attempt to 0. 51 on the second attempt. None of the variables measured were useful in explaining the success of sampling a fish in a <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>net.</b> <b>Drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> are relatively efficient, and we suggest that they continue to be used to sample pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon in large turbid rivers. The high variability in catch per unit effort associated with sampling pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon using <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> reported in the literature is probably related to the their low abundance (primarily pallid sturgeon) and patchy distribution (both species). Thus, using sampling designs appropriate for species with low abundance or patchy distributions rather than sampling designs commonly used for abundant species with ubiquitous distributions will require less effort because <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> are relatively efficient...|$|R
