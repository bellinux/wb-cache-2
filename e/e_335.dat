40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the distribution of}} polymorphisms in the endothelin 1 (EDN 1), endothelin receptor A (EDNRA) and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) genes in systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) and SSc subsets. Methods: Two hundred five patients with SSc and 255 healthy controls were screened for polymorphisms in EDN 1, EDNRA, and EDNRB, using sequence-specific primer–polymerase chain reaction. The polymorphisms studied were at the following positions: for EDN 1, − 1370 (T- 1370 G) of the promoter, + 138 of exon 1 (+ 138 A/−), + 85 of exon 3 (E 106 E), and + 23 of exon 5 (K 198 N); for EDNRA, − 231 of exon 1 (G- 231 A), and + 69 (H 323 H) and + 105 (<b>E</b> <b>335</b> E) of exon 6; for EDNRB, + 2841 of exon 2 (EDNRB- 3), − 2547 of exon 3 (EDNRB- 2), and − 2446 of exon 3 (EDNRB- 1). Results: No {{significant differences between the}} SSc group as a whole and control subjects were observed for any of the investigated polymorphisms in EDN 1, EDNRA, and EDNRB. However, compared with patients with limited cutaneous SSc, patients with diffuse skin involvement had an increased frequency of allele carriage of EDNRB- 1 A (76. 8 % versus 54. 4 %; P = 0. 002), EDNRB- 2 A (79. 7 % versus 60. 2 %; P = 0. 006), and EDNRB- 3 G (79. 7 % versus 56. 6 %; P = 0. 001). Significantly increased carriage frequencies for EDNRA alleles H 323 H/C and <b>E</b> <b>335</b> E/A were observed in SSc patients with anti–RNA polymerase (anti-RNAP) antibodies, compared with both anti-RNAP–negative SSc patients (P < 0. 05) and control subjects (P < 0. 005).

40|$|AbstractCystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) apparently forms Cl− {{channels in}} apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells. A detailed model describes molecular structure and biophysical properties of CFTR {{and the impact}} of various mutations as they occur in cystic fibrosis. In the present report mutations were introduced into the putative 6 th α-helical transmembrane pore forming domain of CFTR. The mutants were subsequently expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of the respective cRNAs. Whole cell (wc) conductances could be reversibly activated by IBMX (1 mmol/l) only in oocytes injected with wild-type (wt) or mutant CFTR but not in oocytes injected with water or antisense CFTR. The activated conductance was partially inhibited by (each 100 μmol/l) DIDS (27 %) and glibenclamide (77 %), but not by 10 μmol/l NPPB. The following mutations were examined: K <b>335</b> <b>E,</b> R 347 E, R 334 <b>E,</b> K <b>335</b> H, R 347 H, R 334 H. They did not measurably change the wt-CFTR anion permeability (P) and wc conductance (G) sequence of: PCl− >PBr− >P 1 − and GCl− >GBr− >G 1 −, respectively. Moreover, anomalous mole fraction behavior for the cAMP activated current could not be detected: neither in wt-CFTR nor in R 347 E-CFTR. Various mutants for which positively charged amino acids were replaced by histidines (K 335 H, R 347 H, R 334 H) did not show pH sensitivity of the IBMX activated wc conductance. We, therefore, cannot confirm previous results. CFTR might have a different molecular structure than previously suggested or it might act as a regulator of ion conductances...|$|R

The position and motion of the cut-off point is related to geometrical- and KNO scaling and their violation, in particular {{by the rise of}} the ratio σel/σt. At the LHC energies a change of the regime, connected with the transition from shadowing to antishadowing is expected. The properties of multiplicity distribution of secondaries P(n) at high values n remain one among the topical problems in high-energy physics. As pointed out in a series of recent papers [1], the underlying dynamics behind these rare processes may be quite different from the bulk of events.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study were to {{identify}} the structural components required for arylaminobenzoate block of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel and to determine the involvement of two positively charged amino acid residues, found within the channel, in drug binding. Wild-type and mutant CFTR chloride channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and CFTR currents measured using the two microelectrode voltage clamp. Block of the wild-type CFTR current by 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) -benzoate (NPPB) occurred in a voltage-dependent manner with preferential inhibition of the inward currents (Kd= 166 [*]μM at − 90 [*]mV). Removal of the phenyl ring from the aliphatic chain of NPPB, with the compound 2 -butylamino- 5 -nitrobenzoic acid, caused only a small change in CFTR inhibition (Kd= 243 [*]μM), while addition of an extra phenyl ring at this position (5 -nitro- 2 -(3, 3 -diphenylpropylamino) -benzoic acid) increased drug potency (Kd= 58 [*]μM). In contrast, removal of the benzoate ring (2 -amino- 4 -phenylbutyric acid) or the 5 -nitro group (2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) -benzoic acid) of NPPB severely limited drug block of the wild-type channel. NPPB inhibition of CFTR currents in oocytes expressing the mutants K <b>335</b> <b>E</b> and R 347 E also occurred in a voltage-dependent manner. However, the Kds for NPPB block were increased to 371 and 1573 [*]μM, for the K <b>335</b> <b>E</b> and R 347 E mutants, respectively.

Tools are compared according {{to the influence of}} technological conditions on the cutting forces and the surface quality. It is described by arithmetic roughness. <b>E</b> <b>335</b> GC (11600), X 20 Cr 1 3 (19436) a 102 Cr 6 (14109) materials were machined in hardened and non-hardened condition. Abrasive (grinding) material affects the size of the cutting forces and thus flexibility of technological system and the repeatability of products. High cutting forces are generated when using sintered corundum, and white electrocorundum. Due to the geometry of the abrasive grain is more advantageous to use diamond or cubic boron nitride material. The porosity of the grinding wheel also affects the resulting machine tool load and technological areas. The greater the porosity is, the lower the value of cutting forces is. Unfortunately, with the porosity increases significantly an average roughness. These grinding wheels are suitable for roughing. The higher value of porosity ensures colder cut and smaller heat affected surfaces. Surface quality, while maintaining other process conditions are best when using white electrocorundum, slightly is impaired for other abrasive materials. However, the results are not statistically significant...|$|E

Structural analysis confirmed the R 3 c phase-stabilization in both bulk and nano-NBT. The lattice strain analysis estimated by using W–H plot from the XRD profiles revealed the strain was compressive in NBT-nano. Phonon life times (τ) of Na/Bi–O, Ti–O and TiO 6 phonon modes were decreased in NBT-nano due to the grain size effect. Microstructure of NBT-nano displayed an enormous {{rise in the number}} of grain boundaries than NBT-bulk. Ferroelectric loops became slanted in NBT-nano due to the multi-domain to mono-domain transformation. The mono-domain transition eased the domain reversal and switching, which in-turn lowered the Ec value in NBT-nano (i. e. Ec = 45 kV/cm). The clamping effect caused by grain size reduction in NBT-nano leads to reduced Pr value (Pr = 25. 2 µC/cm 2). The compressive strain developed in the crystal lattice of NBT-nano leads to an increase in Tm (i. <b>e.</b> <b>335</b> °C).

40|$|Carbamylation is {{a general}} process {{involved}} in protein molecular ageing due to the nonenzymatic binding of isocyanic acid, mainly generated by urea dissociation, to free amino groups. In vitro experiments and clinical studies have suggested the potential involvement of carbamylated proteins (CPs) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) complications like atherosclerosis, but their metabolic fate in vivo is still unknown. To address this issue, we evaluated protein carbamylation in the plasma and tissues of control and 75 % nephrectomised C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by LC-MS/MS assay of homocitrulline, the major carbamylation-derived product (CDP). A basal level of carbamylation was evidenced under all conditions, showing that carbamylation is a physiological process of protein modification in vivo. CP plasma concentrations increased in nephrectomized vs. control mice over the 20 weeks of the experiment (<b>e.</b> g. <b>335</b> ± 43 vs. 167 ± 19 μmol homocitrulline/mol lysine (p< 0. 001) 20 weeks after nephrectomy). Simultaneously, CP content increased roughly by two-fold in all tissues throughout the experiment. The progressive accumulation of CPs was specifically noted in long-lived extracellular matrix proteins, especially collagen (e. g. 1264 ± 123 vs. 726 ± 99 μmol homocitrulline/mol lysine (p< 0. 01) in the skin of nephrectomized vs. control mice after 20 weeks of evolution). These results show that chronic increase of urea, as seen in CKD, increases the carbamylation rate of plasma and tissue proteins. These results may {{be considered in the}} perspective of the deleterious effects of CPs demonstrated in vitro and of the correlation evidenced recently between plasma CPs and cardiovascular risk or mortality in CKD patients...|$|R

Os linfócitos são divididos em sub-populações de acordo com sua função e fenótipo, apesar de serem morfologicamente semelhantes. Seus tipos incluem os linfócitos T, linfócitos B e natural killers (NK). Macrófagos são células que derivam da migração dos monócitos sangüíneos para o tecido. Na placenta, os macrófagos desempenham um papel importante na regulação da apoptose, {{prejudicial}} para o desenvolvimento do embrião, e no processo de apresentação antigênica. Pouco se sabe sobre esses leucócitos na placenta bovina, como sua quantidade e onde estão presentes. Desta maneira, este trabalho tem por objetivo principal identificar as populações de linfócitos e macrófagos presentes na placenta bovina utilizando marcadores específicos e citometria de fluxo. Neste estudo, foram utilizados amostras de placentônios e região intercaruncular de vacas nos três diferentes trimestres da gestação (cinco animais de cada trimestre).

Na região interplacentomal a porcentagem de células marcadas com CD 3 + foi 1, 59 %, 1, 25 % para CD 8 +, 0, 38 % para CD 14 + e 0, 39 % para CD 335 +. No terceiro trimestre gestacional, o placentônio apresentou 0, 72 % de células marcadas para CD 3 +, 0, 75 % para CD 8 +, 1, 05 % para CD 14 + e 0, 77 % para CD 335 +.

Com base nos resultados apresentados, podemos concluir que a população de leucócitos na 11 placenta bovina é menos numerosa quando comparada às outras espécies como camundongos e humanos, provavelmente pelo tipo de placenta sinepiteliocorial que constitui uma barreira significativa para o sistema imunológico materno, diminuindo drasticamente a exposição do concepto a ele. Lymphocytes and macrophages are {{the main}} types of leukocytes involved in the maternal-fetal process of tolerance. Lymphocytes may be divided in subpopulations according to their function and phenotype, although being morphologically similar. Its types include the T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and natural killers (NK). Macrophages are cells that derive from the migration of blood monocytes to the tissue. In the placenta, macrophages {{play an important role}} in the regulation of apoptosis which is deleterious to the development of the embryo and in the process of antigen presentation. There are very few references regarding the presence and quantity of leukocytes in the bovine placenta, therefore this project aims to identify lymphocytes and macrophages populations in the bovine placenta by using specific markers and flow cytometry. In this study placentomes and interplacentomal regions of cows in the three trimesters of pregnancy (five animals of each trimester) were used. Cells were incubated with the following monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD 3, anti-CD 8, anti-CD 14,) and anti-CD 335 (uNK) and evaluated by flow cytometry. In the first trimester of pregnancy, for the placentome, the average percentage of cells marked CD 3 + was 2. 37 %, CD 8 + 2. 39 %,, CD 14 + 1. 16 % and CD 335 + 0. 78 %. For the interplacentomal region the percentage of CD 3 + was 3. 43 %, CD 8 + 4. 41 %, CD 14 + 3. 91 %, and CD 335 + 0. 56 %. In second trimester of pregnancy, the placentome presented 0. 63 % of cells marked with CD 3 +, 0. 62 % of CD 8 +, 0. 34 % of CD 14 + and 0. 55 % of CD 335 +. In the interplacentomal region the percentage of cells marked with CD 3 + was of 1. 59 %, 1. 25 % of CD 8 +, 0. 38 % of CD 14 % and 0. 39 % of CD 335 +. In the third trimester of pregnancy, the placentomes had presented 0. 72 % of cells marked with CD 3 +, 0. 75 % of CD 8 +, 1. 05 % of CD 14 + and 0. 77 % of CD 335 +.

Based on the presented results, we can conclude that the leukocytes population in the bovine placenta is less 13 numerous than those described for other species like mouse and human, probably because it is a sinepithelial type placenta that constitutes a significant barrier to the maternal immunological system, diminishing drastically the conceptus antigen exposition to it...|$|R

40|$|D-Glutamic acid is an {{essential}} component of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Very little is known concerning the genetics and biochemistry of D-glutamate production in most bacteria, including Escherichia coli. Evidence is presented in this report for the roles of two distinct genes in <b>E.</b> coli WM <b>335,</b> a strain which is auxotrophic for D-glutamate. The first gene, which restores D-glutamate independence in WM 335, was mapped, cloned, and sequenced. This gene, designated dga, is a previously reported open reading frame, located at 89. 8 min on the E. coli map. The second gene, gltS, is located at 82 min. gltS encodes a protein that is involved in the transport of D- and L-glutamic acid into E. coli, and the gltS gene of WM 335 was found to contain two missense mutations. To construct D-glutamate auxotrophs, it is necessary to transfer sequentially the mutated gltS locus, and then the mutated dga locus into the recipient. The sequences of the mutant forms of both dga and gltS are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Mutations {{affecting}} the p 62 signalling adapter protein are {{commonly found in}} patients with the skeletal disorder Paget‟s disease of bone (PDB). We have extended previous in vitro functional analyses of PDB-mutant p 62 proteins (Cavey et al., 2006) to {{study the effects of}} several uncharacterised PDB-associated mutations on the ubiquitin-binding properties of p 62. These include mutations which affect regions of p 62 outside of the ubiquitin-binding UBA domain (A 381 V, D <b>335</b> <b>E</b> and a mutant equivalent to a predicted product of the G 1205 C splice-site mutation which lacks amino acids 351 - 388), as well as a double mutation involving the P 392 L and S 399 P changes on the same allele. In accordance with previous findings, both of the non-UBA domain mutations (A 381 V, ∆ 351 - 388) showed deleterious effects on ubiquitin-binding by p 62 in pull-down assays, further emphasising the important role of non-UBA domain sequences in mediating ubiquitin-recognition, as well as in PDB aetiology. The D <b>335</b> <b>E</b> mutant retained its ubiquitin-binding function in vitro. The P 392 L/S 399 P double mutant showed a more severe effect on ubiquitin-binding than either of the single P 392 L or S 399 P missense mutations alone; as this double mutation is associated with a particularly severe phenotype, our findings are supportive of the proposal that disease severity in PDB with p 62 mutations may be directly related to the effects of the mutations on the ubiquitin-binding function of the p 62 protein. Since the in vitro pull-down assays are semi-quantitative at best, we sought to investigate if a more quantitative biophysical approach, two dimensional Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (2 D-HSQC) protein NMR, might be applied to investigate the effects of PDB-associated mutations on protein (ubiquitin-binding) function. Our results showed that protein NMR was not optimal to quantitatively assess the effects of the mutations on the interaction between p 62 and ubiquitin in vitro. Using confocal microscopy, co-transfection of U 20 S cells showed that the selected PDB-associated p 62 mutants (A 381 V, P 392 L, G 425 R) co-localised with ubiquitin with a cellular phenotype indistinguishable from wild type, as each PDB mutant formed cytoplasmic bodies with an area ranging from the detection limit of the microscope to 40 μm 2 or higher; in contrast the E 396 X truncating mutant did not form cytoplasmic bodies nor co-localise with ubiquitin. In addition to interacting with ubiquitin, p 62 also interacts with the LC 3 (an autophagic marker) through its LC 3 interacting region (LIR) to mediate the formation of autophagosomes. By co-transfecting p 62 constructs with LC 3 We found that some of the p 62 -positive cytoplasmic bodies were autophagosomes, and that the D <b>335</b> <b>E</b> mutation of p 62 (which lies within the LIR) did not appear to affect the formation of autophagosomes. The effects of the wild type and PDB-mutant p 62 proteins on NF-κB signalling were assessed in HEK 293 cells co-transfected with an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct. A 381 V mutant p 62 produced a level of activation of NF-κB signalling greater than wildtype and similar to that of UBA domain mutants, indicating that non-UBA and UBA domain mutations may exert their effects through a common mechanism involving dysregulated NF-κB signalling. To further examine the function of p 62 in the regulation of NF-κB signalling, we went on to determine possible effects of PDB-associated mutations on p 62 -CYLD (a DUB enzyme) interactions. Unexpectedly we found that CYLD expression appears to abrogate the formation of the p 62 cytoplasmic bodies previously shown to be ubiquitin-positive. Finally, we went on to study the interaction of p 62 (and its PDB mutants) with another important regulator of NF-κB signalling, IKKγ/NEMO. We concluded that wild type and PDB-mutant p 62 proteins are capable of recruiting NEMO to cytoplasmic bodies which may represent autophagosomes, but do not appear to accelerate its degradation...|$|R

40|$|Neutralization escape mutant {{has played}} an {{important}} role in antigenic evolution of various virus-causing diseases. DENV, the causative agent of dengue has been shown to escape antibody neutralization, thereby causing an epidemic outbreak. The pattern through which DENV escape neutralization that leads to antigenic evolution, however, has not been thoroughly investigated in hyper endemic countries. It is hypothesized that, the highly susceptible DENV demonstrates a clear pattern of antigenic evolution from being minor strains (less frequent during an outbreak) to dominant strains (very frequent during an outbreak). This suggests that the minor strains may act as a springboard for the emergence of more virulent dominant strains by acquiring some characteristics of the minor strains. Hence, the overall objective of the present study is to provide an insight into the antigenic evolution of DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 in Malaysia. To investigate this possibility, the present study used truncated DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 recombinant E, cloned and expressed on phage M 13 g 3 p attachment protein. Using site-directed mutagenesis, six single mutations were engineered separately onto the respective recombinant E gene. Effects of these mutations on binding to insects and mammalian cells were determined in vitro. The polyclonal antibodies generated against these recombinant proteins in BALB/c mice were used in microneutralization and Foci Reduction Neutralization Test to evaluate neutralizing antibody determinant associated with antigenic evolution. Serial propagation in vitro was adopted to handpick the neutralization escape mutant in the sub-neutralizing antibody concentration. To evaluate potential host where the selection occurs, the escape mutant were adapted to mimic mosquito and human cycle in vitro. Finding from the present study shows that two mutations (E 272 and E 390) on DENV- 1 E were demonstrated to affect binding of the recombinant proteins to C 6 / 36 mosquito and Vero cells. Polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant E 272 and E 390 proteins exhibited decreased binding to DENV- 1 virion. The polyclonal antibodies reduced the number of DENV- 1 foci formed up to four-folds for the five endemic DENV- 1 strains (GIa, GIb, GIc, GII and GIII) tested. Two DENV- 1 isolates likely to escape neutralization were identified; D 1. 10245 (GII) and D 1. 11177 (GIb). In DENV- 2, mutations on E 52, E 164 and E 393 were demonstrated to affect binding of the recombinant proteins to C 6 / 36 mosquito and Vero cells. Polyclonal antibodies generated in mice against recombinant E 52, E 164 and E 176 exhibited decreased binding to DENV- 2 (Asian 1 strain) and E 164 and <b>E</b> <b>335</b> on one of the Cosmopolitan strain. The polyclonal antibodies against E 52, E 71, <b>E</b> <b>335</b> and E 393 reduced the number of foci formed up to four-folds for Cosmopolitan DENV- 2 strains tested. The E 52 and E 71 substitutions select isolates likely to escape neutralization in both Cosmopolitan strain (D 2. 14245 and D 2. 1877347) and Asian 1 strain (D 2. 16041). Evidence from the present study show that the neutralization escape strains from DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 alternating between two different hosts adapts differently. The observed difference in DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 on C 6 / 36 and Vero cells was evident in the variation in amino acid residues on E. Of these 6 mutations engineered on DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 recombinant E, substitution on EDI/EDII junction are likely to facilitates antigenic evolution of DENV- 1 (E 272) and DENV- 2 (E 52 and E 71) in Malaysia. Overall, the study identified dominant DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 strains expected to evolve in Malaysian natural population in the future. The antigenic determinants involved were identified. The result of the study directly underlines the effects of these mutations on naturally emerging DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 in Malaysian population and its implications on dengue affliction and vaccines design...|$|E
40|$|The tryptophanyl {{fluorescence}} decays of two myoglobins, i. e., {{sperm whale}} and tuna myoglobin, {{have been examined}} in the frequency domain with an apparatus which utilizes the harmonic content of a mode-locked laser. Data analysis was performed in terms of continuous distribution of lifetime having a Lorentzian shape. Data relative to sperm whale myoglobin, which possesses two tryptophanyl residues, i. e., Trp-A- 5 and -A- 12, provided a broad lifetime distribution including decay rates from a few picoseconds to about 10 ns. By contrast, the tryptophanyl lifetime distribution of tuna myoglobin, which contains only Trp-A- 12, showed two well-separated and narrow Lorentzian components having centers at about 50 ps and 3. 37 ns, respectively. In both cases, the χ 2 obtained from distribution analysis was lower than that provided by a fit using the sum of exponential components. The long-lived components present in the fluorescence decay of the two myoglobins do not correspond to any of those observed for the apoproteins at neutral pH. The tryptophanyl lifetime distribution of sperm whale apomyoglobin consists of two separated Lorentzian components centered at 2. 25 and 5. 4 ns, whereas that of tuna apomyoglobin consists of a single Lorentzian component, whose center is at 2. 19 ns. Acidification of apomyoglobin to pH 3. 5 produced a shift of the distribution centers toward longer lifetimes. The similarity between {{the values of the}} distribution centers of the long-lived components observed in the fluorescence decay of native myoglobins and those observed for apomyoglobins at acidic pH suggests that the long-lived component might arise from a conformational state (different from the native state) in which geometrical factors preclude energy transfer via Forster coupling from tryptophan to heme. This possibility has been further supported by the identification, in the steady-state emission spectrum of tuna myoglobin, of a component having an emission maximum similar to that observed at acidic pH, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>335</b> – 337 nm. The difference between the tryptophanyl lifetime distributions of the two native holoproteins has been explained in terms of a higher degree of structural flexibility of tuna globin compared to that of sperm whale myoglobin. © 1989, American Chemical Society.

The clinical features (age, gender, season distribution, prodromal symptom) and laboratory data were analyzed retrospectively. The stratification analysis was performed {{in the two groups}} according to the degree of hepatic fibrosis (APRI ratio index), HBV infection and cirrhosis status. The risk factors affecting the outcome were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results　The mean age of patients of HE group (43. 8 ± 15. 4) was older than that of HA group (32. 0 ± 13. 0, P= 8. 045 × 10 - 11). Male patients were predominant in the two groups, and male/female ratio was higher in HE group (P= 2. 139 × 10 - 4). High prevalence was found within the period of February to April. Except for a higher total bilirubin (Tbil) level (P< 0. 05) and lower incidence of fever, nausea and vomiting (P< 0. 05) in HE group, {{there was no difference in}} other clinical manifestations between the two groups. Compared with those without cirrhotic, cirrhosis patients co-infected with HA or HE showed an increased Tbil, decreased PTA and Alb, prolonged ALT and Tbil recovery time, higher incidence of hepatic decompensation and related complications, and higher mortality (P< 0. 05). Liver injury was more marked in patients with chronic liver disease who were infected with HAV or HEV with exacerbation of previous liver fibrosis. Alcohol consumption, age and chronic HBV infection were risk factors for liver decompensation in patients with cirrhosis associated with HE. Conclusion　Sporadic acute icteric HA and HE showed similar clinical features, but different in age distribution and jaundice index. Its coexistence with HA or HE can cause severe liver decompensation, the degree of which is associated with basal liver fibrosis status. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2014. 09. 1...|$|R

Infections with hepatitis B and C viruses {{constitute a}} significant {{public health problem}} worldwide. More than 350 million people are chronically infected with HBV and 170 million by HCV. In Brazil, HBV remains endemic despite widespread vaccination with prevalence of infection ranging from ( 7 %) in different regions. Prevalence of HCV infection in Brazil has been estimated at 1. 5 %. Recent studies have shown considerable genetic variation among HBV isolates, confirming the diversity of circulating genotypes of the virus {{and the emergence of}} mutations in the viral genome that may impact on therapeutic and immune response. Information on the genetic diversity of HBV is useful for molecular epidemiology to determine risk factors associated with the spread of the virus and to inform prevention strategies and for monitoring therapy. Because there is no vaccine available to prevent HCV infection and treatment is extremely expensive for public agencies, HCV is an emerging public health problem. The treatment efficiency is directly related to viral genotype. In this study molecular epidemiology tools were used to characterize HBV and HCV in the North and Northeast, particularly in Bahia, through DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Samples from Bahia, Acre, Rond??nia, Amazonas, Maranh??o and Tocantins were analyzed. The samples were collected in collaboration with other studies and centers of references for hepatitis treatments. 635 samples from HCV infected patients and 335 samples from HBV infected were evaluated. Sequences of the regions pre-S / S, HBV core / pre-core, NS 5 B, 5 UTR, HCV Core and E 1 were used for genotypic classification and phylogenetic analysis. The most frequent HBV genotypes were A (57 %), D (10 %) and F (33 %) in Bahia and in the samples from the North region. Fifty five percent of the patients from Rond??nia were coinfected with HBV and HDV. In this study, we were unable to establish a connection with the particular genotype evolution of the infection and determine the presence of mutants related to therapeutic response and immune escape. In the North region co-infection with HBV genotype F and D virus is strongly associated with poor outcome of the disease as informed by the physicians and literature. Regarding HCV, the subtyping of isolates was performed by sequencing the NS 5 B region and 5 UTR (n= 230). The sub-genotypes more frequent were 1 a (45. 6 %), 1 b (46. 9 %), 3 a (6. 5 %) and 2 a / b (0. 8 %).

CDM prevalence and effects on virologic responses were analyzed retrospectively using clinical data. The effects on etravirine susceptibility were assessed in clinical samples and confirmed using site-directed mutants. The most prevalent CDMs (> 10 %) were A 371 V, E 399 D, A 376 S, N 348 I, A 360 T, G 333 E, and L 283 I. CDM presence {{was positively correlated}} with thymidine analogue-associated mutations, but not with NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). The presence or number of CDMs did not significantly reduce etravirine susceptibility, although small reductions were seen in samples with G 333 D, N 348 I, A 360 V, T 369 I, and A 376 S. N 348 I, E 399 G, and N 348 I/T 369 I were associated with reduced etravirine susceptibility when present with K 103 N, L 100 I, or Y 181 C. N 348 I or T 369 I was associated with reduced etravirine susceptibility when present with K 101 P or K 103 R/V 179 D. Virologic responses to an etravirine-containing regimen were slightly diminished when G 333 D, G 335 D, or A 376 S was present, but this was not confirmed in subgroups with higher baseline resistance or without etravirine RAMs. CDMs alone do not confer substantial reductions in etravirine susceptibility but can further reduce etravirine susceptibility in combination with certain NNRTI mutations. Since virologic responses to etravirine were not affected by CDMs, the clinical impacts of these mutations on etravirine susceptibility appear to be minimal...|$|R

Of <b>335</b> <b>E.</b> coli clones, 90 (27 %) were recovered from multiple hosts (up to 11 per clone). Within-household strain sharing (1) involved 68 % of households, including 3 of 5 households in which amember had a UTI; (2) was more frequent than across-household strain sharing (27 % vs. 0. 8 % of potential sharing pairs; P. 001); (3) increased with household size (r 2 0. 93; P. 001); and (4) varied by host-pair type (pet-pet, 58 %; human-human, 31 %; human-pet, 17 %).

Other mutants found {{to be important in}} substrate plasminogen activation were, namely, R 319 H, N 339 S, K 334 A, K 334 <b>E,</b> and L <b>335</b> Q. When examined for their 1 : 1 interaction with human plasmin, these mutants were found to retain the native-like high affinity for plasmin and also to generate amidolytic activity with partner plasminogen {{in a manner similar to}} wild type streptokinase. Moreover, cofactor activities of the mutants precomplexed with plasmin against microplasminogen as the substrate as well as in silico modeling studies suggested that the region 315 – 340 of the γ domain interacts with the serine protease domain of the macromolecular substrate. Overall, our results identify the presence of a substrate specific exosite in the γ domain of streptokinase...|$|R

O manejo da irrigação e a quantificação da demandaevapotranspirométrica foram realizados mediante o cálculo diário do balanço de água no solo, utilizando-se a técnica da TDR e dados coletados em estação meteorológica automática. Verificou-se que a ETc acumulada aos 181 dias após transplantio (DAT) foi de 363 <b>e</b> de <b>335</b> mm, para PC e PD, respectivamente. Os kc’s encontrados foram de 0, 32; 1, 18 e 0, 77 e de 0, 34; 1, 05 e 0, 86, para os sistemas PC e PD, nas fases de crescimento inicial (0 - 40 DAT), média (81 - 120 DAT) e final (181 DAT), respectivamente. Os valores encontrados de kc para a cultura do pimentão para o sistema PC foram semelhantes aos valorespreconizados pela FAO, sendo, no entanto, não-recomendados para PD. Considerando-se a lâmina total aplicada (chuva e irrigação), os valores médios de EUA foram de 3, 9 e 4, 5 kg m- 3 para PC e PD, respectivamente. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the crop evapotranspiration (ETc), crop coefficients (kc) and water-use efficiency (EUA) of the bell pepper crop in the no till system (PD) and conventional tillage system (PC), in the Fluminense Valley, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The irrigation was managed and the evapotranspiration demand quantified by calculating the daily soil water balance using the TDR technique and data collected in an automatic meteorological station. It was verified that the accumulated ETc at 181 days after planting (DAT) was 363 and 335 mmfor PD and PC, respectively. The kcs obtained were 0. 32, 1. 18 and 0. 77 and 0. 34, 1. 05 and 0. 86, for the PD and PC systems, respectively, in the initial (0 - 40 DAP), middle (81 - 120 DAP) and final (181 DAP) growth phases, respectively. The kc values for the bell pepper crop presented by FAO were similar to the values found for the PC, but are not recommended for PD. Considering the total depth applied (rain and irrigation), the average values of water use efficiency were 3. 9 and 4. 5 kg m- 3 for PD and PC, respectively...|$|R

Entre 1971 <b>e</b> 1986, <b>335</b> pacientes receberam, no The Hospital for Sick Children, de Londres, condutos extracardíacos para o lado direito do coração; 176 destes foram homoenxertos aórticos, preservados em solução antibióticonutriente; 140 heteroenxertos (Hancock, Ross, Carpentier-Edwards, lonescu-Shiley e 19 tubos não valvulados. Estes condutos foram usados na correção de defeitos cardíacos complexos. A idade média foi de 6, 34 anos e o peso médio, de 17, 8 kg. O diâmetro interno dos condutos variou de 8 a 30 mm. A mortalidade hospitalar foi de 29, 2 % e o seguimento dos sobrevivente teve uma duração máxima de 14, 3 anos, sendo que apenas 40 % delas foram relacionadas ao conduto extracardíaco. A curva atuarial, livre de obstrução, dos condutos extracardíacos foi significativa, quando se analisaram os homoenxertos, face a cada grupo de heteroenxertos (p The {{concept of}} using extracardiac conduits, to {{establish}} an outflow tract between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery was developed on the sixties. Between 1971 and 1986, 335 patients received extracardiac conduits for the right heart, at The Hospital for Sick Children, London; 176 were antibiotic preserved aortic homografts (Hancock, Ross, Carpentier-Edwards, lonescu-Shiley) and 19 non-valved tubes. These conduits {{were used for the}} repair of complex congenital heart defects. The mean age of these groups was 6. 34 ± 4. 6 years and the mean weight 17. 8 ± 10. 8 kg. The internal diameter of the conduits varied from 8 to 30 mm. The hospital mortality was 29. 2 % and long-term follow-up of the survivals had a maximum period of 14, 39 years. Sixty patients (17. 9 %) were submited to 60 reoperations, being only 40 % conduit related. The actuarial survival cun/e of freedom from obstruction was significant when analyzed the homografts, without Dacron, versus each group of heterografts (p < 0. 005). The more important risk factors were the number of postoperative complications, for late deaths; the severity of associated lesions for reoperation, the date of surgery for the replacement of the extracardiac conduit, and the date of surgery and severity of associated lesions for the obstruction of the extracardiac conduits. We conclude that on long-term the use of extracardiac valved conduits has good results specially when using antibiotic preserved aortic homografts and therefore they are our first choice in the reconstruction of the pulmonary ventricle outflow tract...|$|R
