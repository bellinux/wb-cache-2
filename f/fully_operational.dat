MRC developed a new model representation algorithm that uses a hierarchical, correlated function expansion containing {{a finite number of}} terms. A full expansion of this type is an exact representation of the original model and each of the expansion functions is explicitly calculated using the original model. After calculating the expansion functions, they are assembled into a <b>fully</b> equivalent <b>operational</b> model (FEOM) that can directly replace the original mode...|$|R

5|$|Permission for Blyth A Power Station {{to be built}} {{was granted}} in February 1955, and its {{construction}} took place between 1955 and 1960. The station's first unit went into operation in December 1958, and the A Station was <b>fully</b> <b>operational</b> by June 1960. Its four 120MW sets were the first commissioned in Britain of what became for a time that standardised size. The construction of the B Station began on 4December 1961. Its first unit was commissioned in December 1962, {{and the rest of}} the station was <b>fully</b> <b>operational</b> by September 1966. The station had a total generating capacity of 1,730MW, the highest of any site in the UK until later in the same year, when Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation. Blyth B was the first power station in Britain to have 275MW sets installed. Its two 350MW sets were an intermediate stage toward the 500MW standard, so very few of the 350MW sets were ever commissioned in the UK. Both of the stations were designed by L J Couves & Partners. They were engineered by Merz & McLellan and built by the Cleveland Bridge Company.|$|E
