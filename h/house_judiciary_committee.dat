5|$|Emanuel Celler (D-NY), Chair of the <b>House</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee,</b> {{introduced}} the Voting Rights Act in the House of Representatives on March 19, 1965 as H.R. 6400. The <b>House</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee</b> {{was the first}} committee to consider the bill. The committee's ranking Republican, William McCulloch (R-OH), generally supported expanding voting rights, but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula, and he led opposition to the bill in committee. The committee eventually approved the bill on May 12, {{but it did not}} file its committee report until June 1. The bill included two amendments from subcommittee: a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote, and a prohibition of all poll taxes. The poll tax prohibition gained Speaker of the House John McCormack's support. The bill was next considered by the Rules Committee, whose chair, Howard W. Smith (D-VA), opposed the bill and delayed its consideration until June 24, when Celler initiated proceedings to have the bill discharged from committee. Under pressure from the bill's proponents, Smith allowed the bill to be released a week later, and the full House started debating the bill on July 6.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal battle}} over the tapes {{continued}} through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations {{between him and his}} aides. The <b>House</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee</b> opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks.

5|$|While the <b>House</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee</b> {{hearings}} {{ended in}} a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but {{with a handful of}} Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.|$|E
5|$|During Bush's second term, a {{controversy}} arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House {{maintained that the}} U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other {{senior members of the}} Justice Department. The <b>House</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee</b> issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.|$|E

5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The <b>House</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>committee,</b> chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E
