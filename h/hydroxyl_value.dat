We then characterized the polyester-polyamine structure by NMR spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). We also determined the basic char-acterizations such as total acid numbers (TAN) (5. 0 − 67. 5 mgKOH/g), <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>values</b> (27. 1 − 67. 5 mgKOH/g), and molar masses (Mn = 1. 6 − 8. 4 kg mol − 1) for the polyester and total base numbers (TBN) (15. 3 − 57. 1 mgKOH/g), <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>values</b> (33. 0 − 79. 8 mgKOH/g), and nitrogen contents (1. 02 − 3. 48 %) for the polyester-polyamine polymers.

The investigation involved the synthesis and mechanical testing of a series of unsaturated polyester resins and the incorporation of these resins into sheet moulding compounds (SMC) with their subsequent testing. Two main structural parameters were varied, firstly the degree of unsaturation of the resin (i. e. maleic:phthalic ratio), and secondly the amount of diol excess added to the reaction vessel during the resin synthesis thereby varying the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>value</b> of the resin. It was found that the properties of the resins, both structural and mechanical, were interdependent. Altering the maleic:phthalic ratio was found to effect the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>value,</b> notch sensitivity, shrinkage, and modulus of the resin. Low resin hydroxyl values were found to give SMC with low tensile strength and low fracture toughness. Unusually high hydroxyl values enhanced the toughness but the SMC did not show the expected increase in tensile strength.

Mechanism of reaction will start at ozone attack and break the double bonds(C=C) of unsaturated fatty acid in the waste,and then hydroxyl groups of alcohol can made contact to produce polyol. The main purpose of experiment is to determine the optimum condition for making polyol with ozonolysis technology. The experiment will be carried out by vary temperature of ozonolysis reaction, mol ratio of oil-alcohol,reaction time and ozone concentration. The result of experiment show that <b>hydroxyl</b> number <b>values</b> of polyol vary from 92. 75 to 265. 62 and viscosity values vary from 9. 228 to 20. 403 cp. The optimum condition determined by response optimization program,and from experiment show that converting edible oil waste to polyol will be efficient with temperature 25 'C, 3 hours reaction time, l: 7 for oil and alcohol mol ratio and ozone concentration 6. 3...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} metal-containing epoxy {{polymers}} have been synthesized by the condensation of epichlorohydrin (1 -chloro- 2, 3 -epoxy propane) with Schiff base metal complexes in alkaline medium. Schiff base was initially {{prepared by the}} reaction of 2, 6 dihydroxy 1 -napthaldehyde and o-phenylenediamine in 1 [*][*]:[*][*] 2 molar ratio and then with metal acetate. All the synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental, spectral, and thermal analysis. The physicochemical properties, viz., epoxy <b>value,</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> content, and chlorine content [mol/ 100 [*]g] were measured by standard procedures. The antimicrobial activities of these metal-containing epoxy polymers were carried out by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods against S. aureus, B. subtilis (Gram-positive bacteria), and E. coli, P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria). It {{was found that the}} ECu(II) showed higher antibacterial activity than other metal-chelated epoxy resin while EMn(II) exhibited reduced antibacterial activity against all bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Reactive oxygen {{metabolites}} are potent inflammatory mediators {{that may}} be involved in tissue injury in inflammatory bowel disease. To evaluate their role in inflammatory bowel disease, we investigated the effects of lowering the activities of reactive oxygen metabolites in experimental colitis induced by intracolonic administration of acetic acid in rats. Intracolonic administration of 5 % acetic acid caused severe inflammation (mean (SEM) inflammatory score was 24. 3 (0. 7) of a maximum score of 32). Acetic acid at 2. 5 % produced moderate inflammation (score = 17 (1. 4) v 4. 0 (0. 5) in control rats). This lower dose was used for subsequent experiments. Specific superoxide anion scavenger methoxypolyethylene glycol:superoxide dismutase, and reactive oxygen metabolites scavenger, sulfasalazine, significantly decreased the severity of inflammation (scores: 8 (4. 4) and 9. 8 (2. 2) respectively). The xanthine oxidase inhibitors, tungsten and pterin aldehyde, failed to improve inflammation but another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, a compound with known superoxide anion scavenging effect, did limit the inflammation (10 (2)). Inhibition of hydroxyl radical production by deferoxamine or lowering <b>hydroxyl</b> radical <b>values</b> by a scavenger, dimethyl sulfoxide, did not affect the severity of inflammation. These data suggest: (1) that reactive oxygen metabolites {{play an important role in}} experimental colitis, (2) that the xanthine oxidase pathway is not a major source of reactive oxygen metabolites in colitis, and (3) that tissue injury in experimental colitis is not caused by generation of hydroxyl radicals...|$|R
