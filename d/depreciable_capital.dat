The court cited Illinois Merchants Trust Co., Executor, 4 B.T.A. 103, at page 106, where it found that a [...] "repair is an expenditure for the purpose of keeping the property in an ordinarily efficient operating condition. It does not add to the value of the property nor does it appreciably prolong its life." [...] On the other hand, <b>depreciable</b> <b>capital</b> expenditures are those [...] "for replacements, alterations, improvements, or additions which prolong the life of the property, increase its value, or make it adaptable to a different use." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the various methodologies for estimating marginal effective tax rates applying to investment decisions. The conceptual framework is developed for {{several types of}} investment decisions, including <b>depreciable</b> <b>capital,</b> inventories, and depletable assets. The analysis involves incorporating personal and corporate taxes into the neo-classical theory of the firm. Some of the theoretical issues are discussed including the treatment of adjustment costs, nonprice-taking behaviour, {{and the implications of}} an open economy. The problems involved with implementing effective tax rates empirically are discussed. These include the arbitrage assumption, the treatment of risk, the treatment of firms temporarily in a non-taxable position, and data problems, including problems of aggregation. A number of illustrative calculations are presented using Canadian data. ...|$|E

The starting point for construction of a measure of capital input is the measurement of capital stock. Estimates of <b>depreciable</b> <b>capital</b> are derived by representing capital stock at each point of time as a weighted sum of past investments. The weights correspond to the relative efficiencies of capital goods of different ages, so that the weighted components of capital stock have the same efficiency. Estimates of the stock of land are derived from balance sheet data. We convert estimates of capital stock into estimates of capital service flows by means of capital rental prices. Comparisons of levels of capital input among countries require data on relative prices of capital input. We obtain relative price levels for capital input via relative investment goods prices, {{taking into account the}} flow of capital input per unit of capital stock in each country...|$|E
40|$|The {{tax holiday}} - an {{incentive}} frequently used {{in developing countries}} to encourage capital investments - offers benefits for short-term investments but could in fact penalize long-term capital investments. For some countries with high inflation rates and relatively fast writeoffs for <b>depreciable</b> <b>capital,</b> the effective tax rate on long-term investments is higher during the tax holiday than after. For one thing the tax law may require assets to be depreciated during the holiday. If so, the value of tax depreciation writeoffs may be lower than the true economic cost of depreciation. For another the tax benefit of nominal interest deductions associated with debt financing of capital are of no value to the firm during the holiday - whereas after the holiday they may be quite beneficial. After estimating the effective tax rates on capital for holiday and post holiday investments, the author concludes that for some countries the effecctive tax rate on long-term capital is higher during the holiday than after.

40|$|Investment-to-GDP ratios {{across the}} Caribbean {{tend to be}} {{relatively}} high. In many countries, these ratios have been trending higher since the mid- 1990 s, largely reflecting public investment and foreign direct investment. Private domestic investors have been less prominent. This {{may be one reason}} why such high investment has delivered Caribbean growth rates below the middle-income average. This paper seeks to understand how higher private investment may be encouraged. Using new data, it concludes that: the multiplier effects of public investment and FDI on private domestic investment are weak; and private domestic investment (PDI) is sensitive to the cost of capital. Public policy designed to raise PDI should focus on creating conditions for a lower cost of capital. The focus should be on removing barriers to lower real interest rates, rather than the further extension of costly tax concessions.
