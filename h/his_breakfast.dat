25|$|He is the {{national}} Patron for Dry July, having supported the cause ever since it began, prompted by {{a phone call to}} <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> radio show in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Cowell {{typically}} works {{into the}} morning, wakes up at noon and has breakfast in bed. <b>His</b> <b>breakfast</b> consists {{of hot water}} with lemon, papaya juice with lime, oatmeal, tea, and health smoothies.

5000|$|Jal {{completed}} a 661-day [...] "Lose to Win" [...] fast {{to build a}} school in Leer, Southern Sudan, in Emma McCune's honour. From December 2008 to October 2010, the musician ate one meal per day, skipping <b>his</b> <b>breakfasts</b> and lunches to raise funds and awareness for the school, called Emma Academy.|$|R
25|$|He ate two {{meals a day}} {{and avoided}} snacks. <b>His</b> <b>breakfast,</b> after working out for two hours, {{consisted}} of hard-boiled egg whites, a cup of broth, oatmeal with soy milk, and seasonal fruit. For dinner, {{he and his wife}} typically ate raw vegetables, egg whites, and fish. He did not drink coffee.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{approached}} Diana, Princess of Wales {{and made}} two allegations. He repeated his allegation {{that he had}} been raped. He also claimed to have witnessed the Princess's estranged husband, the Prince of Wales, lying in bed with his aide, Michael Fawcett, on one occasion when he brought the Prince <b>his</b> <b>breakfast.</b> Diana made a tape of the interview. The whereabouts of the tape became a matter of considerable controversy following Diana's death in August 1997.|$|E
25|$|The slam of Cox's {{dressing}} room door awakens Box, who suddenly remembers his bacon. When {{he sees a}} mutton chop on the gridiron, he assumes it is Bouncer's, and throws it out the window, hitting a pedestrian outside. He once again puts the bacon on the fire, and goes to his {{dressing room}} to retrieve <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> utensils. The slam of Boxâ€™s dressing room door sends Cox scurrying back in, assuming it {{is the sound of}} someone knocking. Seeing the bacon on the gridiron once again, he tosses it out the window, hitting the pedestrian for a second time.|$|E
50|$|For <b>his</b> final <b>breakfast,</b> he ate pancakes, fried eggs, sausage patties and milk.|$|R
60|$|He was stout, or, as some term it, lusty; in all probability, therefore, he was {{advanced}} in life, some people expanding {{as they grow}} old. By <b>his</b> <b>breakfasting</b> rather late, and in his own room, {{he must be a}} man accustomed to live at his ease, and above the necessity of early rising; no doubt a round, rosy, lusty old gentleman.|$|R
50|$|John Stapleton {{left the}} show in July, marking the end of <b>his</b> ITV <b>Breakfast</b> career.|$|R
25|$|Box enters, {{after a brief}} offstage altercation with Cox on the staircase. After dismissing Bouncer, {{he takes}} out a bread roll, lights the fire, and puts a rasher of bacon on the gridiron. Overcome with exhaustion, he lies {{down on the bed}} for a catnap. Cox re-enters, having {{unexpectedly}} secured a day off from his employer. He is delighted to find a roll on the table, but surprised to find the fire already lit. Assuming that Bouncer has been using the room in his absence, he takes the bacon off the gridiron, replaces it with a mutton chop, and heads off to his dressing room to retrieve <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> utensils.|$|E
25|$|On {{the final}} day of <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> show in November 2004, he {{announced}} that his partner Melanie Mossman was pregnant and that the next year he would be leaving his media career to become a full-time dad. He returned within two years to present another breakfast radio show. He married Mel on 28 January 2006 in the Great Hall at Sydney University, where guests were asked to donate to charities in lieu of gifts. They have two daughters, Elaquare (Ellie) and Olivia. When Elaquare was six months old, Spencer organised for a fly to be named after her, Fijian fly A. Amblypsilopus elaquarae (Elaquare's Amblypsilopus). This was through the Australian Museum's project to seek funding by giving new animal species namesakes for a donation.|$|E
25|$|Listeners {{were also}} invited to contribute, after which D'Arcy would dip into his O'Byrne's World of Wonder sack which {{contained}} toy prizes. The show was even video-streamed live online. D'Arcy {{was not the}} only original member of the team present; Zig and Zag featured heavily as they were promoting their new DVD Best Bitz From Back Den, Don Conroy put in an appearance to instruct D'Arcy how to draw a barn owl, Ian Dempsey turned up later (he had been presenting <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> show from the Today FM studios directly beforehand), a 4ft Ted attacked D'Arcy at 10:10 as Zig and Zag cheered him on with the audience, and, to Zig and Zag's disgust, Dustin made a cameo appearance toward the end.|$|E

50|$|On 2 January 2009 Poulton {{presented}} <b>his</b> first <b>breakfast</b> show in {{over two}} years as cover for Christian O'Connell on Absolute Radio.|$|R
25|$|Specializing in climbing, Rasmussen {{showed a}} {{propensity}} for attempting spectacular wins in mountain stages {{in which he}} {{broke away from the}} peloton early and rode alone for most of the stage. Michael Rasmussen was known for his care for detail when considering weight. With a low weight (60kg) he was usually one of the lightest riders in his class. He was known for peeling off unnecessary stickers from his bike, not wearing the Livestrong wristband which was common among many Tour de France riders, due to the additional grams. He used to count each grain of rice before eating and had water with <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> cereal, instead of milk. He only carried one water bottle holder and his Colnago Extreme-C bike weighed 6.81kg, only 10g more than the minimum limit.|$|E
25|$|Cooke {{also participated}} in the Gettysburg Campaign with Stuart. Soon {{after the start of}} the Stuart's ride around the Union Army of the Potomac, Cooke was nearly shot or {{captured}} during the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863). He was eating breakfast with two other staff officers and a courier at the home of a blacksmith while the blacksmith shoed their horses. The Confederate officers were about a half mile from the main body of Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton III's cavalry division when advance riders from the 11th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry rode by in pursuit of the advance guard of Hampton's division. The other three Confederates quickly fled toward their main body but Cooke was intent on finishing <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> and having his horse shoed. He barely escaped when a second group of Union riders became suspicious of the nature of activity at the farm and rode up to check.|$|E
500|$|In January 1941, Berryman became Commander, Royal Artillery, in Arthur [...] "Tubby" [...] Allen's 7th Division, and was {{promoted}} to brigadier. During the Syria-Lebanon campaign, Berryman demonstrated {{that he was a}} thrusting commander who led from the front and repeatedly demonstrated his coolness under fire. When his headquarters came under shell fire for the first time, Berryman sat calmly eating <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> [...] "among the flying brick dust and bursting shells", simply telling the men to shut the door, [...] "so they can eat breakfast without being covered in dust".|$|E
60|$|Three days later, {{one of the}} London newsboys got his {{business}} off <b>his</b> mind before <b>breakfast.</b> <b>His</b> district was Diana Street, Pimlico; and {{the last of the}} morning's newspapers which he disposed of was the newspaper he left at Mrs. Oldershaw's door.|$|R
6000|$|The time wore on to midnight. They {{went to bed}} {{late and}} they rose late at Windygates House. Under that hospitable roof, no {{intrusive}} hints, {{in the shape of}} flat candlesticks exhibiting themselves with ostentatious virtue on side-tables, hurried the guest to his room; no vile bell rang him ruthlessly out of bed the next morning, and insisted on <b>his</b> <b>breakfasting</b> at a given hour. Life has surely hardships enough that are inevitable without gratuitously adding the hardship of absolute government, administered by a clock? ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the film}} D2: The Mighty Ducks, the Norwegian-born {{character}} Jan serves hasenpfeffer and eggs to Gordon Bombay and Charlie Conway. It {{is referred to}} as <b>his</b> specialty <b>breakfast.</b>|$|R
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, the Simpsons watch a television program called Cash in Your Legacy, which is a parody on the PBS program Antiques Roadshow. Arthur Fortune is a parody of Branson and Fortune Megastore is a reference to Branson's international record shop chain Virgin Megastores. On the cover of Billionaire Beat, a magazine that Burns reads in the episode, business magnates Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch can be seen. In a scene in the episode, Burns assumes that [...] "Don McNeill and <b>his</b> <b>Breakfast</b> Club" [...] is currently the most popular radio program. Don McNeill's Breakfast Club was a real radio program that, according to Scully, Swartzwelder used to listen to. Costner's film The Postman is also referenced in the episode. Burns' unveiling of the Loch Ness Monster is ruined as the numerous camera flashes blind him, causing him to knock over some lights, starting a fire. This is a reference to the film King Kong, although in the film the flashes enrage the captured gorilla Kong, as opposed to his captor.|$|E
500|$|On 16 March 2011, judge Kyle Sandilands {{announced}} on <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> radio show, Kyle & Jackie O {{that he would}} not be returning to the judging panel for the third season. Of his decision, Sandilands said, [...] "Not because I didn't like it. I thought the show was great and it was great fun to do but it's just too hectic, it's too much work. So, I've told Channel Seven, no." [...] On 31 March 2011, it was announced that Natalie Bassingthwaighte would join the judging panel as a replacement for Natalie Imbruglia. When speaking of her role as a judge, Bassingthwaighte said she would focus on bringing an honest critique to the show and would guide [...] "the artists through the competition". In late April 2011, it was confirmed that Mel B would be Sandilands' replacement. Mel B said, [...] " [...] are either going to love me or hate me but it's going to be a fun ride. I'm really easy to get on with and I'm a hard worker. I'm firm but nice." [...] Guy Sebastian and Ronan Keating were the only judges from the second season who returned.|$|E
500|$|Radio DJ Kenny Everett {{first met}} Mercury in 1974 when he invited the singer onto <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> show on Capital London. As two of Britain's most flamboyant, {{outrageous}} and best-loved entertainers, they shared {{much in common}} and instantly became close friends. Everett would {{play a major role}} in Queen's early success when, in 1975, armed with an advance copy of the single [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", Mercury went to see Everett. While privately Everett doubted any station would play the song due to its length at over 6 minutes, he said nothing to Mercury and placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, enthused: [...] "forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries". While Capital Radio hadn't officially accepted the song, the anarchic Everett would talk incessantly about a record he had but couldn't play, before the song [...] "accidentally" [...] started playing, with Everett stating: [...] "Oops, my finger must've slipped." [...] Capital's switchboard was jammed with callers wanting to know when the song was going to be released â€“ on one occasion Everett aired the song 36 times in one day.|$|E

6000|$|On {{the next}} morning Peregrine saw <b>his</b> {{grandfather}} before <b>breakfast.</b> <b>His</b> mother came to his room door while he was dressing to whisper {{a word of caution}} to him. [...] "Pray, be courteous to him," [...] she said. [...] "Remember how good he is to you--to us both! Say that you congratulate him." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2008 Holmes left <b>his</b> weekday <b>breakfast</b> show on Newstalk ZB after {{hosting the}} show for almost 22 years. Holmes then {{presented}} the Saturday morning show on Newstalk ZB.|$|R
500|$|Linois {{arrived at}} Pondicherry on 11 July to find Rainier's ships {{anchored}} nearby {{and most of}} the city's financial institutions still in British hands. Trident and the brig [...] were anchored in Pondicherry roads, although on Linois's arrival they sailed to join Rainier's squadron. The following day, Linois sent Captain Joseph-Marie Vrignaud and his own nephew on board Rainier's flagship with an invitation to breakfast the following morning, which was accepted. At 10:00, the transport Marie FranÃ§ois arrived in Pondicherry, having been separated in the storm, and she was followed at 18:00 by the brig BÃ©lier. BÃ©lier had been sent out from Brest on 16 March carrying, among other papers, copies of a speech made before the British Parliament by King George III that threatened conflict and orders from Napoleon to immediately sail for Isle de France in anticipation of the declaration of war. Linois was instructed to deliver Decaen to the island, and prepare his ships on the Indian Ocean island [...] for a lengthy raiding operation against British commerce in the region. When dawn rose on 13 July, Rainier embarked on the 16-gun brig [...] for <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> appointment, only to discover that Linois's ships had slipped away in the night.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1988, Young and {{his family}} moved to Lake Macquarie near Newcastle. Newcastle's first FM radio station, New FM, was {{preparing}} to open in 1989 and Young was asked to head their All-Australian programme, Oz Made Mondays. The programme was successful with Young moving through the ranks of the station to Morning Announcer garnering four No.1 rating spots for <b>his</b> <b>Breakfast</b> and Drive Time programmes along the way. A compilation album titled Classic Hits was released in 1988, including the new single [...] "Don't Sing That Song", but failed to chart.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2005, in the lead-up to the Cronulla riots, Jones used <b>his</b> <b>breakfast</b> {{radio program}} to read out and discuss a widely {{circulated}} text message that called on people to [...] "Come to Cronulla {{this weekend to}} take revenge... get down to North Cronulla to support the Leb and wog bashing day". Media commentator David Marr accused Jones of inciting racial tensions and implicitly encouraging violence and vigilantism by the manner of his responses to callers even while he was verbally disapproving of them taking the law into their own hands.|$|E
