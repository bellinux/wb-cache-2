During this period, important local Tamil literature was produced and Hindu temples were built including an academy for language advancement.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} atomic {{transitions}} to measure time was first suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1879, although {{it was only in}} the 1930s with the development of Magnetic resonance that there was a practical method for doing this. A prototype ammonia maser device was built in 1949 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now NIST). Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> accurate than existing quartz clocks, it served to demonstrate the concept.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than a foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was planned to be {{released}} for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team were shown the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of Mega Man Battle Network, Takumi felt that the Game Boy Advance would be perfect for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every sample that was needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E

5|$|During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) and {{especially}} of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned. Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, {{the best way}} for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barça. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence. During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.|$|E

5|$|Mesopotamian {{influence}} {{continued to}} affect Mari's culture during the Amorite period, which {{is evident in}} the Babylonian scribal style used in the city. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> influential than the former periods and a distinct Syrian style prevailed, which is noticeable in the seals of kings, which reflect a clear Syrian origin. The society was a tribal one, it consisted mostly of farmers and nomads (Haneans), and in contrast to Mesopotamia, the temple had a minor role in everyday life as the power was mostly invested in the palace. Women enjoyed a relative equality to men, queen Shibtu ruled in her husband's name while he was away, and had an extensive administrative role and authority over her husband's highest officials.|$|E

5|$|Montreal was {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the Parliament {{building}} to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. For strategic reasons, Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 2004, Aladdin was re{{released}} onto VHS and for {{the first}} time released onto DVD, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line. The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation, prepared for Aladdin's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003, and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3million units in its first month, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than the number of copies, sold in that amount of time, by any other Platinum Edition released before it. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels.|$|E
5|$|Performance {{estimates}} of the Spey-engined Phantom contrary to its American equivalent indicated that the former had a 30% shorter take-off distance, 20% faster climb to altitude, higher top speed and longer range. The Spey was more efficient at lower altitudes, and had better acceleration at low speed, giving British Phantoms better range and acceleration, which was shown during the deployment of 892 NAS to the Mediterranean aboard USS Saratoga in 1969, when the F-4K was repeatedly quicker off the deck than the F-4J used by the Americans. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> efficient at higher altitudes, the British Phantoms lacking speed compared to J79-powered versions owing to the increased drag of the re-designed fuselage. This discrepancy became apparent when the F-4J was obtained by the UK in 1984; it was regarded as being {{the best of the}} three variants to serve in the RAF.|$|E

5|$|The CAB Rating for {{the show}} was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening {{programs}} of the 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular established shows such as The Shadow and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes did not perform as well – but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> than half of Texaco's Fire Chief, which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may be {{because of the time}} slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners were listening to the radio at 7:00p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Jack Pearl's Baron Münchhausen, and Fire Chief all aired after 9:00p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and Five-Star Theater was not renewed for a second season.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{relied on}} a {{logistical}} system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations' system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front-line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet model, this ground-based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies to the front while troops transported those items to the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts. This second effort, though more versatile, was also a substantial disadvantage because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front-line units.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of China {{was known to}} Roman cartographers, but their understanding of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> certain. Ptolemy's 2nd-century AD Geography separates the Land of Silk (Serica) {{at the end of}} the overland Silk Road from the land of the Qin (Sinae) reached by sea. The Sinae are placed on the northern shore of the Great Gulf (Magnus Sinus) east of the Golden Peninsula (Aurea Chersonesus, Malay Peninsula). Their chief port, Cattigara, seems to have been in the lower Mekong Delta. The Great Gulf served as a combined Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea, as Marinus of Tyre and Ptolemy's belief that the Indian Ocean was an inland sea caused them to bend the Cambodian coast south beyond the equator before turning west to join southern Libya (Africa). Much of this is given as unknown lands, but the north-eastern area is placed under the Sinae.|$|E

5|$|The first Formula Three Brabham, the BT9, {{won only}} four major races in 1964. The BT15 which {{followed}} in 1965 {{was a highly}} successful design. 58 cars were sold, which won 42 major races. Further developments of the same concept, including wings {{by the end of}} the decade, were highly competitive up until 1971. The BT38C of 1972 was Brabham's first production monocoque and the first not designed by Tauranac. Although 40 were ordered, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> successful than its predecessors. The angular BT41 was the final Formula Three Brabham.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{proposal}} {{had called}} for locating the station in Ny-Ålesund due to its topographical advantage. In January 1964, ESRO started informal discussions with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who stated {{that they had no}} initial objections. By then, supported by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, ESRO instead proposed situating the station at Longyearbyen because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> remote and would incur lower costs. This was opposed by Norwegian authorities; mining in Ny-Ålesund had ceased after the 1963 Kings Bay Affair and the authorities wanted permanent activity in the town. An official request was made by ESRO in February, and in May, official political support for the project was awarded. The main motivation was to establish a permanent space technology center in Norway that could stimulate further scientific growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of {{contemporary}} art was the oared galley with long and narrow hulls. The shape of the hull was constructed in a way to maximize the number of rowers. Thus, a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of wind conditions. Although it carried mast and sail, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>less</b> efficient as a sailing ship. The Mycenaean galley offered certain advantages. Although lighter compared to the oared-sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete, it seated more rowers. Its steering mechanism was a triangular steering oar, a forerunner of the latter steering oar of Archaic era.|$|E
30|$|There are {{two major}} {{advantages}} of automated ROI definition.

Additionally, automated ROI definition is more amenable for pooling data for meta-analysis, an important aspect since PET studies in patient populations usually have small sample sizes.|$|R
