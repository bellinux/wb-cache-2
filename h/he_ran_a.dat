Days after he suffered a severe hamstring injury in the 200m trials and did not win any medals at the Beijing Olympics. His performance of 9.71 seconds to win the 100m silver medal in the 2009 World Championships is the fastest non-winning time for the event.|$|E

5|$|Invites to Golden League meets never materialised, but he {{continued}} to run at smaller events. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> European leading time of 10.06seconds at Papaflessia in Greece, and won the 100m and 200m races at the 2009 European Team Championships. He was the fastest entrant at the national championships but 2008 runner-up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance. The result took Chambers by surprise {{and he said that}} limited opportunities to race had made him complacent. He later withdrew from the 200m race citing exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|The first {{event at}} the 2009 World Championships in August was the 100m. After two sub-10 clockings in the {{preliminary}} rounds, Gay reached the final, along with Jamaicans Bolt and Powell. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> new US record of 9.71seconds in the race, the third-fastest time in history, but even so {{had to settle for}} second place, losing his 100m world title to Bolt, who knocked 0.11seconds off the world record with a run of 9.58seconds.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a lot}} {{of tension}} between Duyet and Minh Mạng. Although Gia Long had enlisted European support to claim the throne and allowed missionaries to {{function}} in Vietnam in gratitude to Pigneau, <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> classical Confucian administration. He also expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestral worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture; Crown Prince Cảnh had been converted by Pigneau and subsequently refused to bow down to his ancestors, instead desecrating a shrine with feces.|$|E

5|$|With paying gigs {{harder to}} find and paying less, Sims turned to other sources of income. Despite not having had any formal {{instruction}} himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic.

5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E
5|$|Adamle quit {{football}} for good {{after the season}} and focused on his medical career. He received a medical degree from Western Reserve in 1956. He settled in Kent, Ohio, where <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> medical practice {{for the rest of}} his life. He also served as the team doctor for Theodore Roosevelt High School and Kent State University for more than 35 years. Adamle specialized in knee and neck injuries, and published articles about cold therapy and the use of Vitamin C in sports medicine. The Ohio High School Athletic Association named him the state's Outstanding Team Physician in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E
5|$|Kim Collins {{competed in}} his fifth {{consecutive}} Olympic Games, {{and was the}} oldest sprinter at these Games. While most sprinters peak in their 20s, Collins set his personal record after reaching the age of 40, {{and became the first}} individual to run a sub-10 second 100m dash in the process. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> 9.93 100m dash, which was fast enough to qualify for Rio. He competed in both the 100m sprint and 4 × 100m relay. Collins was the only St. Kitts and Nevis athlete to make it out of the first round. He finished his heat with a time of 10.18 and fourth place. He improved his time in the semifinals, finishing with a time of 10.12. This put him in sixth place and he did not advance to the finals.|$|E
5|$|Making his Summer Olympics debut, Yazaldes Nascimento {{qualified}} for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard, without competing in any notable sporting event. He competed on 21 August in Heat 1 against seven other athletes. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> time of 11.00 seconds, finishing last of the eight athletes competing. Singapore's Poh Seng Song placed ahead of him {{with a time of}} 10.75 seconds, in a heat led by Namibia's Frank Fredericks who posted a time of 10.12 seconds, 0.88 seconds quicker than Nascimento's time. Out of 84 athletes, Nascimento ranked 67th and was 0.65 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the quarter-finals. Therefore, {{that was the end of}} his competition.|$|E

At the end of October, Tristan ran twice at the Newmarket Houghton meeting without reproducing his best form. In the Cambridgeshire Handicap he carried top weight of 130 pounds and finished seventh of the thirty-one runners behind Hackness. On his final {{start of the year}} he ran in the Jockey Club Stakes over two and a quarter miles. In a closely contested four way finish he dead-heated for second place with City Arab, a short head behind Chippendale and a neck in front of the mare Corrie Roy.|$|E
5|$|Trevor Linden's grandfather, Nick van der Linden, {{emigrated to}} Canada from the Netherlands in 1929. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> {{construction}} company until his son Lane, Trevor's father, replaced him in 1979. Trevor {{was born in}} Medicine Hat, Alberta to Lane and Edna Linden. Linden was a skilled athlete; despite hockey being his top priority, he also participated in baseball, golf, volleyball, basketball, and speed skating. An excellent student in school, he was offered a scholarship to Princeton University to play for their hockey team; instead, Linden chose to stay in Medicine Hat and play with the local major junior team, the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL. Linden grew up watching the Tigers and idolized Lanny McDonald, who played in Medicine Hat before he joined the NHL.|$|E
5|$|While Heman {{remained}} in Salisbury, where <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> general store {{until his death}} in 1778, Allen's movements {{over the next few years}} are poorly documented. He is known to have been living in Northampton, Massachusetts in the spring of 1766, where his son Joseph was born, and where he invested in a lead mine. He was asked to leave Northampton in July 1767 by the authorities; while no official reason is known, biographer Michael Bellesiles suggests that religious differences and Allen's tendency to be disruptive may have played a role in his departure. He then briefly returned to Salisbury before settling in nearby Sheffield, Massachusetts with his younger brother Zimri. It is likely that his first visits to the New Hampshire Grants occurred during these years. While Sheffield would be the family home for ten years, Allen was often absent for extended periods.|$|E
