25|$|The Mega Powers' first feud {{was against}} The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), whom they {{defeated}} in the main event of the first-ever SummerSlam pay-per-view event. The match, refereed by Jesse Ventura, was famous for Miss Elizabeth jumping up on the apron of the ring late in the match and removing her skirt to show red panties. This allowed both Savage and Hogan (who had been knocked to the outside) to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring and get the pin on DiBiase with Savage pushing a reluctant Ventura to the 3-count. The Mega Powers then began feuding with The Twin Towers (Big Boss Man and Akeem who was formerly the One Man Gang). In {{the case of the}} latter feud, Savage frequently became involved in Hogan's matches involving one of the two villains (and vice versa); the two rival factions captained opposing teams in the main event of the 1988 Survivor Series, which was won by the Mega Powers.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} play from scrimmage, the Steelers {{got a taste of}} what lay in store as Pats quarterback Drew Bledsoe {{completed}} a 53-yard pass to Terry Glenn that set up Curtis Martin's 2-yard touchdown run. Pittsburgh was quickly forced to punt, and New England took just four plays to score again, the last a 34-yard touchdown on a screen pass from Bledsoe to fullback Keith Byars, giving the team a 14-0 lead just over seven minutes into the first quarter. Then on {{the first play}} of the second quarter, Martin burst {{through a hole in the}} right line, dodged a tackle attempt by Carnell Lake, and raced 78 yards for a touchdown, the second longest scoring run in NFL postseason history. Near the end of the half, Steelers defensive back Willie Williams intercepted a pass from Bledsoe to give his team a chance to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. But Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs on the Pats 24-yard line and the score remained 21-0 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|The 1988–89 season saw the Islanders win {{only seven}} {{of their first}} 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team {{finished}} with 61 points, tied with the Quebec Nordiques for the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season {{and the first time}} missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long {{after the end of the}} season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned over day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal, Stephen Walsh, and Paul Greenwood. In return, they each bought a 2.5 interest in the team. In the next season, the Islanders rebounded to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of Bryan Trottier's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The 1990–91 season had the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.|$|E

On the February 13 episode of SmackDown, Kingston would tap out to Jack Swagger in a number one contender's match for the Intercontinental Championship in a match also featuring Mark Henry and Rey Mysterio; on the March 21 episode of SmackDown, Kingston was announced in the Andre the Giant memorial battle royal at WrestleMania XXX. Kingston would have a standout moment in the match, getting thrown of over the turnbuckles by Cesaro and to avoid elimination by keeping his toes on the steel steps, he would later be eliminated by Sheamus. At Payback, Kingston would compete in a match against Bo Dallas, but he would be assaulted by Kane for his tweets against Stephanie McMahon. Kingston competed in the Intercontinental Championship Battle Royal at Battleground where he again avoided elimination by being caught by Big E and rode his shoulders to the ring.

25|$|The Raiders {{hosted the}} Chiefs at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum on November 30. The game began with both teams exchanging field goals {{to tie the}} game at 3. The Raiders lined up to kick another field goal, but instead elected to run a fake field goal, which was fumbled and {{recovered}} by Chiefs CB Maurice Leggett and returned for a touchdown. The Chiefs led the game 10–3 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Raiders tied the game at 10 with a touchdown by RB Justin Fargas. With the Chiefs backed up to their own 9 following a punt, QB Tyler Thigpen led the Chiefs's offense down the field and capped the drive with a hand-off to RB Larry Johnson for a 2-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next possession, Justin Fargas fumbled the football which eventually set up a Chiefs field goal. The Raiders attempted to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game with a field goal by K Sebastian Janikowski, but the Chiefs held possession and ran out the clock {{for the remainder of the}} game. The Chiefs managed to snap their seven-game losing streak by beating the Raiders 20–13. It was Kansas City's sixth consecutive victory at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. The victory was Tyler Thigpen's first as the Chiefs' starting quarterback.|$|E
25|$|Sherrard's {{touchdown}} {{made the}} score 21-10 going into halftime, {{and it turned}} out to be the final score of the day for the offenses of both teams. Washington advanced inside the 49ers 15-yard three times in the second half, but failed to score on all of them. On their second possession of the half, they advanced 66 yards to the 49ers 7-yard line before defensive back Johnnie Jackson picked off a third down pass intended for Monk in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Monk caught three passes for 63 yards on a drive to the San Francisco 15, only to see Rypien get hit as he threw a pass, which floated right into the hands of cornerback Darryl Pollard. Linebacker Monte Coleman quickly gave the Redskins another chance to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, intercepting a pass from Montana and returning it 18 yards to the 49ers 19-yard line with 10:28 left in regulation. Faced with fourth down and 5 from the 14, Rypien threw the ball to receiver Gary Clark in the end zone. Defensive back Eric Davis seemed to make contact with Clark before the ball arrived, but no flag was thrown and the pass fell incomplete, causing a turnover on downs. In the closing minutes of the game, 49ers linebacker Charles Haley deflected a pass from Rypien into the arms of 295 pound defensive tackle Michael Carter, who rumbled 61 yards to the end zone to make the final score 28-10.|$|E
25|$|Alex Koslov put his {{recently}} won AAA Cruiserweight Championship {{on the line}} in the third PPV match of the night as he wrestled against Extreme Tiger, Crazy Boy and Alan Stone in a Elimination hardcore match. The match saw the frequent use of both tables and ladders throughout the match, mixed in with steel chairs for good measure. Koslov's reign as the first AAA Cruiserweight champion ended after just over two weeks as he was the first man eliminated from the match, pinned by Alan Stone. With Koslov eliminated it was a guarantee {{that there would be a}} new champion by the end of the match. Alan Stone's inexperience in Hardcore matches caused him to be eliminated secondly, leaving Crazy Boy and Extreme Tiger, both of whom had a great deal of experience with hardcore matches. The final section of the match had several slow sections where one wrestler set up a table, a ladder or an elaborate chair set up while the other wrestler had to lay on the mat and pretend to be knocked down. At one point Crazy Boy very obviously pushed himself into position so that Extreme Tiger could execute a leap off the top rope onto him. In the final moments of the match saw Extreme Tiger leap out of the ring and splash Crazy Boy through a table. After taking a moment to recover Extreme Tiger was able to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring, only seconds before the referee counted Crazy Boy out. With the count out victory Extreme Tiger was declared the new AAA Cruiserweight champion.|$|E

25|$|Federer next {{traveled}} to Melbourne {{for the first}} Grand Slam of the season, the Australian Open. The Swiss advanced through the first four rounds without {{the loss of a}} set, starting his campaign by defeating qualifier Alexander Kudryavtsev, receiving a walkover into the third round when Andreas Beck withdrew with a lower back injury prior to their second round match, and beating Ivo Karlović to improve to a 10–1 head-to-head record against the Croat. Federer then faced Australian teenager Bernard Tomic and downed him in less than two hours to extend his record streak of Grand Slam quarterfinals consecutive appearances to 31. In the quarterfinals, Federer faced world no. 11 Juan Martín del Potro in his 1000th career match. It was their first meeting in a major tournament since Del Potro defeated Federer in five sets in the 2009 US Open men's final. As the tight match slowly progressed, Federer took control and flew by del Potro in straight sets. With his win, Federer becomes the first player at age 30 and over to reach the Australian Open semifinals since Andre Agassi, and extends his match winning streak (started in September 2011) to 24 consecutive victories. Federer played world no. 2 and archrival Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. He opened up the match by winning the first set, but ultimately lost momentum and dropped the next three sets after a failed attempt to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match by taking the third set, committing 63 unforced errors. Federer's loss to Nadal saw his winning streak of 24 consecutive matches end and his record against Nadal slip to 9–18.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma {{began the}} game with the ball and {{capitalized}} quickly. On the opening kickoff, Juaquin Iglesias returned the ball 47yards to the 50yard line. The Sooners relied on the running game throughout the entire game. The Sooners worked their way towards the endzone with nine plays, seven rushing and two passing, to take the early lead. Oklahoma State went three-and-out on their first possession and Oklahoma began their next possession on their own 42yard line. This time, it only took Oklahoma six plays, all rushing, to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endzone. This included a 41yard run by Allen Patrick. Oklahoma State had more success on their next possession. Beginning on their own 13yard line, the Cowboys drove the 87yards on 13plays to get sevenpoints of their own on the board. Oklahoma answered with another touchdown on their next possession which included a 32yard run for Patrick. The Sooner defense was tested on the next possession. Again, the Cowboys started deep in their own territory. They drove nearly 60yards to Oklahoma's 13yard line. On the next play, the Cowboys got the first down when Dantrell Savage ran for 12yards before being tackled at Oklahoma's one-yard line. Oklahoma State tried threerushing plays up the middle but were stuffed by Oklahoma's defense. On the fourth attempt, rather than kick a field goal, the Cowboy offense tried one last time {{to get in the}} endzone. Rather than run straight up the middle as they had tried the previous three times, quarterback Zac Robinson rushed to the right but was tackled by Curtis Lofton. The ball popped loose and Oklahoma's D.J. Wolfe recovered it and was tackled at the Oklahoma 13yard line. Oklahoma followed with another touchdown that saw Bradford's two longest pass of the first half – a 24-yard throw to Jermaine Gresham and another of the same distance to Iglesias. Bradford completed a twoyard touchdown pass to Joe Jon Finley, his 30th touchdown pass of the season. That pass broke the NCAA record for most touchdown passes for a freshman quarterback. The previous record was set in 1998 by Nevada's David Neill and tied in 2006 by Texas's Colt McCoy. Oklahoma State managed to score a field goal in the closing seconds of the first half. Oklahoma had scored a touchdown on every possession in the first half to give them a 28–10 lead going into halftime.|$|E
