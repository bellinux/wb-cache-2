5|$|On 11 October 2014, Nagpal's husband, Abhishek Singh, also a bureaucrat was {{suspended}}. Abhishek Singh was the SDM (Sub Divisional Magistrate) in Mahawan, Mathura, {{was suspended}} {{by the chief}} minister Akhilesh Yadav, for allegedly treating a teacher, Fauran Singh, in an inhuman manner. Abhishek Singh denies the charges, while the government refuses to elaborate further on what inhuman actions <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of.|$|E
5|$|Umar and {{his senate}} {{identified}} this act as misuse of state treasure, {{though not as}} punishing as to lose one's office, Khalid was already warned not act as alone, he should seek permission from his commander or Caliph for such actions. He immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Abu Ubaidah asking him to bring Khalid in front of the congregation, his turban, and take off his cap. Umar wanted Abu Ubaida to ask Khalid from what funds he gave to Ash'as: from his own pocket or from the state treasury? If he confessed to having used the spoils, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of misappropriation. If he claimed that he gave from his own pocket, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of extravagance. In either case he would be dismissed, and Abu Ubaida would take charge of his duties. Abu Ubaida was himself an admirer of Khalid and loved him as his younger brother, and so said that he was not capable of doing it. Instead, Bilal ibn Ribah was appointed for this task and called back Khalid from Chalcis to Emessa, where he was charged publicly. Khalid stated that he gave money from his own pocket and thus was declared innocent in that charge. However, when he went to Abu Ubaida, he told him that he had been dismissed on the order of Umar and is required to go back to Medina.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty,</b> that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick on the ice, {{and when he saw}} the misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised. Parise nearly swung his stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice. Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted {{in the rest of the}} game being refereed capably.|$|E
5|$|The defence next {{engaged in}} a lengthy direct {{examination}} of Eichmann. Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted {{he had no choice}} but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that he felt a sense of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On the last day of the examination, he stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty for the consequences.|$|E
25|$|Blair {{appeared}} before the Leveson Inquiry on Monday 28 May 2012. During his appearance, a protester, later named as David Lawley-Wakelin, got into the court-room and claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of war crimes before being dragged out.|$|E

25|$|Explaining why he {{eventually}} left the BBC, Omaar {{suggested that he}} wanted to operate independently and to take on assignments for people he wished to collaborate with.

25|$|On January 24, 2017, Metzger {{agreed to}} a plea bargain in which he {{admitted}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of bribery, tax fraud, and interfering in the trial process. In exchange, he would receive a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years and pay 5 million shekels ($1.3 million), including his tax debt and a fine. However, a month later, on February 23, the Jerusalem District Court threw out the plea bargain, and sentenced Metzger to four-and-a-half years in prison.|$|E
25|$|During {{the trial}} of David Westerfield in 2002 for the kidnap and murder of Danielle van Dam, Grace made it clear on Larry King Live that she thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty,</b> but she got some facts wrong. For example, she said he had steam-cleaned his RV, but no {{evidence}} was introduced that he had. Dr. Henry Lee pointed out {{that if he had}} done so, they wouldn't have found the fingerprints and the bloodstain on the carpet. It should be noted, however, that David Westerfield was convicted of kidnapping and murdering Danielle van Dam.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, Abramoff began {{secretly}} granting exclusive {{interviews to}} former Boston Globe investigative reporter Gary S. Chafetz, without {{the knowledge of}} Abramoff's attorneys or the federal prosecutors with whom Abramoff had been cooperating. These interviews – conducted before and during Abramoff's imprisonment – continued until May 2008. In September 2008, Chafetz's book, The Perfect Villain: John McCain and the Demonization of Lobbyist Jack Abramoff was rushed into print prior to the 2008 presidential election. In his book, Chafetz asserted that Abramoff, though guilty {{of some of the}} charges, was the victim of misleading and sensational reporting by the Washington Post, vengeance and mendacity on the part of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), and strong-arm tactics of the Justice Department who forced Abramoff into confessing to crimes he did not believe <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of. Chafetz also accused federal prosecutors of abusive – and possibly illegal – tactics in their reliance on private and public honest services fraud, which he characterized as vague and controversial.|$|E

25|$|In 1886, John Horton Slaughter {{was elected}} Cochise County sheriff. Four {{members of the}} Jack Taylor Gang—Manuel Robles, Geronimo Miranda, Fred Federico, and Nieves Deron—were wanted by both the Mexican Rurales and Arizona law {{enforcement}} for robbery and murder. Trying to evade the lawmen's pursuit, the men came to Tombstone to visit relatives. Slaughter heard that the men were nearby and rode out to arrest them, but the outlaws were tipped off and fled. Slaughter eventually learned they were hiding with Robles' brother in nearby Contention City. Slaughter raised a posse and raided the house. They surprised Robles and Deron while they were asleep, but the gang members rose shooting. Slaughter killed Robles' brother while Deron and Robles ran for cover. Shooting as he ran, Deron nicked Slaughter's right ear lobe. Slaughter shot back and mortally wounded Deron. In his dying minutes, Deron confessed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of the crimes he had been charged with. Robles got away but he and Miranda were later {{shot and killed by}} Mexican authorities.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, George Stinney, a 14-year-old black youth, {{was accused}} of murdering two girls, aged 11 and 8, near Alcolu at Clarendon County. Alcolu was a small working-class mill town, where residences of whites and blacks were {{separated}} by railroad tracks. Stinney was interrogated by police in a locked room with several white officers and no other witnesses, and it was claimed that he had confessed to the killing within an hour. Stinney's father was fired from his job at local lumber mill, {{and his family had}} to either leave the city or risk getting lynched. Given the two white female victims, and an all-white male jury, Stinney was rapidly convicted. Stinney's court-appointed attorney Charles Plowden was a tax commissioner with political aspirations, and scholars have considered him ineffective. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed at South Carolina State Penitentiary in Columbia. Seventy years later, historians question whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> and doubt that he received a fair trial. On December 17, 2014, Stinney's conviction was vacated on the grounds that his constitutional rights had been violated, and his confession had most likely been coerced.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Poirot is {{contacted by}} Maude Williams, who had approached {{him a few}} days earlier, telling him that she had known Bentley when they worked together briefly for the same estate agents. She told Poirot that she liked Bentley and did not believe <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> or even capable of murdering Mrs McGinty. She now offers to help Poirot who takes up her offer by getting her to pose as a maid {{in the house of}} Mrs Wetherby, a resident in the village for whom Mrs McGinty worked as housekeeper, and whose daughter, Deirdre, Poirot suspects may have some connection with the circumstances surrounding Mrs McGinty's murder. During the maid's night off, Mrs Upward's son Robin, a somewhat flamboyant theatre director, and Ariadne Oliver, a famed mystery novelist who has been working on a theatre adaptation with Robin, leave for an evening at the theatre, leaving Mrs Upward alone at the house. When they return, they find Mrs Upward strangled to death. She has evidently had coffee with her murderer, and the lipstick on a coffee cup and perfume in the air points to a woman having committed the crime. Mrs Upward had invited three people to her house that night: Eve Carpenter, Deirdre Henderson and Shelagh Rendell. Any of the three women could be someone from the photographs. Additionally, the postmistress's assistant, Edna, saw someone with blonde hair enter the house, which points to either Carpenter or Rendell, as Henderson is not blonde. Confusing matters even further is the fact that a book is discovered in the Upward house with Evelyn Hope's signature written on the flyleaf, suggesting Mrs Upward was actually Eva Kane. Poirot connects the final piece of the puzzle when he finds the photo Mrs McGinty saw at Maureen Summerhayes' house. It is of Eva Kane and has the inscription “my mother” on the back. Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer – Robin Upward.|$|E

50|$|In short, I cannot {{accept the}} {{suggestion}} that, {{as a prerequisite}} to a constitutionally fair trial, a defendant must stand up in open court and inform a judge that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> when in fact he believes that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|R
500|$|The Crown Prosecutor for Hampshire & Isle of Wight stated [...] "the {{evidence}} {{would have}} been sufficient to prosecute David Lace, if he were alive, with the offences of the {{rape and murder of}} Teresa DeSimone. But this is in no sense a declaration that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of the offences. Had Mr Lace lived, our decision would merely have authorised the police to begin the legal process by charging him. Only after trial does a jury decide whether a person is guilty or not, on a higher standard of proof – beyond reasonable doubt." ...|$|E
500|$|Diefenbaker's {{intensive}} campaign exhausted {{the handful}} of national reporters who followed him. Clark Davey of The Globe and Mail stated, [...] "We {{did not know how}} he did it." [...] Reporters thought the Progressive Conservatives might, at best, gain 30 or 35seats over the 53 they had at dissolution, and when Diefenbaker, off the record, told the reporters that the Tories would win 97 seats (which would still allow the Liberals to form the government), they concluded <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> of wishful thinking. Diefenbaker was even more confident in public; after he concluded his national tour and returned to his constituency, he addressed his final rally in Nipawin, Saskatchewan: [...] "On Monday, I'll be Prime Minister." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{at first}} he was uncooperative, on 13November Tresham confessed to being {{involved}} in the plot, outlining his version of events to his interrogators. [...] Moving his family from the safety of Rushton was, he pointed out, not the action of a man who believed he was taking them into [...] "the very mouth and fury" [...] of the plot. [...] He admitted to the government that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>guilty</b> only of the plot's concealment, denying that he had ever been {{an active member of the}} conspiracy, although by the end of the month he had also admitted his involvement in the Spanish Treason of 1602–1603. [...] He claimed to have persuaded Thomas Wintour and Thomas Percy to postpone the explosion, and that he had planned to inform the king's secretary Thomas Lake of a [...] "Puritan conspiracy".
