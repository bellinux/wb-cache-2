In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.|$|E

In one incident, a person who vomited spread infection right across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one woman vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% {{of the people at}} the same table as the sick woman later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>they</b> were to the sick woman.

Wilson, employing repeating carbines, succeeded in briefly delaying Hill's approach. Getty's men arrived just before Hill's and the two forces skirmished briefly, ending with Hill's men withdrawing {{a few hundred yards}} west of the intersection. Much of the fighting near Orange Plank Road was in close quarters and the thicket along the road, accompanied with the smoke from rifles, caused much confusion amongst officers of both sides. A mile to the rear, Lee established his headquarters at the Widow Tapp's farm. Lee, Jeb Stuart, and Hill were meeting there when they were surprised by a party of Union soldiers entering the clearing. The three generals ran for safety and the Union men, who were equally surprised by the encounter, returned to the woods, unaware of <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>they</b> had come to changing the course of history.

500|$|In contrast, {{historian}} Toh Boon Kwan argues {{at length}} {{the cause of}} the Indonesians, asserting that their claim to victory is equally as valid, if not more than that of the British. He states that British policy makers, in their relief at being let out of the spiral towards war, had forgotten that the Lombok Strait was militarily advantageous to Indonesia, as Indonesian warships could screen the task force easily from a nearby naval base. Symbolically, too, the forcing of ships of the vaunted Royal Navy to take the long way around their territory can be regarded as a major diplomatic success. Indonesian politicians gained strength from the Crisis, now believing that they could go toe-to-toe with 'Imperialists' and survive [...] "brushes with danger."

Manga Life's Park Cooper noted that Sasuke's new abilities, and his fight against Orochimaru indicated a sudden [...] "change the nature of things". Jason Thompson enjoyed both his new design and his first interactions with Naruto after the series' timeskip. Reviewing a scene later in the series, Thompson noted that Sasuke had not become particularly evil, since Itachi {{is the only one}} of his enemies that he actually kills. Sasuke's re-introduction in the second story arc was so important that the animated adaptation Naruto Shippuden started with a sneak peek of this scene. In Shippuden, Sasuke's personality was not entirely different from the original series. His more emotional attitude kept scenes interesting, as did his conversation with the nine-tailed demon fox which foreshadowed future events. Casey Brienza from ANN described Sasuke's final fight against Itachi as [...] "epic," [...] and noted that Itachi's death and revelations about his life notably impacted Sasuke's personality and point of view. UK Anime Network's Dan Rhodes compared Sasuke's fight scenes in a later arc favorably with the scenes of Naruto's fight against Akatsuki member Pain, highlighting the characters' motives for each fight. Jacob Hope Chapman of ANN listed Sasuke and Naruto as one of the [...] "Anime's Fiercest Frenemies," [...] citing their similarities and the renewal of their friendship after their mortal battle. Amy McNulty of ANN also praised their final fight, despite finding Sasuke unlikeable in that scene. Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post lauded Sasuke's decision to protect Konohagakure, since it meant that he would aid Naruto's group in upcoming episodes, alongside the reanimated Hogakes he had gathered. In a later review, Beveridge wondered whether at this point Sasuke was suffering from a god complex, considering his desire to spark revolution in the episodes leading up to his final fight with Naruto. However, Beveridge appreciated the battle for its well-developed choreography. Sarah Nelkin of Anime Now thought the final fight between Sasuke and Naruto was one of the series' darkest moments because of <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>they</b> came to killing each other, even though Naruto continued to try to reconcile with Sasuke during the battle.|$|E
