Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review the <b>fragment.</b> They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills which would have been required to forge the <b>fragment,</b> and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed the <b>fragment</b> as fake. In a television documentary about the <b>fragment</b> that was presented on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested that he considered it more likely to be authentic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Because {{a uniform}} <b>fragments</b> field {{is needed for}} forward-firing warhead intercepting air targets, it is {{necessary}} to analyze quantitatively and improve <b>fragments</b> dispersion uniformity. The wave controller is added in the warhead to make <b>fragments</b> at marginal zone close to the dispersion center. The static explosion experiments are performed to obtain the <b>fragments</b> dispersion data before and after the warhead being improved. The results of data analysis indicate that the marginal <b>fragments</b> will close to the center after adding a suitable wave controller in the warhead. And {{at the same time the}} field density of <b>fragments</b> in the centre zone changes little. The <b>fragments</b> radial dispersion uniformity is much better than before. The effective <b>fragments</b> area is about 1. 8 times larger than before, and the <b>fragments</b> quantity in effective <b>fragments</b> area increases 54. 2 %. But about 30 % of total <b>fragments</b> are still not used effectively because of the sparse density, and the problem needs to be researched farther in the future...|$|R

50|$|If the abundances of quartz, feldspars {{and rock}} <b>fragments</b> {{indicate}} that the rock is a litharenite, a sublitharenite or a feldspathic litharenite, one must then normalize the abundance of rock <b>fragments</b> to 100% and attempt to identify the relative abundances volcanic rock <b>fragments</b> (VRFs), metamorphic rock <b>fragments</b> (MRFs) and sedimentary rock <b>fragments</b> (SRFs).

40|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} via fragmentation is {{an integral}} component of the life history of many marine organisms. In south-eastern Australia the green macroalga Caulerpa filiformis (Suhr) Hering is abundant on many rocky shorelines and <b>fragments</b> are very abundant in the water column. We examined some {{of the factors that}} may influence the growth and successful reattachment of <b>fragments</b> of C. filiformis that potentially contribute to its success. Field surveys revealed that C. filiformis <b>fragments</b> were of variable morphologies (from small fronds to entire thalli) and sizes (0. 1 - 60 cm in length). All <b>fragments</b> of C. filiformis were viable propagules that survived and grew well in the laboratory. However, some <b>fragments</b> grew more than others, in particular larger sizes (7. 5 cm class) of certain morphologies (<b>fragments</b> that consisted only of a single frond). Rhizoids were produced by all <b>fragments,</b> but again, larger <b>fragments</b> produced more rhizoids than smaller <b>fragments.</b> The force required to detach <b>fragments</b> was proportional to the number (but not size) of rhizoids, demonstrating the importance of rhizoids for attachment. The rate of attachment of <b>fragments</b> was also fast, usually within 12 h, but the longer these <b>fragments</b> were attached to a substratum the greater the force required to dislodge them. Interestingly, <b>fragments</b> only produced rhizoids if they were resting on a substratum which may explain the small proportion of <b>fragments</b> with rhizoids in the field (< 5 %). Ultimately, the long term success of C. filiformis <b>fragments</b> was low as only 1. 6 % of <b>fragments</b> attached within 24 h and none of these persisted for longer than 2 days. Nonetheless, the abundance and viability of <b>fragments</b> of C. filiformis available to attach suggest that asexual fragmentation is a successful reproductive strategy in this seaweed.
