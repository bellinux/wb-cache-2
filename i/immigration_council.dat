Prosperity is a shared goal that unites us all, and offers an important lens through which to evaluate the vital role immigration plays in our economy today, as well as the necessity of retooling our outdated and hopelessly broken immigration system. As we do so, however, it is critical for us to recognize that skilled immigration encompasses a wide range of individuals with very different educational and occupational backgrounds. Moreover, the talent we seek very often comes to these shores not only through employment-based channels of immigration, but through family reunification, the admission of refugees and asylees, and can even be found within the current population of unauthorized workers...|$|R

Large numbers of people moves across the borders of the EU for the sake of job opportunities. Sometimes, people cross the border independently, while other times, they do so collectively with other people. The corrupt custom officers and police are strong facilitators of this illicit immigration of these people. Also, the need for people is exploited by an organized crime groups operating in this field. Illegal immigration and trafficking of human beings are combined activities of organized crimes. These can be seen mostly as a labor market problem, and the EU is trying to frame a policy regulating both labor markets and migratory flows.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the ethics {{involved}} in the migration of Indian trained dentists to Australia. It develops from interviews of senior oral health leaders in both the countries to provide evidence that ethics in migration is diluted in practice and to suggest that migratory procedures in both the countries should be reconsidered. There is also an urgent need for more organized bilateral communication and negotiation between the concerned organizations of both the countries (dental <b>councils,</b> <b>immigration</b> departments and research centers) in order to prevent the somewhat irreversible and intensive brain drain of top quality dentists from India to Australia. We would suggest as a starting point better monitoring of the migrants' academic and social background, the nature of the educational investment in India and the nature of the stay in Australia. This new information base could possibly lay the groundwork for more restrictive policies to be introduced both in Australia and India. Madhan Balasubramanian, Stephanie D Shor...|$|R
40|$|This essay aims to {{show the}} {{specific}} case of Albanian immigration in Lombardy Region, whose members have had a particular history in their settlement in Lombardy and in Italy, in general. It {{presents the results of}} twenty in-depth-interviews realised in 2001 to Albanians immigrants, entrepreneurs, head of associations, social operators and experts in some Provinces of Lombardy (Milan, Bergamo, Brescia Varese, and Pavia). The essay reconstructs the phases of arrival and stabilization of Albanians, characterised initially by the gain of labour and house and then the phase of discrimination, along with disqualification processes. It deeps, in particular, the two aspects of participation to the labour market (it reveals the trend to self-entrepreneurship) and of social integration. On this matter it explains the actions realised by the Albanian community in order to strengthen its reputation in Italians opinion. In the conclusions the Author underlines the role of local societies in migration policies, in particular, for the useful contribution of ethnic networks, preference relations with organisations helping immigrants, <b>Immigration</b> and Territorial <b>Councils.</b> Noting that, nevertheless, often it happens that these organisms, especially the public ones, does not work and does not produce the results waited, about planning immigrants entries and their successive social integration. Job centres, for example, rarely have a significant role in allowing immigrants occupations and this determines an increase of social alarm and criminality in local communities. In this case it is underlined how, in planning new entries, qualitative aspects, more then the quantitative ones, have to be considered (to help firms to select workers {{on the basis of their}} needs and to promote initiatives of professional training abroad) ...|$|R
