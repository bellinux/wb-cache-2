50|$|An Optical DPSK {{demodulator}} is {{a device}} that provides a method for converting an optical <b>differential</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> (DPSK) signal to an intensity-keyed signal at the receiving end in fiber-optic communication networks. It {{is also known as}} delay line interferometer (DLI), or simply called DPSK demodulator.|$|E
5000|$|Delay line interferometers {{are also}} known as optical DPSK demodulators. They convert a phase-keyed signal into an amplitude-keyed signal. In this application, an {{incoming}} <b>differential</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> (DPSK) optical signal is first split into two equal-intensity beams in two arms of a Mach Zehnder or Michelson interferometer, in which one beam is delayed by an optical path difference corresponding to 1-bit time delay. After recombination, the two beams interfere with each other constructively or destructively. The resultant interference intensity is the intensity-keyed signal.|$|E
50|$|For {{a signal}} that has been {{differentially}} encoded, there is an obvious alternative method of demodulation. Instead of demodulating as usual and ignoring carrier-phase ambiguity, the phase between two successive received symbols is compared and used to determine what the data must have been. When differential encoding is used in this manner, the scheme is known as <b>differential</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> (DPSK). Note that this is subtly different from just differentially encoded PSK since, upon reception, the received symbols are not decoded one-by-one to constellation points but are instead compared directly to one another.|$|E

50|$|By {{increasing}} the number of states that the carrier signal can take, the number of bits encoded in each symbol can be greater than one. The bit rate can then be greater than the symbol rate. For example, a <b>differential</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> system might allow four possible jumps in phase between symbols. Then two bits could be encoded at each symbol interval, achieving a data rate of double the symbol rate. In a more complex scheme such as 16-QAM, four bits of data are transmitted in each symbol, resulting in a bit rate of four times the symbol rate.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{instead of}} {{operating}} {{with respect to}} a constant reference wave, the broadcast can operate with respect to itself. Changes in phase of a single broadcast waveform can be considered the significant items. In this system, the demodulator determines the changes in the phase of the received signal rather than the phase (relative to a reference wave) itself. Since this scheme depends on the difference between successive phases, it is termed <b>differential</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> (DPSK). DPSK can be significantly simpler to implement than ordinary PSK since {{there is no need for}} the demodulator to have a copy of the reference signal to determine the exact phase of the received signal (it is a non-coherent scheme). In exchange, it produces more erroneous demodulation.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrated}} a signed chromatic dispersion (CD) monitoring method of 10 GHz nonreturn-to-zero <b>differential</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> (NRZ-DPSK) and return-to-zero <b>differential</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> (RZ-DPSK) signals by using asynchronous delay-tap sampling and an imperfect tuned delay interferometer. This method could monitor {{not only the}} value but also the polarity of residual CD. The demodulated signals show amplitude shoulders on the rising edge or the trailing edge with CD accumulation. Delay-tap sampling scatter plots could reflect this signal distortion by a unique characteristic and realize the signed CD monitoring.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the transmission distance of an ON–OFF-keyed high-speed pseudolinear optical communication system can be dramatically improved by means of runlength-limited coding. The key idea is to impose constraints on transmitted sequences such that the minimum interpulse spacing increases, and the average transmission power decreases. Both effects result in considerable suppression of intrachannel four-wave mixing, a major nonlinear penalty in pseudolinear long-haul links. Several coding schemes with different properties are designed for various constraints and compared against a prototypical reference system. Finally, numerical simulations are performed for a benchmark system employing <b>differential</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying.</b> The results obtained indicate that the runlength-limited coding approach {{can be considered a}} legitimate alternative to this more advanced modulation format.
