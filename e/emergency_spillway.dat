In 2018, the upper section of the spillway which was undamaged by the flood but also has been identified as structurally defective, will be demolished and rebuilt. In addition, crews are working to extend a cutoff wall under the <b>emergency</b> <b>spillway</b> to prevent erosion should that structure be used again in the future.|$|E
5|$|New Melones was {{the focus}} of a long {{environmental}} battle during the 1970s and early 1980s; critics protested the flooding of a long scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River, which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone canyon in the western United States. The protestors employed a variety of methods, some extreme, to prevent the filling of New Melones Lake until 1983, when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam's <b>emergency</b> <b>spillway.</b> The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on the state and federal levels; since its completion, no other dams of its size or importance have been built in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The master´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} modeling of flow in the <b>emergency</b> <b>spillways</b> of small dams. It is solved the flow rate capacity of a weir and of spillway called „duckbill-type“. Sharp crested weirs and long crested weirs are modeled using numerical simulations in ANSYS. Hydraulically complex spillway called „duckbill-type“ was modeled in the Flow- 3 D. The results of the discharge coefficients are compared with data in the hydraulic literature...|$|R
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete <b>emergency</b> <b>spillway</b> was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, it was nature, not {{political}} maneuvering, {{that led to}} the filling of New Melones Lake. The winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of the wettest recorded in the 20th century. The Stanislaus River swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through the dam's outlets, and the reservoir rapidly surpassed the temporary limit. The winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached the lip of the <b>emergency</b> <b>spillway</b> (but did not flow over it), a level that has not been surpassed since. With the lake full, the state of California lifted the temporary limit in March, 1983. A deciding factor in the rescinding of the water-level limit was the prevention of $50 million in damages by New Melones Dam in 1982 and 1983, which demonstrated the dam's value for flood control.|$|E
25|$|Jari Dam {{is also an}} earthfill type with silt as {{the core}} material. Gravel is applied on the {{shoulders}} of the dam. The maximum height of Jari dam above the core trench is 274 feet and the length is 6,800 feet. The main spillway is a submerged orifice type with 9 radial gates, 36 x 40 feet each; it has a maximum capacity of 1.1 million cusecs. The <b>emergency</b> <b>spillway</b> is weir type with an erodible bund and a maximum capacity of 0.23 million cusecs. The 5 tunnels are steel and concrete lined and 1,560 feet long in bedrock.

40|$|AbstractEl-Salam Pump Stations (1) and (2) {{are located}} at 22. 1 km and 54. 3 km {{respectively}} at El-Salam Canal. When El-Salam Pump Station (1) is in operation, and switching off El-Salam Pump Station (2), water level rises upstream El-Salam Pump Station (2). Water level overtops El-Salam Pump Station (2) and banks upstream it. Flooding then takes place as Wadi El Noqra Canal, Egypt. This necessitates discharging the excess water {{to protect the}} pump station and the canal from water flooding when the electricity is shut down. The hydrodynamic simulation of El-Salam Canal determinates the critical time for storage capacity according to location and type of <b>emergency</b> <b>spillways</b> through the numerical model to prevent water overtopping upstream pump stations. Determination of the critical time of storage capacity is considered as a new parameter in case of the hydraulic design of the canal controlled by cross pump stations...|$|R
5000|$|A big {{snowmelt}} in the Rocky Mountains led {{to record}} flooding on the Colorado River in 1983 (and again in 1984). Heavy and unseasonably late snows in May were followed rapidly by warm temperatures and record rainfall in early June. The resulting huge surge of water was not forecasted {{and not enough}} water was dumped from Colorado River reservoirs in time to compensate. High inflows forced opening of the <b>emergency</b> <b>spillways</b> at Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams {{for the first time}} since their construction except for brief tests.

25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An <b>emergency</b> <b>spillway</b> is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A fuse plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after 8pm on February 11, 2017, the <b>emergency</b> <b>spillway</b> began {{carrying}} {{water for}} the first time since the dam's construction in 1968.

50|$|Hiyoshi Dam is {{used for}} three main purposes: flood control, river {{maintenance}} and water supply. The dam temporarily stores surges in river water during floods, regulating the flow and avoiding damage to downstream areas. The dam is designed for 100-year floods (floods estimated to occur once every 100 years). The maximum release of water during flood control operations in normal situations is 150 cubic meters per second. However, if not enough, the dam is able to discharge more water when the level in the reservoir surpass the surcharge water level. One such situations occurred in September 2013, when heavy rain from Typhoon 18 forced a maximum outflow of 504 cubic meters per second. In case of emergency, with floods bigger than the estimated 100-year flood for which the dam is designed, the <b>emergency</b> <b>spillways</b> can discharge up to 3,100 cubic meters per second, ensuring {{the safety of the}} structure. These spillways have been used only during trials.|$|R

40|$|Flash floods are {{becoming}} a phenomenon that troubles people {{more and more often}} in many Slovak under-mountain regions and society needs to deal with these extreme natural events. This article is showing an example of mathematical modeling of flood protection measures in Small Carpathians region. To secure flood protection, detention reservoirs have been proposed, because of their automatic function that is important due to rapid progress of flash floods. As a base for this project a previous work that attempted to reconstruct the flood has been used. HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 software package was used for numerical modeling, which includes flood mitigation calculation. Six variants of proposed detention reservoirs were created and checked by a design flood wave that was created according to rainfall with recurrence period of 100 years. All of the proposed detention reservoirs have exact proportions needed to secure flood protection including height of the dam, length of the dam in crest, type and dimension of outlet and dimensions of <b>emergency</b> <b>spillways.</b> The modeling included flood wave passing during several situations - normal function of detention reservoirs, blocked outlet and dam break. This study should be considered as a base for future flood protection project. An extensive terrain survey has been performed in frame of this project...|$|R

500|$|On October 17, 2005, three {{environmental}} groups {{filed a motion}} with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission urging federal officials to require that the dam’s <b>emergency</b> <b>spillway</b> be armored with concrete, rather than remain as an earthen spillway and {{that it did not}} meet modern safety standards.

500|$|New Melones Dam {{has come}} under even greater {{controversy}} than Shasta Dam, {{mainly because of the}} project's conflicts with federal and state limits {{and its impact on the}} watershed of the Stanislaus River. The original Melones Dam, submerged underneath New Melones Lake (hence the name New Melones Dam) is the source of one of these problems. The disused Melones Dam blocks cold water at the bottom of the lake from reaching the river, especially in dry years when the surface of the lake is closer to the crest of the old dam. This results in the river below the dam attaining a much higher temperature than usual, hurting native fish and wildlife. To solve this problem, Reclamation shuts off operations of the dam's hydroelectric power plant when water levels are drastically low, but this results in power shortages. Originally, after the dam was constructed, the State of California put filling the reservoir on hold because of enormous public opposition to what was being inundated: the limestone canyon behind the dam, the deepest of its kind in the United States, contained hundreds of archaeological and historic sites and one of California's best and most popular whitewater rafting runs. Thus the reservoir extended only to Parrot's Ferry Bridge, [...] below its maximum upriver limit, until the El Niño event of 1982-1983, which filled it to capacity within weeks and even forced Reclamation to open the <b>emergency</b> <b>spillways,</b> prompting the state and federal governments to repeal the limits they had imposed on the reservoir. Furthermore, the project allows a far smaller sustainable water yield than originally expected, and Reclamation calls the dam [...] "a case study of all that can go wrong with a project".|$|R
