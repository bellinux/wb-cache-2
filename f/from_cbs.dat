5|$|Across Cuba, anti-Batista groups {{carried out}} bombings and sabotage; police responded with mass arrests, torture, and extrajudicial executions. In March 1957, the DR {{launched}} a failed {{attack on the}} presidential palace, during which Antonio was shot dead. Frank País was also killed, leaving Castro the MR-26-7's unchallenged leader. Although Guevara and Raúl were well known for their Marxist–Leninist views, Castro hid his, hoping to gain the support of less radical revolutionaries. In 1957 he met with leading members of the Partido Ortodoxo, Raúl Chibás and Felipe Pazos, authoring the Sierra Maestra Manifesto, in which they demanded that a provisional civilian government be set up to implement moderate agrarian reform, industrialization, and a literacy campaign before holding multiparty elections. As Cuba's press was censored, Castro contacted foreign media to spread his message; he became a celebrity after being interviewed by Herbert Matthews, a journalist from The New York Times. Reporters <b>from</b> <b>CBS</b> and Paris Match soon followed.|$|E

40|$|We studied whether {{cannabinoid}} CB 1 receptor {{gene disruption}} (to yield CB 1 −/− mice) affects the electrically evoked tritium overflow from vas deferens and atrial pieces preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline (NA) (‘noradrenaline release') and from cerebral cortex slices preincubated with [3 H]-choline (‘acetylcholine release'). NA release was higher by 37 % in vas deferens <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 −/− mice than in vas deferens <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 +/+ mice. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 inhibited, and the CB 1 receptor inverse agonist/antagonist SR 141716, increased NA release in vas deferens <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 +/+ mice without affecting it in vas deferens <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 −/− mice. Atrial NA release {{did not differ}} between CB 1 +/+ and CB 1 −/− mice nor did WIN 55, 212 - 2 affect NA release in either strain. Cortical acetylcholine (Ach) release did not differ between CB 1 +/+ and CB 1 −/− mice. WIN 55, 212 - 2 inhibited, but SR 141716 did not affect, Ach release in the cortex <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 +/+ mice. Both drugs did not alter Ach release in the cortex <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> 1 −/− mice. Tritium content did not differ between CB 1 +/+ and CB 1 −/− mice in any preparation. In conclusion, the increase in NA release associated with CB 1 receptor deficiency in the vas deferens, which cannot be ascribed to an alteration of tritium content of the preparations, suggests an endogenous tone at the CB 1 receptors of CB 1 +/+ mice in this tissue. Furthermore, the effect of WIN 55, 212 - 2 on NA release in the vas deferens and on cortical Ach release involves CB 1 receptors, whereas the involvement of non-CB 1 –non-CB 2 receptors can be excluded...|$|R

5|$|Through {{the night}} to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 needed to buy the half hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage <b>from</b> <b>CBS</b> and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.|$|E
5|$|Offscreen, Mutual {{remained}} an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule {{of news and}} opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis. The network aired that year's NFL Championship Game on December 8, the first national broadcast of the annual event. Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own {{with that of the}} wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS. At 2:26p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship station WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the first public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier. In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück. The following month, Meet the Press premiered with Martha Rountree as moderator.

40|$|Umbilical {{cord blood}} (CB) {{has been widely}} used instead of bone marrow (BM) and {{peripheral}} blood (PB) for stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, problems of sustained immunodeficiency after CB transplantation remain to be resolved. To elucidate the mechanism of immunodeficiency, we compared the characteristics of B cells differentiated in vitro from CD 34 + cells of CB with those of PB. Purified CD 34 + cells <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> and PB were cultured on murine stroma cell-line MS- 5 with stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for 6 weeks. The B-cell precursors (pre-B cells) that differentiated in this culture system, were analysed as to their immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) variable region gene repertoire and the expression of B-cell differentiation-related genes. CD 10 + CD 19 + pre-B cells were differentiated from both PB and CB. Although the usages of IgH gene segments in pre-B cells differentiated <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> and PB were similar, the N region was significantly shorter in CB-derived than PB-derived cells. Productive rearrangements were significantly fewer in cells of CB than PB in the third week. Among a number of B-cell differentiation-related genes, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) gene was not expressed in CB-derived cells during the culture. These results indicated that immature features of pre-B cells <b>from</b> <b>CB,</b> such as lack of TdT expression, and a short N region and few productive rearrangements in the IgH gene, might cause the delay in mature B-cell production...|$|R

40|$|Particulate air {{pollution}} {{is linked to}} impaired respiratory health. We analyzed particle emissions from common indoor sources (candles burning (CB), toasting bread (TB), frying sausages (FS)) and lung function in 55 healthy volunteers (mean age 33. 0 years) in a randomized cross-over controlled exposure study. Lung-deposited particle surface area concentration (PSC), size-specific particle number concentration (PNC) up to 10 µm, and particle mass concentration (PMC) of PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 were determined during exposure (2 h). FEV 1, FVC and MEF 25 %– 75 % was measured before, 4 h and 24 h after exposure. Wilcoxon-rank sum tests (comparing exposure scenarios) and mixed linear regression using particle concentrations and adjusting for personal characteristics, travel time and transportation means before exposure sessions were performed. While no effect was seen comparing the exposure scenarios and in the unadjusted model, inverse associations were found for PMC <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> and FS in relation to FEV 1 and MEF 25 %– 75 %. with a change in 10 µg/m 3 in PM 2. 5 <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> being associated with a change in FEV 1 of − 19 mL (95 %-confidence interval:− 43; 5) after 4 h.

40|$|Abstract Background Endothelial {{progenitor}} cells (EPCs) play {{a fundamental}} role in post-natal vascular repair, yet EPCs from different anatomic locations possess unique biological properties. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. Results EPCs <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> expressed abundant genes involved in cell cycle, hypoxia signalling and blood vessel development, correlating with the phenotypes that CB-EPCs proliferated more rapidly, migrated faster, and formed tubule structure more efficiently. smRNA-seq further deciphered miRNome patterns in EPCs isolated <b>from</b> <b>CB</b> or PB: 54 miRNAs were enriched in CB-EPCs, while another 50 in PB-EPCs. Specifically, CB-EPCs expressed more angiogenic miRNAs such as miR- 31, while PB-EPCs possessed more tumor suppressive miRNAs including miR- 10 a. Knocking down miR- 31 levels in CB-EPCs suppressed cell migration and microtubule formation, while overexpressing miR- 31 in PB-EPCs helped to recapitulate some of CB-EPC functions. Conclusions Our results show {{the foundation for}} a more detailed understanding of EPCs from different anatomic sources. Stimulating the expression of angiogenic microRNAs or genes in EPCs of low activity (such as those from patients with cardiovascular diseases) might allow the development of novel therapeutic strategies. </p...|$|R
