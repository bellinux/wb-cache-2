5|$|In Japan, {{health care}} is {{provided}} by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health <b>insurance</b> <b>program</b> administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.|$|E

30|$|Finally, the {{introduction}} of public health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> may also lead to problems of moral hazard, which refers {{to the effect of}} insurance on the behavior of the insured. One of the criteria that the literature has proposed for designing public health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> is to minimize the efficiency loss resulting from {{the introduction}} of such insurance (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).

30|$|According to {{demographic}} and epidemiological transitions, LAC {{has become increasingly}} vulnerable {{to the impact of}} NCDs. Improved access to healthcare, early detection, and timely treatment constitute an effective approach to reducing the impact of NCDs (Alwan 2011). In this context, the provision of health insurance plays an important role. This section focuses on health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs,</b> first discussing the rationales for creating health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> and then briefly setting out the choices that define particular health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Participation {{in private}} <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> is often voluntary; if the {{purchase}} of insurance is mandatory, individuals usually {{have a choice of}} insurers. Participation in social <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> is generally mandatory; if participation is voluntary, the cost is heavily subsidised enough to ensure essentially universal participation.|$|R

This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program,</b> providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.|$|E
5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare reform bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program</b> (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program</b> in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to federally funded programs, {{there are five}} states which currently offer state funded Disability <b>Insurance</b> <b>programs.</b> These programs are designed for short term disabilities only. The coverage amount {{is determined by the}} applicant's level of income over the previous 12 months. The states which currently fund disability <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> are California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{there appears}} to be a {{trade-off}} between the expansion of subsidized health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> and workersâ€™ choices of informal employment. Given the high rates of informality in LAC and the need to expand access to healthcare to the uninsured, long-term evaluation of the impact of publicly subsidized health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> on the informal market is a research priority. Along these lines, it is also crucial to assess the effects of these programs on health status. The empirical evidence on the extent to which public health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> improve health outcomes is very limited (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of medical expense insurance, patients were expected to pay all other health care costs {{out of their own}} pockets, under {{what is known as the}} fee-for-service business model. During the middle to late 20th century, traditional disability insurance evolved into modern health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs.</b> Today, most comprehensive private health <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> cover the cost of routine, preventive, and emergency health care procedures, and also most prescription drugs, but this was not always the case. The rise of private insurance was accompanied by the gradual expansion of public <b>insurance</b> <b>programs</b> for those who could not acquire coverage through the market.|$|R
5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program,</b> as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeliâ€“Palestinian peace process.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedyâ€”a Democratâ€”and Orrin Hatchâ€”a Republicanâ€”teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program</b> (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Grammâ€“Leachâ€“Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glassâ€“Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the eastern}} portion of West Virginia was {{declared}} a federal disaster area on November 7, 1985. Within {{two weeks of the}} declaration, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began clearing debris across the state, which was completed by July 1986. Widespread areas were under a boil-water advisory due to damage to water facilities, prompting officials to deliver trucks with bottled water through disaster areas. The state's highway department worked with FEMA and the USACE to clear destroyed buildings. Workers also buried killed animals, cleared blocked streams, and helped farmers regrow lost crops. FEMA opened 20disaster centers across the state to coordinate residents' requests for federal aid, and used 290 full or part-time employees. Overall federal assistance totaled $285million, including $171million for debris removal and repairing infrastructure, $90million for loans and temporary housing, and $24million through payments from the National Flood <b>Insurance</b> <b>Program.</b> This followed a six-week period when applications for such assistance were processed. After receiving complaints about inadequate funding, FEMA increased payments to 869people. FEMA also built 647temporary mobile homes, only about half of which were utilized. Residents complained that the money spent on the homes was misdirected and instead should have been given directly to victims. Many residents in Albright moved away after the main industry - river rafting - was washed away. In the city of Parsons, most businesses relied on small business loans to continue operating, although 18stores never reopened following the floods. Officials held a telethon on state television and radio on December7, 1985, that ultimately raised $1.7million for storm victims in the state. In the years after the flood, residents rebuilt houses farther away from flood plains, while officials rebuilt roads, bridges, and public buildings.|$|E
