25|$|The only <b>hardware</b> <b>system</b> that CP/M, as sold by Digital Research, {{would support}} was the Intel 8080 Development System. Manufacturers of CP/M-compatible systems {{customized}} {{portions of the}} operating system for their own combination of installed memory, disk drives, and console devices. CP/M would also run on systems based on the Zilog Z80 processor since the Z80 was compatible with 8080 code. While the Digital Research distributed core of CP/M (BDOS, CCP, core transient commands) did not use any of the Z80-specific instructions, many Z80-based systems used Z80 code in the system-specific BIOS, and many applications were dedicated to Z80-based CP/M machines.|$|E

2500|$|Some systems using {{electro-mechanical}} switching {{in regard}} to microphone activation were engineered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Peter W. Tappan and Robert F. Ancha devised a system of seat sensors that would activate one of 350 hidden microphones at the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist in Chicago in 1970. From approximately 1968, Ken Patterson and Diversified Concepts developed a <b>hardware</b> <b>system</b> that could detect the [...] "Number of Open Microphones" [...] (NOM) and attenuate the master output by an amount which increased with a higher number of microphones in use. This latter system was public domain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{ability of}} {{unambiguously}} specifying (in a mathematical sense) and rigorously analysing timing prop-erties/constraints {{is fundamental to}} design correct <b>hardware</b> <b>systems.</b> Formalisms in which hardware behaviour and timing properties can be precisely captured is a mandatory prerequisite for designing correct <b>hardware</b> sys-tems (discrete-time <b>systems</b> by nature). Timed process algebras are such formalisms. To show that timed process algebras are useful for formal specification and analysis of <b>hardware</b> <b>systems,</b> in this paper, we illustrate {{the use of a}} timed process algebra called timed Chi (χ) with several benchmark examples of <b>hardware</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{idea for}} an {{interactive}} video game TV show was conceived in 1987 by Ivan Sølvason, founder of SilverRock Productions, former editor-in-chief of COMPuter magazine and {{creator of the}} interactive TV programs OsWALD and Super OsWALD, made for Nordisk Film's TV2 Denmark in 1988, and Niels Krogh Mortensen, an animator. Sølvason's small company SilverRock Productions, which was later renamed as Interactive Television Entertainment (ITE) ApS in 1992, developed the character of Hugo {{as well as the}} designated, custom-built computer <b>hardware</b> <b>system</b> that would convert telephone signals into remotely control the characters in the game and allow the interaction of the audience and the TV action without delay. Sølvason and Krogh Mortensen created the concept of [...] "Hugo the TV troll" [...] and the Hugo TV program targeted for the children audience between the ages of four to 14 was launched in September 1990.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{category}} is the bocuses (sing. bocú alt. pl. bocúes), also called fondos ("bottoms").“The bokú is a single-headed drum, skin {{nailed to the}} shell, shell open at one end, long, shaped like a conic section and made of staves with iron hoops that circle them and hold them together. [...] They are heated with fire and played {{with both hands and}} no sticks. [...] The musician or bokusero carries the drum on his left side, hung over the shoulder with a strap.” (Ortíz II 1952-5:34) [...] Nowadays, the skin is usually held on by a metal <b>hardware</b> <b>system</b> {{similar to that of the}} commercial conga drum. [...] Anywhere from four to 16 bocuses are used in one conga (Brea and Millet 1993:179). [...] The bocuses play simple interlocking parts with few variations (however, the sum of the parts results in quite a complex drum melody). [...] A smaller bocú, called a quinto or bocusito, plays complex off-beat figures and improvisations.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{category}} are the bimembranophone tambores (Brea and Millet 1993:200), mentioned in documents {{as early as}} 1916 (Pérez I 1988:217) [...] There are three tambores: one requinto and two galletas. The requinto (Brea and Millet 1993:198), first mentioned in writing as early as 1931 (Pérez II 1988:9), is shaped somewhat like a snare drum- about 50% wider than it is tall. It is hung from the left shoulder with {{the top of the}} drum slightly skewed to the left and is played with a stick on the right-hand skin while the left hand mutes or opens the left-hand skin. [...] Its part is simple with few variations. [...] The galletas (also called congas- Orovio 1981:186) are like bass drums, but flatter. [...] They are both played with a stick {{in a manner similar to}} the requinto, except that they are hung from the shoulders in such a way that the skins are nearly horizontal to the ground. [...] The higher pitched of the two is called a redoblante (Brea and Millet 1993:197). It measures approximately 2 feet in diameter and 5inches high. [...] In addition to its basic pattern, there are many floreos (variations) that it can play. [...] The lower-pitched galleta is called a pilón (Brea and Millet 1993:196) or pilonera (Ortíz II 1952-5:242). [...] It measure about 2inches larger in each dimension than the redoblante. This drum plays a basic pattern with few variations. All three of the drums utilize a metal <b>hardware</b> <b>system</b> for attaching the skins to the drum shells.|$|E
