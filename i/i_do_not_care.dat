25|$|Whether Adam is the personage that {{we should}} {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> for one moment how that is; it is no matter whether we are to consider Him our God, or whether His Father, or his Grandfather, for in either case we are of one species of one family and Jesus Christ is also of our species.|$|E
500|$|Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee {{was arrested}} in Portland, Oregon. He {{had been accused of}} {{treating}} Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee admitted it was true. [...] "I fixed Sharkey up to look {{as if he had been}} fouled. How? Well, that is something <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair." ...|$|E
500|$|Deveau {{returned}} to report these findings to Morehouse, {{who decided to}} bring the derelict into Gibraltar, [...] away. Under maritime law, a salvor could expect a substantial share of the combined value of rescued vessel and cargo, the exact award depending {{on the degree of}} danger inherent in the salvaging. Morehouse divided Dei Gratias crew of eight between the two vessels, sending Deveau and two experienced seamen to Mary Celeste, while he and four others remained on Dei Gratia. The weather was relatively calm for most of the way to Gibraltar, but with each ship seriously undermanned, progress was slow. Dei Gratia reached Gibraltar on December 12, 1872, and Mary Celeste, which had encountered fog, arrived on the following morning. She was immediately impounded by the vice admiralty court, preparatory to salvage hearings. Deveau wrote to his wife that the ordeal of bringing the ship in was such that [...] "I can hardly tell what I am made of, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> so long as I got in safe. I shall be well paid for the Mary Celeste." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wong {{signed for}} the {{recording}} giant EMI in 1997 {{after her first}} daughter was born, in a contract worth HK$60 million (approx. US$7.7 million), to release 55 songs in five albums. While most of her earlier albums were sung in Cantonese, Wong has since sung almost exclusively in Mandarin, her mother tongue, although she recorded Cantonese versions {{of a couple of}} songs in each of her last four albums with EMI to please her Hong Kong audience. Having gone through a period of experimentation, Wong stated that she wished to make [...] "music that I like. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> if others don't, though I would be delighted if they do".|$|E
2500|$|Gavrilo Princip ( [...] , 28 April 1918) was a Bosnian Serb {{member of}} Young Bosnia, a Yugoslavist {{organization}} seeking {{an end to}} Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Sophie, in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, setting off {{a chain of events}} that would lead to outbreak of the First World War. Princip and his accomplices were arrested and implicated the Serbian nationalist secret society known as the Black Hand, leading Austria-Hungary to issue a démarche to Serbia known as the July Ultimatum. This was used as pretext for Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, which then led to World War I. [...] Princip was a Yugoslav nationalist associated with the movement Mlada Bosna (Young Bosnia) which predominantly consisted of Serbs, but also Bosniaks and Croats. During his trial he stated: [...] "I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> what form of state, but it must be freed from Austria." [...] Princip died on April 28, 1918, from tuberculosis caused by poor prison conditions that had cost him a limb earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{attended}} the 1884 GOP National Convention in Chicago {{and gave a}} speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch, an Edmunds supporter, to be temporary chair. Roosevelt fought alongside the Mugwump reformers; however, Blaine, having gained support from Arthur's and Edmunds' delegates, won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot. In a crucial moment of his budding political career, Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine. He bragged about his one small success: [...] "We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman... To do this needed a mixture of skill, boldness and energy... to get the different factions to come in... to defeat the common foe." [...] He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand, the largest crowd he had addressed up to that date. Having gotten a taste of national politics, Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level; he then retired to his new [...] "Chimney Butte Ranch" [...] on the Little Missouri River. Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland, the governor of New York and the Democratic nominee in the general election. He debated {{the pros and cons}} of staying loyal with his political friend, Henry Cabot Lodge. After Blaine won the nomination, Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give [...] "hearty support to any decent Democrat". He distanced himself from the promise, saying that it had not been meant [...] "for publication". When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine, Roosevelt replied, [...] "That question I decline to answer. It is a subject <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>care</b> to talk about." [...] In the end, he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP, and he did so in a press release on July 19. Having lost the support of many reformers, Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and move to North Dakota.|$|E
