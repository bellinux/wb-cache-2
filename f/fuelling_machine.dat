50|$|Gentilly-1 was a {{prototype}} CANDU-BWR reactor, {{based on the}} SGHWR design. It was designed for a net output of 250MW(e). The reactor had several features unique amongst CANDU reactors, including vertically oriented pressure tubes (allowing {{for the use of}} a single <b>fuelling</b> <b>machine</b> below the core), and light-water coolant. These features were intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the unit, again to make it an attractive export unit. However, the design was not successful, and over nearly 7 years recorded only 180 on-power days. Gentilly-1 is no longer in operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In nuclear reactors, {{process as}} well as power water {{hydraulics}} is extensively used to avoid intermixing of oils with water which is used as coolant and moderator. A <b>Fuelling</b> <b>Machine</b> (FM) is used for on-power refueling of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) and Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). Many mechanisms of FM are operated under water environment to handle the fresh {{as well as}} used fuel. Use of Water Hydraulic (WH) actuators is preferred to actuate these mechanisms. It is desirable to use water hydraulic direct drives like High Torque Low Speed (HTLS) rather than using high speed motors with mechanical multipliers like gearbox, working inside the water environment. Mechanical multipliers avoided as they are prone to tribological problems like insufficient lubrication, high wear rate and friction, corrosion etc. under water environment. Water Hydraulic HTLS motors are not available in market, hence there is need to develop it indigenously. WH motor with radial piston configuration {{is one of the}} promising options for HTLS motor since in this design, as it has less number of moving parts and less dynamic sealing locations. This paper discusses comparison of various design configurations of hydraulic motor, problems associated with design of water hydraulic components and engineering solutions to overcome the same, theoretical analysis of radial piston HTLS motor...|$|E
40|$|The {{fossil fuel}} {{resources}} are decreasing and many research's are looking for alternative fuels to comply with transportation need while reducing {{the environmental impact of}} this sector. Inside the transport activity sector, off road vehicle and machine used for agriculture needs a small, but vital energy amount of around 2 MToe in France and the anaerobic digestion of rural wastes could roughly cover machine needs. This paper aims to study environmental and energetic interest of this short power supply path. An ideal biogas production system is built up from average characteristic of current rural biogas plant in France. Pollutant emission and energy demand and production are assessed for various way of producing methane for dual fuel engine. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to look for the environmental impact of the dual <b>fuelled</b> agricultural <b>machines</b> and a comparison with other biofuel's LCA is made. Results show the great impact of biogas on "ecotoxicity" and "respiratory diseases" of the biogas: these are mainly related to electricity production and improvement can be reached with some care about methane losses and local electricity production. For human health, HAP measurements could improve the assessment and avoid inconsistency between different models used in LCA. Then, the impact on the climate change and energy depletion is discussed: therefore, different methods are used to build the energetic and carbon balance of the biogas production system. Then, from this comparison, we discussed about the choice of energy for agricultural machines: biogas energy cost could be reduced by using agricultural machines with high substitution rate instead diesel...|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{response}} {{for the film}} was positive. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 76% based on 115 reviews, with the site's consensus stating: [...] "Emma Thompson's second labor of love with the Nanny McPhee character actually improves on the first, delivering charming family fare with an excellent cast." [...] News of the World gave it 4/5 stars, stating the film was [...] "smart, witty and beautifully crafted - {{exactly what you want}} from a family film" [...] and excited about the next film said [...] "Roll on Nanny McThree". The Independent gave a very favourable review, stating [...] "the film is an ingenious entertainment <b>machine</b> <b>fuelled</b> by a profound understanding of what children enjoy, whether it's cowpats, talking welly boots or piglets doing synchronised swimming. Thompson has written a properly funny script, which is performed superbly by Ifans, Maggie Smith, Bill Bailey, Ralph Fiennes and some estimable child actors." [...] Eros Vlahos was nominated for Best Leading Young Actor at the Young Artist Awards 2011 against Noah Ringer for The Last Airbender, Zachary Gordon for Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Jaden Smith (winner) for The Karate Kid.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} field {{evaluation}} of a liquid petroleum gas (L. P. G.) powered engine on a harvesting platform. A self-propelled harvesting platform, equipped with a small Otto engine was chosen to study mechanical solutions to adapt the chosen machine to L. P. G. fuelling and to compare pollutant emissions using petrol and L. P. G. Field test using petrol and L. P. G. were carried out during pears harvesting. Work capacity of the machine, man-power efficiency, fuel consumption and several basic components of exhausted gases mixture (O 2, CO, CO 2, HC) were measured and evaluated. Field tests were compared with bench tests made on the same engine. The results confirm that L. P. G. <b>fuelling</b> on agricultural <b>machines</b> needs technical and mechanical solutions simpler than the actually adopted on the civil motor-vehicles. These solutions have to be mainly ensure correct regulation and control of L. P. G. delivery and a correct placement of the L. P. G. feeding cylinder, in order to workers safety and simple management during the field operations. Moreover, the field tests {{point out that the}} work capacity of the studied machine is the same for both petrol and L. P. G. fuelling, while consumption and engine pollutant emissions are quite lower for L. P. G. fuelling...|$|R
