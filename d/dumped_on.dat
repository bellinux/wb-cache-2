5|$|On Monday morning, {{the storm}} had moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter and wait for things to clear.|$|E
5|$|Reclamation methods varied {{somewhat}} {{during the}} 19th century, but three basic operations featured; constructing drains at appropriate intervals; building {{a system of}} roads to allow access to the land so that materials such as clay, lime or marl could be <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> it, to give it body; and fertilising the land by adding manure, often {{in the form of}} the euphemistically named night soil, collected from neighbouring towns.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} and industrial waste <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> Chat Moss resulted in {{very high levels}} of heavy metals such as lead and copper in the soil, raising concerns that crops grown there may pose a health risk.

5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up in several stages, {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built up during the medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. The causeway steps up to the top of the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} posse {{is captured}} by Chiricahua Apache Native Americans, who {{blame them for}} the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and emerges from the fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had travelled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens, who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments to find humans' weaknesses, are far stronger and more durable than humans, and have superior weaponry, but are not invulnerable. They can be stabbed and shot to death, but only Jake's gauntlet weapon or a well-aimed shot with a rifle can kill them with a single blast. Ella tells them that the aliens which previously attacked them are just scouts.|$|E
5|$|There {{are very}} few {{material}} remains of the medieval town today. The city wall that surrounded the settlement has largely disappeared and is difficult to trace today, but from the remains of its foundations {{it does not appear}} to have been a substantial fortification. It was lightly built, with a thickness of perhaps , reinforced by rectangular towers. The three gates have left far more substantial remains. The eastern, southeastern and southern sides were fronted by a ditch of some , with the excavated soil <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> the inner side and used to elevate the city wall. A small citadel was located in the southwestern corner of the town. The port was separated from the main town by a wall, and was situated in an excavated basin (today a swamp) and probably separated from the sea by an artificial mole and protected by extensions of the city walls. The entrance to the harbour was from the west, offering protection from both the wind and the coast's shoals.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

25|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León on 13 May 2012, authorities discovered 49 decapitated bodies <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> a highway. Official reports alleged that a local cell of Los Zetas had tortured, mutilated and decapitated their victims {{to send a message}} to their rivals. Morales however, had ordered the henchmen and the local boss of the Zeta cell to toss the bodies in the town's square and not outside the city limits, which supports the hypothesis that members in Los Zetas were disobeying their superiors.|$|E
25|$|These {{oscillating}} bans and authorizations {{for export}} have created wave-like market of {{rising and falling}} prices for rosewood. During times of stricter control, prices rise considerably while illegally harvested wood is stockpiled in anticipation of future authorizations. When restrictions are removed, large quantities of rosewood are <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> the market, bringing massive profits for traders before causing a rapid fall in prices. During the intervals between exports, the wood traders, who are also vanilla traders, use the relatively steady income from vanilla exports to fund the extraction of the illegal wood.|$|E
25|$|Selling {{human waste}} {{products}} as fertilizers became much less common after World War II, both for sanitary reasons {{and because of}} the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is now used for fertilization. Because of this history, Japan had a much higher historical standard of hygiene. For example, in Japan, the orderly disposal of human waste was common, while in Europe, sewage was simply <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> the streets throughout much of the continent's early modern history. The first Westerner to visit Edo expressed his shock to see such a clean city.|$|E

25|$|The hollow {{between the}} Old and New Towns was {{formerly}} the Nor Loch, {{which was created}} for the town's defence but came {{to be used by}} the inhabitants for dumping their sewage. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal {{on the site of the}} loch, but this idea was abandoned. Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> the site of the loch to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as The Mound.|$|E

The remains are those of an adult, tentatively identified as female and of unknown age. The burial dates to the Late Classic. Associated offerings included an inverted ceramic vessel, a flint projectile point, a grey obsidian prismatic blade, a shell disk, two perforated ceramic disks and various other pieces of worked flint. Some of these items may actually be rubbish <b>dumped</b> <b>on</b> top of the burial, with only the inverted vessel being a definite offering associated with the human remains.
