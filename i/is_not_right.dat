However, he still found that [...] "be it because their sound <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> for covering such an act or because they let their imagination run a little too wild {{for the sake of}} the art of reinterpretation, the creativity is vulnerable to quickly becoming a gimmick." [...] He listed [...] "Oh Father" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] as two highlights, describing them as the [...] "most resonant".|$|E

He storms into the house, only to find that the family has disappeared. Suddenly, he is confronted by Martin, who tells him to leave. Mike refuses, and is thrown through the roof, only to be embedded in the yard.|$|E

Dave Carlton, RWE's project manager, has said that they [...] "see the site as an important one, both for RWE npower {{and in terms of}} the UK’s future power generation”, and so RWE npower have retained the site for a possible future power station. Malcolm Reid of People Against New Coal Stations, a group opposed to the power station development, said: [...] "We would now like to see Northumberland County Council re-designate the Cambois site for green, clean technology, to match what is happening at the New and Renewable Energy Centre (NaREC) in Blyth. It is a perfect area for a factory for offshore wind turbines and housing development. If Cambois is re-designated then the prospect of the area being regenerated rises colossally." ...|$|E
500|$|Rudy Klap of Sputnikmusic gave {{praise to}} the {{production}} and songwriting, singling out [...] "Golden Gate Jumpers" [...] with having [...] "one of the record's best lyrics and melodies," [...] but was critical of Willett's performance saying that [...] "his voice can turn from interesting and fresh to grating and intolerable {{with just a few}} misplaced falsettos." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic was also critical about Willett throughout the album, finding his voice [...] "unfettered to the point of grating ("Something <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Right</b> with Me")" [...] and lyrics to be [...] "overworked instead of clever ("Against Privacy")" [...] but found some of the songs carried sharp songwriting skills ("Golden Gate Jumpers") and flair ("I've Seen Enough") concluding that [...] "Cold War Kids deserve credit for their ambitions, but there's a fine line between trying hard and trying too hard. More often than not, Loyalty to Loyalty takes a disappointing stumble on it." ...|$|E

In August, the Provincial Congress met in Princeton and transformed into the state's first Legislature. According to Snell, on several occasions Shafer would rise to his feet exclaiming his dissent in German, saying [...] "Das ist nicht recht! Das ist nicht recht!" [...] (trans. [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>right!</b> That is not right!") and positing his argument in his adopted English. He represented the county {{for the next three}} years, and was described as [...] "faithful in his attendance at the various meetings at Princeton, Trenton, Burlington and Haddonfield. His vote is recorded on almost every question, and always in favor of the most vigorous and aggressive measures for carrying on the war." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening track [...] "Against Privacy" [...] was {{described}} by Willett as a [...] "bohemian manifesto" [...] made by a person with an affinity {{for the arts and}} wanting to live on an art commune. [...] "Mexican Dogs" [...] was written by the band during a trip in Mexico City where they saw a pack of unnamed three-legged dogs running wild across the field. Maust said that he saw it as a metaphor for how the band operates as a whole, in their conduction of both art and business, and how their song craft is [...] "very community oriented and very democratic." [...] The overall sound of the track is reminiscent of boogie rock. The track [...] "Every Valley Is Not a Lake" [...] was a song that was left off Robbers & Cowards. It tells the story about a mother lecturing her daughter about going wild {{in the world and the}} consequences she may face if not careful. The song utilizes jazz piano for its melodies. [...] "Something <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Right</b> with Me" [...] is an upbeat track about a person losing touch with the revolving world and its constant changes from people to technology. Critics described the song as having [...] "Stones-styled bluesy licks" [...] and [...] "Lodger-era Bowie rhythms." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to take the reviewing of children's books seriously. Trimmer's over four hundred reviews constituted a set of distinct and identifiable criteria regarding what was valuable in this new genre. As a high-church Anglican, she was intent on protecting Christianity from secularism as well as evangelicalism, particularly as the latter manifested itself in Methodism. Her reviews also reveal {{her to be a}} staunch monarchist and opponent of the French Revolution. As Grenby puts it, [...] "her initial questions of any children's books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy illustrated her fundamentalism. She wrote to a friend: [...] "I will only say, that the more I reflect on the subject, the more I am convinced that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>right</b> to supersede the figurative style in which they speak of God and divine things, my opinion is, that whoever attempts to teach the truths of divine revelation, should follow the method of the inspired writers as nearly as possible" [...] For Trimmer, the truth of the Bible was not only in its content, but also in its style, and some of her harshest reviews were written against texts that altered both the style and the substance of the Bible.|$|E

A music video directed by Sophie Muller was created for the single and premiered on the band's YouTube page on September 17, 2008. The song was voted number 38 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2008. A second single, [...] "I've Seen Enough", was released on October 22, 2008 but failed to chart. Two music videos were created to promote the single. The first video was directed by Vern Moen and shot in black-and-white, premiering on the band's YouTube page on February 23, 2009. The second video was a collaboration with director Sam Jones (who had previously directed [...] ) and his production company Tool of North America.

[...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique".
