2500|$|At {{a private}} dinner in November 2014, Emil Michael, senior vice {{president}} of Uber, suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to dig into the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber. Specifically, he targeted Sarah Lacy, editor of the technology website PandoDaily, who has accused Uber of sexism and misogyny. The controversy made national news and stirred criticism against Uber. [...] "The comments, reportedly made by {{senior vice president}} for business Emil Michael at a New York dinner attended by BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith," [...] wrote a Washington Post columnist, [...] "ignited a powder keg of criticism about a company already perceived as cut-throat – landing Uber on the front pages of The Washington Post, USA Today and The New York Times." [...] Michael issued a public apology. Later, he sent an email to Lacy: [...] "I was at an event and was venting, but what I said was never intended to describe actions that would ever be undertaken by me or my company toward you or anyone else. I was definitively wrong and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> about any distress I have caused you." ...|$|E

April 3, 2004 [...] <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> ... the speech ... It's a blot. I'm the one who presented it on behalf of the United States to the world, and it will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It's painful now. Sep 8, 2005 ...|$|E

We've got {{to keep it going}} through the fall, that's really important, but this is great. I'm just so proud of my guys. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> for the fans because I didn't get to do a burnout. I didn't have any gas. The car wouldn't run, but we're back here in Victory Lane and what a great Saturday night." ...|$|E
5000|$|These events {{occurred}} on my watch. As Secretary of Defense, I am accountable for them. I take full responsibility. It is my obligation to evaluate what happened, {{to make sure}} those who have committed wrongdoing are brought to justice, and to make changes as needed {{to see that it}} doesn't happen again. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> about what happened to these Iraqi detainees. They are human beings. They were in U.S. custody. Our country had an obligation to treat them right. We didn't do that. That was wrong. To those Iraqis who were mistreated by members of U.S. armed forces, I offer my deepest apology. It was un-American. And it was inconsistent with the values of our nation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collapse}} of the orchestra raised a number of suspicions regarding how {{the management of the}} orchestra reacted to its financial difficulties. Perhaps the most widely questioned piece of the controversy is the [...] "ultimatum," [...] issued by orchestra chairman Dan Lewis on April 22, stating that bankruptcy was imminent unless the community would produce $20 million. This approach to fundraising has been criticized as being excessively confrontational and unlikely to provide results as it could create an attitude of unwillingness to contribute to an organization whose bankruptcy was imminent anyway. Dan Lewis, however, has defended this step as necessary, citing time constraints and saying that [...] "I feel good about what we did. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> about the outcome, but I think we did a good job." ...|$|E

Code was on a winter camping trip with few supplies, similar to summer trips he'd taken before in admiration of the adventures he had seen on Survivorman. Learning of Code's death, Stroud said, [...] "It's a <b>terrible</b> tragedy and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> absolutely <b>terrible</b> for the families involved"—but did not know Code or the situation he was in, and refused to comment further on his death.|$|R

5000|$|In the Spinster on October 6, she battled {{with old}} rival Gorgeous and won by three lengths while setting a stakes record. Coming into the 1990 Breeders' Cup Distaff at Belmont Park on October 27, Bayakoa had six wins from nine starts, {{with two of}} those losses coming in open company against male horses. Despite her {{excellent}} record, she was only the second choice {{in the field to}} the brilliant three-year-old filly Go For Wand. Both front-runners by nature, the two battled for the lead for the first mile {{as if it was a}} match race. After they came off of the final turn and entered the last furlong, Go For Wand's leg shattered near the spot on the track where the great Ruffian is buried. Bayakoa continued on to the wire, and Go For Wand was euthanized. [...] "I can hardly speak," [...] said McNally. [...] "I feel good for our mare, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> because of what happened to Go For Wand." ...|$|E

He pitted with 30 to go and handed the lead to Ryan Blaney. He pitted with 25 to go and handed the lead to Alex Bowman. He pitted with 19 to go and the lead cycled back to Elliott. During the pit cycle, Johnson was issued a pass through penalty for speeding. He said after the race that he [...] "just can’t believe I got in trouble down there leaving the pits. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> for these guys. It should have been a top-five day, but I will back down on pit road even more and try not to make that mistake. Hats off to the team for our fast Lowe’s Chevrolet, I just screwed up.” ...|$|E

40|$|I {{would like}} to {{dedicate}} this to my mother, Nita (aka Mama). She instilled in me a love of learning {{at a very early}} age and consistently encouraged me to challenge myself intellectually. It was this thirst for knowledge that ultimately led me to pursue a Ph. D. in mathematics, and for that, I will always be grateful. Thank you Mama. I love you very much. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I {{would like to}} thank the following people. Tom Weston: for being a brilliant and incredibly supportive adviser and mentor. He helped me to believe in myself academically, and supported me with patience and compassion through many personal difficulties during my studies. His knowledge and advice have been invaluable to me. My Family and Friends: for being loving, supportive and generally amazing through this whole process. I could not have done this without them.

2500|$|In January 2007, Boxer was in {{the news}} for {{comments}} she made when responding to Bush's plans to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. [...] "Who pays the price?" [...] Boxer asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. [...] "I'm {{not going to pay}} a personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you." [...] When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, [...] "Madam Secretary, please. <b>I</b> know you <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> about it. That's not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily... I find really appalling." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a July 1999 {{speech to}} the Democratic Leadership Council, then-President Bill Clinton criticized Bush's [...] "compassionate conservative" [...] self-description, saying: [...] "This 'compassionate conservatism' has a great ring to it, you know? It sounds so good. And I've really worked hard {{to try to figure}} out what it means... I made an honest effort, and near as I can tell, here's what it means: It means, 'I like you. I do. And I would like to be for the patients' bill of rights and I'd like to be for closing the gun show loophole, and I'd like not to squander the surplus and, you know, save Social Security and Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to raise the minimum wage. I'd like to do these things. But I just can't, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>terrible</b> about it.'" [...] Similarly, in December 2005, then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, {{speaking}} in the House of Commons, said: [...] "the only difference between compassionate conservatism and conservatism is that under compassionate conservatism they tell you they're not going to help you but they're really sorry about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There again you partly deceive yourself, Adam. There is no sort of wrong deed {{of which}} a man can bear the {{punishment}} alone; you can't isolate yourself {{and say that the}} evil which is in you shall not spread. Men's lives are as thoroughly blended with each other as the air they breathe: evil spreads as necessarily as disease. <b>I</b> know, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> the <b>terrible</b> extent of suffering this sin of Arthur's has caused to others; but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it. An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under: you could not bear the punishment alone; you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you. You would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were and add worse evils to them. You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of vengeance, but the feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such actions, and as long as you indulge it, {{as long as you do}} not see that to fix your mind on Arthur's punishment is revenge, and not justice, you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong. Remember what you told me about your feelings after you had given that blow to Arthur in the Grove." ...|$|R

5000|$|On 28 April 2016, Foran {{was rushed}} to {{hospital}} in an ambulance after he overdosed on prescription medication and he was subsequently granted indefinite leave. On 29 April 2016, reports came out that Foran had been struggling because of the pressure of football, a relationship breakdown with his partner who recently gave birth to their second child, a third-party sponsorship dispute with former club Manly who allegedly owe him $140,000 {{and the prospect of}} Parramatta losing competition points from the club’s salary cap scandal. On 6 May 2016, Foran launched legal action against KIIS 106.5 Radio host Jackie O after she made degrading comments about Foran and his ex-partner Rebecca Pope about the paternity of the couple’s second child. Jackie O later apologized to Foran and Pope, commenting [...] "I just want to take this time to personally apologise to Rebecca and Kieran for what I said. I can imagine how hurtful that would have been and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> really <b>terrible,</b> <b>I</b> really do, and I'm truly sorry".On 21 May 2016, Foran was again in the spotlight after reports he lost $75,000 on his TAB account on a gambling binge. Reports claimed that Foran bet money on greyhounds and horse racing in South Africa. In one wager he allegedly placed a $20,000 bet on a horse that came last. Just prior to this gambling binge, Foran had returned to Sydney from a three-day stint at a Queensland rehabilitation centre. On 24 May 2016, Foran was reportedly planning to sue the TAB over his leaked betting details seeking a $150,000 payout from the betting agency. In round 12, against the Newcastle Knights, Foran suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in the Eels 20-18 win at Hunter Stadium. On 28 June 2016, Foran was stripped of his captaincy and fined $5,000 for unprofessional conduct by the Eels after he did not turn up to a rehabilitation session and drank alcohol while being injured. [...] On 29 July 2016, it was announced that Foran had been released from his contract with the Eels to sort out his personal issues. Foran finished the 2016 NRL season having played in 9 matches and scoring a solitary try for the Parramatta Eels.|$|R
