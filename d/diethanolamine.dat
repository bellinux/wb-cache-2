25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They {{are all suitable}} for thermoplastic polyurethanes {{with the exception of}} ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. <b>Diethanolamine</b> and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity.

25|$|In organic chemistry, ammonia {{can act as}} a {{nucleophile}} in substitution reactions. Amines can {{be formed}} by the reaction of ammonia with alkyl halides, although the resulting -NH2 group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the hydrogen halide formed. Methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with chloromethane, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare racemic alanine in 70% yield.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and magnetic characterisation {{of a series}} of polynuclear 3 d and 3 d/ 4 f complexes built using phenolic oxime type ligands. Chapter two {{describes the}} reaction of salicylaldoxime and its derivatised analogues (R-saoH 2) with the alkoxide containing co-ligands triethanolamine (TeaH 3) and 2 -(hydroxymethyl) pyridine (Hhmp), in the presence of Mn(II) /Ln(III) salts. This results in the formation of a family of sixteen [MnIII 4 LnIII 2] clusters, which are structurally related to a previously studied [MnIII 6] family of Single-Molecule Magnets (SMMs). The magnetic properties of the Ln = Y, Gd and Lu analogues can be qualitatively rationalised {{on the basis of a}} magneto-structural correlation (MSC), previously developed for MnIII alkoxide/oxime bridged dimers. Chapter three describes how the combination of two complimentary ligands, the phenolic oximes (R-SaoH 2) and the <b>diethanolamines</b> (DeaH 3), into one organic framework, creates new ligand types (H 3 L 1 and H 4 L 2) which can be used to construct a hexametallic MnIII wheel; [MnIII 6 Na(L 1) 6]Cl, the first example of a ferromagnetically coupled dodecametallic MnIII wheel;[MnIII 12 (OMe) 16 (L 2) 4 (O 2 CCMe 3) 4 (MeOH) 4], and the first example of a dodecametallic MnIII truncated tetrahedron; [MnIII 12 O 4 (H 3 L 2) 8 (H 2 L 2) 4 (TMA) 4 (TMA = trianion of trimesic acid). Single crystal hysteresis measurements reveal both 3. 2 and 3. 3 to be SMMs at low temperature. Chapter four deals with the use of H 4 L 2 in Cu coordination chemistry. Phenolic oximes are known to form monometallic complexes with CuII ions, as are the <b>diethanolamines.</b> However, the deliberate incorporation of one ligand onto the organic framework of the other permits the preparation of a family of [CuIIn] wheels (n = 4, 6, 8). In each case nearest neighbour interactions between CuII ions are shown to be strongly antiferromagnetic. DFT calculations suggest the origin of this interaction is related to the Cu-O-N-Cu dihedral angle, an observation which allows for the development of a theoretical MSC, that suggests a switch from antiferro- to ferro-magnetic exchange is possible at Cu-O-N-Cu angles > 60 o...|$|R
