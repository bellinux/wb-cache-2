5|$|Teesside Energy from Waste plant (also {{known as}} Teesside WTE power station or Haverton Hill <b>incinerator)</b> is a {{municipal}} waste <b>incinerator</b> and waste-to-energy power station, which provides 29.2 megawatts (MW) of electricity for the National Grid by burning 390,000 tonnes of household and commercial waste a year. It {{is located on}} the River Tees at Haverton Hill, east of Billingham in North East England. Operated by SITA UK since its conception, the plant replaced the Portrack <b>Incinerator</b> and opened in 1998.|$|E

The highway remains locally owned for three blocks to <b>Incinerator</b> Road, where the route becomes state-maintained once more. During this stretch, NY10 intersects NY5S at Main Street. North of <b>Incinerator</b> Road, the route passes under the Thruway before crossing into the neighboring village of Palatine Bridge at {{the midpoint of the}} Mohawk River. On the northern riverbank, NY10 meets NY5 and overlaps the route westward for a block before continuing northward into the largely rural town of Palatine.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed <b>incinerator.</b> The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the <b>incinerator,</b> and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

5|$|Between 1975 and 1996, the Portrack <b>Incinerator</b> on the River Tees burned 200,000 tonnes of Teesside's waste every year, {{generating}} 20 {{megawatts of}} electricity in doing so. In November 1996, the plant was closed down after it failed to meet emission regulations; it was then demolished in stages between 1998 and 2000.

The emission of dioxins from hospital waste <b>incinerators</b> is high compared with the emission of dioxins from Dutch municipal waste <b>incinerators.</b> Hospital waste was incinerated in the Netherlands by about 25 hospitals in august 1991.

5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. <b>Incinerator</b> bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker.
