5|$|Fast Ferries service began {{initially}} with {{a single}} boat, the 118-passenger Rich Passage 1, in 2017. The vessel is a catamaran designed to create a very low wake while operating at high speeds by employing a special foil. A second boat of a similar design is planned {{be added to the}} Bremerton route in 2019. The agency's plans call for the purchase of a 150-passenger catamaran <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> in 2018, two 250-passenger bow loading catamarans <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> in 2020 and 2021, and an additional 118-passenger high-speed, low-wake catamaran to be delivered in 2022.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Mohammed Osman Ali (Dhagah-tur), the General Director of the Ministry of Aviation and Transport, also {{announced}} that the Somali government had begun preparations to revive the Mogadishu-based national carrier, Somali Airlines.

5|$|In mid-1981, the Indian {{government}} set up {{a committee}} to study its own requirements for a light transport aircraft. Based upon this competition, the Bhutanese government ordered one Dornier 228-200 <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> in January 1983, with the option for a second aircraft <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983, the exact time of landing, the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft was parked on the airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong.|$|E

5|$|Permission {{was granted}} {{for the first}} batch of fifteen {{locomotives}} in March 1928, but this was reduced to ten when {{it became apparent that}} they would not immediately be able to operate on the Hastings route. Production delays at Eastleigh railway works meant that they were not delivered until between March and July 1930. Once the original batch had proved their worth and had been well received by the crews a further twenty locomotives were ordered in March 1931 <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> between December 1932 and March 1934. A third batch of twenty were ordered from Eastleigh in March 1932 <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> after the completion of the previous order, but this was subsequently reduced to ten locomotives because of the continuing trade depression. The final locomotive in the class was delivered in July 1935.|$|E

5|$|ALP's Letter {{becomes the}} focal point as it is {{analysed}} in detail in I.5.

50|$|The {{two primary}} {{categories}} of conventional footwork include batsmen's shots played {{off the front}} foot, and shots played off the back foot. A right-handed batsman's front foot is the left; the back foot is the right.

5|$|One {{consignment}} of 250 copies {{was stopped}} at Dover. Then the Chairman of the Board of Customs balked.

On 19 October he released the seized copies <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> to Leopold Hill's premises, where the Metropolitan Police were waiting with a search warrant. Hill and Cape were summoned to appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court to show cause why the book should not be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Cray-3 was {{originally}} slated <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> in 1991. This was {{during a time}} when the supercomputer market was rapidly shrinking from 50% annual growth in 1980, to 10% in 1988. At the same time, Cray Research was also working on the Y-MP, a faster multi-processor version of the system architecture tracing its ancestry to the original Cray-1. In order to focus the Y-MP and Cray-3 groups, and with Cray's personal support, the Cray-3 project moved to a new research center in Colorado Springs.|$|E
30|$|The four {{scenarios}} modelled in {{this paper}} indicate that cargo bikes are more cost effective than <b>delivery</b> trucks <b>for</b> <b>deliveries</b> {{in close proximity to}} the distribution center (less than 2 [*]miles <b>for</b> the observed <b>delivery</b> route with 50 parcels per stop and less than 6 [*]miles <b>for</b> the hypothetical <b>delivery</b> route with 10 parcels per stop) and at which there is a high density of residential units and low delivery volumes.|$|R

5|$|The {{resulting}} 0.021572 is positive, so {{one would}} say that the euro is trading at a 0.021572 or 2.16% premium against the dollar <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> in 30 days.

Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft.

5|$|VAT's {{positioning}} in the heavy-vehicle market strengthened in 1950 and {{the company}} started producing bus chassis. The same year, VAT introduced a new product familythe VK series.

The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005. The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose.|$|E
