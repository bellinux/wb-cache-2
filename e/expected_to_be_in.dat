40|$|We {{examine the}} {{intersection}} of the ‘‘Overworked American’’ and the ‘‘Sandwiched Generation. ’’ Recent studies indicate that many U. S. workers would prefer to work shorter hours. For workers who are sandwiched between childcare and eldercare or who <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the future, questions remain about work hour preferences. We use a representative sample and distinguish between currently sandwiched workers and those who <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> five years. The proportion of workers who are currently sandwiched has increased from 1992 to 2002. Further, workers who <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sandwiched <b>are</b> less likely <b>to</b> want to reduce their workweek hours than others...|$|R

5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in glass fiber, {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Tuesday 23 February, Gothenburg passed Cooktown {{at about}} 2:00pm. The {{wind and rain}} {{severely}} increased and cloud cover became so thick it blocked out the sun. Despite this, she continued the journey south into worsening weather, in a deep water passage between the North Queensland coastline and the Great Barrier Reef, known as the inner route. Although taking this route provided some protection from the open sea, captains had to navigate and thread {{their way through a}} number of then uncharted reefs. All passengers and crew <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> Newcastle on Sunday evening for a scheduled stopover.|$|E
5|$|During a {{match with}} Mr. Kennedy on the October 1, 2007 episode of Raw, Cena {{suffered}} a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss. Though finishing the match and {{taking part in}} the scripted attack by Orton after the match, surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone, estimating at the time to require seven months to a year of rehabilitation. As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night's episode of ECW, ending what was the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years. Cena's surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> his rehabilitation at that time. Despite his injury, Cena attended the annual WWE's Tribute to the Troops show filmed at Camp Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq on December 7, and aired on December 24.|$|E

5|$|No. 4 Commando {{made the}} {{crossing}} to Dieppe on board HMS Prins Albert. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a position but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they opened fire on the battery with their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles. One of the mortar bombs landed inside the battery and exploded the stored charges, putting the guns out of action.|$|E
5|$|Prince Eugene was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{position}} by 11:00, {{but due to}} the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow. Lord Cutts' column – who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the Nebel – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring {{over the next three}} hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even start. Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, Colonel Cadogan reported that Eugene's Prussian and Danish infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E

The competition was won by British athlete Amy Williams, who set new course records for the track on her first and third runs. Williams, who had never before won a World Cup or World Championship event, became the first British athlete to win a solo Winter Olympic gold medal in 30 years. German sliders Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber won the silver and bronze medals respectively. Williams' teammate Shelley Rudman, who had won the silver medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and Canadian Mellisa Hollingsworth, both of whom had been <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> medal contention, were disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{began the}} season {{coming off the}} bench. On November 24, Alexander had his first double-digit output with 10 points against Rider. In the 2014 Orlando Classic semifinals against Tennessee on November 28, he posted 16 points. Then in the finals against #20 Michigan State on November 30, he contributed 4 blocks. On December 5 during the Big 12/SEC Challenge contest against Florida, Alexander posted a team-high 10 rebounds along with 12 points for his first collegiate double-double. On December 20, Alexander was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the {{starting}} lineup {{for the first time}} against Lafayette, but he was not. However, he started on December 22 against Temple. On January 19 against #19 Oklahoma, Alexander posted 13 points and 13 rebounds. The 13 rebounds in just 23 minutes played marked a career high for Alexander and an individual season high for the Jayhawks. Alexander was named Big 12 newcomer of the week on January 26, 2015. Alexander made his second start of the season on February 10 against Texas Tech, replacing Jamari Traylor in the lineup and posting 10 points, 4 blocks and 5 rebounds. On February 28, Alexander was inactivated due to an undisclosed NCAA investigation as a precautionary measure. He did not play any games after February 23 because of the investigation of his mother's initiation of pre-NBA draft loan processing.|$|E
