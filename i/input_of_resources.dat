30|$|The {{recovery}} {{ability of}} a system is composed of intrinsic recovery ability and artificial recovery ability. Intrinsic recovery ability refers to the {{ability of a}} system to spontaneously absorb external disturbances and return to its normal state. This type of recovery ability can be considered constant. Artificial recovery ability is closely related to the level of emergency management and planning that determines the <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> for emergency response. When an external disturbance is large, artificial recovery ability (<b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> for emergency response) normally will increase until it reaches its limit. In a transport system, when a minor accident happens and forms a queue of delayed vehicles, for example, the queue usually dissipates automatically without any external aid. When the congestion is severe, police will show up to organize the traffic. The worse the congestion becomes, the more external aids (manpower and facilities) the system will receive.|$|E

The number of prevented accidents and the corresponding values of lives and property saved were estimated annually for the same period of eight years. The type <b>of</b> <b>input</b> <b>resource,</b> total number <b>of</b> <b>input</b> <b>resources,</b> total number <b>of</b> prevented accidents by class, the unit cost of each of the accident class, the cost <b>of</b> <b>input</b> <b>resources,</b> quantity <b>of</b> each type <b>of</b> <b>input</b> <b>resources</b> and the targeted period were identified. The study revealed that a total of 156 accidents were prevented in the period of the safety programme which translates to an average of 19. 45 per year. The safety programme also saved lives and property worth N 20. 2 million for the eight year period which is at an average of N 2. 5 million annually.

40|$|While {{a tomato}} crop grows on the {{time-scale}} of weeks, the greenhouse climate changes on a time-scale of minutes. The economic optimal control problem of producing good quality crops against minimum <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> is tackled by a two time-scale decomposition. First, the sub-problem associated to the slow crop evolution is solved off-line, {{leading to a}} seasonal pattern for the co-states {{of the amount of}} assimilates produced by photosynthesis, and the fruit and leaf weights. These co-states can be interpreted as the marginal prices of a unit of assimilate, leaf and fruit. Next, they are used in the goal function of an on-line receding horizon control (RHOC) of the greenhouse climate, thus balancing costs of heating and CO 2 -dosage against predicted benefits from harvesting, while profiting as much as possible from the available solar radiation. Simulations using the time-varying co-states are compared to experimental results obtained with fixed co-states. It appears that the on-line control is sensitive to the time evolution of the co-states, suggesting that it is advantageous to repeat the seasonal optimisation {{from time to time to}} adjust the co-states to the past weather and realised crop state. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the framework, a service center represents an intelligent service broker that offers a self-managed and integrated service to respond to the requests from the workflow adaptively. A workflow engine in this framework coordinates these service agents to implement particular business functions. The structure of the service agent, including its plan model, the relevant reconfiguration method and a service optimization mechanism, were discussed in the paper.
