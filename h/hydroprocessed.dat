Initially, the reactor is loaded with glass pellets and then the rapeseed oil was fed into the reactor.

40|$|Molecular {{management}} targets {{the right}} molecules {{to be at}} the right place, at the right time and at the right price. It consists of molecular characterisation of refining streams, molecular modelling and optimisation of refining processes, as well as overall refinery optimisation integrating material processing system and utility system on the molecular level. The need to increase modelling details to a molecular level is not just a result of political regulations, which force refiners to managing the molecule properly, but also seems to be a very promising to increase the refining margin. In this work, four aspects of molecular management are investigated respectively. Molecular Type Homologous Series (MTHS) matrix framework is enhanced on both representation construction and transformation methodology. To improve the accuracy and adequacy of the representation model, different strategies are formulated separately to consider isomers for light and middle distillates. By introducing statistical distribution, which takes the composition distribution of molecules into account, the transformation approach is revolutionised to increase the usability, and tackle the challenge of possibly achieving significantly different compositions from the same bulk properties by the existing approaches. The methodology is also enhanced by applying extensive bulk properties. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the methodology. Based on the proposed characterisation method, refining processes are modelled on a molecular level, and then process level optimisation is preformed to have an insight view of economic performance. Three different processes, including gasoline blending, catalytic reforming, and diesel hydrotreating, are investigated respectively. Regarding gasoline blending, the property prediction of blending components, and the blending nonlinearity are discussed. To tightly control on the property giveaway, a molecular model of gasoline blending is developed, and then integrated into the recipe optimisation. As for the conversion processes, catalytic reforming and diesel hydrotreating, reactions and reactors are modelled separately, and then followed by the consideration of catalyst deactivation. A homogeneous rigorous molecular model of a semiregenerative catalytic reforming process, considering pressure drop, has been developed. In addition, a multi-period process optimisation model has been formulated. Regarding diesel hydrotreating, a molecular model of reactions with a three-phase trickle-bed reactor has been developed. The concept of reaction family is successfully applied. A structural contribution approach is used to obtain kinetics and adsorption parameters. A series of procedures are developed to solve the complex problem. Thereafter, a process optimisation model has been developed with the consideration of catalyst deactivation, with a new strategy on the division of catalyst life. Finally, a two-level decomposition optimisation method is extended to incorporate molecular modelling into the overall refinery optimisation, and then applied in two aspects. Firstly, with the integration of the process and the site-level models, a better perspective is obtained with regard to a material processing system. By molecular modelling of refining streams and processes, the integrated approach not only controls the molecules in products properly, but also increases the overall performance. In the second application, a framework integrating a hydrogen network with <b>hydroprocesses</b> is developed to target the maximum profit, rather than saving hydrogen. It allocates hydrogen on the hydrogen network level and utilise hydrogen efficiently on the process level by optimising operating conditions. Consequently, the extent of achieving the maximum profit could be fully exploited with optimal hydrogen utilisation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Since {{a perfect}} ‘drop in’ fuel that mimics {{conventional}} aviation kerosene {{without the need}} for blending is unlikely to be developed in the near future, this chapter considers the range of additives available to modify biofuels to meet the rigorous aviation fuel specifications. Approved additives and their mechanism of action are considered here against the short-fall of biofuels. For example, oxygenated fuels contain a higher water content compared to conventional aviation kerosenes; fuel system icing inhibitors, biocides, and corrosion inhibitors could mitigate the detrimental effects created by the presence of water. <b>Hydroprocessed</b> alternative fuels would benefit from antioxidants and lubricity improvers. Potential additives addressing seal swelling capabilities, soot formation, and water content are also explored.

40|$|Cetane {{number is}} the {{accepted}} indicator for quantifying the autoignition characteristics of diesel fuels in compression ignition engines. Diesel fuel specifications typically require a minimum cetane number to achieve satisfactory combustion behaviour in conventional diesel engines. In contrast, a high cetane number fuel {{may not be}} beneficial for implementing high efficiency, clean combustion strategies such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate cetane number effects on HCCI combustion and emissions. The experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder, variable compression ratio, cooperative fuel research engine operated in HCCI combustion mode. The fuels were finely atomized and partially vaporized in the intake manifold. The base fuel was a low cetane refining stream derived from oil sands sources. Three different methods were employed to increase the base fuel cetane number, namely hydroprocessing, cetane improver addition, and blending with a renewable fuel component. Results show that the three methods of cetane number enhancement produce significantly different HCCI combustion behaviour. The <b>hydroprocessed</b> fuels exhibited more stable and complete combustion than the base fuel, which resulted in a wider operating region, reduced carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and lower indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC). The main disadvantages of the <b>hydroprocessed</b> fuels were the higher exhaust gas recirculation rates required to retard the combustion phasing, which limits the maximum indicated mean effective pressure for a given intake pressure, and increased knock intensity due to a faster combustion process. In comparison, the other twomethods of fuel cetane enhancement increased ISFC compared to the base fuel. The addition of nitrate cetane improver resulted in higher NOx emissions, while blending with a renewable fuel component increased hydrocarbon emissions. The experimental data provide evidence that the magnitude and phasing of low temperature heat release, as well as fuel volatility,play important roles in HCCI combustion.

The tests were conducted using a two-stroke, direct injected Detroit 3 - 53 Diesel engine. The cetane number (CN) of the HRD used was 78 while the CN of the F- 76 used was 46. The start of injection (SOI) was measured with a strain gauge mounted on the mechanical fuel injector rocker arm. SOI was found to advance as load increased and retard as speed increased; however, SOI remained constant {{with the use of}} the different fuels HRD or F- 76. Ignition delay (IGD) decreased significantly with HRD which is consistent with the much higher CN. The heat release rate analysis performed determined that the shorter IGD of HRD led to later combustion phasing, increased overall combustion duration and lower maximum rate of pressure rise. The use of HRD also resulted in lower max cylinder pressure. These results suggest that the combustion performance of HRD has no detrimental effects on the Diesel engine tested.

40|$|Alternative fuels for {{aviation}} {{are now a}} reality. These fuels {{not only}} reduce reliance on conventional petroleum-based fuels as the primary propulsion source, but also offer promise for environmental sustainability. While these alternative fuels meet the aviation fuels standards and their overall properties resemble those of the conventional fuel, {{they are expected to}} demonstrate different exhaust emissions characteristics because of the inherent variations in their chemical composition resulting from the variations involved in the processing of these fuels. This paper presents the results of back-to-back comparison of emissions characterization tests that were performed using three alternative aviation fuels in a GE CF- 700 - 2 D- 2 engine core.

However, paraffinic advanced biofuels are a mixture of paraffins naturally found also in petroleum-derived fuels. Thus, the distinction and quantification of such advanced biofuels in mixtures with biodiesel and petroleum diesel in an efficient way is a challenge for the quality control of this type of fuel blend. In this work, we present an innovative analytical method to distinguish and quantify renewable diesel and biodiesel contents in diesel fuel blends with adequate accuracy in a fast, simple and cost-effective manner through the employment of nearinfrared (NIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics. Multivariate calibration models using partial least squares (PLS) or support vector machines (SVM) provided prediction results of HEFA renewable diesel and biodiesel contents with values of root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) up to 0. 5 % (v/ v) and relative error of prediction (REP) up to 2. 7 %, being adequate for real-world applications.

The OTSof an alternative aviation fuel was characterized using PetroOxy test from 120 - 160 °C and JFTOT test at 325 °C. The alternative jet fuel is a Synthetic Paraffinic Keroseneproduced from <b>Hydroprocessed</b> Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK). Results showed a high thermal stability of HEFA-SPK. However, a low oxidation stability was also observed. The oxidation stability of 8 model cyclicmolecules was evaluated. Results allowed to estimate the influence of the molecular structure of cyclic molecules on liquid phase reactivity involving the number and the hydrogenation of the aromatic rings and the number and chain-length of the aromatic alkyl groups. The addition of several alkylbenzenes increased almost linearly the induction period of HEFA-SPK. Tetralin and decalin acted as inhibitors of the radical chain mechanism at low concentration, although having inherently low oxidation stability. Besides offering a better oxidation stability, the addition of specific low fractions of several alkylbenzenes, tetralin and decalin to HEFA-SPK allowed to achieve a good thermal stability as well. These molecules represent good candidates to improve OTS of HEFA-SPK.

40|$|Both Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and <b>Hydroprocessed</b> Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosine (SPK) fuels are {{considered}} as leading alternative replacements for conventional jet fuel. To {{satisfy the requirements}} of Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA), their drop-in incorporations {{have been subjected to}} a rigorous certification process. To reach the ambitious incorporation targets, new routes for biofuels incorporation may need to emerge, involving optimizing the production processes and the blending strategies. This paper focuses on a new strategy for incorporating HEFA, allowing the process yield to be optimised. 				One of the major steps limiting the process yield for HEFA remains the isomerisation that allows production of a biofuel with very good cold flow properties. But this step introduces a substantial decrease of the overall yield (fuel component per kg of starting material) due to the production of light compounds, unsuitable for conventional jet fuel. In this work relaxing the freezing point requirement for the neat HEFA component (by decreasing the severity of the isomerisation step) is proposed in order to minimize the production of less valuable light compounds. This strategy could lead to a significant additional biofuel yield with respect to the oil compared to a process making a better freeze point component. This allows the land surface area necessary for HEFA feedstock cultivation to be reduced for a given amount of bio-jet fuel produced...|$|E

The higher heating value of the bio-crude was approximately 35 MJ/kg, however the nitrogen content of 6 % and oxygen content of 11 % render it unsuitable for direct combustion.

We examine the cost to US airlines of meeting this goal using renewable fuel produced from a <b>Hydroprocessed</b> Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process from renewable oils. Our approach employs an economy-wide model of economic activity and energy systems and a detailed partial equilibrium model of the aviation industry. If soybean oil {{is used as a}} feedstock, we find that meeting the aviation biofuel goal in 2020 will require an implicit subsidy to biofuel producers of $ 2. 69 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. If the aviation goal can be met by fuel from oilseed rotation crops grown on otherwise fallow land, the implicit subsidy is $ 0. 35 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. As commercial aviation biofuel consumption represents less than two per cent of total fuel used by this industry, the goal has a small impact on the average price of jet fuel and carbon dioxide emissions.

Unfortunately, it is predicted that the fossils fuels which have heretofore been the main source of energy will be practically depleted in 50 years. It is also now abundantly clear that the use of the fossil fuels involves environmentally damaging emissions such as CO, SOand a variety of Nitrogen Oxides. The lifting of {{hundreds of millions of people}} in the developing world from poverty into the middle class has greatly increased the demand for energy, which is currently derived mainly from fossil fuels and thus dramatically exacerbating the pollution trends. Due to the limiting nature of the fossil fuels and their undesirable pollution effects, there is a concerted effort to find alternative and less polluting energy sources. Since the aviation industry is on the cusp of unprecedented expansion to accommodate the travelling needs of the rapidly increasing middle class of the emerging economies, the quest for alternative fuels, such as biofuels, for aviation has assumed a form of urgency.

A test with a T 56 turboprop engine was performed to demonstrate that a CHEFA/JP 8 (Camelina <b>Hydroprocessed</b> Ester and Fatty Acids and standard JP 8) fuel blend would meet operational requirements. The primary test objective was to assess whether a fuel change had an immediate impact on the engine condition, performance, emissions or vibration characteristics. This paper presents test results comparing engine performance with JP 8 and a 50 / 50 blend of JP 8 and CHEFA. Comparison runs were conducted before and after a 20 hour ground durability test with the CHEFA fuel blend. A nearly time-expired, nacelle-dressed T 56 on an outdoor test stand was tested. The engine was equipped with minimallyintrusive non-standard pressure, temperature and emissions monitoring equipment, and a field vibration assessment suite in addition to the standard flight instrumentation. This paper discusses the test plan, data acquisition methods, results and data repeatability. The performance and emissions results are compared to the changes predicted theoretically from the fuel properties. Observations from the borescope inspections before, during and after the 20 hour durability test are also presented. The lessons learned in this test could be applied to future fuel or process-change tests, and the results provide a performance baseline for engine health assessment.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{has always}} been instrumental in raising the living standards {{of the people of}} this planet. Unfortunately, it is predicted that the fossils fuels which have heretofore been the main source of energy will be practically depleted in 50 years. It is also now abundantly clear that the use of the fossil fuels involves environmentally damaging emissions such as CO 2, SO 2 and a variety of Nitrogen Oxides. The lifting of {{hundreds of millions of people}} in the developing world from poverty into the middle class has greatly increased the demand for energy, which is currently derived mainly from fossil fuels and thus dramatically exacerbating the pollution trends. Due to the limiting nature of the fossil fuels and their undesirable pollution effects, there is a concerted effort to find alternative and less polluting energy sources. Since the aviation industry is on the cusp of unprecedented expansion to accommodate the travelling needs of the rapidly increasing middle class of the emerging economies, the quest for alternative fuels, such as biofuels, for aviation has assumed a form of urgency. Since the approval of the use of Fischer Tropsch <b>Hydroprocessed</b> Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosenes (SPK) produced by Sasol as a blending stock in DEFSTAN 91 - 91 research has been ongoing to introduce feedstock from alternative feedstock using different methods. However, the use of biofuels in aviation presents greater restrictions for any candidate fuel and may require extensive changes to engines. The aim of this paper is to review and provide a guideline in the production and certification of aviation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{short-term}} economic feasibility of six conversion pathways for renewable jet fuel (RJF) production. The assessment combines (i) a harmonized techno-economic analysis of conversion pathways {{expected to be}} certified for use in commercial aviation by 2020, (ii) a pioneer plant analysis taking into account technological immaturity, and (iii) a quantified assessment of the merits of co-producing RJF alongside existing European supply chains in the pulp, wheat ethanol, and beet sugar industries. None of the pathways assessed are able to reach price parity with petroleum-derived jet fuel in the short term. The pioneer plant analysis suggests that the <b>hydroprocessed</b> esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway is currently the best option; the technology achieves the lowest minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of 29. 3 € GJ– 1 (1289 € t– 1) and the technology is deployed on commercial scale already. In the short term, nth plant analysis shows hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis emerging as promising alternatives, yielding MFSPs of 21. 4 € GJ– 1 (939 € t– 1) and 30. 2 € GJ– 1 (1326 € t– 1), respectively. The pioneer plant analysis shows considerable MFSP increases for producing drop-in fuels using HTL and pyrolysis as both technologies are relatively immature. Hence, further RD&D efforts into these pathways are recommended. Co-production strategies decrease the MFSP by 4 – 8 % compared to greenfield production. Integration of process units and material and energy flows is expected to lead to further cost reductions. As such, co-production can be a particularly useful strategy to progress emerging technologies to commercial scale...|$|E
40|$|The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a {{goal that}} one billion gallons of {{renewable}} jet fuel is consumed by the US aviation industry each year from 2018. We examine the economic and emissions impacts of this goal using renewable fuel produced from a <b>Hydroprocessed</b> Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process from renewable oils. Our approach employs an economy-wide model of economic activity and energy systems and a detailed partial equilibrium model of the aviation industry. If soybean oil {{is used as a}} feedstock, we find that meeting the aviation biofuel goal in 2020 will require an implicit subsidy from airlines to biofuel producers of $ 2. 69 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. If the aviation goal can be met by fuel from oilseed rotation crops grown on otherwise fallow land, the implicit subsidy is $ 0. 35 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. As commercial aviation biofuel consumption represents less than 2 % of total fuel used by this industry, the goal has a small impact on the average price of jet fuel and carbon dioxide emissions. We also find that, under the pathways we examine, the cost per tonne of CO[subscript 2] abated due to aviation biofuels is between $ 50 and $ 400. United States. Federal Aviation Administration.

40|$|The use of {{biofuels}} in {{the aviation}} sector has {{economic and environmental}} benefits. Among the options {{for the production of}} renewable jet fuels, <b>hydroprocessed</b> esters and fatty acids (HEFA) have received predominant attention in comparison with fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), which are not approved as additives for jet fuels. However, the presence of oxygen in methyl esters tends to reduce soot emissions and therefore particulate matter emissions. This sooting tendency is quantified in this work with an oxygen-extended sooting index, based on smoke point measurements. Results have shown considerable reduction in the sooting tendency for all biokerosenes (produced by transesterification and eventually distillation) with respect to fossil kerosenes. Among the tested biokerosenes, that made from palm kernel oil was the most effective one, and nondistilled methyl esters (from camelina and linseed oils) showed lower effectiveness than distilled biokerosenes to reduce the sooting tendency. These results may constitute an additional argument for the use of FAME’s as blend components of jet fuels. Other arguments were pointed out in previous publications, but some controversy has aroused over the use of these components. Some of the criticism was {{based on the fact that}} the methods used in our previous work are not approved for jet fuels in the standard methods and concluded that the use of FAME in any amount is, thus, inappropriate. However, some of the standard methods are not updated for considering oxygenated components (like the method for obtaining the lower heating value), and others are not precise enough (like the methods for measuring the freezing point), whereas some alternative methods may provide better reproducibility for oxygenated fuels...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a model to}} quantify the economic costs and environmental impacts of producing fuels from <b>hydroprocessed</b> renewable oils (HRO) process. Aspen Plus was used to model bio-refinery operations and supporting utilities. Material and energy balances for electricity, carbon dioxide, and water requirements {{as well as economic}} costs were obtained from these models. A discounted-cash-flow-rate-of-return (DCFROR) economic model was used to evaluate minimum product values for diesel and jet fuels under various economic conditions. The baseline gate cost for distillate fuel production were found to range between $ 3. 80 and $ 4. 38 per gallon {{depending on the size of}} the facility. The additional cost for maximizing jet fuel production ranged between $ 0. 25 and $ 0. 30 per gallon. While the cost of feedstock is the most significant portion of fuel cost, facility size, financing, and capacity utilization were found to be sensitive parameters of the gate cost. The total water use of the system was found to be 0. 9 pounds of water per pound of vegetable oil processed. Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) for the processing step were found to range between 10. 1 and 13. 0 gCO 2 e per MJ of distillate fuel using an energy allocation method consistent with methods in the literature. Finally, the policy landscape for producing jet and diesel fuels from renewable oils was reviewed from the perspective of a fuel producer. It was found that the potential of HRO fuels penetrating the market is dependent on the availability of feedstocks and access to capital. by Matthew Noah Pearlson. Thesis (S.
