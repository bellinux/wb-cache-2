The feasibility of a combined process of zeolite ion exchange and <b>electron</b> beam <b>irradiation</b> of livestock wastewater was also investigated. The removal efficiencies of NH 4 +-N, T-N and T-P were significantly enhanced by <b>electron</b> beam <b>irradiation</b> after zeolite ion exchange as a pre-treatment. The presence of silica zeolite accelerated the decomposition rate of livestock wastewater in the <b>electron</b> beam <b>irradiation</b> process.

However, it was demonstrated by Baliga and also by A. M.
