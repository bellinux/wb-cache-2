40|$|Soil carbon (C) pools are {{not only}} {{important}} to governing soil properties and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems, but also {{play a critical role}} in global C cycling. Mulch and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> may alter soil C pools by changing organic matter inputs to the forest ecosystem. We studied the 12 -month mulch and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> responses on the chemical composition of soil organic C and the seasonal dynamics of water extractable organic C (WEOC), hot water extractable organic C (HWEOC), chloroform-released organic C (CHCl 3 -released C), and acid hydrolysed organic C (acid hydrolysable C) in a hardwood plantation of subtropical Australia. The results showed that compared with the non-mulch treatment, the mulch treatment significantly increased soil WEOC, HWEOC, and CHCl 3 -released C over the four sampling months. The <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatment</b> significantly reduced the amount of HWEOC and CHCl 3 -released C compared with the no <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatment.</b> Neither the mulch nor <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatment</b> significantly affected soil acid hydrolysed organic C. There were no significant seasonal variations in soil WEOC, HWEOC, CHCl 3 -released C, and acid hydrolysed organic C in the hardwood plantation. Solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to study the structural chemistry of soil C pools in hydrofluoric acid (HF) treated soils collected 12 months after the mulch and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> were applied. Overall, O-alkyl C was the dominant C fraction, accounting for 33 - 43 % of the total NMR signal intensity. The mulch treatment led to higher signal intensity in the alkyl C spectral region and A/O-A ratio (the ratio of alkyl C region intensity to O-alkyl C region intensity), but lower signal intensity in the aryl C and aromaticity. Compared with the no <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatment,</b> the <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatment</b> reduced signal intensity in the aryl C and aromaticity. Together, shifts in the amount and nature of soil C following the mulch and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> may be due to the changes in organic matter input and soil physical environment.

Findings from this research were compared with previous research carried out when the trees were ages eight and eleven. Assuming a green density of 1, 000 kg/m 3, Young’s Modulus equation was used to convert acoustic velocity to wood stiffness, or, Modulus of Elasticity (MOE). The effect of wind direction upon mean wood stiffness was not significant (α = 0. 05). Consequently, one measure of wood stiffness was calculated per tree. Mean stem slenderness and mean wood stiffness values were calculated by block, <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatment,</b> and clone. <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> had a significant impact upon mean wood stiffness in comparison to the <b>control</b> <b>treatment</b> (0. 03 m 2 area of <b>weed</b> <b>control).</b> Significant differences did not exist between different levels of <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> ie., 0. 75 m 2, 3. 14 m 2 and 9 m 2 chemical spot spray area.

The {{aim of this}} research was to identify how <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and fertilization <b>treatments</b> affect nitrogen nutrition and water use in F 1 hybrid pine plantations, together with tree growth. The results have indicated that a lack of weed competition has shown greater potential for height and diameter at breast height (Dbh) increment and d 15 N in the foliage. A strong correlation between growth and d 15 N existed for all canopy positions, demonstrating that foliar d 15 N may prove to be a better indicator of growth indices in the canopy than total foliar N concentrations alone. These differences could be in part due to discrimination against 15 N by soil micro-fauna, during the processes of decomposition and mineralization {{and as a result of}} leaching of lighter 14 N, where no weed cover exists.

Beauv., Tridax procunbens L. and Vernonia galamensis (Cass.) Less. The remaining weed species had rare abundance. The relative frequency of the weed species was generally reduced under all the <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> except Paspalum obiculare whose relative frequency was consistently high in all the assessment periods under all the <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Companion plant {{intercropping}} involves {{growing a}} cash crop with another plant {{that is not}} harvested, to confer a set of benefits on the crop and the environment. <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> and herbicide use reduction {{are one of the}} principal reasons for adopting this approach. Companion plants should compete with weeds for light, nutrients and water, but they may also compete with the crop. The species grown must therefore be carefully chosen and managed so as to outcompete weeds but limit competition with the crop and yield loss. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the effects of companion plants on weed regulation and cash crop yields, and to analyze their sources of variability. We reviewed different intercropping systems involving an annual cash crop and a legume companion plant from around the world. We report data from 34 scientific articles, corresponding to 476 experimental units (i. e. combinations of site × year × cash crop × legume companion plant species × agricultural practices), and we explore whether intercropping with legume companion plants can <b>control</b> <b>weeds</b> while maintaining crop yield. Yield and weed biomass ratios were analyzed as response variables. We used the type of cash crop (straw cereals, maize or other crops), the methods used to establish the companion plants (living mulch, synchronized sowing or relay intercropping) and the overlap between the growth periods of the companion plants and the cash crop as explanatory variables. Intercropping with a companion plant resulted in a lower weed biomass and a higher yield (win-win situation) than non-weeded or <b>weeded</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments,</b> in 52 % and 36 %, respectively, of the experimental units considered. A higher weed biomass associated with a lower yield (lose-lose) was observed in only 13 % and 26 % of the experimental units, in comparisons with non-weeded and <b>weeded</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments,</b> respectively. Considering all the experimental units together, the companion plants had no significant effect on cash crop yield, but significantly decreased weed biomass, by 56 % relatively to a non-weeded <b>control</b> <b>treatment,</b> and 42 % relative to a <b>weeded</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatment.</b> The greatest benefits from companion plant intercropping were reported for maize, with yields 37 % higher than those for non-weeded <b>control</b> <b>treatments.</b> The other explanatory variables tested had no significant effect on yield or <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Thus, the use of legume companion plants generally seems to enhance <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> without reducing crop yield, but the conditions giving rise to win-win situations should be explored further, to encourage the spread of this technique among farmers...|$|R

Studies {{were conducted in}} 2011 and 2012 at two sites at the Southern Research and Outreach Center in Waseca, MN to evaluate different combinations of row spacing, soybean varieties, and early season <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> on giant ragweed, common lambsquarters, and tall waterhemp density, biomass, and seed production. The early season <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> consisted of a pre-emergence herbicide, winter rye cover, and radish/pennycress cover mixture. Overall, a flumioxazin, acetochlor, or winter rye treatment were the most effective in reducing weed density, biomass, and seed production. These two treatments generally resulted {{in at least a}} 50 % reduction in total weed density compared to the control. A flumioxazin or winter rye treatment resulted in no weed seed production of common lambsquarters at Site 1 in 2011, compared to 2018 seeds m- 2 in the control. Results demonstrate the importance of early season <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> as part of a comprehensive weed management plan. Soybean row spacing and variety were not as effective in reducing weed density, biomass, and seed production. However, they were important as part of an integrated weed management strategy when used in combination with the winter rye cover crop and flumioxazin or acetochlor in <b>controlling</b> <b>weeds</b> in soybeans.

40|$|The {{potential}} effect of two sowing dates of ryegrass, Lolium perenne L. var. Elka as an interplant in winter leek, Allium porrum L., on <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> soil nitrogen allocation and crop yield was studied at two sites in Switzerland. In {{order to reduce}} potential competition with the ryegrass, row application of the herbicide methazol (as additional treatment) and increased fertiliser doses in spring (as split-plot treatment) were used, and compared with a weed-free control. Ryegrass was sown 4 weeks (early) and 6 weeks (late) after planting of the leek, allowing for one and two mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments,</b> respectively, prior to sowing. Under the experimental conditions, intersowing ryegrass 6 weeks after planting resulted in crop yield {{similar to that in}} the control plots. Crop quality variates were increased and the overall production system was environmentally more advantageous. The combination of two mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> followed by ryegrass intersowing suppressed weeds sufficiently without herbicide applications. Approximately 20 kg N/ha could be retained from being washed out over the winter, and c. 50 kg N/ha was stored in the interplants up to harvest. The interplants were incorporated into the soil after the harvest to serve as N-source for the subsequent crop. Surplus fertiliser doses in spring increased N-allocation to leek in the control plots. However, when ryegrass was present, it mainly derived a benefit, resulting in only slightly increased N-allocation to leek, or even reduce...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: The aim of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and {{fertilization}} {{in forest}} plantations was to increase tree growth by reducing competition for available nutrients and water. However, treatments that influence weed biomass {{can also have}} significant impacts on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling which can in turn lead {{to changes in the}} dynamics of stable C (δ 13 C) and N (δ 15 N) isotope compositions in soils and tree foliage. Methods: We examined the key C and N cycling processes influenced by routine and luxury <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and fertilization <b>treatments</b> as reflected by soil and foliar δ 13 C and δ 15 N and long-term tree growth in an 8 -year old F 1 hybrid pine (Pinus elliottii x P. caribaea) plantation in southeast Queensland, Australia. <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> varied by treatment frequency and intensity while fertilization treatments varied by the application of N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and micronutrients. Different soil and canopy sampling positions were assessed to determine if sampling position enhanced the relationships among soil N transformations and tree N use, water use efficiency and carbon gain under the early establishment silviculture. Results: Routine <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> was associated with increased weed biomass returned to the soil, compared with luxury <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Soil δ 13 C increased at the 0 – 5 cm soil sampling depth in both the inter-planting (IPR) and planting row (PR) {{as a result of the}} routine <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments.</b> In addition, soil δ 13 C was significantly higher as a result of fertilisation treatment in the 0 – 5 cm soil sampling depth in the PR. Soil δ 13 C was negatively correlated to soil δ 15 N at the 0 – 5 cm soil sampling depth in the IPR. Soil δ 15 N increased in the 0 – 5 and 5 – 10 cm soil sampling depths in the IPR, as a result of more frequent (luxury) <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Foliar δ 15 N and tree water use efficiency (WUE) (as indicated by foliar δ 13 C) were positively correlated with tree growth at age 8 years. While relationships between δ 13 C and δ 15 N in the soil and foliage varied depending on soil sampling depth and position, and with canopy sampling position where there were consistent relationships between soil δ 13 C (or δ 15 N) and foliar δ 15 N. Conclusions: This study demonstrates how early establishment silviculture has important implications for soil C and N cycling and how soil δ 13 C and δ 15 N were consistent with changes in soil C cycling and N transformations as a result of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments,</b> while foliar δ 15 N was linked to more rapid N cycling as reflected in the soil δ 15 N, which increased tree growth and tree WUE (as reflected by foliar δ 13 C).

Results revealed that crop sequence decreased significantly numbers (m 2) and dry weight of grassy, broad-leaved and total weeds (g/m 2) in both seasons. Sowing pea after clover/sorghum and clover/peanut decreased the numbers (m 2) and dry weight of weeds (g/m 2) and increased significant plant height, number of branches/plant, pod length, pod width, number of ovules/pod, shell-out %, 100 -green seed weight, green pod yield (ton/fed) and dry seeds yield (kg/fed) as compared with sowing of pea after wheat/sorghum or wheat/peanut in both seasons. Crop sequences significantly affected each of vegetative growth, yield and its components in both seasons. <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> decreased significantly the numbers and dry weight of grassy, broad-leaved and total weeds (g/m 2) in both seasons. Application of hand hoeing at 20, 45 DAS, Gesagard at 1. 0 L/fed+Select super and Basagran at 500 cm 3 /fed+Select super at 500 cm 3 /fed gave the highest reduction of the dry weight of grassy, board-leaved and total weeds (g/m 2) in both seasons. Hand hoeing at 20, 45 DAS, Gesagard+Select super and Basagran+Select super increased significantly the plant height, number of branches/plant, pod length, pod width, number of ovules/pod, shell-out %, 100 -green seed weight (g), green pod yield (ton/fed) and dry seed yield (kg/fed). The effect of interactions between crop sequence and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> was statistically significant where decreased significantly the numbers (m 2) and dry weight of grassy, broad-leaved and total weeds (g/m 2) using of sowing of pea after clover/sorghum and clover/peanut under hand hoeing twice and Gesagard+Select super per in ceased than other treatments.

In the herbicide experiments two treatments were applied by PRE emergence herbicides (metribuzin, clomazone, dimethenamid and metribuzin, flufenacet, clomazone) and another two treatments were sprayed {{with a combination of}} PRE + POST emergence herbicides (metribuzin, flufenacet, thifensulfuron and pendimethalin, thifensulfuron, bentazone, cycloxydim). Furthermore, a POST herbicide treatment was implemented (thifensulfuron, bentazone, thifensulfuron and fluazifop-P-butyl). In the mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> experiments, <b>treatments</b> were: three times hoeing, PRE emergence harrowing plus three times hoeing, hoeing and harrowing in rotation or three times harrowing.
