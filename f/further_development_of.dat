5|$|In {{the middle}} of August 2015, a strong {{westerly}} wind surge along the equator produced two areas of convection, or thunderstorm activity, near the Marshall Islands in the western Pacific Ocean.

The westernmost system developed a banding pattern by August13, indicative of increased organization. At 18:00UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression, centered about 700km (435mi) east-southeast of Guam.
