"Not at all dangerous,--at {{least not}} worth {{speaking}} of," [...] replied the manager; [...] "nitro-glycerine {{by itself is}} indeed very dangerous, being easily exploded by concussion or mere vibration; but when mixed with <b>infusorial</b> <b>earth</b> and thus converted into dynamite, {{it is one of}} the safest explosives in existence--not quite so safe, indeed, as gun-cotton, but much more so than gunpowder. Any sort of fire will explode gunpowder, but any sort of fire will not explode dynamite; it will only cause it to burn. It requires a detonator to explode it with violence. Without its detonator, dynamite is a sleeping giant." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{surface is}} then {{coated with a}} mixture of quartz sand, <b>infusorial</b> <b>earth</b> (calcined fossil meal), and {{powdered}} marble, mixed four parts to one with quicklime slaked with distilled water. The purpose of this layer is to ensure adhesion of the subsequent layers to the surface. Next, a layer of lime-sand mortar is applied to even the surface, with care taken to avoid cracking. This layer is allowed to dry for up to a year.|$|E
50|$|Once dry, a {{painting}} ground composed of white quartz sand, marble sand, marble meal, and <b>infusorial</b> <b>earth</b> is combined eight parts to one with slaked lime, {{and applied to}} the surface at a thickness of one eighth to one quarter inch. This layer dries for several days, at which point a crust of carbonate has formed on the surface. This crust is removed {{with a mixture of}} one part hydrofluosilicic acid to three parts distilled water, which is brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, after which the surface is rinsed with distilled water.|$|E
50|$|These {{researches}} had {{an important}} bearing {{on some of the}} <b>infusorial</b> <b>earths</b> used for polishing and other economic purposes; they added, moreover, largely to our knowledge of the microorganisms of certain geological formations, especially of the chalk, and of the marine and freshwater accumulations. Until Ehrenberg took up the study it was not known that considerable masses of rock were composed of minute forms of animals or plants. He also demonstrated that the phosphorescence of the sea was due to organisms.|$|R
40|$|During the {{procedure}} of transferring waste containers with radioactive powders within a temporary depot {{the downfall of}} the container may induce its decomposition and the release of the powdery inventory. To derive the release rates dependent on mass of inventory, height of fall, ventilation near the floor and powder materials like <b>infusorial</b> <b>earth</b> (filter remedies) and house ash (incineration of combustible wastes) small scale simulation experiments were performed with a wooden box of 8 l volume with unfolded side walls. The most important parameters influencing the release rates were the mass of the powdery inventory, the height of fall and the powder material. (IUCT...|$|E
40|$|The {{monthly meeting}} of the Royal Society of Tasmania {{was held at the}} Museum on Tuesday, May 11. His Excellency the Governor Sir R. G. C. Hamilton, K. C. B., LL. D., presided. There was a good {{attendance}} of Fellows. His Excellency expressed his regret at being absent from the last meeting. This {{was the first time he}} had been with them since the late Science Congress had met, and he congratulated them upon the success which had attended their labours in this respect. This was, he was sure, largely due to the exertions of Mr. A. Morton, the General Secretary, who had been indefatigable in his efforts to make the affair a success. Includes, Science Congress Ardea pacifica, Herodias alba, Erismatura australis (first time recorded in Tasmania), Australian Coot, Discussion on Export of Apples, - Mr. C. H. Grant, with reference to Mr. Shoobridge's paper upon the export of apples to Europe, said that the author of the paper had dealt with the question in a very able manner, although it was rather deficient in the details relating to the cultivation of fruit, which, however, might possibly relate more to the gardening industry than to the Royal Society.

40|$|Batch {{hydrolysis}} {{of olive}} oil was performed by Candida rugosa lipase immobilized on Amberlite IRC- 50 and Al 2 O 3. These two supports were selected out of 16 carriers: inorganic materials (sand, silica gel, <b>infusorial</b> <b>earth,</b> Al 2 O 3), inorganic salts (CaCO 3, CaSO 4), ion-exchange resins (Amberlite IRC- 50 and IR- 4 B, Dowex 2 X 8), a natural resin (colophony), a natural biopolymer (sodium alginate), synthetic polymers (polypropylene, polyethylene) and zeolites. Lipase immobilization {{was carried out by}} simple adsorption, adsorption followed by cross-linking, adsorption on ion-exchange resins, combined adsorption and precipitation, pure precipitation and gel entrapment. The suitability of the supports and techniques for the immobilization of lipase was evaluated by estimating the enzyme activity, protein loading, immobilization efficiency and reusability of the immobilizates. Most of the immobilizates exhibited either a low enzyme activity or difficulties during the hydrolytic reaction. Only those prepared by ionic adsorption on Amberlite IRC- 50 and by combined adsorption and precipitation on Al 2 O 3 showed better activity, 2000 and 430 U/g support, respectively, and demonstrated satisfactory behavior when used repeatedly. The hydrolysis was studied as a function of several parameters: surfactant concentration, enzyme concentration, pH and temperature. The immobilized preparation with Amberlite IRC- 50 was stable and active in the whole range of pH (4 to 9) and temperature (20 to 50 Â°C), demonstrating a 99 % degree of hydrolysis. In repeated usage, it was stable and active having a half-life of 16 batches, which corresponds to an operation time of 384 h. Its storage stability was remarkable too, since after 9 months it had lost only 25 % of the initial activity. The immobilizate with Al 22 O 3 was less stable and less active. At optimal environmental conditions, the degree of hydrolysis did not exceed 79 %. In repeated usage, after the fourth batch, the degree of hydrolysis was reduced to 53. 5 %...|$|E
