50|$|In {{traditional}} geometry, affine geometry {{is considered}} to be a study between Euclidean geometry and projective geometry. On the one <b>hand,</b> affine <b>geometry</b> is Euclidean geometry with congruence left out; on the other <b>hand,</b> affine <b>geometry</b> may be obtained from projective geometry by the designation of a particular line or plane to represent the points at infinity. In affine geometry, there is no metric structure but the parallel postulate does hold. Affine geometry provides the basis for Euclidean structure when perpendicular lines are defined, or the basis for Minkowski geometry through the notion of hyperbolic orthogonality. In this viewpoint, an affine transformation geometry is a group of projective transformations that do not permute finite points with points at infinity.|$|R

Popu-lation Balance Equations (PBEs) are coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate turbulent dispersed flows.

On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>geometries</b> in the industrial problems can be very complex such that pre-processing steps require great effort and time, especially for pure hexahedral meshes. Nevertheless, instead of conventional meshing tools, a different approach based on the con-cept of “fictitious domains”, Fictitious Boundary Method (FBM), can be employed to mesh complex, moving and/or deforming geometries. In this study, we present efficient implemen-tation strategies and numerical methods to couple PBEs to CFD and numerical simulation techniques using a finite element approach in combination with FBM.

50|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>Geometry</b> Authentication - <b>Hand</b> <b>geometry</b> {{techniques}} exploit {{hand shape}} characteristics, such as finger length and width. This leads to quite {{a small amount}} of data (about 9 bytes), thus restricting their application to simple authentication purposes only. Also, their behaviour related to the fulfilment of the above properties is moderate. The iris, the circular coloured membrane surrounding the pupil of the eye, is a unique structure consisting of specific characteristics such as striations, furrows, rings, crypts, filaments, and corona. Iris patterns are characterised by very high distinctiveness, even twins have different ones. The probability that two individuals have the same iris pattern is about 10^sup -52^. The probability that two distinct iris patterns result to the same iris-code used (about 256 bytes) by a biometric system is negligible (about 10^sup -78^), thus allowing almost perfect matching accuracy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{feasibility}} of leveraging the sensors embedded on mo-bile devices to enable a user authentication mechanism that is easy for users to perform, but hard for attackers to bypass. The proposed approach lies {{on the fact that}} users perform gestures in a unique way that depends on how they hold the phone, and on their <b>hand’s</b> <b>geometry,</b> size, and flexibility. Based on this obser-vation, we introduce two new unlock gestures that have been designed to enable the phone’s embedded sensors to properly capture the geometry and biokinetics of the user’s hand during the gesture. The touch sensor extracts the geometry and timing of the user hand, while the accelerometer and gyro sensors record the dis-placement and rotation of the mobile device during the gesture. When combined, a sensor fingerprint for the user is generated. In this approach, potential attackers need to simultaneously reproduce the touch, accelerometer, and gyro sensor sig-natures to falsely authenticate. Using 5000 gestures recorded over two user stud-ies involving a total of 70 subjects, our results indicate that sensor fingerprints can accurately differentiate users while achieving less than 2. 5 % false accept and false reject rates. Attackers that directly observe the true user authenticating on a device, can successfully bypass authentication only 3 % of the time. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{the day to}} day {{security}} {{is a major concern}} the authentication problem is very crucial. The hand recognition system provides efficient way to produce the authentication using image processing. <b>Hand</b> recognition <b>geometry</b> as the name suggest uses the shape of the hand to identify the person. Unlike iris, face or fingerprints, the human hand is not unique. The existing systems use finger length, thickness and curvature for the purpose of verification but not for identification. <b>Hand</b> recognition <b>geometry</b> data is relatively easier to collect to other technologies e. g. for fingerprint collection good frictional skin is required by image systems. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop a system which can increase the accuracy of the hand recognition using soft computing, the system should be capable to self-learn, about the correct and incorrect palm prints and add them to its database. A robust palm print recognition approach using neural network is proposed in this study. Neural networks offer a number of advantages, including requiring less formal statistical training, ability to implicitly detect complex nonlinear relationships between dependent and independent variables, ability to detect all possible interactions between predictor variables, and the availability of multiple training algorithms. Palm print recognition, Preprocessing, Feature extraction, Matching and Results and Feedback to the database are the six steps that are followed in the proposed approach.
