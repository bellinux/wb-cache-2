In order to reduce squeal noise, four constrained layer damping (CLD) models have been proposed and assessed, The complex eigenvalue results show that the CLD 2 and CLD 4 models can fully eliminate unstable mode at a frequency of 6120 Hz, while in frequency of 2051 Hz the positive real part has been reduced from + 222 to + 199 for CLD 2 and + 182 for CLD 4, The CEA results indicate that proper CLD designs can be used to reduce drum brake squeal noise in the motorcycles...|$|R

In the numerical model, the columns were represented as an assemblage of distinct blocks connected together by zero-thickness interfaces, which can open and/or close depending on the magnitude {{and direction of the}} stresses applied to them. Through non-linear static analysis, capacity curves and corresponding failure mechanisms of each of the studied models were obtained. The influence of different parameters (the number of drums, geometrical properties and imperfections at columns) was also assessed to observe their influence on the response of <b>drum</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The results of analyses revealed that rigid overturning is the main collapse mechanisms under uniform horizontal forces. A combination of rigid and shear failure mechanisms might also occur, depending on geometric characteristics and the choice of joint material properties. A higher displacement capacity was observed for columns constructed with a larger number of drums. It was also found that imperfections in the ancient free-standing columns have a significant influence on the lateral load resisting capacity. Therefore, structural analysis of undamaged columns may not represent the actual capacity of the columns due to their very sensitive and highly non-linear characteristics...|$|R

40|$|A new {{radioactive}} shipping packaging for transporting bulk {{quantities of}} tritium, the Bulk Tritium Shipping Package (BTSP), {{has been designed}} for the Department of Energy (DOE) {{as a replacement for}} a package designed in the early 1970 s. This paper summarizes significant design features and describes how the design satisfies the regulatory safety requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The BTSP design incorporates many improvements over its predecessor by implementing improved testing, handling, and maintenance capabilities, while improving manufacturability and incorporating new engineered materials. This paper also discusses the results from testing of the BTSP to 10 CFR 71 Normal Conditions of Transport and Hypothetical Accident Condition events. The programmatic need of the Department of Energy (DOE) to ship bulk quantities of tritium has been satisfied since the late 1970 s by the UC- 609 shipping package. The current Certificate of Conformance for the UC- 609, USA/ 9932 /B(U) (DOE), will expire in late 2011. Since the UC- 609 was not designed to meet current regulatory requirements, it will not be recertified and thereby necessitates a replacement Type B shipping package for continued DOE tritium shipments in the future. A replacement tritium packaging called the Bulk Tritium Shipping Package (BTSP) is currently being designed and tested by Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). The BTSP consists of two primary assemblies, an outer <b>Drum</b> <b>Assembly</b> and an inner Containment Vessel Assembly (CV), both designed to mitigate damage and to protect the tritium contents from leaking during the regulatory Hypothetical Accident Condition (HAC) events and during Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT). During transport, the CV rests on a silicone pad within the Drum Liner and is covered with a thermal insulating disk within the insulated <b>Drum</b> <b>Assembly.</b> The BTSP packaging weighs approximately 500 lbs without contents and is 50 - 1 / 2 inches high by 24 - 1 / 2 inches in outside diameter. With contents the gross weight of the BTSP is 650 lbs. The BTSP is designed for the safe shipment of 150 grams of tritium in a solid or gaseous state. To comply with the federal regulations that govern Type B shipping packages, the BTSP is designed so that it will not lose tritium at a rate greater than the limits stated in 10 CFR 71. 51 of 10 {sup - 6 } A 2 per hour for the 'Normal Conditions of Transport' (NCT) and an A 2 in 1 week under 'Hypothetical Accident Conditions' (HAC). Additionally, since the BTSP design incorporates a valve as part of the tritium containment boundary, secondary containment features are incorporated in the CV Lid to protect against gas leakage past the valve as required by 10 CFR 71. 43 (e). This secondary containment boundary is designed to provide the same level of containment as the primary containment boundary when subjected to the HAC and NCT criteria...|$|E

40|$|Development of the gamma-ray spectrometric {{technique}} termed GSAK (Gamma-Ray Spectrometry with Acceptable Knowledge) for {{the characterization}} of CC 104 / 107 remote-handled transuranic (RH-TRU) wastes continued this year. Proof-of-principle measurements have been completed on the surrogate RH-TRU waste drums configured earlier this year. The GSAK technique uses conventional gamma-ray spectrometry to quantify the detectable fission product content of overpacked RH-TRU drums. These results are then coupled with the inventory report to characterize the waste drum content. The inventory report is based on process knowledge of the waste drum loading and calculations of the isotopic distribution in the spent fuel examined to generate the drummed wastes. Three RH-TRU surrogate drums were configured with encapsulated EBR-II driver fuel rod segments arranged in the surrogate <b>drum</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Segment-specific inventory calculations initially specified the radionuclide content of the fuel segments and thus the surrogate drums. Radiochemical assays performed on representative fuel element segments identified {{a problem in the}} accuracy of some of the fission and activation product inventory values and provided a basis for adjustment of the specified surrogate drum inventories.

Thus this paper attempts to prevent drum brake squeal by means of lining modifications.

Two different types of external particles, namely road grit and silica sand with a size between 100 to 200 μm will be used and fed into the disc brake end corner. Brake squeal occurrences will be captured using accelerometers and a microphone. Those results will then be compared with the test results without external particles.

Equipment was designed to measure drawing force, drawing torque, amplitude of die and drum oscillation, and drawing speed. Frequencies of die oscillation in the range 0 - 125 Hz were studied with amplitudes up to 0. 070 in peak to peak.

The selected technology must provide micro-gravity gasfliquid separation and pump the liquid from 10 psia at the gasfliquid interface to 18 psia at the wastewater bus storage tank. The rotary disk concept, which has pedigree in other systems currently being built for installation on the ISS, failed to achieve the required pumping head within the allotted power. The separator discussed in this paper is a new design that was tested to determine compliance with performance requirements in the CRA. The drum separator and pump @SP) design is similar to the Oxygen Generator Assembly (OGA) Rotary Separator Accumulator (RSA) in that it has a rotating assembly inside a stationary housing driven by a integral internal motor. The innovation of the DSP is the <b>drum</b> shaped rotating <b>assembly</b> that acts as the accumulator and also pumps the liquid at much less power than its predecessors. In the CRA application, the separator will rotate at slow speed while accumulating water.
