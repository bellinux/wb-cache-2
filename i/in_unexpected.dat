5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked {{to try to make it}} appear as unique as possible.|$|E

25|$|These {{are fairly}} {{terrestrial}} birds of wet forest floors. They eat snails, insects and similar invertebrate prey. Pittas are mostly solitary and lay {{up to six}} eggs in a large spherical nest in a tree or shrub, or sometimes on the ground. Both parents care for the young.

25|$|In this sense, {{it is no}} {{surprise}} that Bach's music is easily and often performed on instruments it was not necessarily written for, that it is transcribed so often, and that his melodies turn up <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> places such as jazz music. Apart from that, Bach left a number of compositions without specified instrumentation: the Canons BWV 1072–1078 fall in that category, as well as the bulk of The Musical Offering and The Art of Fugue.|$|E
25|$|The {{reduction}} of sea ice has boosted {{the productivity of}} phytoplankton by about twenty {{percent over the past}} thirty years. However, the effect on marine ecosystems is unclear, since the larger types of phytoplankton, which are the preferred food source of most zooplankton, do not appear to have increased as much as the smaller types. So far, Arctic phytoplankton have not {{had a significant impact on}} the global carbon cycle. In summer, the melt ponds on young and thin ice have allowed sunlight to penetrate the ice, in turn allowing phytoplankton to bloom <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> concentrations, although it is unknown just how long this phenomenon has been occurring.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the basic}} {{concept of the}} strip is simple, Herriman always found ways to tweak the formula. Ignatz's plans to surreptitiously lob a brick at Krazy's head {{sometimes}} succeed; other times Officer Pupp outsmarts Ignatz and imprisons him. The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or gnomic pronouncements irritating the mouse {{so much that he}} goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even self-referential humor is evident—in one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having finished drawing the jailhouse.|$|E

25|$|WAP was {{the most}} well known feminist anti-pornography group out of many that were active {{throughout}} the United States and the anglophone world, primarily from the late 1970s through the early 1990s. After previous failed attempts to start a broad feminist anti-pornography group in New York City, WAP was finally established in 1978. WAP quickly drew widespread support for its anti-pornography campaign, and in late 1979 held a March on Times Square that included over 5000 supporters. Through their march {{as well as other}} means of activism, WAP was able to bring <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> financial support from the Mayor's office, theater owners, and other parties with an interest in the gentrification of Times Square.|$|E
25|$|Indirect free-kicks {{can throw}} a defence into {{confusion}} when taken quickly, or <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> directions. The third goal of Brazil's 1970 World Cup victory over Italy illustrates the method. Brazil's midfield general Gerson Nunes approached rapidly and lofted the dead ball {{in a high}} arc almost from the midfield line. It found Pele perfectly positioned near the Italian goal. The Brazilian headed down softly and accurately, straight {{into the path of}} the onrushing winger Jairzinho, who virtually walked the ball into the net. Italy's catenaccio defence was caught out of position here, not only failing to neutralise Pele, but providing little cover to stop Jairzinho. A rapid, daring set-piece kick will often accomplish this unbalancing of defences.|$|E
25|$|Species {{that are}} {{recorded}} <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> areas (adventive species) {{are not considered}} to be migratory species, because these did not leave their habitat on their own strength. Examples are species that are imported as egg or caterpillar alongside of their host plants or individuals that were reared by a collector but have escaped. An example of an introduced species is Galleria mellonella, which is found all over the world, because it is reared as food for captive birds and reptiles. At times it is difficult to decide if a species is adventive or migratory. Migratory species like Chrysodeixis chalcites and Helicoverpa armigera would be able to reach western Europe on their own, but are also common in greenhouses.|$|E

Rather than developing {{an interest in the}} successful son of her neighbors, Toby Walling, which would please both families, it is David who captures Nina's attention. When the connection between Nina and David is discovered, everyone's lives are thrown into upheaval, particularly Vanessa Walling's, Nina's childhood best friend.

25|$|Hōnen {{relocated}} {{to the district}} of Ōtani in Kyoto, where he started addressing crowds of men and women, establishing a considerable following. Hōnen attracted fortune-tellers, ex-robbers, samurai and other elements of society normally excluded from Buddhist practice. Hōnen {{was a man of}} recognition in Kyoto, and many priests and nobleman allied with him and visited him for spiritual advice. Among them was an imperial regent named Kujō Kanezane (1149–1207). The increasing popularity of his teachings drew criticism from noted contemporaries as Myōe and Jōkei among others, who argued against Hōnen's sole reliance on nembutsu as a means of rebirth in a pure land. Additionally, some disciples interpreted Hōnen's teachings <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> ways, leading to disreputable behavior, criticism of other sects, or other forms of antinomianism.|$|E
25|$|Many puzzles {{in these}} games involve {{gathering}} and using items from their inventory. Players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> ways. For example, {{by putting a}} deflated inner tube on a cactus to create a slingshot, which requires a player to realize that an inner tube is stretchy. They may need to carry items in their inventory for a long duration before they prove useful, and thus it is normal for adventure games to test a player's memory where a challenge can only be overcome by recalling a piece of information from earlier in the game. There is seldom any time pressure for these puzzles, focusing more on the player's ability to reason than on quick-thinking.|$|E

25|$|After {{making a}} {{television}} production: La Matiouette ou l'arrière-pays, (1983), Téchiné returned to critical attention with Rendez-vous (1985), a sexy noir melodrama replete with the seductive {{surface of the}} era. In the film a would-be actress, Nina, fleeing her provincial home for Paris, enters a turbulent love relationship with a sadistic, self-destructive young actor, who caused {{the death of his}} former girlfriend. When the actor himself is killed in an accident, or possible suicide, his former mentor/director, and father of the dead girlfriend, determines to cast the inexperienced Nina as the female lead in 'Romeo and Juliet', a role his deceased daughter played. The film is ultimately a vehicle for exploring the violent intensity of certain emotional attachments and their ability to cause one's life to spin off <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> directions. By now a key director of the post-New Wave, this film earned Téchiné the Cannes Festival Best Direction Award while helping launch the career of Juliette Binoche.|$|E
25|$|The Escort quest is a {{combination}} of slaying monsters to maintain the well-being of a non-player character (NPC), while exploring an area alongside that NPC. A typical escort quest would involve protecting a character as he or she moves through a monster-infested area. A majority of the time, the quest will demand the player to slay multiple monsters {{to ensure the safety of}} the NPC. Escort quests can be beneficial, forcing the player's to focus on a particular area, in order to play out a scene or reveal a section of the plot. Escort quests can also be used to funnel a character from one location to another, leading the player along a route or path. However, problems with this type of quest can occur if the artificial intelligence controlling the NPC causes the NPC to behave <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> or unmanageable ways. Because many escort quests are often perceived as being done wrong, they are very unpopular amongst the gaming community.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} encounter was the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich, {{during which the}} English club were trailing 1–0 until injury time, then scoring two goals to win 2–1. This result was celebrated by many in England who were not United fans as being another English victory over Germany. Other memorable matches were the controversial 1975 European Cup Final in which Bayern beat Leeds United after the latter had penalty claims turned down by a French referee who also disallowed a goal scored by Peter Lorimer with a shot from outside the area. Leeds would eventually eliminate a German team (VfB Stuttgart) <b>in</b> <b>unexpected</b> and bizarre circumstances. After the Germans had qualified, {{in the first round}} of the 1992–93 competition, on the away goals rule, the return leg was awarded by UEFA 3–0 to Leeds United because Stuttgart fielded an extra foreigner, thus infringing the European competition rules that were in place at the time. A replay was ordered as the aggregate stood at 3–3. Leeds won the replay at Barcelona's Camp Nou 2–1.|$|E
