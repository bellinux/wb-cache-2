5|$|In late May 1938, Chandler's {{campaign}} manager publicly claimed that federal relief agencies—especially the Works Progress Administration—were openly working for Barkley's re-election. Although the WPA administrator in Kentucky denied the charges, veteran reporter Thomas Lunsford Stokes launched an <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agency's {{activities in the}} state and eventually raised twenty-two charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles covering the Barkley-Chandler campaign. Federal WPA administrator Harry Hopkins claimed an internal <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agency refuted all but two of Stokes' charges, but Stokes was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1939 for his investigation. In the wake of the investigation Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939 to limit the WPA's involvement in future elections.|$|E
