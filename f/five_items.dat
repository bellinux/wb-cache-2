25|$|The fan and {{fly-whisk}} are items used {{to comfort}} and cool, an important accessory for a divine king {{especially in a}} tropical country. The Royal Fan (พัดวาลวิชนี) was created by order of King Rama I. The fan is gilded with gold, the handle enamelled in green and red. Traditionally a fan was made by bending a talipot palm's frond at a right angle; the royal fan mimics this traditional form. The Royal Fly-whisk of the yak's tail (พระแส้หางจามรี) {{was made in the}} reign of King Rama IV to augment the <b>five</b> <b>items</b> of the regalia. Evidently associated with the same idea of divine comfort as the fan, it is actually derived from the ancient chāmara of India. According to tradition, the fly-whisk was used by the king to repel any maleficent forces that might bring discomfort to his subjects. The hair on the royal fly-whisk has since been replaced by those of a white elephant.|$|E

One of the various changes for localization was the contents of Captain America's notebook list seen {{at the beginning of the}} film.

500|$|In {{the first}} half of 1923, Harding did two acts that were later said to {{indicate}} foreknowledge of death: he sold the Star (though undertaking to remain as a contributing editor for ten years after his presidency), and made a new will. Harding had long suffered occasional health problems, but when he was not experiencing symptoms he tended to eat, drink, and smoke too much. By 1919, he was aware he had a heart condition. Stress caused by the presidency and by Florence Harding's ill-health (she had a chronic kidney condition) debilitated him, and he never really recovered from an episode of influenza in January 1923. After that, Harding, an avid golfer, had difficulty completing a round. In June 1923, Ohio Senator Willis met with Harding, but brought to the president's attention only two of the <b>five</b> <b>items</b> he intended to discuss. When asked why, Willis responded, [...] "Warren seemed so tired".|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Hypno-analgesia (HA) {{is used in}} the {{operating}} room and for complex pain. Before implementation of HA in our intensive care unit (ICU), most protocols for algogenic procedures included intravenous or epidural morphine and Nitrous Oxid. Since 2016, many caregivers have been trained, HA has been implemented and patient comfort is evaluated using 1) a specific analogic scale of comfort (0 to 10) before and after the procedure +  2) {{at the end of the}} procedure, a score of patient and caregiver comfort using a <b>five</b> <b>item</b> questionnaire (5 to 20 points).|$|R

The mean {{note in the}} comfort scale remained unchanged after vs. before drain removal in patients without HA (n =  43, + 0.04 points, ±  2.8), while it increased in patients with HA (n =  45, + 2.07, ±  2.7  + p =  0.001). Using our specific <b>five</b> <b>item</b> comfort score, patients and caregivers had a comparable level of satisfaction in HA and non-HA groups (Patients 17.4 20 and 16.3 20  + caregivers— 19 20 in both). A trend was observed in reduction of the consumption of morphine and Nitrous Oxid with HA, without altering their comfort.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Routine data {{collection}} {{is now considered}} mandatory. Therefore, staff rated clinical scales that consist of multiple items should have the minimum number of items necessary for rigorous measurement. This study explores the possibility of developing a short form Barthel index, suitable for use in clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and audit, that satisfies criteria for rigorous measurement and is psychometrically equivalent to the 10 item instrument.  METHODS—Data were analysed from 844 consecutive admissions to a neurological rehabilitation unit in London. Random half samples were generated. Short forms were developed in one sample (n= 419), by selecting items with the best measurement properties, and tested in the other (n= 418). For each of the 10 items of the BI, {{item total correlations and}} effect sizes were computed and rank ordered. The best items were defined as those with the lowest cross product of these rank orderings. The acceptability, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of three short form BIs (five, four, and three item) were determined and compared with the 10 item BI. Agreement between scores generated by short forms and 10 item BI was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients and the method of Bland and Altman.  RESULTS—The <b>five</b> best <b>items</b> in this sample were transfers, bathing, toilet use, stairs, and mobility. Of the three short forms examined, the <b>five</b> <b>item</b> BI had the best measurement properties and was psychometrically equivalent to the 10 item BI. Agreement between scores generated by the two measures for individual patients was excellent (ICC= 0. 90) but not identical (limits of agreement= 1. 84 ± 3. 84).  CONCLUSIONS—The <b>five</b> <b>item</b> short form BI may be a suitable outcome measure for group comparison studies in comparable samples. Further evaluations are needed. Results demonstrate a fundamental difference between assessment and measurement and the importance of incorporating psychometric methods in the development and evaluation of health measures. ...|$|R
