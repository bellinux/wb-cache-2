40|$|Three {{types of}} actuators, i. e., {{oscillating}} walls, Lorentz <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> and DBD plasma actuators, {{were used to}} actively control turbulent boundary layer for the turbulent skin-friction drag reduction with Direct Numerical Simulations. The main object is to understand drag reduction mechanism in simple spanwise wall oscillation case (Jung et al., 1992), then implement the control using more practical Lorentz <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> and plasma actuators. A large amount of 40 ± 2 %, 30 ± 2 % and 20 ± 2 % drag reduction was observed at Rer = 200 turbulent channel for oscillating walls, Lorentz <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> and plasma actuators, respectively. Different configurations for Lorentz <b>force</b> and plasma <b>actuators</b> were intensively studied, with a new configuration proposed for DBD plasma actuators. The present study suggests a good prospective of skin-friction drag reduction by using Lorentz <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> for ocean transportation, and DBD plasma actuators for land and air transportation. However, no net energy saving was obtained for both actuators considering the fluid power required for flow control, and this situation was even worse if the electric efficiency of the actuators was accounted for. For all three types of actuators, {{the interaction between the}} actuators and the near wall turbulent structure is presented using ensemble averaged method. DNS control cases were also performed at moderate Reynolds numbers, i. e, Rer = 800 and 1600, to understand the role of recently discovered very large scale motions (VLSMs). The result suggests that the control of the VLSMs in the outer region is necessary for maximising drag reduction at high Reynolds number turbulent flow...|$|R

An active interface or a <b>force</b> <b>actuator</b> mounted between suspension and chassis can reduce these vibrations. The simulation of the full car model with the active interface or a <b>force</b> <b>actuator</b> {{is essential for the}} dimensioning of the active system, development of the controller, testing of the functionality, estimation of the performance and monitoring of the system reliability. An active interface has been developed and is currently improved in the Fraunhofer FASPAS project. With the simulation of the active Interface first experiences can be gathered even before the interface is integrated in the real structure. In this case the <b>force</b> <b>actuator</b> is composed of smart actuators based on piezoceramic materials. The application of a controller should reduce disturbing vibrations. The simulation is a helpful software tool for selection of the smart actuators and for construction of the <b>force</b> <b>actuator.</b> In this paper a NVH full car model based on FEM and MBS will be conducted. The suspension will be designed in the MBS and embedded in the chassis, which is imported with its elastic eigenmodes from the FEM into the MBS.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and {{experimental study of}} the frequency response function of a matched volume velocity sensor and uniform <b>force</b> <b>actuator</b> for active structural acoustic control. The paper first reviews {{the design of a}} volume velocity sensor and uniform <b>force</b> <b>actuator</b> on a panel, using piezoelectric film with quadratic shaping of the electrodes. The frequency response function of a matched volume velocity sensor and uniform <b>force</b> <b>actuator</b> bonded on either sides of a panel is then studied in detail. This analysis shows that below 100 Hz the sensor-actuator response is controlled by the bending vibration of the panel and a good estimate of the volumetric component of the transverse vibration of the panel is achieved. At higher frequencies, however, the sensoractuator response is controlled by the in-plane longitudinal and shear vibration of the panel, which causes the real part of the frequency response function to be not strictly positive and to be characterized by large amplitudes at higher frequencies. These two phenomena are important since they limit the possibility of implementing a stable direct velocity feedback control system using these transducers...|$|E
40|$|The {{active control}} of a {{structure}} {{in order to reduce}} its vibration or sound radiation, which may be termed active vibro-acoustic control, has previously been achieved with multiple actuators and sensors and fully-coupled feedforward or feedback controllers. In this paper local velocity feedback using multiple miniature accelerometers will be investigated, together with either collocated <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> or piezoceramic actuators placed under each sensor. With ideal <b>force</b> <b>actuators,</b> the plant response is passive for such an arrangement of collocated actuator/sensor pairs and so decentralized (local) feedback is guaranteed stable. This property is shown to extend to collocated velocity sensors and piezoceramic actuators over the bandwidth of interest and so multiple local feedback loops are also predicted to be stable. The performance of such a system is simulated in controlling the vibration and sound transmission through a thin plate, excited by an acoustic plane wave, with a 4 x 4 array of such actuator/sensor pairs, which are connected together with 16 local feedback control loops. Using <b>force</b> <b>actuators,</b> significant frequency-averaged reductions up to 1 kHz in both the kinetic energy (28 dB) and transmitted sound power (18 dB) can be obtained with an appropriate feedback gain in each loop. These reductions are not so great with piezoelectric actuators (12 dB and 9 dB respectively) but their use allows the controller to be fully integrated in the structure...|$|R

40|$|With {{an array}} of {{collocated}} <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> and velocity sensors, decentralised feedback controllers can not only be unconditionally stable, but their performance in reducing vibration and radiated sound can approach that of a centralised LQG controller [1]. They also have a modular architecture that can be scaled, even for very large structures. This paper discusses the use of either piezoelectric or proof-mass transducers, instead of ideal <b>force</b> <b>actuators,</b> in such decentralised controllers. Piezoceramic actuators can give significant control in thinner structures, but as well as controlling out-of-plane vibration they also create in-plane motion in the structure that can couple into closely located strain sensors causing instability in feedback controllers. Novel triangular arrangements of such transducers will be described in which the effect of in-plane coupling is minimised, thus significantly improving their performance. Proof-mass actuators are attractive when generating significant forces at low frequencies, but their natural frequency must be well below the first structural resonance frequency for stable operation...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{research}} {{tests were}} performed to actively control the rotor vibrations of a flexible rotor mounted on flexible bearing supports. The active control method used in the tests is called optimal direct-output feedback control. This method uses four electrodynamic actuators to apply control forces directly to the bearing housings {{in order to achieve}} effective vibration control of the rotor. The <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> are controlled by an analog controller that accepts rotor displacement as input. The controller is programmed with experimentally determined feedback coefficients; the output is a control signal to the <b>force</b> <b>actuators.</b> The tests showed that this active control method reduced the rotor resonance peaks due to unbalance from approximately 250 micrometers down to approximately 25 micrometers (essentially runout level). The tests were conducted over a speed range from 0 to 10, 000 rpm; the rotor system had nine critical speeds within this speed range. The method was effective in significantly reducing the rotor vibration for all of the vibration modes and critical speeds...|$|R

40|$|Large (> 1 m) {{deformable}} mirrors {{with hundreds}} or thousands of actuators are attractive for extremely large telescopes. Use of <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> coupled to the mirror via suction cups, and electret microphones for position sensing, has the potential of substantially reducing costs. However, a mirror controlled with <b>force</b> <b>actuators</b> will have many structural resonances within the desired system bandwidth, shifting the emphasis somewhat of the control aspects. Local velocity and position loop for each actuator can add significant damping, but gives poor performance at high spatial frequencies. We therefore introduce a novel control strategy with many parallel "actuator families", each controlled by single-input-single-output controllers. This family approach provides performance close to that of global control, but without the accompanying robustness challenges. Using a complete simulation model of a representative large deformable mirror, we demonstrate feasibility of the approach. This paper describes the challenges of non-ideal actuators and sensors. The results presented give an understanding of the required actuator bandwidth and the effects of the sensors dynamics. The conclusion is that the introduction of actuator and sensor dynamics does not limit the control system of the deformable mirror...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis is}} presented of the flexural vibration of a beam with a control system which implements direct velocity feedback using either an ideal collocated <b>force</b> <b>actuator</b> or a closely located piezoelectric patch actuator. The {{aim of this}} study is to describe the vibration of the beam as the control gain is raised. Both control systems generate active damping which reduces the vibration level at resonance frequencies. However, it is shown that when the gain passes an optimal value then the vibration of the beam is rearranged into a new set of lightly damped resonance frequencies, since the control systems impose new boundary conditions at the control position on the beam, in which the velocity is driven to zero in both cases but different spatial derivatives of the velocity are driven to zero in the case of the <b>force</b> <b>actuator</b> and the piezoelectric patch actuator. The new ‘‘natural frequencies’’ and ‘‘natural modes’’ of the beam constrained by the two feedback control systems with large control gains are derived analytically. The new resonance frequencies and mode shapes seen in the simulations are consistent with the natural frequencies and natural modes of the constrained beams derived analytically...|$|E
