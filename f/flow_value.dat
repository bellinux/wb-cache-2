40|$|In this investigation, 145 {{previously}} recorded temperature logs from 63 boreholes on or {{near the}} NTS were examined. Thirteen of these temperature logs were determined to be suitable for the determination of heat <b>flow</b> <b>values.</b> Additionally, 36 new temperature profiles were obtained in the field, either to validate existing temperature profiles, or to provide additional temperature profiles for heat flow determination. Of these, 23 boreholes were found to have temperature profiles suitable for the determination of additional heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> from one or more intervals within the boreholes. Comparison of the previously existing and relogged temperature profiles, in general, displayed excellent correlations, and demonstrated the usefulness and reliability of existing temperature profiles from the NTS. Heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> for intervals contained within the 36 boreholes from which values could be determined ranged from a low of 8. 0 mW m- 2 to a high of 181. 6 mW m- 2. Vertical variations in heat <b>flow</b> <b>values,</b> within individual boreholes, were readily explained by the advection of heat by groundwater flow. Horizontal consistencies and variations in heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> between various boreholes were dependent upon the geologic setting of the borehole, and the effect of vertical fluid movement. Temperature profiles are extremely easy and inexpensive to obtain. Considerable hydrologic information can be determined from the examination of a single temperature profile; however, if sufficient spatially distributed heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> are obtained, a heat transport model of the NTS could be used to reduce the uncertainty of nonisothermal hydrologic models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Terrestrial {{heat flow}} in the Baikal rift zone is irreg-ularly distributed. Its high values are {{associated}} with active faults and areas of dynamic influence of faults. Stress pat-terns in these regions have been studied across and along major faults. Measurement sites under consideration are those located not farther than 30 km from the given fault axis. Across the fault strike, heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> are revealed to decrease with distance from the fault axis. Along the fault strike, variations of heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> are within measurement errors, {{with the exception of}} thermal spring sites. It is estab-lished that heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> are regularly changeable. Similar relationships are obtained for heat flow patterns in other con-tinental rift zones. ...|$|R

40|$|Determination of the {{conductive}} heat flow in western Anatolia has broad implications in many areas, including {{studies on the}} present-day extensional tectonic activity and assessments of the geothermal resources in the region. In this study, high-resolution equilibrium temperatures from 113 boreholes with depths of ~ 100 m were analyzed for determination of the {{conductive heat}} flow. Thermal conductivities were either determined by measurements on outcrops or estimated using lithologic records. By {{a detailed analysis of}} temperature–depth curves, a total of 55 sites were selected as being useful for further conductive gradient/heat flow calculations, while the remaining 58 sites were abandoned due to hydrological effects on temperatures. Heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> with formal errors were calculated for 24 sites where rock thermal conductivity information is available. Due to the shallow depths of the investigated boreholes and uncertainties in thermal conductivity information, the results include a large accumulated error. A preliminary heat flow map is generated using {{the results of this study}} and a previous study in the southern Marmara region. Elevated heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> of 85 – 95 mW m - 2 are observed in the coastal areas, including peninsular parts of Çanakkale and Izmir. The central part of the Menderes Massif also shows elevated heat <b>flow</b> <b>values,</b> the highest values (> 100 mW m - 2) being in the northeastern part of the Gediz Graben near the Kula volcanic center. Moderate heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> of 55 – 70 mW m - 2 are observed in the eastern part of Çanakkale, central part of Balıkesir, northwest of Manisa, and northeast end of Bursa including Yalova. Some of the observed moderate values may be related to unconstrained near surface phenomena due to shallow depth of measurements. Towards the south of the study region, moderate heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> are also observed in Muğla. Previously reported regional heat <b>flow</b> <b>values</b> exceeding ~ 120 mW m - 2 is not observed in the region.
