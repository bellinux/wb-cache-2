500|$|The {{town has}} many {{dependent}} villages including West Buckland, Langford Budville, Nynehead, Sampford Arundel and Sampford Moor. The formerly independent village of Rockwell Green, {{to the west}} of the town, has been incorporated into the town however there is still a <b>green</b> <b>wedge</b> of land in between them. Wellington Park was a gift from the Quaker Fox family to the town in 1903 as a memorial to the coronation of King Edward VII. The [...] gardens were laid out by F.W. Meyer, who included a rock garden which used 80tons of limestone from Westleigh quarry near Burlescombe. It is Grade II listed on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. It was restored at a cost of £412,827 which included a grant of £296,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund Public Parks Initiative.|$|E

60|$|Where they moored {{their boat}} the trees showered down, {{so that their}} topmost leaves trailed in the ripples and the <b>green</b> <b>wedge</b> that lay in the water being made of leaves shifted in leaf-breadths as the real leaves shifted. Now there was a shiver of wind--instantly an edge of sky; and as Durrant ate {{cherries}} he dropped the stunted yellow cherries through the <b>green</b> <b>wedge</b> of leaves, their stalks twinkling as they wriggled in and out, and sometimes one half-bitten cherry would go down red into the green. The meadow was on a level with Jacob's eyes as he lay back; gilt with buttercups, but the grass did not run like the thin green water of the graveyard grass about to overflow the tombstones, but stood juicy and thick. Looking up, backwards, he saw the legs of children deep in the grass, and the legs of cows. Munch, munch, he heard; then a short step through the grass; then again munch, munch, munch, as they tore the grass short at the roots. In front of him two white butterflies circled higher and higher round the elm tree.|$|E
60|$|Four days' journey by boat to {{the north}} of Rinkitink is the Island of Pingaree, and as our story begins here I must tell you {{something}} about this island. At the north end of Pingaree, where it is widest, the land is a mile from shore to shore, but at the south end it is scarcely half a mile broad; thus, although Pingaree is four miles long, from north to south, it cannot be called a very big island. It is exceedingly pretty, however, and to the gulls who approach it from the sea it must resemble a huge <b>green</b> <b>wedge</b> lying upon the waters, for its grass and trees give it the color of an emerald.|$|E
60|$|That last is no {{more than}} a foot high, and about seven paces across, a mere flat top of a grey rock which smokes like a hot cinder after a shower, and where no man would care to venture a naked sole before sunset. On the Little Isabel an old ragged palm, with a thick bulging trunk rough with spines, a very witch amongst palm trees, rustles a dismal bunch of dead leaves above the coarse sand. The Great Isabel has a spring of fresh water issuing from the {{overgrown}} side of a ravine. Resembling an emerald <b>green</b> <b>wedge</b> of land a mile long, and laid flat upon the sea, it bears two forest trees standing close together, with a wide spread of shade at the foot of their smooth trunks. A ravine extending the whole length of the island is full of bushes; and presenting a deep tangled cleft on the high side spreads itself out on the other into a shallow depression abutting on a small strip of sandy shore.|$|E

40|$|The <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> of Stockholm {{are meant}} to support {{a high level of}} {{biodiversity}} as well as cultural and recreational services but evaluating the spatial development of the wedges is difficult because their delineation has changed since they were first used in a regional development plan. This study examines a part of the Hanveden and Tyresta wedges in southern Stockholm, with the goal to use robust ecological theory to evaluate the development of the wedges from 1992 until today with focus on conserving a high level of biodiversity. Using an already existing GIS-based method of identifying connectivity weaknesses in the wedges, more weaknesses were found in 2010 than in 1992 although the total area of the wedges had only declined 3. 3 %. The shape of the wedges had also changed, with more narrow parts in 2010 than in 1992. To more effectively compare the development of factors in the landscape that are relevant for biodiversity, this study proposes a new method using the common shrew and hazel grouse as surrogate species. The total area loss for the common shrew was 2. 96 % from 1991 to 2013 and 2. 23 % for the hazel grouse. Fragmentation increased for both species. A large part of the greenspaces relevant to the surrogate species are covered by the <b>green</b> <b>wedges,</b> meaning that important cultural and recreational values identified by the county council are also present in areas relevant to the surrogate species. Using surrogate species to delineate and monitor the <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> could enhance the cultural and recreational qualities of the wedges, emphasize the need for connectivity planning, identify ecologically important parts of the greenspaces as well as provide a tool for following up the development of the urban greenspaces of Stockholm. However, formulating goals relevant to biodiversity is important to fully evaluate development and municipal cooperation is needed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{court case}} was heard, where the plaintiffs argued that {{constructing}} EastLink {{would result in}} pressure to build the [...] "missing link" [...] (North East Link) between EastLink and the Metropolitan Ring Road. They claimed that such a freeway would damage the environmentally sensitive <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> through either Eltham and Warrandyte or Heidelberg and the Yarra Flats.

40|$|Urban greenspaces are universally valued as amenity-recreation venues, {{wildlife}} refuges {{and essential}} livable-city ingredients. Western strategies of urban greenspace provision {{are difficult to}} implement or retrofit in most Asian cities, commonly constrained by a high-density compact form. With recent rapid urbanization and associated brown and green field developments, ample opportunities arise to overhaul greenspace standards and patterns. The case study of the ancient city of Nanjing in China permits planning for an integrated greenspace network, aiming at flexibility for future urban expansion, green field acquisition, recreational functions, wildlife habitats and environmental benefits. It consists of <b>green</b> <b>wedges,</b> greenways and <b>green</b> extensions that incorporate urban green areas at three landscape scales. At the metropolis scale, through normative and substantive analyses of urban form and urban expansion, and assessment of suburban uplands, five <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> are demarcated to generate a star urban form. The <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> link the extensive countryside to the central city, and define elongated finger-like spaces between them for urban expansion to avoid conflicts with green fields. At the city scale, three major greenways, including city-wall circular greenway, Inner-Qinhuai River greenway, and canopy-road greenway, are designed as a permeating framework to guide new greenspace location, configuration and continuity, and to link existing parks. These greenways are equipped with a comprehensive trail system to foster pedestrian and cycling movements that are preferred by {{the public and the}} government. At the neighborhood scale, a greenspace organization, consisting of residential public open spaces, shaded sidewalks and riparian strips, conforms to the network geometry. As well-connected entities, these small proximate enclaves provide opportunities for residents to have day-to-day contact with nature. They also serve to resist undue urban influences and intrusions. Overall, the three-tiered greenspace system provides an alternative mode for urban development to the conventional transport-dominated one, to usher substantial improvement in landscape-environmental quality and to augment the sustainable-city notion. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.

50|$|A {{green belt}} or {{greenbelt}} {{is a policy}} and land use designation used in land use planning to retain areas of largely undeveloped, wild, or agricultural land surrounding or neighbouring urban areas. Similar concepts are greenways or <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> which have a linear character and may run through an urban area instead of around it. In essence, a green belt is an invisible line designating a border around a certain area, preventing development of the area and allowing wildlife to return and be established.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 2000s, {{population}} growth in Melbourne has been accelerating. Since the early 20th century, {{the city has been}} expanding outwards with low-density suburban urban forms to accommodate population growth. As this urban form is unsustainable, many sustainable alternatives have been proposed and implemented into policy to limit suburban sprawl, create transit-oriented urban environments and affordable housing and rent. However, in 2009 the Victorian Government announced plans to extend the city's urban growth boundary, potentially rezoning <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> and agricultural land for housing development.|$|R

40|$|Since 1947 the {{development}} of greater Copenhagen has followed a plan that divided the city into a centre and five urban fingers and since the 1980 ties they have formally constituted {{a part of the}} planning frame. Between the fingers four <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> and three <b>green</b> rings constitute a multifunctional recreational landscape of high value to the citizens. In spring 2007 a new planning reform was carried out in Denmark moving country side planning from the former Counties to municipality level. As a part of their legacy the Council for Greater Copenhagen in 2006 proposed a vision for an enlargement of the existing <b>green</b> <b>wedges</b> and a new fourth green ring.
