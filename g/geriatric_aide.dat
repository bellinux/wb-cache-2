40|$|Senior {{dietetic}} students {{worked closely}} with an elderly population and respective caregivers in an adult day-care program. Experiences included preparation of nutritional assessments, design of appropriate case management, and counseling clients and families. Nutrition education programs consonant with age-related changes in learning were planned and implemented. The food service system was monitored {{to assure that the}} needs of an aging group with diverse dietary needs were met. Students enjoyed a valuable experience working with a growing population and gained an appreciation of how heterogeneous today’s elders are. The Adult Day Care Center of the University of Delaware, Newark, represents the cooperative efforts of the university and the State Division of Aging. Since opening in 1984, enrollment has increased rapidly to its current maximum capacity of 25 clients per day. The center is staffed by a director with a degree in clinical psychology, two registered nurses, a driver <b>geriatric</b> <b>aide,</b> and a secretary. Developed as a national model, the center’s philosophy is to provide a therapeutic and caring environment for seniors living in community settings who are in need of a structured daytime environment. The overall goal is quite simply to enhance an elder’s self-esteem and general well-being. The center serves its clients through a host of programs that seek to make health promotion, health protection, and preventive health services more accessible. Health assessments and monitoring of daily health are routinely provided. Physical therapy, reality orientation, and educational classes are available. Referrals to appropriate professionals are offered. The center staff seeks {{to meet the needs of}} clients through develop-ment of an ongoing program and the establishment of a liaiso...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 89 - 97) This study {{describes the}} need for the development of Home Economics curriculum with an emphasis in Gerontology and also clarifies {{the need for}} specially trained home economists working with older adults. The basis for conclusions drawn from this study was the data derived from a questionnaire administered to a diverse senior citizen population resulting in one hundred thirty-one questionnaires. It was found that more than eighty percent of the senior population surveyed had a personal need related to Home Economics curriculum, specifically: nutrition, meal planning, consumer protection, classes related to personal development emphasizing family relationships, recreation, health care, and day care services which provide homemaker or <b>geriatric</b> <b>aides.</b> Over three-fourths of the respondents indicated as ???essential??? or as ???important??? the need for specially trained personnel to work with older adults in senior programs. Seniors desired additional information regarding the aspects of gerontology, and often felt that {{there was a lack of}} qualified persons to disseminate needed information. In comparing actual needs assessed by seniors with the available existing senior programs, it is suggested that areas of Home Economics be incorporated into a Gerontology curriculum...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologyPerson-centered caregiving is a {{construct}} {{that is currently}} being defined and operationalized in the gerontology literature and in long-term care. The goal {{of this study was}} to further define interpersonal person-centered care by developing and pilot testing a training intervention for <b>geriatric</b> nurse <b>aides.</b> The training was developed to incorporate content regarding person-centered behaviors, knowing the residents, and understanding relationships. Specific materials used in the training were videos to model person-centered care, personalized resident videobiographies, and personalized videos of caregiving interactions between the nurse aides and the residents. The pilot testing of this intervention was implemented by using a quasiexperimental, waitlist control design in two nursing homes, Catholic Care and St. Joseph. The outcome measures included two behavioral observation measures for assessing person-centered care: the Person-Centered Care Inventory and the Global Behavioral Scale. Additional outcome measures included: dyadic measures of relational closeness and relationship satisfaction, nurse aide job satisfaction, and resident satisfaction with care. The findings indicate that the training intervention was successful in increasing both the nurse aides’ and residents’ sense of relationship closeness, as well as their relationship satisfaction. However, the nurse aides’ person-centered caregiving behaviors care did not increase reliably. One explanation may be that the sampling of the nurse aides’ caregiving behaviors was too small to provide an adequate test of the hypothesized increase. It is possible that relationship closeness increased as a result of the combination of encouraging the nurse aides and residents to think of themselves as being in a relationship as well as the specific content of the training intervention...|$|R
