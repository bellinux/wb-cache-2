50|$|Most recently, in 2003, Aprilia {{launched}} the RSV Mille Tuono which was essentially an RSV Mille with motorcross-style high handlebars {{and only a}} small <b>headlight</b> <b>fairing.</b> Most of the major motorcycle magazines picked it for the best bike of the year. In 2004 Aprilia was acquired by Piaggio & C. SpA, to form the worldâ€™s fourth largest motorcycle group with 1.5 billion Euro in sales, an annual production capacity of over 600,000 vehicles, and a presence in 50 countries.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, the SRX {{was sold}} with a reduced {{displacement}} of 400 cc for tax reasons, or 608 cc. Also, these models featured an oil cooler. From 1988, the 2NX model was sold, which featured a 17-inch front wheel and single 320 mm brake disc. There {{was also an}} SRX 250 on the Japanese market, although this differed somewhat {{in the presence of}} a <b>headlight</b> <b>fairing</b> and electric start. When the international marketing of the SRX stopped, in Japan there was a new production line 3VN; it received an engine derived from the newer XT600E, equipped with an electrical starter. Also, the classic twin-shock configuration was dropped for a mono shock design. This iteration was produced until 1997, when production altogether ceased. The SRX was outlived by its predecessor - the SR400 was still available in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Deluxe" [...] model {{appeared}} in 1979. This bike looked {{nearly identical to}} the original CX500 Standard, with the exception of regular (85 mph) gauges and <b>headlight</b> (the mini <b>fairing</b> was removed) and black reversed Com Star wheels - 19 inch front and 16 inch rear. 1981 was the final year for the CX500 Deluxe model.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, Bertone {{created the}} Fiat 527S Ardita 2500, {{a turning point}} in car design, with some {{incredible}} new details such as the stunning front <b>headlights</b> with <b>fairing</b> along the bonnet. With the Ardita a new kind of style was created, destined to take off {{towards the end of the}} decade, with FIAT and Lancia models astounding for their day. Examples were the 'six window' FIAT 1500 Aerodinamica, the opulent Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet and the novel Fiat 1500 Torpedo, with structural features that had never been seen before, such as the fold-away hood which stowed away entirely inside the car. With Giovanni's bold innovations and elegant creations, he was highly appreciated by car experts and fans.|$|R
