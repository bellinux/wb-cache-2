5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships {{are considered to be}} one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two modes}} to select {{from in the}} game, Timed Dive and Free Dive. Timed Dive {{requires}} you to clear blocks until the diver reaches a certain depth before <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> air, {{at that point the}} level will end and the diver descends to the next stage. Free Dive is a never-ending puzzle that tests how deep your diver can go before <b>he</b> <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> air.|$|R
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Tallon had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 9,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable with the bat. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, including one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As Australia often won by an innings, and often declared in the first innings, Tallon only had 13 innings in his 14 first-class fixtures and was not out two times as <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> partners.|$|E
5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled {{the extent to which}} his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E

5|$|Following the World Cup, against Australia {{during a}} Test match at Perth in 1979–80, Boycott {{became the first}} man to be marooned on 99 not out in a Test when <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> partners. England then toured the West Indies. Here, Boycott again faced the West Indies' feared pace attack, but succeeded in scoring centuries off the likes of Holding, Roberts, Colin Croft and Joel Garner, despite having passed the age of 40 the {{previous}} year. Other batsmen, such as David Gower found the attack difficult to cope with, and the later England captain stated that Boycott often had no sympathy. Boycott was the third most successful batsman, behind Gooch and Gower, during a tour where England went down 2–0. He scored 70 in the opening match, the only England player to pass 50.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{travelled}} {{to flight}} schools across America. In November {{he flew to}} Orlando, Florida and across to Galveston, Texas near Palm Beach. The lecturing tour took him to Los Angeles California {{at the end of}} 1942. By January 1943 he had also visited Arizona and Texas. His flight log had expanded throughout this period to include a variety of types. Using his privileged position he flew the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Through flying MacLachlan felt the urge to participate in combat operations again but he enjoyed American hospitality immensely. In February he flew at an aerobatic show in Mesa, Arizona. On 18 February 1943 MacLachlan had a close call. While flying from Fort Stockton to El Paso, he force-landed in the desert when <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel. According to a legend, MacLachaln used a local pipeline to fill the tanks. While in America he undertook several public relations tours and met movie stars such as Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine when he visited Hollywood for autographed photo-shoots.|$|E

Italian propaganda later declared that Minniti was subject to torture and mutilation before his death.|$|E
25|$|In 1851 Swainson {{sailed to}} Sydney {{and he took}} the post of Botanical Surveyor in 1852 with the Victoria Government, after being invited by the Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe to study local trees. He {{finished}} his report in 1853 in which he claimed a grand total of 1520 species and varieties of Eucalyptidae.

25|$|Senna {{decided to}} try with a light fuel load to attack Mansell. He closed the gap to 7 seconds but because of that, <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel on the last lap, which gave Mansell the {{opportunity}} {{to pick up the}} stranded Brazilian on his victory lap and drive him back to pit lane. Therefore, Mansell won ahead of Berger, Prost, Senna (classified fourth for starting final lap), Piquet and Gachot.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, Mehmed had a final council {{with his}} senior officers. Here he {{encountered}} some resistance; {{one of his}} Viziers, the veteran Halil Pasha, who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege {{in the face of}} recent adversity. Zagan Pasha argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defense by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 at Phoenix, Harvick led {{part of the}} race, battling former rival Kyle Busch, but Denny Hamlin led {{the rest}} of the race on the last pit stop. Harvick tried to close on Hamlin, but scored a second-place finish after <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> gas with two laps to go, leaving Hamlin the race winner. He managed to cross the finish line holding off the pack for second place. Although winless, Harvick made the Chase through consistency. At the second stop at Phoenix, Harvick avoided a chaos filled race to collect his only win of the season, and the 19th of his career.|$|E

In the second match, batting at number four against Western Province in Cape Town, he scored 111 (his first century) and 31 not out. In the fourth match, against Natal in Port Elizabeth, he made 69 and 79 not out. In the sixth match, against Natal in Durban, he made 102 not out in a team total of 239. In each of the latter two innings <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> partners {{as the rest of}} the batsmen struggled.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Kyffin Freeman, {{owner of}} the Herne Bay Argus, formed the Hampton-on-Sea Estate Association Limited in 1879 with £60,000 capital in £10 shares, but only sold 398 shares. He built a bandstand, built {{foundations}} for reading rooms and planned tennis courts, a miniature golf course, an archery green and a recreation ground. He organised a sports day with free teas and amusement rides, but too many visitors arrived and <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> teas. With builder Thomas Richard Geelong Hoe he planned a housing estate, and a Hampton-on-Sea nameboard was put up at Herne Bay railway station in expectation of this, but then he died in 1880. The company was eventually dissolved in 1905.|$|E
25|$|Teamed with Brazilian Wilson Fittipaldi Júnior for the 1973 season, Reutemann {{scored two}} podium {{finishes}} and {{seventh in the}} Drivers' Championship. For 1974, the Gordon Murray-designed Brabham BT44 was a vast improvement and the team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship. Reutemann took the first three victories of his F1 career at South Africa, Austria and the United States. He might have won the first race {{of the year in}} Argentina, too, but the Brabham team apparently failed to properly fuel his car and <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel with less than two laps to go while safely in the lead. Though he matched Drivers' Champion Emerson Fittipaldi's win total, inconsistent performances in the other races left Reutemann sixth in the season standings.|$|E
