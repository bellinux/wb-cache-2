40|$|The {{microbiological}} quality of eight halogenated and two u. v. -treated <b>hydrotherapy</b> <b>pools</b> in hospitals was investigated. The {{microbiological quality}} of halogenated <b>hydrotherapy</b> <b>pools</b> was comparable to halogenated public swimming pools, although in some Pseudomonas aeruginosa and faecal pollution indicators were more frequent due to bad management. On {{the other hand}} u. v. -treated <b>hydrotherapy</b> <b>pools</b> had very bad microbiological quality. Apart from faecal pollution indicators, P. aeruginosa was present in very high numbers. Halogenated <b>hydrotherapy</b> <b>pools</b> were not highly contaminated with amoebae, and Naegleria spp. were never detected. On the other hand u. v. -treated pools contained very high numbers of thermophilic Naegleria. The Naegleria isolated were identified as N. lovaniensis, a species commonly found in association with N. fowleri.

25|$|Rangers' {{training}} facility {{is located in}} Auchenhowie, Glasgow. The facility is known as Murray Park after former chairman and owner Sir David Murray. It was proposed by then-manager Dick Advocaat upon his arrival at the club in 1998. It was completed in 2001 {{at a cost of}} £14million. Murray Park was the first purpose-built facility of its kind in Scotland, and incorporates features including nine football pitches, a state of the art gym, a <b>hydrotherapy</b> <b>pool,</b> and a video-editing suite. Rangers' youth teams are also accommodated at Murray Park, with around 140 players between under-10 and under-19 age groups using the training centre. Various first-team players have come through the ranks at Murray Park, including Alan Hutton, Chris Burke, Stevie Smith, John Fleck and Charlie Adam. International club teams playing in Scotland, as well as national sides, have previously used Murray Park for training, and Advocaat's South Korea team used it for training prior to the 2006 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Pool {{designs for}} canine {{hydrotherapy}} vary, but most have generic elements. The pool {{tends to be}} smaller than a human swimming pool and is heated. (This is unlike equine <b>hydrotherapy</b> <b>pools.</b> Horses generate a lot of body heat when swimming, so equine pools use cold water to prevent the animal overheating.) A dog's muscles benefit from the warming effects of the heated water. Most pools have a ramp for entry and exit and some have harnesses to maintain the dog in position in the water. There may be a manual or electric hoist for lifting dogs {{in and out of}} the water. Water is chlorinated or treated with an alternative chemical. Some have jets to add resistance and make the dog swim more strongly.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAcquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in {{the lungs}} of {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) is a marker of poor survival. PA is a ubiquitous pathogen prevalent in humid conditions. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of PA in public swimming pools, {{as well as from}} water taps. MethodsWater was collected from public indoor and outdoor pools in the area of St. Gallen, Switzerland. In addition, standing and running water was sampled from bathroom water taps of 50 patients with CF. ResultsOutdoor pools: In 2002, none of the 72 specimens from 28 pools revealed PA. In 2003, three specimens from 46 pools (7 %) revealed PA, each were from a different paddling pool. Indoor pools: two of 128 specimens from 56 pools (4 %) identified PA, both were from non-public <b>hydrotherapy</b> <b>pools.</b> Water taps: in winter, none of the 102 specimens was colonized with PA. in summer, only two out of 50 specimens of the standing water were positive for PA but none of the running water revealed PA. ConclusionThe prevalence of PA in public swimming pools and bathroom water taps {{in the eastern part of}} Switzerland is very low. On hot summer days, outdoor paddling pools and standing tap water can contain PA. This study does not support recommendations to avoid public swimming pools or running tap water if the water is maintained according to hygiene guidelines...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} the cardiorespiratory responses of eight healthy women (mean age 30. 25 years) to submaximal exercise on land (LTm) and water treadmills (WTm) in chest-deep water (Aquaciser). In addition, {{the effects of}} two different water temperatures were examined (28 and 36 degrees C). Each exercise test consisted of three consecutive 5 -min bouts at 3. 5, 4. 5 and 5. 5 km. h(- 1). Oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O- 2) and heart rate (HR), measured using open-circuit spirometry and telemetry, respectively, increased linearly with increasing speed both in water and on land. At 3. 5 km. h(- 1) (V) over dot O- 2 was similar across procedures [chi = 0. 6 (0. 05) l. min(- 1) ]. At 4. 5 and 5. 5 km. h(- 1) (V) over dot O- 2 was significantly higher in water than on land, {{but there was no}} temperature effect (WTm: 0. 9 and 1. 4, respectively; LTm: 0. 8 and 0. 9 l. min(- 1), respectively). HR was significantly higher in WTm at 36 degrees C compared to WTm at 28 degrees C at all speeds, and compared to LTm at 4. 5 and 5. 5 km. h(- 1) (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 003). The HR-(V) over dot O- 2 relationship showed that at a (V) over dot O- 2 of 0. 9 l. min(- 1), HR was higher in water at 36 degrees C (115 beats. min(- 1)) than either on land (100 beats. min(- 1)) or in water at 28 degrees C (99 beats. min(- 1)). The Borg scale of perceived exertion showed that walking in water at 4. 5 and 5. 5 km. h(- 1) was significantly harder than on land (WTm: 11. 4 and 14, respectively; LTm: 9. 9 and 11, respectively; P less than or equal to 0. 001). These cardiorespiratory changes occurred despite a slower cadence in water (the mean difference at all speeds was 27 steps/min). Thus, walking in chest-deep water yields higher energy costs than walking at similar speeds on land. This data has implications for therapists working in <b>hydrotherapy</b> <b>pools...</b>|$|R
