5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles,</b> which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E

50|$|The altarpiece was {{originally}} painted with distemper, but during a renovation in the 19th century all the paint was removed. Restoration works {{were carried out}} between 1852 and 1855 {{under the leadership of}} Adalbert Stifter, after it was discovered that common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> were damaging the wooden piece of art. During the renovation some parts of the altarpiece were replaced or altered by carpenters Johann Rint and Josef Rint. The renovation has been criticised, not least the removal of the paint. A second renovation was carried out in 1896, this time inspired by the explorer Andreas Reischek, who was born in Kefermarkt. Other restorative works have been made in 1904 and 1916 to 1918. In 1929, a new attempt to get rid of <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> damaging the altarpiece was made using Zyklon B. In 1959 an attempt was made {{to get rid of the}} beetles for the last time, as the altarpiece then was cleaned and impregnated. The window panes of the choir were furthermore treated to make the light less damaging to the altarpiece.|$|E

30|$|A high {{relative}} abundance of plaster beetles {{is found in}} Annexe Tunnels (6.0 per trap) and at Casemate Tunnels (0.45 per trap), but are less frequent elsewhere (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Plaster beetles feed on mould so as the Tunnels are damp, the environment may be suitable {{for the growth of}} this food source. As mentioned before the <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anobium punctatum) is frequent in Atcham Stores, especially at Atcham Store No. 31 (0.13 per trap) and the Tunnels of the Southeast Territory. Although found in five of the key London properties, the <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle</b> is not caught at high frequency in the capital.|$|R
50|$|Lasioderma serricorne, {{commonly}} known as the cigarette beetle, cigar beetle, or tobacco beetle, is an insect very similar in appearance to the drugstore beetle (Stegobium paniceum) and the common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anobium punctatum).

5000|$|Powderpost beetles are a {{group of}} seventy species of woodboring beetles {{classified}} in the insect subfamily Lyctinae. These beetles, along with spider beetles, death watch beetles, common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles,</b> skin beetles, and others, make up the superfamily Bostrichoidea. While most woodborers have a large prothorax, powderpost beetles do not, making their heads more visible. In addition to this, their antennae have two-jointed clubs. They are considered pests and attack deciduous trees, over time reducing the wood to a powdery dust. The damage caused by longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) is often confused with that of powderpost beetles, but the two groups are unrelated. Their larvae are white and C-shaped.|$|E
30|$|About 55 % of {{the traps}} {{of the more}} than 30000 traps {{examined}} over that period contained insects that were readily categorised. The rate of catch (insects/trap) was highest in London and the Southeast. Booklice (Liposcelis bostrychophila) and silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) were the most frequent catch. Woolly bear (Anthrenus spp.) larvae and crustacean woodlice (Porcellio spinicornis) were also common. A higher frequency of <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> (Anobium punctatum) is notable in the Southeast and West. Despite this overall pattern, catch varied greatly between individual properties. The general view that insects have increased over time was not universal, although the dominant booklouse showed an increased catch over the last decade. The insects {{did not appear to be}} randomly distributed, but clustered onto traps in greater numbers than might be expected from a Poisson distribution, which suggested they occurred as infestations. Some insect species appeared in combination with other species at a higher frequency than expected, but the reasons for these associations were not always obvious. Pheromone traps collected more webbing and case bearing clothes moths (Tineola bisselliella, Tinea pellionella) than traps without attractants, much as expected. There are hints that covered traps may collect fewer insects than simple blunder traps.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} 42 {{patients who}} had unusual pruritic dermatitis associated with a specifi c clinical sign (comet sign) in 23 houses in southeastern France from May through September 2007. Pyemotes ventricosus, a parasite of the furniture beetle Anobium punctatum, {{was the cause of}} this condition. In 2006, we described an outbreak of unusual dermatitis in southeastern France (1). Patients affected had highly erythematous pruritic macules typical of arthropod bites, sometimes associated with a linear erythematous macular tract that we called the comet sign (Figure 1). The cause of this outbreak remained unknown. In May 2007, during an entomologic ecoenvironmental investigation conducted inside the homes of some of these patients, we found wooden furniture, which harbored live <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> (Anobium punctatum) (Figure 2, panel A), and small amounts of wood dust on the floor. Because A. punctatum does not bite humans or cause contact dermatitis (2), it was not considered as the direct causative agent. However, stereomicroscope examination of the wood dust identified the mite Pyemotes ventricosus (Figure 2, panel B). Because Pyemotes spp. can cause dermatitis (3), they were considered as the hypothetical agent causing the eruption. We then conducted an observational and entomologic study of the new cases...|$|E

30|$|The catch {{rate for}} some {{individual}} species {{is shown in}} Figures  3 c- 3 h, and here we see apparent differences in the regional distribution of insects (p[*]<[*] 0.001 for each figure, Chi-squared test DoF[*]=[*] 4). London for example shows a high frequency of silverfish, woolly bear larvae and webbing clothes moths compared with other territories. A high frequency of <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> is notable in the Southeast and West, but to some extent these are driven by its prevalence in the Annexe and Casemate Tunnels (in the Southeast) and Atcham stores (under closure) in the West. In general the beetle is only found at 1.7 % occupancy {{in relation to the}} number of traps throughout the record, although at just over 3 % the Southeast and the West (p[*]=[*] 0.02, Mann–Whitney U test), but in the Tunnels and Atcham stores it is at 5.1 % and 5.2 % respectively (significant difference between these sites and the Southeast and the West territories; p[*]=[*] 0.04, Mann–Whitney U test). The wood weevils (Pentarthrum and Euophryum), show similar patterns to the furniture beetle, with highest catch rates in the southeast (0.053) and the west (0.028). Plaster beetles (Lathridiidae), as discussed below, are frequent in the Southeast.|$|E

40|$|Historical buildings, {{which served}} as museums in Turkey, are heavily infested with wood boring insects such as common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle,</b> Anobium punctatum. Disinfestations of museums in Turkey had been based on using Methyl bromide (MBr) at a {{concentration}} of 60 g/m 3. Due {{to the lack of}} a registered fumigant in Turkey that has no adverse effects to ozone layer, in this study, fumigation practice was concentrated on the use of lowered concentration of Methyl bromide at a dosage of 20 - 25 g/m 3. Lowered MBr concentrations were applied by a re-circulating system. The museum was constructed from a mix of wood and stone in Istanbul (Turkey). Valuable old sculptures of wood, paintings on wood or with wooden frames, as well as parquet floor material were all heavily damaged by wood boring insects. Before fumigation, all sensitive and precious objects were kept in specially designed cubes in the building to disinfest using modified atmosphere application. The building was fumigated for two days of exposure. Pieces of heavily infested wooden samples were kept inside the building during the fumigation. After aeration of the building, wooden samples were kept in glass cabinets for 3 months without any insect activity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Woodworm or <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle</b> Anobiton punctatum {{can cause}} serious damage to wooden objects and the {{structural}} timber in buildings. In {{the light of}} recent evidence of the reduced incidence of this pest in museum objects and in buildings it is timely to re-examine the need for chemical treatments and also to evaluate some of the alternative techniques. Over the years, treatments {{have been carried out}} {{with a wide range of}} chemicals to control infestations and prevent damage. Many of the treatments which were previously used are no longer acceptable for reasons of safety and legislation. Trials have shown that traps with pheromone lures can be used for the detection of adult Anobium. Monitoring programmes using these traps coupled with environmental monitoring and control mean that decisons on the need for treatment can be based on hard evidence of active pest presence rather than of fear generated by old emergence holes. If and when it is deemed that treatment is needed then the options for use of residual chemicals can be considered together with alternative treatments such as heat, cold, and atmospheric gases. By applying sound principles of pest management to Anohiwn, it should be possible to target control more effectively and at the same time decrease the incidence of unnecessary treatments with pesticides...|$|R
40|$|Denna rapport är en jämförande studie av utvalda konsolidanter som används till att stabilisera nedbrutet insektsangripet trä. Av de trägnagande skadeinsekter vi har i Sverige är det främst den strimmiga trägnagaren som är intressant i möbelsammanhang. I rapporten beskrivs den strimmiga trägnagaren, en liten skadeinsekt som kan åstadkomma stor skada om den får verka ostörd. Insekten finns utspridd i hela Europa och är ett stort problem då den angriper alla typer av träslag. Nedbrutet insektsangripet trä förlorar sin styrka och kan behöva konsolideras genom att injicera konsolidanter in i träet. Studien är tänkt att jämföra styrkan på de vanligast förkommande och använda konsolidanterna. Urval av dessa har dels gjorts genom att intervjua konservatorer i Sverige, Norge och Danmark, dels utifrån tillgänglig litteratur och forskning. I studien injiceras de utvalda konsolidanterna in i provbitar av artificiellt konstruerat insektsangripet trä som sedan utsätts för hållfasthetsprover. Provbitarna är utformade i kuber av björk, 45 x 45 x 45 mm och är borrade med 2 mm stora hål för att efterlikna angripet trä. Två olika typer av hållfasthetsprov har använts för att mäta styrkan hos de olika konsolidanterna, tryckhållfasthet tvärsfiber och skjuvhållfasthet. Resultaten av hållfasthetsproverna visar inga tydliga tecken på att de injicerade konsolidanterna gett någon direkt styrka till provbitarna. I tryckhållfasthets tvärsfiber finns en dock en tendens tillförhöjda värden. För att kunna dra någon slutsats bör ytterligare studier genomföras. This {{report is}} a {{comparative}} study of a chosen set of consolidating agents used to stabilize wood suffering from the infestation of wood boring insects. When considering furniture, the most common wood boring insect in Sweden is the <b>Furniture</b> <b>Beetle.</b> This report discusses the <b>Furniture</b> <b>Beetle,</b> a small insect which if left alone, achieves {{a great amount of}} damage. This particular beetle can be found in all of Europe and is a sizable problem, since it can attack all species of wood. Infested wood is destabilized by the beetles boring a web of internal tunnels throughout, which results in a loss of strength. This wood is then commonly injected with a consolidation agent to compensate for its internal weakness. The study is made to compare the strength of the most commonly used consolidating agents. These lection of agents was determined by interviewing conservators in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, as well as from accessible literature and research. In the study the selected consolidating agents are injected into trial pieces of artificially compromised wood which are in turn exposed to strength testing in a laboratory setting. The trial pieces are squares of birch wood measuring 45 x 45 x 45 mm which have several 2 mm holes drilled into them lengthwise, to simulate the beetle's pathways. Two types of strength testing were carried out to test the consolidation agents and their effect. One testmeasures the strength by compression across the grain, while the other puts pressure on either side, forcing the piece to fail along the grain. The results of the testing do not distinctively show that the consolidating agents impose any significant strength to the trial pieces. There is however a tendency of increased strength shown in the cross grain compression tests. To draw any firm conclusions, additional research is required...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{enemies are}} known from many {{cultural}} heritage pests, but {{their potential for}} biological control has been marginally exploited only. In this publication, examples of practical and commercial application of parasitoids of beetles and moths are compiled as well as laboratory research {{that contributes to the}} development of guidelines for parasitoid releases. One the one hand there are parasitoids found to occur simultaneously with the pests in buildings, on the other hand there are parasitoids that were never found {{to be associated with the}} respective pests but accept them if brought into the cultural heritage environments. An example for the latter is the egg parasitoid Trichogramma evanescens euproctidis, a parasitoid of moth eggs including those of the cloth moth Tineola bisselliella. In semi-field trials it was shown that inundative releases of the egg parasitoids are necessary and that effectiveness is reduced on thick cloth with long strand. Trichogramma release units have to be placed directly on the cloth to be protected. A naturally occuring parasitoid of Anobiid beetles is the pteromalid larval parasitoid Lariophagus distinguendus. This parasitoid was applied against the drugstore beetle Stegobium paniceum in historic libraries and against spider beetles (Ptininae) in historic buildings. A simulation model for the population-dynamics of L. distinguendus and the golden spider beetle Niptus hololeucus is presented. Finally, monitoring of the Braconid larval parasitoid Spathius exarator used for indirect monitoring of the common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle</b> Anobium punctatum is described. The future potential of parasitoids to control cultural heritage pests is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{webbing clothes moth}} Tineola bisselliela, {{assumed to}} {{original}} derive from Afrika (Zeller, 1852), is a cosmopolitan pest in households, warehouses and on culture heritage (Key & Common, 1959; Querner, 2014). To organize and develop strategies for the identification, prevention and control of stored product and culture heritage pest organism {{in the manner of}} Integrated Pest Management (IPM), a precise knowledge of the biology, ecology and physiology of the pest organism is needed. Based on the observations by Titschak (1925) on the development of T. bisselliella under different temperatures and relative humidities, this work shows the quantification of moth eclosion under three conditions of temperature and relative humidity compared in control and interspecific competition with the <b>furniture</b> carpet <b>beetle</b> (Anthrenus flavipes) from the same feeding guild. The overall competition of the webbing clothes moth demonstrates her success as a culture heritage pest organism. Monitoring T. bisselliella at differnt outdoor stations in the broader area of Berlin leads to the absence of an occurrence in natural habitats. Molecular analysis of mitochondrial sequences as well as BOX-PCR patters demonstrate no population fragmentation into the trapping locations. Nonetheless a quite good network from passiv distribution by human being can also results in a continious geneflow...|$|R
