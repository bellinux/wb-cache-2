5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to <b>depressurize.</b> The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E

Scully visits Sharon, {{now in a}} mental institution, who tells Scully that she stole {{technology}} from her employer that Max believed was alien. The device was in three parts, one which she had, one that he brought {{on the plane and}} a third one. Mulder uses the claim ticket to obtain the third device at a New York airport and heads on a plane to return to Washington. Garrett, who is also aboard, sits next to him. Mulder soon realizes who Garrett is and holds him at gunpoint. Garrett does not care, telling Mulder that if he shoots him the plane will <b>depressurize</b> and {{he will be able to}} escape with a parachute he has with him. Mulder imprisons Garrett in the airplane bathroom but Garrett soon emerges with a zip gun and orders him to hand over the device. Suddenly the plane starts shaking and bright lights shine in through the windows. When the plane touches down and Mulder gets out both Garrett and the device are gone and Mulder is missing nine minutes, having no memory of what happened. The agents visit Sharon one last time in Max's trailer and say goodbye.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} revived {{safety concerns}} {{about the effects of}} smoke in the cockpit. The crash also revived concerns over whether smoke hoods should be allowed in the cockpit. Prior to the crash of UPS Flight 6, debate over whether manufacturers and regulators had been doing enough to prevent airborne fires had occurred. Around the time of the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board had asked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to install automatic fire extinguisher systems in the holds of cargo aircraft. UPS Airlines followed FAA regulations, which stated that pilots should <b>depressurize</b> the main cabin and climb to an altitude of at least [...] upon detection of a fire so as to deprive the flames of oxygen.|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that methane production from hydrate-bearing porous media by means of depressurization-induced dissociation can be a promising technique. In this study, a 2 D axisymmetric model for simulating the gas production from hydrates by depressurization is developed to investigate the gas production behavior with different <b>depressurizing</b> approaches. The simulation results showed that the depressurization process with <b>depressurizing</b> range has significant influence on the final gas production. On the contrary, the <b>depressurizing</b> rate only affects the production lifetime. More amount of cumulative gas can be produced with a larger depressurization range or lowering the <b>depressurizing</b> rate for a certain <b>depressurizing</b> range. Through the comparison of the combined depressurization modes, the Class 2 (all the hydrate dissociation simulations are performed by reducing the initial system pressure with the same <b>depressurizing</b> range initially, then to continue the depressurization process conducted by different <b>depressurizing</b> rates and complete when the system pressure decreases to the atmospheric pressure) is much superior to the Class 1 (different <b>depressurizing</b> ranges are adopted in the initial period of the gas production process, when the pressure is reduced to the corresponding value of depressurization process at the different <b>depressurizing</b> range, the simulations are conducted at a certain <b>depressurizing</b> rate until the pressure reaches the atmospheric pressure) for a long and stable gas production process. The parameter analysis indicated that the gas production performance decreases and the period of stable production increases with the initial pressure for the case of <b>depressurizing</b> range. Additionally, for the case of <b>depressurizing</b> range, the better gas production performance is associated with higher ambient temperature for production process, and the effect of thermal conductivity on gas production performance can be negligible. However, for the case of <b>depressurizing</b> rate, the ambient temperature or thermal conductivity is dominant in different period of gas production process...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{different}} saturations of hydrate samples were formed in a cubic hydrate simulator (CHS) filled with silica sand. Subsequently, the hydrate was dissociated by depressurization {{in conjunction with}} warm water stimulation using dual horizontal wells. The hydrate dissociation process includes the <b>depressurizing</b> period and the injection period (the constant-pressure period). Hydrate was dissociated simultaneously in the whole reservoir during the <b>depressurizing</b> period. Meanwhile, gas production in the <b>depressurizing</b> period is mainly determined by the <b>depressurizing</b> rate, and it has little relation to the hydrate saturation (when the hydrate saturation ranges from 15. 5 % to 39. 1 %). During the injection period, more gas can be produced for the reservoir with the higher hydrate saturation, whereas the highest average gas production rate can be obtained for the reservoir with the middle-higher hydrate saturation. With respect to the gas production in the <b>depressurizing</b> period, gas production in the injection period is the dominant factor affecting the whole production efficiency in the experiment. In addition, the energy ratio only increases {{with the increase of}} the hydrate saturation in the prior stage of the constant-pressure period, and the final energy ratio with the middle-higher hydrate saturation is the maximum. Moreover, energy analysis indicates that heat injection plays the leading role for hydrate dissociation in the constant-pressure production period when the initial hydrate saturation is higher than 32. 4 %...|$|R

In different experiments, the cumulative gas productions are similar in the <b>depressurizing</b> period and increase with the hydrate saturation in the steady pressure period. The average gas production rate increases with the increase of the hydrate saturation while decreases at the hydrate saturation of 40. 7 % in the steady pressure period.

40|$|Analyses were {{performed}} to determine maximum temperatures in the reactor pressure vessel for two potential Very-High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) designs during normal operation and during a <b>depressurized</b> conduction cooldown accident. The purpose of the analyses was {{to aid in the}} determination of appropriate reactor vessel materials for the VHTR. The designs evaluated utilized both prismatic and pebble-bed cores that generated 600 MW of thermal power. Calculations {{were performed}} for fluid outlet temperatures of 900 and 950 Â°C, corresponding to the expected range for the VHTR. The analyses were performed using the RELAP 5 - 3 D and PEBBED-THERMIX computer codes. Results of the calculations were compared with preliminary temperature limits derived from the ASME pressure vessel code. Because PEBBED-THERMIX has not been extensively validated, confirmatory calculations were also performed with RELAP 5 - 3 D for the pebble-bed design. During normal operation, the predicted axial profiles in reactor vessel temperature were similar with both codes and the predicted maximum values were within 2 Â°C. The trends of the calculated vessel temperatures were similar during the <b>depressurized</b> conduction cooldown accident. The maximum value predicted with RELAP 5 - 3 D during the <b>depressurized</b> conduction cooldown accident was about 40 Â°C higher than that predicted with PEBBED. This agreement is considered reasonable based on the expected uncertainty in either calculation. The differences between the PEBBED and RELAP 5 - 3 D calculations were not large enough to affect conclusions concerning comparisons between calculated and allowed maximum temperatures during normal operation and the <b>depressurized</b> conduction cooldown accident...|$|R
50|$|Whether {{the crew}} members {{remained}} conscious long after the breakup is unknown, and largely depends on whether the detached crew cabin maintained pressure integrity.

If, on the other hand, the cabin was not <b>depressurized</b> or only slowly <b>depressurizing,</b> they may have been conscious for the entire fall until impact. Recovery of the cabin found that the middeck floor had not suffered buckling or tearing, as would result from a rapid decompression, thus providing some evidence that the depressurization may have not happened all at once.|$|R
