50|$|Eristalini is a {{tribe of}} hoverflies. Several species are {{well-known}} honeybee mimics, {{such as the}} <b>drone</b> <b>fly</b> Eristalis tenax, while other genera such as Helophilus and Parhelophilus exhibit wasp-like patterns of yellow and black stripes, both strategies to avoid predation by visual predators such as birds.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} a {{well-known}} hoverfly maggot is the rat-tailed maggot, of the <b>drone</b> <b>fly,</b> Eristalis tenax. It has a breathing siphon at its rear end, giving it its name. The species lives in stagnant water, such as sewage and lagoons. The maggots also have a commercial use, and are sometimes sold for ice fishing.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} encountered rat-tailed maggots are the larvae of the <b>drone</b> <b>fly,</b> Eristalis tenax. It lives in stagnant, oxygen-deprived water, {{with a high}} organic content. It is fairly tolerant of pollution and can live in sewage lagoons and cesspools. In 2017, rat-tailed maggots gained some press coverage after they were recognised in the composting toilets of the Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
50|$|Myathropa florea is a {{very common}} European and North African species of hoverfly. Adults may be seen on flowers from May to September. It is of similar size as the <b>drone</b> <b>fly,</b> but living Myathropa are {{generally}} more yellow, with two light bands to the thorax, interrupted with a black central smudge. In museum specimens, any yellow colour soon fades to brown after death. Like most Eristalini, Myathropa are rather variable in size, shape and colour.|$|E

30|$|Since the {{relationship}} between the number of required drones versus the <b>drone’s</b> <b>fly</b> height is a saturated function rather than a linear one, we do not provide prediction models for this relationship.

50|$|The Drone {{became popular}} with private owners. Col. the Master of Sempill startled the {{aviation}} world in April 1936, when he <b>flew</b> <b>Drone</b> G-ADPJ from Croydon Airport to Berlin in 11 hours flying time on 14 gallons of petrol. The return took him nine hours. Two <b>Drones</b> <b>flew</b> over 40,000 miles with C.W.A. Scott's air display team. During the Second World War, a camouflaged Drone de Luxe was unofficially flown by pilots of No. 609 Squadron on duck-shooting sorties using a 12-bore shot gun and a ring-and-bead sight.|$|R
50|$|Camouflage {{consists}} {{of not only}} color but also shape and pattern. The background upon which the organism is seen can be both its environment, such as a mantis resembling dead leaves, or other organisms, e.g., the stripes of zebra blending in {{with each other in}} a herd, making it difficult for lions to focus on a single target. In mimicry, an organism has a similar appearance to another species, as in the <b>drone</b> <b>fly,</b> which resembles a bee, yet has no sting. Another example of such Batesian mimicry is the io moth, (Automeris io), which has markings on its wings that resemble an owl's eyes. When an insectivorous predator disturbs the moth, it reveals its hind wings, temporarily startling the predator and giving it time to escape. Predators may also use mimicry to lure their prey, however. Female fireflies of the genus Photuris, for example, copy the light signals of other species, thereby attracting male fireflies, which are then captured and eaten (see aggressive mimicry).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The saprophagous and coprophagous maggots of the <b>drone</b> <b>fly</b> Eristalis tenax (Insecta, Diptera) {{have evolved}} the unique {{ability to survive}} in aquatic {{habitats}} with extreme microbial stress such as drains, sewage pools, and farmyard liquid manure storage pits. Therefore, they represent suitable models for the investigation of trade-offs between the benefits resulting from colonization of habitats lacking predators, parasitoids, or competitors and the investment in immunity against microbial stress. In this study, we screened for genes in E. tenax that are induced upon septic injury. Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to selectively amplify and identify cDNAs that are differentially expressed in response to injected crude bacterial endotoxin (LPS). Results Untreated E. tenax maggots exhibit significant antibacterial activity in the hemolymph which strongly increases upon challenge with LPS. In order to identify effector molecules contributing to this microbial defense we constructed a subtractive cDNA library using RNA samples from untreated and LPS injected maggots. Analysis of 288 cDNAs revealed induced expression of 117 cDNAs corresponding to 30 novel gene clusters in E. tenax. Among these immune-inducible transcripts we found homologues of known genes from other Diptera such as Drosophila and Anopheles that mediate pathogen recognition (e. g. peptidoglycan recognition protein) or immune-related signaling (e. g. relish). As predicted, we determined a high diversity of novel putative antimicrobial peptides including one E. tenax defensin. Conclusion We identified 30 novel genes of E. tenax that were induced in response to septic injury including novel putative antimicrobial peptides. Further analysis of these immune-related effector molecules from Eristalis may help to elucidate the interdependency of ecological adaptation and molecular evolution of the innate immunity in Diptera. </p...|$|E
40|$|Because of its {{importance}} as a pollinator {{and its potential}} economic usefulness for the biodegradation of organic animal waste, the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the <b>drone</b> <b>fly,</b> Eristalis tenax L. (Diptera: Syrphidae), was studied in both wild and captive populations from southeastern Europe. Wild specimens from a natural protected habitat (with low human impact), field crop habitat (semisynanthropic condition), and intensive pig farming habitat (synanthropic condition) were compared with a laboratory colony reared on artificial media. An integrative approach was applied based on allozyme loci, cytochrome c oxidase I mitochondrial DNA, wing traits (size and shape), and abdominal color patterns. Our {{results indicate that the}} fourth and eighth generations of the laboratory colony show a severe lack of genetic diversity compared with natural populations. Reduced genetic diversity in subsequent generations (F 4 and F 8) of the laboratory colony was found to be linked with phenotypic divergence. Loss of genetic variability associated with phenotypic differentiation in laboratory samples suggests a founder effect, followed by stochastic genetic processes and inbreeding. Hence, our results have implications for captive bred Eristalis flies, which have been used in crop pollination and biodegradation of organic waste under synanthropic conditions. This work {{was supported in part by}} the Ministry of Science of Serbia (Dynamics of gene pool, genetic and phenotypic variability of populations, determined by the environmental changes, No. 173012), and the Provincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development (Molecular and phenotypic diversity of taxa of economical and epidemiological importance, and endangered and endemic species in Europe).

30|$|Until now, the <b>drone’s</b> <b>fly</b> height {{was limited}} to 35 m (Section 3.1) maximum and 4 m minimum. When flying above an outdoor user, a fly height of 4 m was assumed.

In this section, the <b>drone</b> will <b>fly</b> at a predefined height independent on {{the fact of the}} user is indoors or outdoors. However, note however that when the user is indoor and the building is higher than the predefined fly height, this location can not be added as a possible location to develop the network.|$|R
