But there's a lot of story potential to mine there.

Easton said: [...] "I've been trying <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> and haven't {{been able to do}} it [...] before.

2500|$|After [...] "Normal" [...] aired, {{internet}} sources {{began to}} summarize the rules for True American, which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and Candy Land where the floor is lava; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents. The idea of True American came from a New Girl writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting [...] "JFK! FDR!" [...] and walking on chairs. As the cast {{did not understand the}} game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to [...] "have fun, dig in, jump in" [...] and play it as if [...] "they'd been playing this thing <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> and years." [...] The high-energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming True American more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode.|$|E

Prior to submitting the photograph for a Pulitzer Prize, Meadows' assignment editor, Fred Sweets, contacted the firefighter, who reportedly {{said he had been}} asked by Meadows to go to the pool and splash water on his head. Meadows denied the accusation, claiming [...] "I may have been guilty of saying this would make a nice shot, but {{to the best of my}} recollection, I did not directly ask him to do that. ...

[...] In February 2013 in the Wall Street Journal, Boal responded to the Senate critics, being quoted as saying [...] "oes that mean they can use the movie as a political platform to talk about what they've been wanting to talk about <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> and years? Do I think that Feinstein used the movie as a publicity tool to get a conversation going about her report? I believe it, ..." [...] referring to the intelligence committee's report on enhanced interrogations. He also said the senators' letter showed they were still concerned about public opinion supporting the effectiveness of torture and didn't want the movie reinforcing that. Boal said, though, [...] "I don't think that [...] issue has really been resolved" [...] if there is a suspect with possible knowledge of imminent attack who will not talk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first quarter}} went by 0-0 {{what looked to}} become another {{defensive}} battle that these two teams have taken part in so many times during their long 10-year war, this soon changed as James Twomey ran for 60 yards for a fantastic rushing touchdown; however, it was called back over a flag, deja vu of last year's regular season game where Twomey was called back on a 70-yard rushing TD against the same opponents. The man to break the deadlock was the new Vikings special teams captain Sean Goldrick (last year's rookie of the year) after he broke tackles and sprinted 45 yards for a TD after Garvey connected with him. The Rebels got the ball back and wanted to level the scores before the half driving down the Vikings pitch bending the Viking d to their limit until the usual dominating Rebels veteran quarterback Dennehy threw a pass that was intercepted by a player who has also been dominating the IAFL <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years,</b> Vikings captain Liam Ryan, who {{over the years has}} developed the skills to become a take balls out of the air that he has no right to. This stopped the Rebels drive and looked all set for the Vikes to go into the half with an 8-0 lead, with 3 seconds left on the clock of the first half, Marc Ashworth pitched the ball to Adrian Garvey, who ran 61 yards. Garvey had excellent blocking but still had a lot to do, running straight through two Rebels defenders.|$|E

2500|$|In 1841 Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the {{daughter}} of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) {{were told by}} Ada's mother that her father was also Medora's father. On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: [...] "I am {{not in the least}} astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected." [...] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: [...] "I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was." [...] In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals: first, from a relaxed relationship with men who were not her husband, which led to rumours of affairs—and secondly, her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than £3,000 on the horses during the later 1840s. The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband. She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her. During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, {{it had become}} an ever more widely held view that {{equitable}} rules and the law of trusts varied unpredictably, as the jurist John Selden remarked, according {{to the size of}} the [...] "Chancellor's foot". Over the 18th century English property law, and trusts with it, mostly came to a standstill in legislation, but the Court of Chancery continued to develop equitable principles notably under Lord Nottingham (from 1673–1682), Lord King (1725–1733), Lord Hardwicke (1737–1756), and Lord Henley (1757–1766). In 1765, the first Professor of English law, William Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that equity should not be seen as a distinct body of rules, separate from the other laws of England. For example, although it was [...] "said that a court of equity determines according to the spirit of the rule and not according to the strictness of the letter," [...] wrote Blackstone, [...] "so also does a court of law" [...] and the result was that each system of courts was attempting to reach [...] "the same principles of justice and positive law". Blackstone's influence reached far. Chancellors became more concerned to standardise and harmonise equitable principles. At the start of the 19th century in Gee v Pritchard, referring to John Selden's quip, Lord Eldon (1801–1827) said 'Nothing would inflict upon me greater pain in quitting this place than the recollection that I had done anything to justify the reproach that the equity of this court varies like the Chancellor's foot.' The Court of Chancery was meant to have mitigated the petty strictnesses of the common law of property. But instead, came to be seen as cumbersome and arcane. This was partly because until 1813, there was only the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls working as judges. Work was slow. In 1813, a Vice-Chancellor was appointed, in 1841 two more, and in 1851 two Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery (making seven). But this did not save it from ridicule. In particular, Charles Dickens (1812–1870), who himself worked as a clerk near Chancery Lane, wrote Bleak House in 1853, depicting a fictional case of Jarndyce v Jarndyce, a Chancery matter about wills that nobody understood and dragged on <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years.</b> Within twenty years, separate courts of equity were abolished. Parliament merged the common law and equity courts into one system with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. Equitable principles would prevail over common law rules in case of conflict, but the separate identity of equity had ended. The separate identity of the trust, however, continued as strongly as before. In other parts of the Commonwealth (or the British Empire at the time) trust law principles, as then understood, were codified for the purpose of easy administration. The best example is the Indian Trusts Act 1882, which described a trust as meaning [...] "an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the bearer".|$|E
