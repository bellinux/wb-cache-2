Guy abused his authority and ignored Raynald of Ch√¢tillon's harassment of Muslim trade caravans, causing a diplomatic crisis between Jerusalem and Egypt-Syria. Guy's apparent <b>excess</b> <b>caution</b> at Kerak caused King Baldwin to depose Guy as regent and lift Saladin's siege there, during {{the wedding of}} young princess Isabella and Humphrey IV of Toron.|$|E
5000|$|The pair {{of novels}} was adapted as a 1990 Merchant-Ivory motion picture, ''''Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'''', {{starring}} Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. Critics gave the film mixed reviews. Hal Hinson wrote in The Washington Post that [...] "the film {{comes with a}} built-in problem. Its subject is emotional repression, and {{the challenge is to}} make a film about a soul-deep conservatism that doesn't itself suffer from the <b>excess</b> <b>caution</b> and lack of dynamism that its characters do. However, it's not a challenge that is met." ...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) {{can be described}} as cautious and hesitant, manifesting an excessive indecisiveness that hinders efficient decision making. However, <b>excess</b> <b>caution</b> in decision making may also lead to better performance in specific situations where the cost of extended deliberation is small. We compared 16 juvenile OCD patients with 16 matched healthy controls whilst they performed a sequential information gathering task under different external cost conditions. We found that patients with OCD outperformed healthy controls, winning significantly more points. The groups also differed in the number of draws required prior to committing to a decision, but not in decision accuracy. A novel Bayesian computational model revealed that subjective sampling costs arose as a non-linear function of sampling, closely resembling an escalating urgency signal. Group difference in performance was best explained by a later emergence of these subjective costs in the OCD group, also evident in an increased decision threshold. Our findings present a novel computational model and suggest that enhanced information gathering in OCD can be accounted for by a higher decision threshold arising out of an altered perception of costs that, in some specific contexts, may be advantageous...|$|E

5|$|The Union's V Corps, {{commanded}} by Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, took up {{positions on the}} hill on June30. McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle, having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison's Landing, where he intended to locate the base for his army. Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps. Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder {{to be late for}} the battle, an <b>excess</b> of <b>caution</b> delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger, and Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson had problems collecting the Confederate artillery.|$|R
60|$|Though {{in no way}} {{remarkable}} for <b>excess</b> of <b>caution,</b> or for the possession of any extraordinary fund of worldly wisdom, Mr. Blyth frowned {{and shook his head}} suspiciously, while he listened to the curious narrative now addressed to him. As soon as it was concluded, he expressed the most decided disapprobation of the careless readiness with which Zack had allowed a perfect stranger to become intimate with him--reminding him that he had met his new acquaintance (of whom, by his own confession, he knew next to nothing) in a very disreputable place--and concluded by earnestly recommending him to break off all connection with so dangerous an associate, at the earliest possible opportunity.|$|R
2500|$|A casual {{listener}} {{might have}} believed from Bronston's answer {{that he himself}} had never had any Swiss bank accounts, he agreed. [...] "But we are not dealing with casual conversation and the statute {{does not make it}} a criminal act for a witness to willfully state any material matter that implies any material matter that he does not believe to be true" [...] since intent to mislead or evade might not be the underlying reason: [...] "Under the pressures and tensions of interrogation, {{it is not uncommon for}} the most earnest witnesses to give answers that are not entirely responsive. Sometimes the witness does not understand the question, or may in an <b>excess</b> of <b>caution</b> or apprehension read too much or too little into it." ...|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{following}} the western shore, whither their errand led them, the wary Mohican inclined his course more towards those hills behind which Montcalm {{was known to}} have led his army into the formidable fortress of Ticonderoga. As the Hurons, to every appearance, had abandoned the pursuit, there was no apparent reason for this <b>excess</b> of <b>caution.</b> It was, however, maintained for hours, until they had reached a bay, nigh the northern termination of the lake. Here the canoe was driven upon the beach, and the whole party landed. Hawkeye and Heyward ascended an adjacent bluff, where the former, after considering the expanse of water beneath him, pointed out to the latter a small black object, hovering under a headland, at the distance of several miles.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his early}} years, Powell {{seemed to have}} {{remained}} free of controversy. In 1739 he was appointed {{a member of the}} four-person St Helena Executive Council. Two years later, aged about 31, he married Sarah Frances. By this time, he had also positioned himself as a champion of anti-corruption on the island. But St Helena historian Thomas Brooke, an ex-Governor of the island, claimed that Powell deliberately ingratiated the directors of the East India Company by exposing fraud in order to gain a position from which be could perpetrate even worse <b>excesses.</b> However, <b>caution</b> should be exercised, as almost all the sources for the St Helena period are hostile to the Powell family, partly because all three generations had, at some stage, come into direct conflict with the Governing authorities of the island.|$|R
6000|$|... [692] [Sir George Prevost (1767-1816), the Governor-General of British North America, and {{nominally}} Commander-in-chief of the Army in {{the second}} American War, contributed, by his <b>excess</b> of <b>caution,</b> supineness, and delay, to the humiliation of the British forces. The particular allusion is to his alleged inaction at a critical moment in the engagement of September 11, 1814, between Commodore Macdonough and Captain Downie in Plattsburg Bay. [...] "A letter was sent to Capt. Downie, strongly urging him to come on, as the army had long been waiting for his co-operation.... The brave Downie replied that he required no urging to do his duty.... He {{was as good as}} his word. The guns were scaled when he got under way, upon hearing which Sir George issued an order for the troops to cook, instead of that of instant co-operation."--To Editor of the Montreal Herald, May 23, 1815, Letters of Veritas, 1815, pp. 116, 117.

50|$|In 2007, Autism Speaks {{completed}} its merger with Cure Autism Now (CAN). CAN {{was founded in}} 1995 by Jonathan Shestack and Portia Iversen, {{the parents of a}} child with autism whose story is told in the book Strange Son. It was an organization of parents, doctors and scientists devoted to research to prevent, treat and cure autism. Iversen and Shestack were invited to join NAAR's board but declined, impatient with what they considered NAAR's <b>excess</b> of <b>caution</b> in staying with the scientific establishment. In 1997, CAN established the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange; CAN was successful in establishing AGRE despite an initially negative reaction from scientists who were concerned whether CAN could carry out rigorous work, and despite what CAN considered to be scientists' reluctance to share their data. During its existence, Cure Autism Now provided more than $39 million for research grants and other programs. Its flagship programs included the AGRE, Autism Treatment Network, Clinical Trials Network, and Innovative Technology for Autism. It also funded education and outreach efforts.|$|R
60|$|Time had in {{no respect}} lessened Valentine's morbid {{anxiety about the}} strict {{concealment}} of every circumstance attending Mrs. Peckover's first connection with Madonna, and Madonna's mother. The years that had now passed and left him in undisputed possession of his adopted child, had not diminished that <b>excess</b> of <b>caution</b> in keeping secret all the little that was known of her early history, which had even impelled him to pledge Doctor and Mrs. Joyce never to mention in public any particulars of the narrative related at the Rectory. Still, he had not got over his first dread that she might one day be traced, claimed, and taken away from him, if that narrative, meagre as it was, should ever be trusted to other ears than those which had originally listened to it. Still, he kept the hair bracelet and the handkerchief {{that had belonged to}} her mother carefully locked up out of sight in his bureau; and still, he doubted Mrs. Peckover's discretion in the government of her tongue, as he had doubted it in the bygone days when the little girl was first established in his own home.|$|R
60|$|In this manner, hours {{passed by}} without further interruption. The moon reached the zenith, and shed its mild light perpendicularly on the lovely {{sight of the}} sisters slumbering peacefully in each other's arms. Duncan cast the wide shawl of Cora before a {{spectacle}} he so much loved to contemplate, and then suffered his own head to seek a pillow on the rock. David began to utter sounds that would have shocked his delicate organs in more wakeful moments; in short, all but Hawkeye and the Mohicans lost every idea of consciousness, in uncontrollable drowsiness. But the watchfulness of these vigilant protectors neither tired nor slumbered. Immovable as that rock, of which each appeared to form a part, they lay, with their eyes roving, without intermission, along the dark margin of trees that bounded the adjacent shores of the narrow stream. Not a sound escaped them; the most subtle examination could not have told they breathed. It was evident that this <b>excess</b> of <b>caution</b> proceeded from an experience that no subtlety {{on the part of}} their enemies could deceive. It was, however, continued without any apparent consequences, until the moon had set, and a pale streak above the tree-tops, at the bend of the river a little below, announced the approach of day.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{ozone monitoring}} {{data obtained from}} 50 European stations operated by the Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) and two stations maintained by the Austrian Environmental Agency. Data used in the analyses covered the summer period of the year 1990. The analysis explores first time series of ozone concentration and establishes simple statistical parameters such as maximum, average, daily variation and exceedance indices. It is shown that different indices rank high at different locations in Europe, stressing the importance of well-based information when establishing relationships to environmental impacts. Different characteristic exposure patterns are identified for Northern Europe, Central Europe and the UK. The analysis shows that at some stations also night time ozone concentration has a remarkable effect on cumulated <b>excess</b> ozone. Thus, <b>caution</b> should be exerted when excluding the nighttime values until more detailed data on the biological effects of nighttime high concentrations are obtained...|$|R
5000|$|Instead {{of writing}} an article, Boyd and Hoyt went to North Dakota to present McGovern and his {{campaign}} chairman Frank Mankiewicz with their evidence {{and give them}} a chance to respond. [...] "It was the only fair and decent thing to do," [...] Boyd later said. In return, McGovern [...] "double-crossed" [...] them, in the words of a colleague, James McCartney, by holding a press conference on July 25, 1972, at which Eagleton announced that he had been hospitalized three times for [...] "nervous exhaustion and fatigue" [...] and McGovern expressed confidence in Eagleton's current health. [...] "They said 'Sorry boys, we're going public,'" [...] Boyd later recalled. [...] "It was a frustrating thing for us." [...] By holding the press conference, Mankiewicz blew Boyd's and Hoyt's chances at an exclusive. On July 31, Eagleton withdrew. The incident raised [...] "critical journalistic questions: Had Boyd and Hoyt, in an <b>excess</b> of <b>caution,</b> tossed away a major exclusive by insisting on total confirmation, or had they been rigorously responsible? Was the tip...just another dirty trick by the Nixon crowd? Did that matter, because it turned out to be true? Was it better to have the revelation come against Eagleton the candidate rather than against Eagleton the vice-president? Was the journalistic responsibility to tell the news and let the public decide? Is that what happened?" [...] Although they had been deprived of their scoop, Boyd and Hoyt ended up winning the Pulitzer Prize for uncovering the facts about Eagleton's psychiatric history anyway. One account suggests that Boyd was rewarded at least in part for his [...] "touch of compassion," [...] that the Pulitzer board [...] "tipped its hat to him for his judicious restraint." [...] The prize was described by [...] "one Washington cynic" [...] as [...] "the first time anybody ever won a Pulitzer for a story they didn't write." ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis studies {{games with}} non-probabilistic {{uncertainty}} about some parameters {{that affect the}} rewards of the players. The goal is to understand whether players should be optimistic or pessimistic in such situations. The first chapter provides {{a brief overview of}} the standard solution concepts in Game Theory. The second chapter proposes a model where the players are strategic in choosing their attitude (degree of optimism), instead of having an intrinsic risk aversion. The idea is that Alice may be {{able to take advantage of}} Bob's pessimism, in which case Bob should not be pessimistic. The chapter presents a few examples of two-player non-cooperative games where the agents have a dominant attitude (e. g., optimism), regardless of the unknown private information of the opponent. The chapter also analyses a Cournot duopoly game where each firm has confidential knowledge of its production cost. In the symmetric case, it is shown that pessimism is never a dominant attitude. Finally, the chapter defines a robust attitude and the price of uncertainty, and analyzes them in the Cournot duopoly game. The third chapter studies a simple wireless network with two relay nodes that cooperate to forward information to a common destination. For a range of success probabilities, only the node with the largest success probability should relay packets to avoid collisions at the destination. However, the success probability of a node is known initially only to that node. To improve the performance of the network, the nodes exchange link state messages through a control channel that is not fully reliable. The chapter studies a protocol where each node tries to protect the performance against the worst possible choice of the other node. The performance of that protocol does not converge as the relays exchange more and more link state messages. Essentially, the relay nodes use an <b>excess</b> of <b>caution.</b> The chapter studies another protocol where each relay node ignores the possible states of knowledge of the other node. The throughput of this less cautious protocol converges to the maximum possible value...|$|R
