40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the bone tissue response at the interface of loaded and non-loaded implants {{used in an}} orthopedic anchorage system after a continuous, non-axial <b>force</b> <b>application</b> of 5 N over 2 months. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine Branemark System implants {{were placed in the}} Zygomatic arches of 5 dogs. After a healing period of 8 weeks, 20 implants (4 in each dog) were loaded during 8 weeks with a large non-axial orthopedic <b>force</b> <b>application</b> of 5 N. This force was directed between the implants and a maxillary splint to move the maxilla forward. Nine implants were not loaded during this period. At the termination of the experiment, all 29 implants were retrieved for radiographic as well as for histologic analysis. Computer-based histomorphometric quantifications were performed via light microscopy and computer software. Bone-metal contact (BMC), bone surface area (BSA) inside the threads, and the bone mirror area (BMA) of the implants were measured. Statistical comparisons between the loaded and non-loaded implants were carried out. In the group of loaded implants a 2 -factor analysis of variance was used. Results: There were no statistically significant differences found in BMC, BSA, and BMA between the loaded and non-loaded implants, both for all the threads and for only the cervical region of the implants. Nor were there statistically significant differences between the non-pressure and pressure sides or for different lengths of the loaded implants. Discussion: The loaded implants maintained the osseointegration achieved during the 8 -week healing period. Conclusions: The results {{of this study indicate that}} titanium implants can be used as anchorage for orthopedic <b>force</b> <b>application</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} analysis and design of a robotic and haptic system that applies arbitrary forces to the digits of the human finger for virtual <b>force</b> display <b>applications.</b> This <b>system</b> {{is based on the}} application of electromagnetic principles to couple the human hand with a robotic manipulator. Using this approach, forces are transmitted between the robot exoskeleton and the human without using mechanical attachments to the robot. A PUMA 560 manipulator is used to track the exoskeleton interface. The combined system allows for a large working volume, so that a more realistic virtual reality environment is implemented. The human environment working with a mechanical manipulator is modeled and the coupled stability is analyzed in terms of the driving point admittance.;The stability and performance limit of several different haptic interface types are compared. The human-machine interaction using electromagnetic field represents better performance from the stability point of view. The impedance of the human hand is estimated, and several possible haptic interactions are realized, and its basic elements are discussed. Typical synthetic environments with a NURBS based free-form deformation are programmed and tested using the ISU force reflecting exoskeleton system. The experimental results show that the electromagnetic interface gives adequate force levels for perception of virtual objects, enhancing the feeling of immersion in the synthetic environment...|$|R

40|$|Pericytes, {{the mural}} cells of blood capillaries, have an {{important}} role in the regulation of the blood flow through the capillaries. In many pathological conditions in the vascular network, pericytes are the main cause of a disease. They contain contractile proteins that are attached to fibronectin patches in a shared basement membrane with the capillary. Therefore, the pericyte is able to exert forces and regulate the vessel diameter. In our work, the main question was how the forces of pericytes relate in hypoxia and ischemia. We showed that pericytes in simulated hypoxia have a decrease in <b>force</b> <b>application</b> and an increase in cell spreading area compared to normal conditions. In simulated ischemia pericytes decrease their cell spreading area and have a slightly decreased <b>force</b> <b>application.</b> A second question we discussed is how the substrate stiffness plays a role in the <b>force</b> <b>application</b> in normal conditions. The gradient of <b>force</b> <b>application</b> for a range of substrate stiffnesses of 11. 6 to 137 kPa is dependent of the cell type. For fibroblasts the force and the cell spreading area increased with increasing substrate stiffness. However, pericytes show a high <b>force</b> <b>application</b> on low and high substrate stiffnesses and have a low <b>force</b> <b>application</b> on intermediate stiffnesses. In order to find the force that a cell exert, we used a model that mimiced the fibronectin patches in the basement membrane. Cells were seeded on micropillar arrays made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that were functionalized with fibronectin. The deflection of the pillars was used to calculate the force applied by the cell...|$|R

40|$|Aims: 1. To {{study the}} changes in human pulpal blood flow (PBF) during and after <b>application</b> of {{intrusive}} <b>force</b> for 4 minutes in right maxillary central using laser Doppler flowmeter. 2. To evaluate the effect on human pulpal blood flow after application of continuous orthodontic intrusive force for 72 hrs in right maxillary central incisor using laser Doppler flowmeter. Material and methods: Brief intrusive force application: Eight subjects (men; mean age = 19. 6 yrs) had an intrusive force applied to a maxillary central incisor through lever system. A cast chrome cobalt coping was fabricated to fit over the incisor and thus provided a reproducible point of <b>force</b> <b>application.</b> Each subject participated in six testing sessions (0 gm, 5 gm, 50 gm, 100 gm, 250 gm <b>force</b> <b>application</b> and local anesthetic application). During each session, PBF was measured by laser Doppler flowmeter, 4 mins baseline period, then 4 min <b>force</b> <b>application</b> and then continuously measures next 12 mins. The last session local anesthetic with vasoconstrictor (epinephrine 1 : 100, 000) was administrated {{in place of the}} <b>force</b> <b>application</b> to determine the ability of this experimental paradigm to detect reductions in PBF. Continuous orthodontic force application: Seven subjects (men, mean age = 19. 6 yrs) were selected and 2 OZ intrusive force applied to a maxillary central incisor using modified utility arch. PBF was measured before <b>application</b> of orthodontic <b>force</b> and after 72 hrs intrusive <b>force</b> <b>application</b> Results: There is no significant reduction in pulpal blood flow during and after the application of brief intrusive force for 4 mins.

All subjects performed a maximal exercise test on a wheelchair ergometer. Exercise bouts with an intensity of 30 to 50 % and 60 to 80 % of the maximal power output were analyzed. Effectiveness of <b>force</b> <b>application,</b> defined as the ratio of the effective force and the total force, was considerably lower in TP, compared with PP. Effectiveness of <b>force</b> <b>application</b> in the plane of the wheel was comparable between TP and PP. TP showed a significantly lower effectiveness of <b>force</b> <b>application</b> in the frontal plane and applied the forces in a more lateromedial direction to the hand rim. The ratio power output/energy expenditure, calculated as an indication of gross mechanical efficiency, was considerably lower in TP and was associated with the effectiveness of <b>force</b> <b>application</b> (r = 0. 64; P < 0. 01). Timing parameters showed that TP positioned their hands in a more backward position on the hand rim. Comparing the different intensity conditions revealed that force was applied more effectively, and the ratio power output/energy expenditure was higher at the higher intensity condition. Push time, relative to cycle time, increased, and beginning angle showed a forward shift with a higher load. TP tended to decrease, whereas PP showed a tendency for an increase in stroke angle with a higher load. The low effectiveness and different pattern of <b>force</b> <b>application</b> in TP should be taken into account when developing other wheelchair propelling mechanisms and training programs for this population...|$|R
