5|$|Thaïs (1894), {{composed}} for Sanderson, was moderately received. Like Werther, it did {{not gain}} widespread popularity among French opera-goers until its first revival, which was {{four years after the}} premiere, by when the composer's association with Sanderson was over. In the same year he had a modest success in Paris with the one-act Le portrait de Manon at the Opéra-Comique, and a much greater one in London with La Navarraise at Covent Garden. The Times commented that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> Massenet had adopted the verismo style of such works as Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana to great effect. The audience clamoured for the composer to acknowledge the applause, but Massenet, always a shy man, declined to take even a single curtain call.|$|E

25|$|Lassus {{is one of}} the composers of a style {{known as}} musica reservata—a term which has survived in many {{contemporary}} references, many of them seemingly contradictory. The exact meaning of the term is a matter of fierce debate, though a rough consensus among musicologists is that it involves intensely expressive setting of text and chromaticism, and that it may have referred to music specifically written for connoisseurs. A famous composition by Lassus representative of this style is his series of 12 motets entitled Prophetiae Sibyllarum, in a wildly chromatic idiom which anticipates the work of Gesualdo; some of the chord progressions <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> were not to be heard again until the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|This {{culminated in}} the {{dismissal}} and imprisonment on unsubstantiated charges of the Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, in 1997 after an internal dispute within the government. The complicity of the judiciary <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of persecution {{was seen as a}} particularly clear sign of the decline of Malaysian democracy. The Anwar affair {{led to the formation of}} a new party, the People's Justice Party, or Keadilan, led by Anwar’s wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. At the 1999 elections Keadilan formed a coalition with the DAP and the PAS known as the Alternative Front (Barisan Alternatif). The result of this was that the PAS won a number of Malay seats from UMNO, but many Chinese voters disapproved of this unnatural alliance with the Islamist PAS, causing the DAP to lose many of its seats to the MCA, including that of its veteran leader, Lim Kit Siang. Wan Azizah won her husband’s former constituency in Penang but otherwise Keadilan made little impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{large-scale}} St. Luke Passion (1963–66) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, {{not least}} because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Western audiences {{saw it as a}} snub to the Soviet authorities. Various different musical styles {{can be seen in the}} piece. The experimental textures, such as were seen in the Threnody, are balanced by the work's Baroque form and the occasional use of more traditional harmonic and melodic writing. Penderecki makes use of serialism <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece,</b> and one of the tone rows he uses includes the BACH motif, which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The Stabat Mater section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple chord of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.|$|E

500|$|The Magpie is {{an early}} example of Monet's {{investigation}} of colored shadows. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece,</b> Monet makes use of the complementary colors of blue and yellow. The shadow produced by yellow sunlight shining on the snow gives {{the impression of a}} blue-violet color, the effect of simultaneous contrast. French Impressionists popularized the use of colored shadows, which went against the artistic convention of portraying shadows by darkening and desaturating the color. Colored shadows can be directly observed in nature, particularly in the type of snow scene presented by Monet. In his study of Impressionism, art historian John Rewald observed that artists used snowscapes to [...] "investigate the problem of shadows". The problem is summarized by Fred S. Kleiner in Gardner's Art Through the Ages: ...|$|E
500|$|The seventh nocturne {{departs from}} the A–B–A form of Fauré's earlier nocturnes; in Pinkas's view is it {{constructed}} {{more like a}} ballade than a nocturne. It opens with a slow (molto lento) theme of harmonic ambiguity, followed by a second theme, equally ambiguous in key, though nominally in D major. The central section is in F major, and the re-emergence of the first theme brings the piece to a conclusion. Morrison finds <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> a sense of bleakness, and of the composer's struggle against despair. Pinkas, however, regards the work as a [...] "contrast between ambiguity and joy, ending in reassurance." [...] It is sometimes known as the [...] "English" [...] nocturne, having been composed while Fauré was staying in the UK, and being dedicated to the English pianist Adela Maddison.|$|E
500|$|Sibelius {{continued}} to make changes to {{the final version of}} the tone poem as he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the steamship SS Kaiser Wilhelm II and even during rehearsals in Norfolk, but these last-minute changes, Andrew Barnett argues, must have been relatively [...] "minor", as the orchestral parts had been copied before his departure from Finland. Sibelius was delighted with the new piece, writing to Aino, [...] "It's as though I have found myself, and more besides. The Fourth Symphony was the start. But <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> there is so much more. There are passages in it that drive me crazy. Such poetry". Neither the suite nor the Yale version of the tone poem was performed in Sibelius's lifetime, receiving their world premieres by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra on 19September and 24October 2002, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Many of Bush's best-known {{works were}} written in the {{immediate}} postwar years. [...] Anthony Payne described the Three Concert Studies for Piano Trio (Op. 31) of 1947 as exceeding Britten in its inventiveness, [...] "a high-water mark in Bush's mature art". [...] The Violin Concerto (Op. 32, 1948) has been cited as [...] "a work as beautiful and refined as any in the genre since Walton's". Foreman considers the concerto, which uses twelve-tone themes, to be the epitome of Bush's thematic theory of composition, although Bush's contemporary, Edmund Rubbra, thought it too intellectual for general audiences. The Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue for timpani, percussion and strings, (Op. 52, 1959), involves eight variations in the Dorian mode, followed by eight in other modes culminating in a final quadruple fugue in six parts. Musical Opinions critic praised the composer's [...] "wonderful control and splendid craftsmanship" [...] <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece,</b> and predicted that it could become {{the most popular of}} all Bush's orchestral works.|$|E
500|$|Dara Gellman, an {{independent}} Canadian video artist, used the kiss sequence in [...] "Rejoined" [...] {{as the basis}} of her 3-minute 1999 project alien kisses. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece,</b> the kiss scene is manipulated—the video is slowed, the image enlarged and digitized—and trance music is added. New media scholar Carolyn Guertin argues that this serves to make the footage [...] "even more alien", presenting queerness as [...] "unearthly". Jean Bruce argues that, despite the inherent ambiguity of the scene in the episode, [...] "the image is still one of two women kissing, which opens up the possibilities of queer desire on its own terms". Similarly, Guertin argues that Gellman translates the (not truly queer) scene into an [...] "expression of gay love that is alien and apart, but no less erotic for being so". In using the scene in isolation, alien kisses, Bruce argues, [...] "strips away the gender equivocation by imposing a new queer vision". She suggests that alien kisses works as an [...] "antidote" [...] to the [...] "ultimately tame treatment" [...] Star Trek has offered of queer themes, and as a [...] "suggestion" [...] that Star Trek acknowledge the desires of queer viewers and fans [...] "beyond the occasional titillating episode".|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} in trade publications, with Paul's garb being {{cited as the}} weakest aspect by two {{different}} reviewers. Walton of The Moving Picture News, praised the film as a success, but did not provide any details as to why it was successful. The Moving Picture World provided a detailed review which praised the adaptation of the novel and found the staging and the acting to be clear and strong. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was negative, criticizing the garb, tempest scene, [...] and describing the acting as lacking in feeling. The Nickelodeon, an uncommon source for Thanhouser reviews, was not fooled by Crane's outfit. The reviewer said, [...] "It is usually good advice to tell a man to 'keep his shirt on,' but we decidedly advise the actor who played the part of Paul <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> to take his shirt off {{the next time he}} essays the role of a child of nature whose costume consists principally of his own skin plus a few trimmings. Baggy underwear, where his skin ought to be, looks like the arch-fiend. ... The production was adequate up to the point of the tempest and shipwreck, which fell down deplorably. Better to have left it out all together. From here onward the photoplay adapters have departed from the original story, and maybe they were wise. Paul in his nude underwear would have spoiled Virginia's funeral." [...] The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Saëns was {{the first}} major French {{composer}} to write piano concertos. His First, in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second, in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works. The composer experimented with form <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece,</b> replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza. The scherzo second movement and presto finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work [...] "begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach". The Third Piano Concerto, in E (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines. The Fourth, in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos. According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns [...] "the Beethoven of France" [...] (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor. The work is known as the [...] "Egyptian" [...] concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor, and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems {{follow the}} model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the [...] "vulgar blatancy" [...] to which the earlier {{composer}} was prone. The most popular of the four is Danse macabre (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight. Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers. Le Rouet d'Omphale (1870) was composed soon after {{the horrors of the}} Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies. Rees rates Phaëton (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate. A critic {{at the time of the}} premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece [...] "the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre" [...] rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece. The last of the four symphonic poems, La jeunesse d'Hercule ("Hercules's Youth", 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful. In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration [...] "set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel".|$|E

500|$|Grossmith {{left the}} D'Oyly Carte company {{near the end}} of the {{original}} run of The Yeomen of the Guard on 17 August 1889 and resumed his career entertaining at the piano, which he continued to do for more than 15 years afterwards. Despite his dislike of travelling, he toured in Britain, Ireland, and, on five occasions, North America. [...] His drawing-room sketches included his own popular songs, such as [...] "See me Dance the Polka", [...] "The Happy Fatherland", [...] "The Polka and the Choir-boy", [...] "Thou of My Thou", [...] "The French Verbs", [...] "Go on Talking – Don't Mind Me", [...] "I Don't Mind Flies". [...] His new sketches during this period included Modern Music and Morals (1889), On Tour; or, Piano and I (1891), A Seaside Holiday (1892), Fashionable Music (1892) and Is Music a Failure? (1892). According to The Times, [...] "His genial satire was enjoyed even by those at whom its shafts were aimed." [...] When he toured Scotland in the autumn of 1890, Grossmith gave a command performance for Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle. He also composed the music for a three-act comic opera with a libretto by Gilbert, Haste to the Wedding (1892). [...] <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece,</b> his son George Grossmith Jr. made his stage debut. [...] Musically more challenging than any composition he had attempted before, this work was unsuccessful. [...] Later, however, Grossmith said that the experience of writing with Gilbert was one of the happiest of his life. In 1892–93 he toured North America (his second tour there), writing successful new sketches, [...] "How I Discovered America" [...] and [...] "Baby on the Shore" [...] (1893).|$|E
500|$|Greg Edmonson {{composed}} the musical {{score for the}} series. He stated that he wrote for the emotion of the moment. However, one reviewer averred that he also wrote for the characters, stating: [...] "Edmonson has developed a specialized collection of musical symbolism for the series". To help illustrate the collection, the reviewer gave key leitmotifs, or [...] "signatures", various names, noting that [...] "Serenity" [...] recalls {{the theme of the}} show and is used when they return to the ship, or when they were meeting clandestinely; it was [...] "the sound of their home". The slide guitar and fiddle used <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> are portable instruments which fit the lifestyle of the crew: [...] "the music they make calls up tunes played out in the open, by people who were hundreds of miles away yesterday. 'Serenity' conjures the nomadic lifestyle the crew leads and underlines the western aspect of the show." [...] Another emotional signature was [...] "Sad Violin". It was used {{at the end of the}} Battle of Serenity Valley, but also helped set up the joke for when Mal tells Simon that Kaylee is dead in the episode [...] "Serenity". The most memorable use of [...] "Sad Violin", however, is at the end of [...] "The Message", when the crew mourned the death of Tracey. This was also the last scene of the last episode the actors shot, and so this was seen by them, and Edmonson, as Firefly farewell. To denote impending danger, [...] "Peril" [...] was used, which is [...] "a low pulse, like a heartbeat, with deep chimes and low strings". The reviewer also noted character signatures. The criminal Niska has his own signature: Eastern European or Middle Eastern melodies over a low drone. Simon and River's signature was a piano played sparsely with a violin in the background. This is in contrast to the portable instruments of [...] "Serenity": the piano is an instrument that cannot be easily moved and evokes the image of [...] "the distant house and family they both long for". The various signatures were mostly established in the first pilot, [...] "Serenity", and helped enhance the narrative.|$|E
500|$|The The Moving Picture World {{reviewer}} {{found the}} subject to be too long, but did not find {{it to be a}} fault. The reviewer states, [...] "A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The mince pie episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated, [...] "To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story {{is the fact that the}} pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power.
