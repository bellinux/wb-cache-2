5000|$|Innocent III {{negotiated}} {{an agreement}} with the Republic of Venice, Europe's dominant sea power at the time, involving the construction of a fleet of warships and transports. The deal stipulated that about 35,000 crusaders would need transport and the Venetians would be paid 94,000 marks of silver, to be paid in installments. A council held at Soissons in June 1201 chose Boniface of Montferrat to lead the expedition. On the eve of the feast of Saint Martin, they arrived before Zara in Sclavonia and saw the city fortified with lofty walls and tall towers; you would have sought a finer, stronger, more impressive city in vain. And when the pilgrims saw it they were greatly astounded and said to one another, [...] "How could such a city be taken by force, unless god himself brought it about?" [...] Joinville and Villehardouin (Translated by Margaret Shaw), Chronicles of the Crusades The agreement between the Venetians and the crusaders had set the date for the arrival of the host in Venice before the end of April 1202, in order to provide for a departure in time for a summer crossing at the end of June. The crusade leaders had counted on raising the money still owed to the Venetians through the collection of passage money from the individual crusaders. However, the first crusader groups did not leave France until April and May, others straggled along throughout the summer and some of the French nobles chose to sail instead from Marseilles and other ports. Therefore, after the Venetians had suspended their regular commercial operations for a year to build and crew the ships, only about 12,000 crusaders showed up at Venice to man and pay for them. Boniface and the nobles added what money they could spare, and pledged their gold and silver plate to the Venetian moneylenders. Still the crusaders found themselves only able to pay 51,000 marks to the Venetians. In response, the Venetians indicated that they would accept the invasion of Zara (now Zadar, Croatia), a Catholic city on the coast of the Adriatic, as well as nearby Trieste, in lieu of payment for the time being; the crusaders were then to pay the rest owed to the Venetians out of their initial gains in the crusade. Zara had rebelled against the Venetian Republic in 1183, and placed itself under the <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> of the Papacy and King Emeric of Hungary (who had recently agreed to join the Crusade). Though a large group of crusaders found the scheme repulsive and refused to participate, the majority agreed (despite the written protests of Innocent III), citing it as necessary to attain the larger goal of taking Jerusalem.|$|E

50|$|Similar {{to other}} members of the pentraxin family PTX3 binds {{apoptotic}} cells, thereby inhibiting their recognition by DCs. Binding occurs late in the apoptotic process and enhances cytokine production by DCs. In addition, preincubation of apoptotic cells with PTX3 enhances C1q binding and C3 deposition on the cell surface, suggesting a role for PTX3 in the complement-mediated clearance of apoptotic cells. Moreover, in the presence of dying cells, PTX3 restricts the cross presentation of antigens derived from dying cells.

There was a need to study barriers that affects use of <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> methods among PLHIV Objective: To determine barriers of using <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> method of family planning and HIV prevention among people living with HIV in Kinondoni Municipality of Dar es salaam Methodology: A mixed cross sectional study was conducted from four randomly selected health facilities in which semi structured questioners were used to collect quantitative information. These were processed using SPSS and Chi-square test was used to determine association between use of <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> methods at last sexual intercourse and various independent variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to determine predictors for <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> use. Qualitative data was collected and analyzed to identify themes and subthemes with relevant quotes to explain how certain barriers affect use of the <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> method using the indepth interview synthesis matrix. Results: A total of 367 PLWHIV were interviewed, where by females accounted for majority (66 %.) in which 34. 6 % of the PLHIV reported use of <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> methods during their last sexual intercourse. The use was affected by level of knowledge on benefits for <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> methods, inadequate partner support, and HIV dislosure status, child desire and development of side effects. In multivariate analysis, level of knowledge on benefit of <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> methods (AOR 6, 95 % CI: 1. 5 - 16. 0), shared HIV status to spouse (AOR 5. 0, 95 % CI: 2. 9 - 11) and desire to have children (AOR 3. 0 95 % CI: 1. 77 - 72) were significant predictors of <b>dual</b> <b>protection</b> use in last sexual intercourse.
