Ethyl diazoacetate was prepared in a biphasic mixture comprising an aqueous solution of glycine <b>ethyl</b> ester, sodium <b>nitrite</b> and dichloromethane.

40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of the {{nitrosation}} of L-cysteine, L-cysteine methyl and ethyl esters, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and glutathione by isopropyl nitrite in acid solution at 25 C was undertaken. The thiols exhibited identical rate laws and in all cases the observed rate constant was reduced by added isopropyl alcohol. The results {{were found to be}} consistent with the mechanism in which a rapid reversible acid-catalysed hydrolysis of isopropyl nitrite occurs to give nitrous acid, which then in its protonated form effects nitrosation. The third-order rate constant for the nitrosation of the thiols by isopropyl nitrite and the equilibrium constant for the formation of isopropyl nitrite were found to be in good agreement with the literature values obtained by direct measurement. A similar kinetic {{study of the}} nitrosation of L-cysteine, L-cysteine methyl and ethyl esters, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, thioglycolic acid and glutathione by various alkyl nitrites, in water at 25 C, in the pH range 6 - 13 was undertaken. The pH dependence of the rate constant is consistent with a mechanism involving a direct nitrosation by alkyl nitrites with the thiolate anion (RS(^-)) of the thiol. A quantitative kinetic analysis yielded macroscopic and microscopic pKa values for RSH ionisation in good agreement with the literature values. One exception is L-cysteine where the microscopic, pKp, value (for NH(_ 2) RSH → NH(_ 2) RS(^-)) differs significantly from the literature value. In the case of simple alkyl <b>nitrites</b> (<b>ethyl,</b> isopropyl, isoamyl and t-butyl nitrites) steric effects appear to be the major influence in reactivity whereas electron-withdrawing substituents in the β-position greatly enhanced the rate constant. The results were found to satisfy Taft's equation and thus a correlation between structure and reactivity of the alkyl nitrites with the thiols was established. This work shows that at least in vitro a direct and rapid reaction occurs between alkyl nitrites and thiols at pH values likely to be encountered in vivo. This confirms that such reactions could occur in vivo and could be an important feature of the chain of events occurring during the vasodilatory action of alkyl nitrites. Finally a preliminary investigation of the reaction of glyceryl trinitrate with cysteine, in oxygen and oxygen-free nitrogen atmosphere, in the pH range 6 - 13 was undertaken. In this case no evidence was found for the formation of S-nitrosocysteine or nitric oxide from glyceryl trinitrate in {{the presence or absence of}} cysteine. Thus the results could not confirm the hypothesis that glyceryl trinitrate owes its vasodilatory action to the formation of the intermediate, S-nitrosocysteine, from the reaction of nitric oxide (formed from glyceryl trinitrate) and cysteine...|$|R

Rat femoral artery rings and gastric fundus strips dose-dependently relaxed upon exposure to nitrite:ethanol mixtures.

40|$|Background: It is {{well known}} that ethanol can cause {{significant}} morbidity and mortality, and much of the related toxic effects can be explained by its metabolic profile. Objective: This work performs a complete review of the metabolism of ethanol focusing on both major and minor metabolites. Method: An exhaustive literature search was carried out using textual and structural queries for ethanol and related known metabolizing enzymes and metabolites. Results: The main pathway of metabolism is catalyzed by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase, which exhibits multiple isoenzymes and genetic polymorphisms with clinical and forensic implications. Another two oxidative routes, the highly inducible CYP 2 E 1 system and peroxisomal catalase may acquire relevance under specific circumstances. In addition to oxidative metabolism, ethanol also originates minor metabolites such as ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate, ethyl phosphate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrite,</b> phosphatidylethanol and fatty acid ethyl esters.

40|$|International audienceThe {{isomerization}} process between ionized phenol and ionized cyclohexadienone is {{studied by}} performing ion/molecule reactions with several alkyl nitrites in a hexapole collision cell inserted in a six-sector mass spectrometer. The distinction between both isomeric species is readily achieved {{on the basis}} of the completely different reactivity patterns observed for them in subsequent reactions. When reacting with alkyl nitrite, ionized phenol undergoes two competitive reactions corresponding to the formal radical substitution of the hydroxylic hydrogen atom by respectively (i) the nitrosyl radical (m/z 123) and (ii) an alkoxyl radical (m/z 138 if alkyl=ethyl). Both reactions were theoretically demonstrated by density functional theory calculations [B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) +ZPE] to involve hydrogen-bridged radical cations as key intermediates. The ion/molecule reaction products detected starting from ionized cyclohexadienone as the mass-selected ions arise from *OAlkyl, *OH, and NO 2 * radical additions. The occurrence of a spontaneous ring-opening of cyclohexadienone radical ion into a distonic species is suggested to account for the observed ion/molecule reaction products. We also demonstrated that ionized cyclohexadienone is partly isomerized during a proton-transfer catalysis process into ionized phenol inside the Hcell with <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> as the base. The molecular ions of phenol generated in such conditions consecutively undergo reactions producing m/z 123 and 138 radical cations.

Because S-nitrosylation is a key pathway mediating many NO biological effects, treatment with inhaled ENO may better protect postnatal lung development from oxidative stress than NO. Objectives: To compare inhaled NO and ENO on hyperoxia-impaired postnatal lung development. Methods: We treated newborn rats beginning at birth to air or 95 % O 2 � 0. 2 – 20. 0 ppm ENO for 8 days, or to 10 ppm NO for 8 days. Pups treated with the optimum ENO dose, 10 ppm, and pups treated with 10 ppm NO were recovered in room air for 6 more days. Measurements and Main Results: ENO and NO partly prevented 95 % O 2 –induced airway neutrophil influx in lavage, but ENO had a greater effect than did NO in prevention of lung myeloperoxidase accumulation, and in expression of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant- 1. Treatment with 10 ppm ENO, but not NO, for 8 days followed by recovery in air for 6 days prevented 95 % O 2 – induced impairments of body weight, lung compliance, and alveolar development.

Although these systems simplify experimental manipulation and provide relatively {{large amounts of}} soluble protein, they do {{not account for the}} complexity of signal regulation from other factors or cell types present in the cell's native physiological environment. Here we describe the general analytical and informatic methodologies used for the global quantitation of specific sites of phosphorylation from clinically relevant matrices such as human tissue or biological fluids compatible from a variety of different experimental designs. As an exemplar application of the methodology, a quantitative analysis of lipopolysaccharide challenged and <b>ethyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> protected mouse lung tissue was performed. Phosphopeptide enrichments from 600 ug aliquots of trypsin digested homogenized mouse lung tissue from four unique treatment groups was accomplished using an optimized TiO 2 spin-column protocol and were subjected to triplicate 1 D-LC-MS/MS analysis on a Waters NanoAcquity UPLC coupled to a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL. Following accurate mass and retention time alignment across all LC-MS runs performed within Rosetta Elucidator, a robust mean normalization of precursor ion intensities was applied and area under the curve quantitative measurements were made for all precursor ions. Qualitative identifications were assigned to each precursor ion following Mascot searches against a mus musculus database appended with reverse entries and scoring thresholds were adjusted to yield a peptide 1 % FDR. Across all four treatment groups, a total of 778 phosphopeptides were qualitatively identified. Analytical plus TiO 2 enrichment variation of pre-digested bovine alpha-casein spiked into each sample prior to enrichment yielded a phosphopeptide intensity variation of < 20 % RSD across approximately three orders of magnitude. In summary, these data demonstrate an effective and straight-forward methodology to study global changes in phosphorylation directly from clinically relevant biological samples...|$|E
