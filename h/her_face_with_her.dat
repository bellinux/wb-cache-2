5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E
60|$|Tears {{rolled out}} of her little eyes as she spoke, and she covered <b>her</b> round <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> pocket-handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|Marie had <b>her</b> <b>face</b> covered <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} at this appeal, {{and began}} sobbing and using <b>her</b> smelling-bottle, <b>with</b> great vehemence.|$|R
60|$|Immediately the Princess {{released}} {{his hair and}} sank at his feet sobbing and trembling, while she covered <b>her</b> pretty <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands to hide her blushes and shame.|$|R
25|$|Unexpectedly, Renato arrives, and Amelia covers <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> veil {{before he}} can {{recognize}} her.

Riccardo leaves, making Renato promise to escort the veiled woman safely back to town, not asking her identity.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with {{formally}} dressed spectators {{entering a}} museum as a curator introduces [...] "a creature so rare {{it was believed}} to be extinct. In captivity for the first time, the rarest creature on Earth, Avis Cyrus. White curtains are pulled down to reveal Cyrus, dressed in a black leotard and expansive black CGI wings, asleep in a giant bird nest locked inside a giant cage. Cyrus rises and approaches the audience, but a camera flash startles her and causes her to shield <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> wings. The music starts, and Cyrus unveils herself again and joins a large group of feathered dancers. As Cyrus sings, she and the dancers escape the cage and prowl the museum, shattering museum exhibits as they pass them. They perform provocative dances both inside the cage and in darkened museum halls. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus lying down, dressed in a silver corset attached to a bed of peacock feathers, or writhing alone in her nest in the cage. The video ends with Cyrus back in her cage and the museum empty and trashed.|$|E
500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with a smile to give her a little time.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1997, Graner's {{wife and}} mother of their two {{children}} filed for divorce and sought a protection order, saying Graner had threatened to kill her. A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner {{had come to her}} house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had [...] "yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging me and all the covers into the hall and tried to throw me down the steps." [...] Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean's and allegedly said, [...] "I have nothing if she's not my wife, she's dead." [...] Graner admitted the attack and a third order of protection was granted.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] she said, lifting <b>her</b> hand, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{laughing}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> peculiar, blind, almost dazzling laugh. She {{wondered what}} he was doing, when he stooped and kissed her. He should be shaking hands and going.|$|R

60|$|Roger {{followed}} Malinche {{into her}} room. Amenche was lying, without a vestige of color on <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes closed and}} her breathing so faint that Roger, {{as he looked at}} her, thought that she was dead.|$|R
60|$|RUMMY [running indignantly {{to him to}} scold him]. Oh, you great brute-- [He {{instantly}} {{swings his}} left hand back against <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She screams and reels back to the trough, where she sits down, covering <b>her</b> bruised <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands and rocking and moaning with pain].|$|R

6000|$|She was {{covering}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> both <b>her</b> hands, and the hawk, {{with a young}} rabbit in its claws, was sailing up again. It looked so beautiful {{that he did not}} somehow feel sorry for the rabbit; but he wanted to stroke and comfort her, and said: ...|$|R
