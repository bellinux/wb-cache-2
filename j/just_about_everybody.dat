"The key to {{understanding}} Smith," [...] Johnson wrote, [...] "was that, like other white Rhodesians, he clung to an almost Victorian {{view of the world}} both in moral values and in the easy assumptions of British primacy that characterised the empire." [...] Bill Schwarz took a similar line, writing that Smith and his supporters reacted to the British Empire's demise by imagining white Rhodesians to be [...] "the final survivors of a lost civilisation", charged with [...] "tak on the mantle of historic Britain" [...] in the imperial power's absence. [...] "He spoke endlessly about how Rhodesians had been more British than the British," [...] Boynton reflected, [...] "and how this small community of decent, fair-minded whites had been betrayed by, well, <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> he could think of... It was easy to mock Ian Smith, but he was right—both about the betrayals and about the quality of most African politicians". Smith's [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] quote dominated his obituaries, a development that Peter Godwin, despite his critical stance regarding Smith and his policies, considered [...] "unfair and inaccurate": [...] "Over the years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free-floating clip that has now become his epitaph... But there is more than enough for which to quite legitimately criticise Smith, without resorting to fabrication." ...|$|E
500|$|To promote Me Estoy Enamorando, Fernández {{launched}} his first solo tour performing in Argentina, Central America, Mexico, and the US. He also {{performed at the}} 1998 Viña del Mar festival in Chile. His set list consisted of rancheras from his past recordings, several tracks from Me Estoy Enamorando, and a Spanish-language rendition of Frank Sinatra's [...] "My Way". Fernández {{was accompanied by a}} 15-piece mariachi band for his ranchera performances. Reviewing his concert at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, California, Los Angeles Times editor Ernesto Lechner felt that Fernández [...] "seemed to suffer from the same malady that affects most modern Mexican pop stars", citing [...] "Si Tú Supieras" [...] and [...] "No Sé Olvidar" [...] as [...] "unnervingly soulless". Alejandro Riera of the Chicago Tribune commented that Fernández has [...] "one mean set of pipes" [...] and [...] "used that voice to successfully seduce <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everybody</b> in his mostly female audience". Riera also noted that unlike his father, Vicente, who sings [...] "the tequila-drenched songs of unrequited love", Alejandro [...] "praises the power that women hold over men. He sees them as superior beings even when he takes on the persona of the disdained lover." [...] Laura Emerick wrote a mixed review of his performance at the Rosement Theatre. She felt that even though Fernández is focused on being independent from his father, [...] "young Alejandro remains a pony, not a stylistic stallion like his father. He lacks the vocal finesse and stage presence that make Vicente such a galvanizing force." [...] She observed that the mariachi band [...] "looked bored". Emerick however praised his ranchera tunes.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2005, the College Libertarians at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro {{staged a}} protest outside the University's {{designated}} protest zones. The specific {{intent of the}} protest was to provoke just such a charge, in order to [...] "provoke the system into action into a critical review of what's going on." [...] Two students, Allison Jaynes and Robert Sinnott, were brought up on charges under the student code of conduct of [...] "violation of respect", for refusing to move when told {{to do so by}} a university official.

Numerous anecdotes surround his name, including engaging in a fist fight with another journalist during a live television program.

2500|$|Though Erik distrusted {{the nobility}} as a whole, he became {{particularly}} suspicious of Nils Svantesson Sture, {{who was arrested}} and tried. Despite his many illegitimate children, Erik lacked a legal heir and feared that Sture might claim his throne. The Stures were a very influential family, and Erik projected an astrological reading on Nils Sture saying {{that he would be}} succeeded by a [...] "light-haired man". According to Peterson (2007),"the strain of war, paranoia toward <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everybody,</b> especially the aristocracy, personal and national pressures to provide an heir, and his own mercurial personality were steadily crowding Erik to the edge of mental collapse. His frustrations and anxieties gradually began to center on one person."On the basis of unsubstantiated charges like [...] "neglect of duty," [...] Nils Sture was sentenced to death, but the verdict was commuted to a humiliating drive through the streets of the capital: on 15 June 1566, he had to ride through Stockholm on a wretched hack wearing a crown of straw, with some of his wounds suffered from prior torture still bleeding. Thereafter, Erik sent Nils Sture to Lorraine, where he was to arrange the marriage of princess Renata to Erik (which would never materialize).|$|E

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, who gave the album four out of five stars, called it [...] "easily ranks among her best" [...] and complimented the musical diversity [...] "Houston has never been quite so subtle before, nor has she ever shown this desire to branch out musically." [...] But he also wasn't positive for adult contemporary ballads of the album, stating [...] "In fact, the songs that feel the stiffest are the big production numbers; tellingly, they're the songs that are the most reminiscent of old-school Houston."
