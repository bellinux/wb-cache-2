5|$|The {{only time}} the Red Line shared tracks with another line was from January 27, 1997 to September 17, 1999, when the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> Commuter Shortcut used Red Line tracks from Brookland–CUA to Farragut North. A short {{time after the}} <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> branch north of Fort Totten opened in the early 1990s, the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> Commuter Shortcut began as a six-month experiment. Passengers could board the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> between Greenbelt and West Hyattsville and travel as far as Farragut North without having to transfer; the trains {{bypassed}} Fort Totten via a single-track spur between the West Hyattsville and Brookland–CUA stations. Due to its success, the shortcut continued until the mid-city portion of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was completed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was completed.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> near Berwyn Heights, Maryland {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} Lake Artemesia. In 1976, WMATA removed sand and gravel needed for construction from open space adjacent to the <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> In exchange, WMATA paid to develop the area as a lake surrounded by a park.|$|E

5|$|Funding {{troubles}} delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials {{worried that}} high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds {{to complete the}} <b>Green</b> <b>Line,</b> forcing Maryland to pay these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation had created a $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget. By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> be sped up.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Metro {{undertook}} {{two steps}} to secure {{completion of the}} <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> First, the transit agency hired former U.S. Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr. in December 1983 to oversee negotiations with the various entities involved with the siting of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> route and seek a resolution through the U.S. district court. On February 21, 1984, Prince George's County Executive Parris Glendening announced that construction of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> in Prince George's must start by September 30, 1984, or he would begin vetoing Metro spending proposals. At the same time, Metro and Coleman opened negotiations to build the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> from the L'Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia. Advocates of the Rosecroft route, however, warned that they would sue if Metro switched {{back to the original}} route.|$|E

5|$|Service on the Yellow Line {{began on}} April 30, 1983, adding Archives {{to the system}} and linking the two already-built {{stations}} of Gallery Place and Pentagon with a bridge across the Potomac River. It was extended beyond National Airport by four stations to Huntington on December 17, 1983, the first station outside of the Capital Beltway. When the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> link to U Street opened on May 11, 1991, it acted {{as an extension of}} the Yellow Line until the southern <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> branch was completed. When <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> service began, the Yellow Line was truncated at Mount Vernon Square, where a pocket track exists to relay trains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> {{is one of}} the six heavy rail subway {{lines that}} make up the Washington Metro rapid transit system in the Washington, D.C., {{metropolitan}} area. The <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> consists of 21 stations, with termini at Branch Avenue and at Greenbelt. The <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> runs through Prince George's County, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. It was the last line in the original Metrorail plan to be constructed, and is one of three north–south lines through the city of Washington. It shares nine stations with the Yellow Line, one station with the Blue, Silver and Orange lines, and two stations with the Red Line.|$|E
5|$|The first WMATA budget which {{contained}} funds for operating the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was proposed in December 1989. The budget presumed a December 1, 1990, opening for the Mt. Vernon Square, Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations, and requested funds {{to test the}} soon-to-open <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> from Gallery Place–Chinatown to the Anacostia Station. The budget also projected that the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> from Gallery Place–Chinatown to the Anacostia Station would open in 1991, and that new Metrobus service will be added in Prince George's County to bring commuters to the new station.|$|E

5|$|Funding for {{construction}} of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was threatening to cut WMATA's funding by up to 26 percent to $184.5 {{million a year for}} four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the Reagan administration said that it would cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but administration officials said WMATA had more than enough money to complete the <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> Prince George's County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for defaults, and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, Reagan administration officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.|$|E

5|$|Funding {{problems}} delayed construction even further. In February 1982, President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting Metro construction funds by 21.4 {{percent to}} just $295 million a year. Planned <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> construction constituted 40.5 percent of Metro's construction budget, and the cuts threatened {{to cancel the}} entire <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> To African American community leaders, the cuts were evidence that Metrorail was meant for suburban white commuters while inner city African Americans were relegated to taking Metrobus. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia Station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard Station. But on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money {{on the construction of}} the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> Judge Ramsey held that Metro had decided to shift the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> route without properly advertising the public hearings, which the transit system would now be required to hold (delaying construction of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> and Anacostia Station by at least a year). Although Metro had advertised the hearings, Judge Ramsey said, the advertisements contained the same wording flaws that had precipitated the Maryland lawsuit. Metro subsequently scheduled new hearings for June 1982.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 Metro began {{studying}} {{the needs of}} the system through 2040. New Metro rail lines and extensions under consideration as part of this long term plan include: a new line which parallels the Capital Beltway; a new line from the Friendship Heights Metro station to White Oak, Maryland, which would pass through the District and Silver Spring; an extension of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> to National Harbor in Maryland; and re-routing the Blue Line in the District between the Orange Line and <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> None of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction.|$|E

5|$|In December 1978, Metro {{announced}} that the new completion date of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> past the Anacostia Station to Rosecroft Raceway would be 1987 (a year later than anticipated). Metro also {{announced that}} cost considerations had forced it to abandon the high-vault ceiling design for all unbuilt stations (except Navy Yard), and that a less-costly design would be used at all unbuilt <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> stations. By July 1979, despite the release {{of billions of dollars}} in construction funds by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Metro had pushed back the construction of the Anacostia Station to mid-1985 and the completion of the Branch Avenue Line to late 1986. But construction schedules continued to slip: despite reaffirming its construction schedules in December 1979, Metro announced in January 1980 that completion of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> terminus in Prince George's County would be pushed back six more months to 1987.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for rapid}} transit {{prior to the}} {{creation}} of WMATA in February 1967 focused on the needs of commuters while neglecting some of the District's less affluent neighborhoods. However, by late 1966, some plans started to include a line along 7th Street in the District of Columbia. The new line was included in WMATA's master plan for its proposed then-101-mile system in 1968. At that time, a <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was planned to pass through some of the area's poorest and most transit-dependent neighborhoods and provide them with subway service. Riots following the death of Martin Luther King in 1968 destroyed much of the commercial district around 14th and U Streets and planners hoped that adding a subway stop in that area would stimulate redevelopment. The original 1969 plan called for a line under 13th Street NW with just two stations. However, in 1970, the District of Columbia Council agreed to pay an additional $3 million to add a third station and reroute the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> under U Street, and then 14th Street NW. Instead of opening in 1976, the first <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> stations opened in 1991. The southern part of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was originally to pass over the 11th Street Bridges to the intersection of Good Hope Road SE and Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE, follow Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE to Suitland Parkway, down Suitland Parkway to Branch Avenue SE, and down Branch Avenue to a terminus at the intersection of Branch Avenue and the Capital Beltway. Public hearings on whether to build a <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> and the route it should take were completed in 1973, and portions of the <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> was originally scheduled to open in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The December 2000 {{opening of}} the final five <b>Green</b> <b>Line</b> {{stations}} (Branch Avenue, Suitland, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Congress Heights) significantly worsened overcrowding and service problems on the <b>Green</b> <b>Line.</b> The five new stations added almost 20,000 new riders a day, overwhelming station platforms, jamming trains to capacity, and forcing many riders at Anacostia and other stations up the line to wait as train after train passed them filled. Metro had estimated that 18,000 riders a day would board from these stations by June 2001. That estimate was exceeded by 2,000 riders {{a day on the}} second day the stations were open.|$|E
