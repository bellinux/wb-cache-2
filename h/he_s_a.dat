"nAddi t ion of aut ologous serum from HE Ag c a r r iers t o s t heir l ymphocyt e s reduced the numbe r of detectabl e cells in HE Ag carriers.

Our studies demonstrated a failur e o f CMI among HB Ags car r i ers detected by the l e ukocyte migr ation i nhibition (LMI) test. This failure cannot be attributed to the presence of HE Ag-AB complexes in their serum. It is s possible that specific failure of CMI allows the hepatitis B virus to remain harmless in carriers a Hepatitis B surface-antigen (HE Ag); Hepatitis Bs coreantigen (HE Ag) and Hepatitis Be-antigen (HE Ag), c e have been established as indicating ineffectivity in viral hepatitis B ({I, 6, 20, 28). "nA number of infected individuals also developed clini cal evidence of disease and HE Ag may s the serum of some subjects for a long rema&bull;ln present I&bull;n time (18).

In contrast, other workers report a normal respons e t o PHA in healthy carriers of HE Ag and s they concludE that the defective T-cell response is relat ed to the live!' disease rather than the immune system (31). Dudley et al (8) have suggested that liver damage occurring after hepatitis B infection, may be an effect of thymus-dependent lymphocytes (12). "nA variety of in-vitro tests have been employed to demonstrate the status of cellular immunity (30, 35). Amongst these the inhibition of leukocyte migration by different specific and non-specific antigens appears to be a sensitive and convenient procedure (37). Leukocyte Inhibitory Factor (LIF) production {{in the presence of the}} virus itself has already been demonstrated Ill). In a preliminary study lto et al.

"nThe prevalence of HBsAg among some 200, 000 voluntary blood donors in Iran was found to be 3. 5 %(10).
