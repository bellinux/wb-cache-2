After {{stealing}} a car from the motel parking lot, Madonna picks up an old woman to accompany her in her drive around the city, and it quickly changes from there. Madonna rams her Camaro into a car full of young men who were looking at her suggestively. From here, she tasers a man at an automated teller machine (ATM) and takes his money (which she later stuffs into a waitress's pocket), and scrapes a police car with her car as two doltish cops look on. She then pulls a realistic-looking water gun on two police officers, and sprays them with water before driving backwards into their car to explode their airbags. After mowing down some roller-hockey players in a parking lot, she steals another car and blows up a gas station, all while still accompanied by the old woman. Finally, Madonna slams her stolen car into a cement pole in an apparent act of murder–suicide. In the final moments of the video, we see the old woman and Madonna putting on protective body gear (shin braces and a body vest, respectively). Although having a vision of violence, [...] "Madonna's violent acts in the video are either shown from a distance or take place off screen, and although ideas and events are clearly indicated, nothing graphic or gratuitous appears," [...] as noted by Miller.|$|E
