2500|$|Like {{the home}} {{mortgage}} <b>interest</b> <b>deduction,</b> charitable giving receives preferential treatment under current tax law allowing individuals to deduct the donation, to certain charities, from taxable income. Someone paying a 25% {{income tax rate}} would receive $250 back from the government for a $1,000 donation. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the deduction for full benefit, this encourages households to donate more of their income to charity than would otherwise be the case. As the FairTax would only tax new retail purchases, donations to charity would be made with untaxed income (comparable to a deduction on both income and payroll taxes). [...] The FairTax would also remove the prohibition of political speech by non-profits, therefore removing the threat to non-profit status. Taxable property and services purchased by a qualified non-profit or religious organization 'for business purposes' would not be taxable.|$|E
2500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} basic interest rate {{as determined by the}} Federal Reserve. The interest above the basic rate applied by the lender is a financial intermediation service and is subject to the FairTax (on a typical home mortgage only about one-half of one percent of interest would be subject to tax). Several economic studies have estimated that switching from an income tax system to a consumption tax system such as the FairTax would result in an interest rate drop of approximately 25%. These changes would result in a decreased cost for home buyers. [...] As a comparison to the FairTax for encouraging home ownership, the current tax system would have to allow all taxpayers to fully deduct the purchase of used property against income and payroll taxes, expand the mortgage <b>interest</b> <b>deduction</b> so that it permits a deduction against payroll taxes, fully untax interest income to lenders and institutions, and fully untax returns on savings. [...] However, since several areas would be tax free under the FairTax plan, it could decrease the social incentive to spend more on homes in favor of savings, education, or other investments.|$|E

40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} through <b>interest</b> <b>deductions</b> {{has been}} highlighted internationally as {{a concern with}} the effect of eroding tax revenues of countries, including South Africa (SA). The evident cause of this concern is what is termed base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) mainly orchestrated by multinational companies using aggressive tax planning schemes. Although the concern continues to exist, comprehensive measures are in place in SA such as the anti-avoidance rules and exchange control regulations to mitigate the concern. The study was undertaken to analyse the legislation on <b>interest</b> <b>deductions</b> {{in terms of the}} Income Tax Act No 58 of 1962 (‘the Act’) with particular focus on anti-avoidance. A number of issues pertaining to the operation of the provisions in the Act; administrative challenges as well the possible exploitation of loopholes within the provisions were identified. Furthermore, a comparative analysis conducted against Australia and the United Kingdom indicated that the measures adopted in SA are relatively similar, if not ahead. The effect the anti-avoidance measures have on the economic growth was considered. The results were positive in that the measures do not counteract the pursuit of economic growth. Lastly, the study assessed the position of SA against the internationally recommended best practice on the subject matter and it became evident that opportunities exist to improve the current measures applied in SA to mitigate the BEPS risks through <b>interest</b> <b>deductions...</b>|$|R

50|$|Housing {{subsidies}} are government {{financial assistance to}} help provide housing. The largest housing subsidy in the US is the home mortgage <b>interest</b> <b>deduction,</b> which allows homeowners with mortgages on first homes, second homes, and even boats with bathrooms to lower their taxes owed. The cost {{to the federal government}} of the mortgage interest deductions in 2012 was approximately $110 billion. Some states also have the mortgage <b>interest</b> <b>deduction</b> provision. The majority of the home mortgage <b>interest</b> <b>deduction</b> goes to the top 5% income earners in the United States. Some housing {{subsidies are}} also provided to low income tenants in renting housing. These subsidies are often defined by whether the subsidy is given to the landlord and then criteria are set for the tenants they can lease to or whether the subsidy is given to the tenant, typically as a voucher, and they are allowed to find suitable private housing. The subsidy amount is typically based on the tenant's income, usually the difference between the rent and 30% of the tenant's gross income, but other formulas have been used.|$|E

40|$|In {{passing the}} Tax Reform Act of 1986, policymakers wanted {{to ensure that}} {{corporations}} would {{pay their fair share}} of tax. Congress broadened the corporate tax base, rescinded the investment tax credit, and instituted a new minimum tax. The issue of adequate tax payments has not gone away, however, because corporations have been taking larger <b>interest</b> <b>deductions</b> as a result of having substituted debt for equity on their balance sheets.; This study begins by measuring the aggregate tax consequences of corporate leverage decisions. It also examines the tax implications of recent transactions in which corporations effectively increased their leverage, not by changing their financing of new investment projects, but by reducing their outstanding net worth. The author argues that policymakers concerned with stemming further revenue losses should look to responses other than outlawing certain controversial forms of restructuring or restricting <b>interest</b> <b>deductions</b> that appear to be excessive. At most, they should consider altering tax laws to provide more neutral treatment of income from debt and equity capital. Financial leverage; Taxation; Corporations - Finance...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86), the {{interest}} on all personal loans (including credit card debt) was deductible. TRA86 eliminated that broad deduction, but created the narrower home mortgage <b>interest</b> <b>deduction</b> under the theory that it would encourage home ownership. [...] A New York Times article notes that, in 1913, when interest deductions started, Congress [...] "certainly wasn't thinking of the <b>interest</b> <b>deduction</b> as a stepping-stone to middle-class home ownership, because the tax excluded the first $3,000 (or for married couples, $4,000) of income; less than 1 {{percent of the population}} earned more than that;" [...] moreover, during that era, most people who purchased homes paid upfront rather than taking out a mortgage. Rather, the reason for the deduction was that in a nation of small proprietors, it was more difficult to separate business and personal expenses, and so it was simpler to just allow deduction of all interest.|$|E
