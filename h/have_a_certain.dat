According to a survey ordered by the European commission in 2005, 49% of Croatians speak English as their second language, 34% speak German, and 14% speak Italian. French and Russian are spoken by 4% each, and 2% of Croatians speak Spanish.

According to a survey ordered by the European Commission in 2005, 49% of Croatians speak English as the second language, 34% speak German, and 14% speak Italian. French and Russian are spoken by 4% each, and 2% of Croatians speak Spanish. However, there are large municipalities that have minority languages that include substantial populations that speak these languages.

The country is a part of various language-based international associations most notably, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the European Union Language Association.|$|E
5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> item used on them. They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.|$|E

The Roman Catholic Church (both Latin and Eastern Catholic), the Orthodox Churches and the Anglican Communion all have provinces. These provinces are led by a metropolitan archbishop.|$|E
25|$|Transfusion-associated volume {{overload}} is {{a common}} complication simply {{due to the fact}} that blood products <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> amount of volume. This is especially the case in recipients with underlying cardiac or kidney disease. Red cell transfusions can lead to volume overload when they must be repeated due to insufficient efficacy (see above). Plasma transfusion is especially prone to causing volume overload due to its hypertonicity.|$|E

Beckett’s plays often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
25|$|As another example, {{mathematical}} finance will derive {{and extend}} the mathematical or numerical models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> share price, a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use stochastic calculus to obtain the corresponding value of derivatives of the stock (see: Valuation of options; Financial modeling).|$|E
25|$|Some {{algorithms}} do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> {{desired effect}} on the cube (for example, swapping two corners) but may also have the side-effect of changing {{other parts of the}} cube (such as permuting some edges). Such algorithms are often simpler than the ones without side-effects, and are employed early on in the solution when most of the puzzle has not yet been solved and the side-effects are not important. Most are long and difficult to memorise. Towards the end of the solution, the more specific (and usually more complicated) algorithms are used instead.|$|E

25|$|The D {{function}} genes {{were discovered}} in 1995. These genes are MADS-box proteins {{and they have a}} function that is distinct from those previously described, although they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> homology with C function genes. These genes are called FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN7 (FBP7) and FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN1L (FBP1l). It was found that, in Petunia, they are involved {{in the development of the}} ovule. Equivalent genes were later found in Arabidopsis, where they are also involved in controlling the development of carpels and the ovule and even with structures related to seed dispersal.|$|E

25|$|Mental events <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> {{subjective}} {{quality to}} them, whereas physical seem not to. So, for example, one may ask what a burned finger feels like, {{or what the}} blueness of the sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like. Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events qualia. There is something that it's like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events. And the claim is that qualia cannot be reduced to anything physical.|$|E

25|$|Weber (1948, p.214) {{gives the}} analogy that “the fully {{developed}} bureaucratic mechanism compares with other organizations exactly {{as does the}} machine compare with the non-mechanical modes of production. Precision, speed, unambiguity, … strict subordination, reduction of friction and of material and personal costs- these are raised to the optimum point in the strictly bureaucratic administration.” Bureaucratic structures <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> degree of standardization. They are better suited for more complex or larger scale organizations, usually adopting a tall structure. The tension between bureaucratic structures and non-bureaucratic is echoed in Burns and Stalker's distinction between mechanistic and organic structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{images in}} the panels are mostly Vaishnava in faith and they are {{attributed}} to two well known Hoysala sculptors, Baichoja and Mallitamma. There are a few images of the god Shiva {{in the form of}} Bhairava along with his consort Bhairavi. Baichoja's sculptures are {{on the south side of}} the temple and according to Foekema, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> peace and dignity about them. Mallitamma's sculptures are on the north side. According to him, while they are not as fine, they are lively and have greater variety. The three shrines contain the images of Venugopala, Keshava and Lakshminarasimha, all avatars of Vishnu.|$|E
25|$|Both Conway's and Jensen's {{versions}} of the transfer-matrix method involve {{counting the number of}} polyominoes that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> width. Computing the number for all widths gives the total number of polyominoes. The basic idea behind the method is that possible beginning rows are considered, and then to determine the minimum number of squares needed to complete the polyomino of the given width. Combined with the use of generating functions, this technique is able to count many polyominoes at once, thus enabling it to run many times faster than methods that have to generate every polyomino.|$|E
