Calculations show that electron mobility in irradiated samples is limited by triply charged donor defects. Subsequent thermal annealing removes {{a fraction of the}} defects, decreasing the electron concentration. There is a large increase in electron mobility upon annealing; the mobilities approach those of the as-grown films, which have 10 to 100 times smaller <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Spatial ordering of the triply charged defects is suggested to cause the unusual increase in electron mobility...|$|E

40|$|We have {{calculated}} the electron mobilities in GaN and InN {{taking into consideration}} scattering by short range potentials, {{in addition to all}} standard scattering mechanisms. These potentials are produced by the native defects which are responsible for the high <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> in nominally undoped nitrides. Comparison of the calculated mobilities with experimental data shows that scattering by short range potentials is the dominant mechanism limiting the electron mobilities in unintentionally doped nitrides with large <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations.</b> In the case of Al{sub x}Ga{sub 1 -x}N alloys, the reduction in the electron concentration due to the upward shift of the conduction band relative to the native defect level can account for the experimentally measured mobilities.

30|$|According to the ABC model, light-output {{power is}} {{proportional}} to Bn 2 (or √(Light-output power) ∝ n).

With the current density increasing, the n ratios of LED II and LED III versus LED I increase and saturate at fixed values at 1.04 and 0.64, respectively. The highest total effective <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> in the LED II results in the largest light-output power at the high current density, which indicates that using appropriate indium concentration in the quantum barriers, the reduced carrier confinement will decrease the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> restricted in the quantum wells near the n-GaN layer, and increase the total effective <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> in the MQWs.|$|R

At similar <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations,</b> the atomic Te concentration, as determined by secondary ion mass spectroscopy, is more than 2 times higher in n-GaSb compared to n-GaInAsSb. In addition, the electron mobility is lower in n-GaSb than n-GaInAsSb at similar <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The electron concentration saturates at about 1. 3 x 10 {sup 18 } cm{sup - 3 } for n-GaSb, but linearly increases for n-GaInAsSb. Pd/Ge/Au/Pt/Au metallization was studied for ohmic contacts. A specific contact resistivity of 1 x 10 {sup - 5 }{Omega}-cm{sup 2 } for n-GaSb was measured.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{effects on}} the N-h profile of an equatorwards neutral wind {{and a decrease in}} the O N 2 concentration ratio of the neutral atmosphere at F-region heights are such as to leave the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> at a particular height below the peak of the F-layer unchanged. Above this height the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> increases and below it the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> decreases. This transition phenomenon is observed on experimentally obtained N-h profiles at Brisbane (27 °S, 153 °E) during magnetic storms and is assumed to indicate the presence of the negative mechanisms when the maximum <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> of the F-layer is above normal.

30|$|Our {{modeling}} [1] {{has shown}} that at the liquid nitrogen temperature, high electron mobility can be obtained at high <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> in the well, which enhances 2 DEG screening and decreases hole concentration. Such an increase of the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> could be achieved by delta-doping of barriers or by applying the top-gate bias voltage. Growth of the mobility {{with the increase of}} the quantum well composition x could be explained by a lower concentration of heavy holes at the same value of the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration.</b> Since the concentration of holes in QW is often higher than 1015  cm− 3, the fabrication of high purity samples with low concentration of residual charged impurities (of the order of 1014  cm− 3) will not improve the electron mobility sufficiently. Our modeling shows that because of the high hole concentration, the purity of samples in many configurations is of a lower importance for obtaining high electron mobility than the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> in the well. This conclusion could be important for the reduction of fabrication costs for high-mobility HgCdTe heterostructures.|$|R

An implantation of 1 × 1015 cm− 2 N+-ions yielded a p-type with hole concentrations 1017 – 1018 cm− 3 in some as-implanted samples. The films annealed at temperatures above 200 °C in O 2 and above 400 °C in N 2 were n-type with <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> 1017 – 1020 cm− 3. The higher nitrogen concentration (confirmed by SRIM and SIMS), in the films implanted with a 1 × 1016 cm− 2 dose, resulted in lower <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations,</b> respectively, higher resistivity, due to compensation of donors by nitrogen acceptors. The <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> ratio n(1 × 1015) /n(1 × 1016) decreases with increasing annealing temperature.

It was further shown that combining alloying elements at concentrations that produce {{the maximum amount of}} softening in Mo does not result in additive softening in ternary Mo alloys. Once a critical <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> is exceeded, only alloy hardening is observed. A comparison of hardness behavior with literature data on Hall coefficient and magnetic susceptibility for W-Re alloys showed that hardness minima occur at Re concentrations where minima are observed for the physical property measurements.

40|$|We have {{performed}} systematic {{studies of the}} effects of high-energy particle irradiation on the properties of InGaN alloys. In agreement with the amphoteric defect model, irradiation of InN produces donor-like defects. The <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> increases with increasing radiation dose and saturates at 4 x 10 {sup 20 } cm{sup - 3 } at very high doses. We find that the increase of the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> causes a large blue-shift of the absorption edge, which is well-explained by the Burstein-Moss effect. The maximum <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> decreases with increasing Ga fraction in irradiated In{sub 1 -x}Ga{sub x}N alloys as the conduction band edge approaches the Fermi level stabilization energy (E{sub FS}). For x > 0. 66 the conduction band edge moves above E{sub FS} and the irradiation of n-type films produces acceptor-like defects, resulting in a reduced free <b>electron</b> <b>concentration.</b> An analysis of the concentration dependence of the electron mobility in InN indicates that the dominant defects in irradiated InN are triply-charged donors.

This behavior is explained by the presence of residual charged impurities. Variation of the well width results in the variation of the hole concentration in the well (see Fig.  3). For high <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations,</b> the hole concentration is smaller than the residual impurity concentration, and the variation of holes concentration does not affect the electron mobility.
