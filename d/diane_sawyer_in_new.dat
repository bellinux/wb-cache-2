500|$|... "Everytime" [...] is a pop ballad. It {{begins with}} a music box {{introduction}} accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong through the song.

5000|$|One {{approach}} taken is gun avoidance, {{such as when}} encountering {{a firearm}} at a neighbor's home. The Eddie Eagle Gun Safety Program, administered by the National Rifle Association (NRA), is geared towards younger children from pre-kindergarten to sixth grade, and teaches kids that real guns are not toys by emphasizing a [...] "just say no" [...] approach. The Eddie Eagle program is based on training children in a four-step action to take {{when they see a}} firearm: (1) Stop! (2) Don't touch! (3) Leave the area. (4) Go tell an adult. Materials, such as coloring books and posters, back the lessons up and provide the repetition necessary in any child-education program. The ineffectiveness of the [...] "just say no" [...] approach promoted by the NRA's Eddie the Eagle program was highlighted in an investigative piece by ABC's <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> 1999. <b>Sawyer's</b> piece was based on academic studies conducted by Dr. Marjorie Hardy, assistant professor of psychology at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. [...] Dr. Hardy's study tracked the behavior of elementary age schoolchildren who spent a day learning the Eddie the Eagle four-step action plan from a uniformed police officer. The children were then placed into a playroom which contained a hidden gun. When the children found the gun, they did not run away from the gun, but rather, they inevitably played with it, pulled the trigger while looking into the barrel, or aimed the gun at a playmate and pulled the trigger. The study concluded that children's natural curiosity was far more powerful than the parental admonition to [...] "Just say no".|$|R

A few days after Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce) came out as a trans woman during a 20/20 interview with <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> May 2015, E! aired a two-part special on Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled [...] "About Bruce", in which another side of the story was told featuring family members who were not involved in the previous interview on 20/20. The first part of the special debuted on May 17, 2015, and attracted 2.92 million total viewers, a 40% increase from the previous episode, while the second part aired the following day with similar viewership. I Am Cait, a separate documentary series, was announced immediately after the 20/20 interview. Jeff Olde, head of programming at E! network, said that the series is [...] "not at all a Kardashian spin-off", and that [...] "we will not resort to spectacle," [...] trying to emphasize its distinct format that is entirely different from most programming on the network, including Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The eight-part, one-hour docuseries debuted on July 26, 2015, on E!, and focused on how Jenner was handling the aftermath of the transition; it also attempted to deal with various LGBT-related issues. It was later cancelled after two seasons. In April 2017, it was announced E! had ordered an 8-episode spin-off Life of Kylie revolving around Kylie Jenner which is set to premiere in summer 2017.|$|R

50|$|On Sunday, January 28, 1979, CBS revamped the program, premiering Morning, {{which was}} titled in {{accordance}} to {{the day of the}} week (Monday Morning, Tuesday Morning, etc.). The weekday Morning series competed with Good Morning America and Today. Charles Kuralt hosted Sundays, while Bob Schieffer hosted the rest of the week; Kuralt took over the daily broadcasts as well starting on October 27, 1980. The program featured long-form pieces from CBS News bureaus, and many viewed it as a highbrow, classy newscast in the best CBS tradition. Despite critical acclaim, the program remained dead last in the ratings, and CBS was under more pressure from affiliates to present a more viable morning competitor. So on September 28, 1981, Morning dropped the days of the week from its title (except for Sunday Morning), was extended to 90 minutes and added <b>Diane</b> <b>Sawyer</b> as co-host; <b>in</b> the process, Captain Kangaroo was reduced to a half-hour daily and pushed to an earlier time period (7:00 a.m.).|$|R
