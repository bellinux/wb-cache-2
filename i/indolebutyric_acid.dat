Four extractions were {{done on the}} spent medium, three at pH 2 and one at pH 10, using CHCL 3 or ether. Derivatizations were done with trichloroethanol, heptafluorobutyric anhydride, and heptafluorobutyric anhydride-ethanol. All samples were analyzed with frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography. A dedicated computer was used to assist in data analysis. C. difficile produced both short-chain and aromatic acids in Trypticase-yeast-salt broth; hydroxy acids were also detected. p-Cresol, indoleacetic acid, 4 -methylthio- 2 -hydroxybutyric acid, and some unidentified alcohols were observed. The basic chloroform extraction contained cadaverine and putrescine. Leucine, norleucine, and isoleucine influenced the production of C 5 and C 6 acids and alcohols. L-Tyrosine underwent successive degradation to produce p-cresol and aromatic acids as final products. Tryptophan increased the production of indoleacetic, indolepropionic, and <b>indolebutyric</b> <b>acids.</b> Isocaproic acid was produced in relatively high concentrations regardless of medium substitution.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Using {{the method}} of micro propagation, {{conditions}} of mass obtaining of somatic clones in in vitro culture have been established for loquat (Eriobotria japonica L.) {{and the effect of}} phytohormones on shoot rooting investigated. Different concentrations of synthetic cytokinin- benzylaminopurine (BAP) and auxin- 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (1 -NAA) and their different combinations were tested. Cytokinin at low concentration (8 mkM) stimulated apical morphogenesis, which was less expressed when adding higher concentrations of BAP – 12 - 26 mkM or 20 - 24 mkM to the cultivation medium. It has been revealed that introduction of auxin together with cytokinin into the cultivation medium caused an intensive callogenesis in the basal part of the main shoot. Callogenesis was more active in the case of 3 mkM concentration of 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid as compared to 1 mkM concentration of the same growth regulator. The latter concentration of 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid turned out to be most favorable for the expression of morphogenetic potential of the callus. As to the influence of phytohormones on the rooting of regenerated shoots, <b>indolebutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (IBA) at 5 mkM proved to be the most effective of all growth regulators used.

The {{objective of the}} present study was to determine how agrobacteria trigger root formation in the stem of a recalcitrant woody microcutting, which cytological events result from the combined presence of infection and exogenous auxin, and which types of roots are induced by infection. Microcuttings of a recalcitrant walnut (Fuglans regia), infected or not with A. rhizogenes strain 1855, were cultured with either <b>indolebutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (IBA), IAA, or without exogenous hormones, to induce rhizogenesis. They were cytohistologically and ultrastructurally investigated at various times in culture. Southern blot and PCR analyses were performed to verify the frequency of transgenic, chimeric and bacterium-containing roots. The infection was sufficient per se to stimulate rhizogenesis. Rooting on the infected cuttings was enhanced by exogenous IBA, which accelerated and increased root meristemoid formation, in comparison with without hormone treatment. Meristemoids were organized both directly by the cambial cells and indirectly by the callus, and showed a pluricellular origin. Inter and intracellular bacteria were observed in the stem throughout the culture period (30 d). They were preferentially present in the vessels, and mainly in those showing polyphenol deposition. In the infected IAA-treated cultures, a high level of secondary xylem formation occurred instead of rhizogenesis.

A micropropagation method for F. imbricata plants was established by culturing shoot tips on Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium containing 1. 0 mg/l benzylaminopurine (BAP), 0. 01 mg/l naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and 0. 1 mg/l gibberellic acid (GA 3). Auxin addition to the rooting medium, especially 0. 5 mg/l <b>indolebutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (IBA) or 0. 5 mg/l IBA and 0. 1 mg/l NAA, enhances root formation. The micropropagation method presented allowed the obtention of regenerated plantlets in six weeks from shoot tips...|$|E
40|$|Aiming {{to verify}} the rooting of abiu {{cuttings}} the present research was realized using cuttings with 15 cm of length and treated with indolbutiric acid, in the doses of 0, 1000, 3000 and 5000 mg dm - 3. The experiment were conducted in a nursery with intermitent artificial mist conditions of the Faculdade de Ciências Agrárias e Veterinárias - UNESP, Jaboticabal Campus, São Paulo, {{in the period of}} summer. The experimental delineation used was a random design, with 4 repetitions and 10 cuttings per parcel, in a total of 160 cuttings. After 150 days the evaluations were made for: percentage of rooted and survived cuttings, percentage of cuttings with root and with calluses. In the conditions that the experiment was done, can be conclude that the cutting is a viable method to propagate the abiu and the treatment with <b>indolebutyric</b> <b>acid</b> increased rooting in the specie...|$|E
40|$|Differences in bud {{induction}} on cotyledons from seedlings of six full-sib {{families and}} a wild seedlot of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco were observed after culturing on a half-strength Murashige & Skoog basal medium containing 5. 0 ^M benzyladenine (BA) and different auxin supplements. Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) at {{a concentration of}} 0. 05 /^M or a mixture of indoleacetic acid at 2. 8 to 5. 7 fjM plus <b>indolebutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (IBA) at 2. 5 to 4. 9 ^M induced high percentages of explants to differentiate buds. Cotyledons from full-sib families gave substantially more bud induction than cotyledons from wild stock. No significant interaction was observed between seed parents and treat-ments for bud induction. Seeds of full-sib families weighed significantly (at p = 0. 05) more than seeds from the wild seedlot used in this study. A strongly positive correlation between seed weight and im vitro bud induction was observed...|$|E
40|$|The auxin-induced {{formation}} of {{roots in the}} hypocotyls of Phaseolus vulgaris can be prevented by treatment with actinomycin D, colchicine or cytochalasin B if applied within 40 hr of initiation. Shortly after auxin pretreatment, there {{is an increase in}} translatable messenger RNA activity. Analysis of the labelled cell-free products indicate, among other changes, a striking increase in a protein co-migrating with tubulin, in the case of RNA isolated from <b>indolebutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (IBA) pretreated hypocotyls. An increase in tubulin content in vivo can also be demonstrated on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of membrane proteins and functional assays for tubulin polymerization. An increase in the synthesis of tubulin in vivo can also be demonstrated after IBA pretreatment. In addition, the auxin is also able to promote tubulin polymerization when added in vitro. It is suggested that tubulin synthesis and microtubule assembly are early events in auxin-mediated root differentiation...|$|E
