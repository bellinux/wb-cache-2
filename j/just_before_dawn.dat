5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn,</b> they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E
5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn</b> on December 14, {{ammunition}} {{was issued}} and the 22nd moved forward slightly, {{to about the}} position on the open slope that they had occupied the day before. Here they spent another day pinned to the ground, unable to advance or retire due to the constant fire of Confederate riflemen. Nightfall finally brought relief as another unit took their place {{on the field and}} the 22nd retired to the city of Fredericksburg.|$|E

5|$|After re-organising, in mid-August the 11th Battalion {{moved to}} La Boisselle {{where they were}} placed into brigade reserve. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn</b> on 21 August, about 200 men from the 11th took part in an attack around Mouquet Farm; {{casualties}} amounted to 20 killed and 40 wounded and afterwards the battalion was moved to Belgium. The 11th Battalion spent the remainder of 1916 in the Ypres sector, in Flanders, but was {{moved back to the}} Somme {{at the end of the}} year as the worst winter in 40 years descended on the front.|$|E
5|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by Kamikene and Daisuke Ishizaka of Hatos. It {{features}} two overlapping circles colored deep blue and bright blue, {{in order to create}} , a color close to indigo. The bright blue was chosen as it was a synthetic ink that regularly occurs in Japanese printing, while the deep blue was taken naturally, isolating a color taken from a photo of the sky <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn.</b> The center of the artwork features the Kikuuiki typography, as well as a logo of two overlapping circles. The mix of natural and artificial blue circles was used to represent Kikuuikis theme of mixing points.|$|E
5|$|On {{the crest}} of Sibidang-san, an antipersonnel {{minefield}} stopped the first North Korean infantry assault. More attacks followed in quick succession, {{all of which were}} repulsed by the US troops' superior firepower. By 02:30 the B Company riflemen were so depleted of ammunition that they began stripping machine-gun bullets from the ammunition belts and using them in their rifles. The 1st Platoon of C Company, {{at the base of the}} mountain behind B Company, climbed Sibidang-san in 45 minutes with an ammunition resupply for the company. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn</b> the North Korean attack subsided. Daylight revealed a vast amount of abandoned North Korean equipment scattered on the slope just below the crest, including 33 machine-guns. Among the North Korean dead was the commanding officer of the NK 13th Regiment.|$|E

5|$|That {{night was}} quiet until <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn.</b> The North Koreans then {{launched}} {{an attack against}} the 9th Infantry {{on the right of}} the marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came {{in the midst of a}} downpour. In bringing his platoon from an outpost position to the relief of the company, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman encountered an encircling North Korean force on the ridge line. He bayoneted the lead scout and engaged those following with grenades and rifle fire. His sudden attack confused and dispersed this group. Kaufman led his platoon on and succeeded in joining hard-pressed G Company. In the ensuing action Kaufman led assaults against close-up North Korean positions and, in hand-to-hand fighting, he bayoneted four more North Korean soldiers, destroyed a machine gun position, and killed the crew members of a North Korean mortar. American artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the North Koreans in this night and day battle.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn,</b> Spragg took {{command of}} the trench in the {{southern}} sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post. He successfully deployed his men {{so that when the}} attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03:30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the post. Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully {{to the north of the}} post. However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the post. At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.|$|E
5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn,</b> Howard summoned his platoon {{commanders to}} a meeting. With their senior {{officers}} dead or wounded, numbers One, Two and Three Platoons were now commanded by corporals. Howard's second in command, Captain Priday and number Four Platoon were missing. Only Lieutenants Fox and Sweeney in Five and Six Platoons {{had a full}} complement of officers and NCOs. The landings at Sword began at 07:00, preceded by a heavy naval bombardment. At the bridges, daylight allowed German snipers to identify targets and anyone moving in the open was in danger of being shot. The men of number One Platoon who had taken over the 75mm anti-tank gun on the east bank of the canal used it to engage possible sniper positions in Bénouville, the Château de Bénouville and the surrounding area. At 09:00, two German gunboats approached the canal bridge from Ouistreham. The lead boat fired its 20mm gun and number Two Platoon returned fire with a PIAT, hitting the wheelhouse of the leading boat, which crashed into the canal bank. The second boat retreated to Ouistreham. A lone German aircraft bombed the canal bridge at 10:00, dropping one bomb. The bomb struck the bridge but failed to detonate.|$|E

60|$|We {{reached the}} river <b>just</b> <b>before</b> the <b>dawn.</b> To my horror {{it was very}} full, so full that the drift looked dangerous, for it had been swollen by the thunder-rain of the {{previous}} night.

5|$|Throughout the {{following}} day, the US forces attempted to retake the lost positions {{in order to}} restore the integrity of their line. Fighting raged throughout the day into the early afternoon, by which time they had successfully recaptured several of the pillboxes, supported by mortar fire. In the evening, the Americans used indirect fire and searchlights to harass the Japanese, but by early morning, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn,</b> they struck again, and captured another pillbox. As morning progressed, the US commander requested tank support and four tanks from the 754th Tank Battalion were dispatched. In the meantime, minor counterattacks succeeded in regaining part of the line; by mid-morning the tanks joined the fighting and several more positions were retaken by the US troops in several attacks before and after lunch. Having run out of ammunition and running low on fuel, {{the first group of}} tanks was withdrawn and replaced with a fresh platoon of tanks with which the attack was resumed in the mid-afternoon. Fighting continued throughout the day until 7:30pm when the Japanese retired from the position for the evening, having been forced to give up all of their earlier gains by a determined American counterattack.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Australians were {{detected}} while waiting to step off and, after being illuminated by flares and taking fire from a German picquet, hastily launched the attack. After overcoming this, the left-centre company, having lost {{all of their}} officers, lost their formation {{and had to be}} re-organised before the attack on {{the eastern side of the}} village could continue. The two companies passed through hedges and the ruined buildings, clearing the outskirts of the village with little resistance. The left-most company then began its task of establishing outposts to the east. At the same time, on the right, the right-most company had advanced to the Doignes–Hermies road when they had begun to take fire. Overcoming this and skirting a wire obstacle, they began moving towards the rear of the German main defence line. At this point, they came under fire from a low hill on the western outskirts of the village, which took them in the flank and pinned them on its slope. In the darkness, the location of the enemy machine-gun could not be ascertained initially. The Australians remained fixed there for almost an hour-and-a-half before members of the right centre company, who had avoided most of the German resistance, were able to locate it and destroy it from the rear <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>dawn.</b> The two centre companies were then able to enter the village proper, forcing large numbers of the garrison to try to escape to the north-east, where they were taken prisoner in large numbers. Here the left-most company had been establishing a number of posts in the open fields. Most of these were established with minimal resistance, however, one platoon became heavily engaged by a machine-gun positioned near a sandpit on the other side of a road. A small group of men crossed the road and attempted to provide covering fire for the platoon. Amongst this group was Private Bede Kenny who, under heavy fire, rushed the enemy position and destroyed it with grenades, taking the surviving Germans prisoner. For his actions, he was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Minor skirmishing continued after this, but by 6:00am the village had been captured and 200 prisoners taken, for a loss to the 2nd Battalion of eight officers and 173 other ranks killed or wounded.|$|E

Two days later the Germans began another gas attack but the wind turned and blew the gas back over the German lines. A large number of German casualties were caused by the change in the wind direction and the decision to go ahead against protests by local officers, which were increased by British troops, who fired on German soldiers as they fled in the open.|$|E
