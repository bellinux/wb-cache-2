5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values he has <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with.</b> When {{he returned to}} India in 1891, his outlook was parochial {{and he could not}} make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Bridget {{has been}} portrayed out of {{conjunction}} with the stereotypical 'girly image', she is sporty and athletic. Mignon has described her as open, honest, outdoor kind of girl. Stating that like herself Bridget had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> keen interests for climbing trees, cycling and swimming in rivers, non typical female interests. She also branded Bridget as a 'sporty tomboy'. During an interview, Mignon said that Bridget's relationship with Declan changes her and she feels more independent from her family. She also becomes more determined as a person.|$|E

5|$|Malaria was endemic in the marshlands {{of eastern}} Virginia during the time, and Cornwallis's army {{suffered}} greatly from the disease; he estimated during the surrender {{that half of}} his army was unable to fight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of their members had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> malaria, and hence had acquired resistance to the disease. As malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} First Aliyah in 1881, Jews began immigrating {{to the area}} from Eastern Europe in larger numbers, {{particularly}} from Poland and Russia. These Zionist pioneers were motivated both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles they had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with,</b> and adapt by using local produce, especially vegetables such as zucchini, peppers, eggplant, artichoke and chickpeas. The first Hebrew cookbook, written by Erna Meyer, and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO), exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking. The bread, olives, cheese and raw vegetables they adopted {{became the basis for}} the kibbutz breakfast, which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels, and in various forms in most Israeli homes today.|$|E
40|$|The paper aims at {{disclosing}} {{the mechanism}} of genre memory, its ability to retain some persistent archaic elements due to their ongoing updating and renewal. The modern short story discussed appeals to the Bluebeard plot and is intended for <b>grown</b> <b>ups.</b> <b>With</b> scholars' inference about initiation rite as the underpinning of fairy tales and their symbolism hidden from children's eyes who are the common target audience now, the reinterpretation for adult readers is viewed as making symbolic truth less implicit, lifting of sexual taboos, and explication of inherent latent motifs related to initiation into adulthood...|$|R

5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, {{the court was}} central to the {{patronage}} and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. Lavish court display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from into an ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule, Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that she had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity.

5|$|Some bootleggers noticed rock {{fans that}} had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{the music in}} the 1960s wanted rare or {{unreleased}} recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of Golden Eggs, a bootleg of outtakes by The Yardbirds had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed to interview the band's Keith Relf for the sequel, More Golden Eggs. Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become the Band) at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the Royal Albert Hall for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance.|$|E
5|$|Their {{motives for}} {{escaping}} evolved over time. Those who fled {{in the years}} shortly after the Wall was built had experienced the formerly open border first-hand and often had relatives in the West or had traveled there. By contrast, later escapees had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the closed border, desired greater freedom and were dissatisfied with conditions in East Germany. Their attempts to escape were often triggered by specific events such as a wish to avoid conscription, repression by the authorities or the refusal of a request to emigrate. Many escapees had previously clashed with the state authorities and had been imprisoned for political offenses, often related to earlier unsuccessful escape attempts.|$|E

40|$|That {{the social}} {{sciences}} have <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> linked <b>with</b> their subject matter presents a unique challenge to historians.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{frequency of}} anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACCP) and anti-modified citrullinated vimentin antibodies (AMCV) elevation and their diagnostic significance {{in children with}} early juvenile arthritis (JA). Material and methods. ACCP were evaluated in serum of 80 pts with early JA (36 girls, 44 boys, mean age 8, 5 ± 5, 03 years), AMCV — in 85 pts with early JA (49 girls and 36 boys) aged from 1, 5 to 16 years (mean age 8, 7 ± 4, 9 years). Disease duration in all children was less than 6 months. Control group included 54 <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> pts <b>with</b> early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 27 - with undifferentiated arthritis (UDA) and 37 conditionally healthy children. АССР was assessed by immuno-enzyme assay (IEA) with commercial kits “Axis Shield Diagnostics" (Great Britain), upper normal limit 5, 0 U/ml. AMCV was examined by IEA with commercial kits “Orgentec Diagnostics” (Germany), upper normal limit — 25 U/ml. Results. ACCP was elevated in 7 children with early JA (8, 8 %). Frequency was higher than in healthy children but lower than in <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> pts <b>with</b> early RA and comparable with UDA. In juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) ACCP were more frequent than in juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). Concentration was higher in rheumatoid factor (RF) positive pts with polyarticular JA. AMCV level was elevated in in 23 (27, 1 %) pts with early JA (more frequent than in healthy donors but less frequent than in <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> pts <b>with</b> early RA and UDA). AMCV was significantly more frequent in JRA than in JCA and in RF positive than in RF negative pts. AMCV concentration in JA was higher than in healthy children but lower than in <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> pts <b>with</b> RA. It was also higher in RF+ than RF- JA. ACCP and AMCV correlated with swollen joint count, tender joint count and RF. AMCV also correlated with ESR and CRP. Conclusion. In pts with early JA ACCP and AMCV are equally or more frequent than RF. In spite of low sensitivity they have high specificity for JRA in contrast to JCA. Assessment of ACCP itself or in combination with RF and AMCV is of significant importance for prognosis of polyarticular joint damage with risk of significant functional disability development and timely administration of proper quite often aggressive therapy in early stage of the disease...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of {{locus of control}} is associated with family style and resources, cultural stability and experiences with effort leading to reward. Many internals have <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> families modeling typical internal beliefs; these families emphasized effort, education, responsibility and thinking, and parents typically gave their children rewards they had promised them. In contrast, externals are typically associated with lower socioeconomic status. Societies experiencing social unrest increase the expectancy of being out-of-control; therefore, people in such societies become more external.|$|E
25|$|Mäenpää {{focused his}} {{energies}} on recording Wintersun {{despite the lack}} of formal band members. The vocals, guitars, bass, and keyboards on Wintersun were performed solely by Mäenpää, who was already adept at recording multi-instrumental songs, having <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> 8- and 16-track equipment. Three studios were used in the making of Wintersun: drums were recorded at Tico-Tico Studios, Mäenpää's vocals, synth, and guitarwork were recorded at Sundi Coop Studios, and Nino Laurenne mixed the album at Sonic Pump Studios. Mäenpää recorded additional synth and guitar solos on his 16-track recorder.|$|E
25|$|Research {{with and}} caring for infant rhesus monkeys further {{inspired}} Harlow, and ultimately led {{to some of his}} best-known experiments: the use of surrogate mothers. Although Harlow, his students, contemporaries, and associates soon learned how to care for the physical needs of their infant monkeys, the nursery-reared infants remained very different from their mother-reared peers. Psychologically speaking, these infants were slightly strange: they were reclusive, had definite social deficits, and clung to their cloth diapers. For instance, babies that had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> only a mother and no playmates showed signs of fear or aggressiveness.|$|E
