The best obtained results were recorded to the vaccinated-challenged group with the homologous strain and vaccinated by spraying method which exhibited decreases in organ lesion scores in comparison to the other groups (non-vaccinated challenged chickens and groups of chickens either homologous challenged-vaccinated through drinking water or heterologous challenged-vaccinated groups). These findings suggest that vaccine is a suitable for minimizing lesion scores against homologous challenge using spraying method that could lead to minimizing the time for treatment and cases of condemnation in processing plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of accessory toxins to the acute inflammatory response to Vibrio cholerae was assessed in a murine pulmonary model. Intranasal administration of an El Tor O 1 V. cholerae strain deleted of cholera toxin genes (ctxAB) caused diffuse pneumonia characterized by infiltration of PMNs, tissue damage, and hemorrhage. By contrast, the ctxAB mutant {{with an additional}} deletion in the actin-cross-linking repeats-in-toxin (RTX) toxin gene (rtxA) caused a less severe pathology and decreased serum levels of proinflammatory molecules interleukin (IL) - 6 and murine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 2. These {{data suggest that the}} RTX toxin contributes to the severity of acute inflammatory responses. Deletions within the genes for either hemagglutinin/protease (hapA) or hemolysin (hlyA) did not significantly affect virulence in this model. Compound deletion of ctxAB, hlyA, hapA, and rtxA created strain KFV 101, which colonized the lung but induced pulmonary disease with limited inflammation and significantly reduced serum titers of IL- 6 and MIP- 2. 100 % of mice inoculated with KFV 101 survive, compared with 20 % of mice inoculated with the ctxAB mutant. Thus, the reduced virulence of KFV 101 makes it a prototype for multi-toxin <b>deleted</b> <b>vaccine</b> strains {{that could be used for}} protection against V. cholerae without the adverse effects of the accessory cholera toxins.

40|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} viruses of rabbits include: Myxoma virus (MV), the poxvirus that causes Myxomatosis, the calicivirus (genus Lagovirus) of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHDV), and Lapine Rotavirus (LRV), which is an enteric agent. There are some other viral agents in rabbits (parvovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, calicivirus (genus Vesivirus), enterovirus-like, reovirus, herpesvirus and coronavirus) but both their occurrence and their pathological value are negligible. Myxomatosis was firstly introduced in Europe more than 50 years ago and still represents a current and real problem. Recent studies have been focused to determine the role and function of the over 100 genes of MV encoding structural and essential proteins; in particular the immunomodulatory MV (im-MV) proteins (virokines and viroreceptors, immune modulators and anti-apoptotic factor), involved in contrasting the host immune system response towards the MV infection. One of the main tools to control myxomatosis in endemic areas is use of the live attenuated vaccines {{that are able to}} induce traceable humoral immunity for a variable time even if the protection of rabbits from the infection is not fully guarantee. Therefore, thanks also to the knowledge on the im-MV proteins, a new family of biotechnology <b>deleted</b> <b>vaccines</b> will soon be produced and made available in a few years. These should be more safe and able to induce a wider immunity and permit to apply the DIVA strategy i. e. to use serology to ascertain if the anti-MV antibodies detected in a rabbits originate by an infection or a vaccination. RHDV is a non-cultivable calicivirus that infects rabbits and causes an acute fatal hepatitis, firstly described in China in 1984.

Thirty seronegative, colostrum-deprived 5 month-old Holstein steer calves that tested negative for persistent BVDV by ear notch immunohistochemistry and seronegative to BVDV types 1 and 2 were used. Calves were screened by multi-parameter flow cytometry (MP-FCM) 1 week before vaccination to ensure that they were negative for T cell responses to the BVDV types 1 and 2 viruses in the Bovela® vaccine. Calves were assigned to 3 treatment groups: control (PBS), FSV inoculated, and Bovela® vaccinated. The humoral response was tested by standard serum virus neutralization (SVN) test to BVDV types 1 (Singer strain) and 2 (strain 125). The response by CD 4, CD 8, and gamma delta (γδ TCR) T cells was evaluated by MP-FCM using individual BVDV types 1 and 2 from Bovela® vaccine as recall antigens at 5, 6, and 7 weeks after vaccination. Activation markers used were upregulation of surface CD 25 (IL- 2 R), intracellular interferon gamma (IFNγ) and intracellular interleukin 4 (IL- 4). Each T cell subset was evaluated for increased expression of each activation marker compared to non-antigen stimulated cells of the same animal. All Bovela® vaccinated and FSV inoculated calves produced SVN antibodies to both BVDV types 1 and 2 while control animals remained seronegative throughout the study. The mean (weeks 5, 6, and 7) T cell recall responses to Bovela® BVDV type 1 and type 2 recall antigens were numerically higher in all three T cell subsets (CD 4, CD 8, and γδ TCR) for all three activation markers (CD 25, IFNγ, and IL- 4) when compared to either the control animals or to the FSV inoculated animals.

50|$|Vaccination {{is widely}} used both to protect cattle {{clinically}} {{in the case of}} infection and significantly reduce the shedding of the virus. Vaccination provides herd immunity, which lowers the likelihood of an animal coming into contact with an infected animal. Both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines are available. Immunity usually lasts approximately six months to one year. Marker vaccines are also available and recommended. Marker vaccines, also known as DIVA (differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals), have become popular in order to distinguish vaccinated animals from infected animals. A marker vaccine uses either deletion mutants or a virion subunit, such as glycoprotein E. Studies show that vaccinating after an animal has been infected decreases shedding of the disease and reduces reactivation of the latent virus, although not completely. Using a killed gE <b>deleted</b> marker <b>vaccine</b> after infection will reduce viral excretion following reactivation, using a dexamethasone treatment.|$|R

Recently, the establishment of an infectious cRNA system for IBDV has been described (E. Mundt and V. N. Vakharia, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 : 11131 - 11136, 1996). Here, we report the isolation of a VP 5 - IBDV mutant constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the methionine start codon of VP 5, followed by cRNA transfection. The resulting virus mutant was replication competent in cell culture, which indicates that VP 5 is not required for productive replication of IBDV. Absence of VP 5 expression was verified by lack of reactivity with newly established anti-VP 5 monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera. VP 5 - IBDV exhibited a delay in replication in chicken embryo cells compared to the VP 5 + parental virus. However, final yields were similar.

It has been difficult, however, to predict the location of limited protective regions with the use of conventional antisera because these antisera are polyclonal and contain antibodies to many different determinants (8, 9), some of which may not be exposed in the native state of the M protein on the bacterial surface, and others of which may cross-react with host tissue antigens...|$|R

Two protocols of hyperimmunisation in which glycoprotein-E <b>deleted</b> marker <b>vaccines</b> were repeatedly administered were compared to a positive control group in which the usual vaccination protocols were authorised. The two hyperimmunisation protocols differed in the primovaccination : the first group was treated with an attenuated vaccine firstly given intra-nasally then by intramuscular route whereas the second group was given an inactivated vaccine by subcutaneous injection. Afterwards, booster vaccinations were the same in both groups : an inactivated vaccine was administered by subcutaneous route every 6 months. In the control group, as a rule, part of the herd was vaccinated annually. For each group, 6 half-yearly reports specify : 1. the evolution of the population, categorized by birth half-year, 2. the incidence of seroconversion against gE in the cohorts and 3. the evolution of the gE seroprevalence.

After 5 months of infection, the six calves were treated with dexamethasone. Virus was only re-excreted by the four calves which previously seroconverted against gE. The two other calves became seronegative against BHV- 1, 30 - 32 weeks after infection. A second dexamethasone treatment performed 11 months after infection failed to demonstrate a latent infection in these two calves. Moreover, the lack of identification of a cell-mediated immune response, after the two dexamethasone treatments, and the failure to detect BHV- 1 DNA sequences in trigeminal ganglia strongly suggest that these two calves were not latently infected. In conclusion, the presence of high levels of maternal immunity lacking gE antibodies does not prevent latency after infection with a low titre of BHV- 1. Moreover, latency is associated with a serological response to gE. These results confirm that the gE deletion is a good marker to identify young calves latently infected with a field virus.

40|$|The seventh cholera {{pandemic}} {{that started}} in 1961 was caused by Vibrio cholerae O 1 strains of the El Tor biotype. These strains produce the pore-forming toxin hemolysin, a characteristic used clinically to distinguish classical and El Tor biotypes. Even though extensive in vitro data on the cytolytic activities of hemolysin exist, the connection of hemolysin to virulence in vivo is not well characterized. To study the contribution of hemolysin and other accessory toxins to pathogenesis, we utilized the model of intestinal infection in adult mice sensitive to the actions of accessory toxins. In this study, we showed that 4 - to 6 -week-old streptomycin-fed C 57 BL/ 6 mice were susceptible to intestinal infection with El Tor strains, which caused rapid death at high doses. Hemolysin had the predominant role in lethality, with a secondary contribution by the multifunctional autoprocessing RTX (MARTX) toxin. Cholera toxin and hemagglutinin/protease did not contribute to lethality in this model. Rapid death was not caused by increased dissemination due to a damaged epithelium since the numbers of CFU recovered from spleens and livers 6 h after infection did not differ between mice inoculated with hemolysin-expressing strains and those infected with non-hemolysin-expressing strains. Although accessory toxins were linked to virulence, a strain defective {{in the production of}} accessory toxins was still immunogenic since mice immunized with a multitoxin-deficient strain were protected from a subsequent lethal challenge with the wild type. These data suggest that hemolysin and MARTX toxin contribute to vaccine reactogenicity but that the genes for these toxins can be <b>deleted</b> from <b>vaccine</b> strains without affecting vaccine efficacy...|$|R

In the present study, the NS 2 gene, whose encoded protein antagonizes the host’s interferon-a/b response, was <b>deleted</b> from RSV <b>vaccine</b> candidates by use of reverse genetics. Methods. Three NS 2 gene–deleted RSV vaccine candidates were studied: rA 2 cpDNS 2, rA 2 cp 248 / 404 DNS 2, and rA 2 cp 530 / 1009 DNS 2. rA 2 cpDNS 2, which had the fewest attenuating mutations, was evaluated in adults and RSV-seropositive children. rA 2 cp 248 / 404 DNS 2 and rA 2 cp 530 / 1009 DNS 2 were evaluated in adults and RSV-seropositive and RSV-seronegative children.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{resistance of}} the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) to most antibiotics, including macrolides, is generally attributed to the low permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall. However, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are much more sensitive to macrolides than members of the MTC. A search for macrolide resistance determinants within the genome of M. tuberculosis revealed {{the presence of a}} sequence encoding a putative rRNA methyltransferase. The deduced protein is similar to Erm methyltransferases, which confer macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance by methylation of 23 S rRNA, and was named ErmMT. The corresponding gene, ermMT (erm 37), is present in all members of the MTC but is absent in NTM species. Part of ermMT is <b>deleted</b> in some <b>vaccine</b> strains of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, such as the Pasteur strain, which lack the RD 2 region. The Pasteur strain was susceptible to MLS antibiotics, whereas MTC species harboring the RD 2 region were resistant to them. The expression of ermMT in the macrolide-sensitive Mycobacterium smegmatis and BCG Pasteur conferred MLS resistance. The resistance patterns and ribosomal affinity for erythromycin of Mycobacterium host strains expressing ermMT, srmA (monomethyltransferase from Streptomyces ambofaciens), and ermE (dimethyltransferase from Saccharopolyspora erythraea) were compared, and the ones conferred by ErmMT were similar to those conferred by SrmA, corresponding to the MLS type I phenotype. These results suggest that ermMT {{plays a major role in}} the intrinsic macrolide resistance of members of the MTC and could be the first example of a gene conferring resistance by target modification in mycobacteria...|$|R

However, there are several safety concerns about using such an anti-HIV vaccine in humans, including reversion of the vaccine strain to virulence and recombination with endogenous retroviral sequences to produce new infectious and potentially pathogenic viruses. Because testing in humans would inevitably carry a substantial risk, we set out to test the genetic stability of multiply deleted HIV constructs in perpetuated tissue culture infections. The Delta 3 candidate vaccine strain of HIV- 1 contains deletions in the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and the vpr and nef genes. This virus replicates with delayed kinetics, but a profound enhancement of virus replication was observed after approximately 2 months of culturing. Analysis of the revertant viral genome indicated that the three introduced deletions were maintained but a 39 -nucleotide sequence was inserted in the LTR promoter region. This insert was formed by duplication of the region encoding three binding sites for the Sp 1 transcription factor. The duplicated Sp 1 region was demonstrated to increase the LTR promoter activity, and a concomitant increase in the virus replication rate was measured. In fact, duplication of the Sp 1 sites increased the fitness of the Delta 3 virus (Vpr/Nef/U 3) to levels higher than that of the singly deleted DeltaVpr virus. These results indicate that <b>deleted</b> HIV- 1 <b>vaccine</b> strains can evolve into fast-replicating variants by multiplication of remaining sequence motifs, and their safety is therefore not guaranteed.

When the transposon (Ac) inserts into one site between the two direct repeats in the P-ovov- 1114 allele, homologous recombination between the two 5. 2 kb repeats can occur and the whole P gene coding sequence is deleted;To further study this transposon-induced homologous recombination. This study examined six alleles that carry Ac insertions at different sites in the P locus, in both orientations.

We found the alleles with Ac inserted at different sites between the two direct repeats had higher frequency of colorless sector than the alleles with Ac insertions either within or outside the 52 ̆ 7 direct repeat. These results suggest that the transposon-induced homologous recombination is enhanced by the insertion of the element between the repeats. Ac orientation might have no effect on homologous recombination at P locus;To test if transposon-induced recombination is a general phenomenon in plants, we transformed Arabidopsis with a construct (GU-Ds-US) containing a stable transposon (Ds) inserted between two <b>deleted</b> <b>GUS</b> parts with homologous direct repeats similar to Ac inserted in maize P locus.

Lomniczi, M. L. Blankenship, and T. Ben-Porat, J. Virol. 49 : 970 - 979, 1984).

Virol. 53 : 52 - 57, 1985) to the sequences <b>deleted</b> from the <b>vaccine</b> strain. Restoration of these deleted sequences to the Bartha strain genome restores to the virus the ability to specify the gI glycoprotein. The Bartha vaccine strain grows as well as wild-type virus in pig kidney and in rabbit kidney (RK) cells, but is not released efficiently from and forms small plaques in RK cells. The rescued Bartha 43 / 25 a strain (which has an intact Us) is released considerably more efficiently than the Bartha vaccine strain, but less efficiently than wild-type virus from RK cells; it also forms larger plaques on RK cells than does the parental Bartha vaccine strain. The Norden vaccine strain, which has a deletion in the Us, is released better from RK cells than is the Bartha strain, but not as well as is wild-type virus. We conclude that whereas the sequences in the Us that are deleted from the Bartha and Norden strain genomes specify functions that {{play a role in the}} release of virions from some cell types, at least one other function (which is defective in the Bartha strain but not in the Norden strain) also affects release of virus from these cells. Since restoration to the Bartha strain of an intact Us restores to the virus both the ability to grow in chicken brains (B. Lomniczi, S. Watanabe, T. Ben-Porat, and A. S. Kaplan, J.

Attenuated or inactivated Salmonella vaccines have had variable impact upon colonisation. An aroA gene <b>deleted</b> attenuated live <b>vaccine</b> has been released in Australia, whilst an inactivated vaccine has been successfully used by an Australian poultry company for some years. The main aim of this project was to evaluate the efficacy of a Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) attenuated vaccine, alone or in combination with an inactivated multivalent autogenous vaccine that contained Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Infantis, Salmonella Zanzibar and Salmonella Montevideo, administered by four delivery methods, to aid the control of Salmonella in egg layer chickens. Following vaccination, a number of the birds were challenged at four ages with one of the following field-isolated serovars: Typhimurium, Infantis or Virchow. Twenty-one days following challenge the birds were euthanized and their caeca cultured for Salmonella. Throughout the study, the birds were bled at various ages to measure seroconversion, assessed as anti-Salmonella Typhimurium antibody levels; pre and post challenge. The quantitative investigation of the challenge strain in the caecum revealed a statistically significant (p < 0. 05) lower challenge strain burden in the parenteral vaccinated groups compared with the non-vaccinated control group up to an age of 22 weeks. The antibody responses varied, though the combination of the attenuated vaccine given by subcutaneous injection at 6 weeks and the inactivated vaccine given by intramuscular injection at 12 weeks of age gave the highest titres. The protective effects were demonstrated for the homologous challenge strains but not the heterologous strain. This study has shown that it is necessary to provoke a strong humoral response by vaccination, in commercial layers to reduce the contamination of eggs and egg products. The pre-lay period of layers is considered an especially important age to have control over Salmonella colonisation. Thereby, if the bird is protected, the transmission of Salmonella serovars of public health importance will be reduced, if not eliminated...|$|R

BuHV- 1 has been detected in Italian buffaloes after experimental immunosuppressor treatment and some genetic characteristics have been so far described. A close similarity has been described among the DNA sequences of BoHV- 1 and BuHV- 1 encoding for the gB, gC and gD.

The test includes two blocking ELISA directed to the BoHV- 1 gB and gE which had been developed to discriminate between animals infected by BoHV- 1 and animals vaccinated with a gE <b>deleted</b> BoHV- 1 <b>vaccine.</b> For this purpose, sera samples collected from 681 unvaccinated buffaloes from 8 farms in Central Italy have been tested by a commercially available gB/gE ELISA test. Seroneutralization tests for BuHV- 1 and BoHV- 1 have been carried out on the 157 samples resulted gB positive and gE negative. The immune sera used for the seroneutralization were obtained by experimental inoculation of BuHV- 1 and BoHV- 1 respectively in a buffalo and in a cattle. The seroneutralization test showed antibody titres more than three times higher for BuHV- 1 than for BoHV- 1 in all the 157 gB+ and gE- sera, confirming the BuHV- 1 infection. The results obtained in this preliminary study suggest the use of the gB/gE ELISA test for the survey of BuHV- 1 infection in buffaloes in Italy. However, serological interference would be obtained if animals vaccinated with a BoHV- 1 gE- vaccine are tested. Furthermore, BuHV- 1 infected animals show the same gB/gE ELISA results than BoHV- 1 gE- vaccinated cattle.
