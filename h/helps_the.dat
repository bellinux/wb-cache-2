5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk <b>helps</b> <b>the</b> cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E

Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, <b>helps</b> <b>the</b> animal view its surroundings.|$|E

As part of the national conservation effort, more than 1.2 million trees have been replanted to check the advancement of the desert, which incidentally also <b>helps</b> <b>the</b> local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, which produce gum arabic, and also from fruit trees.|$|E

5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa <b>helps</b> <b>the</b> student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa <b>helps</b> <b>the</b> student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} choose from five skills to {{overcome}} situations: Stealth, Athletics, Lore, Mechanics and Survival. As the player fights more creatures, more information is added to their bestiary. This <b>helps</b> <b>the</b> player collect information about how to attack them effectively. Early in the game, the protagonist will take over a stronghold, which acts as the party's fortress. This can be upgraded.|$|E
30|$|To try to {{overcome}} this objection, {{it is important to}} set objectives and face tradeoffs. One presumed objective of development is to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> poor. How to <b>help</b> <b>the</b> poor is open to discussion. Let us assume that <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> poor through improving their employment opportunities is an agreed-upon goal. Let us be clear, though, that <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> poor may not be the only goal of development policy; helping others {{in other parts of the}} income distribution or members of target groups may also be an important development goal. And let us also be clear that improving employment opportunities for the poor may not be the only means of <b>helping</b> them; <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> poor through improving and spreading social programs may be another means, for example.|$|R

5|$|A chavrusa <b>helps</b> <b>the</b> student stay awake, {{keep his}} mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
