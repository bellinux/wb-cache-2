40|$|Abstract Background Castleman's {{disease of}} the {{pancreas}} is a very rare condition that may resemble more common disease entities as well as pancreatic cancer. Case presentation Here we report {{the case of a}} 58 -year-old African American male with an incidentally discovered lesion in the head of the pancreas. The specimen from his pancreaticoduodectomy contained a protuberant, encapsulated mass, exhibiting microscopic features most consistent with localized/unicentric Castleman's disease. These included <b>florid</b> <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> with mantle/marginal zone hyperplasia along with focal progressive transformation of germinal centers admixed with involuted germinal centers. Conclusion To date, eight cases of Castleman's disease associated with the pancreas have been described in the world literature. We report the first case of unicentric disease situated within the head of the pancreas. In addition, we discuss the diagnostic dilemma Castleman's disease may present to the pancreatic surgeon and review current data on pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome. </p...|$|E
40|$|Genital {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) infections are a common cause of {{inguinal}} lymphadenopathy. However, surgical excision of enlarged inguinal nodes is almost never performed to initially diagnose genital {{herpes simplex virus}}, due to the distinct external presentation of genital herpetic vesicles that usually occur with the first symptoms of infection. Therefore, the histologic and immunophenotypic features of HSV-associated inguinal lymphadenopathy are unfamiliar to most pathologists. The current report describes the lymph node pathology of two immunocompetent patients, whose initial HSV diagnosis was established through surgical excision of enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. Histologic examination showed features consistent with viral lymphadenopathy, including <b>florid</b> <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> monocytoid B-cell hyperplasia, and paracortical hyperplasia without extensive necrosis.

40|$|Faecal stream {{diversion}} {{may induce}} inflammatory {{changes in the}} defunctioned segment of the large intestine. These changes are predominantly mucosal, although confusing histological features including granulomas may be present. The pathology of 15 defunctioned rectal stumps has been studied. All patients had previously undergone urgent total colectomy for ulcerative colitis and rectal stumps had been left in situ while they awaited pelvic ileal reservoir construction. All rectal stumps showed predominantly mucosal disease but there were additional features such as <b>florid</b> lymphoid <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> (12 cases), transmural inflammation (nine cases), granulomas (four cases), fissures (eight cases), and changes akin to ischaemia or to pseudomembraneous colitis (four cases). These changes may result {{from a combination of}} defunctioning and of active ulcerative proctitis. Some induce a histological appearance that may mimic Crohn's disease. Nevertheless review of all 15 colectomy specimens showed unequivocal ulcerative colitis and none of the patients has subsequently shown any clinical, radiological, or pathological evidence to support a diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{cellular}} localization of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV- 8) {{in rare cases}} of HHV- 8 infection from Italy that are associated neither with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection nor Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Methods: The presence and distribution of HHV- 8 -infected cells was investigated by direct in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the lymph node tissues from 2 patients with reactive lymphadenopathies with <b>florid</b> <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> and increased vascularity and in the lung tissue from 1 patient with chronic interstitial pneumonitis. Results: HHV- 8 was localized in lymphoid and monocyte-macrophage cells scattered in the interfollicular regions of both lymph nodes but not in endothelial cells. In the lung tissue, HHV- 8 {{was found in the}} inflammatory cells infiltrating the interalveolar interstitium, in endothelial cells of the pulmonary vasculature, and in rare pneumocytes. Conclusions: HHV- 8 can infect nonneoplastic lymph nodes of immunocompetent subjects, and the distribution of infected cells outside of the germinal centers resembles that of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -infected cells in the lymph nodes in the course of infectious mononucleosis. Endothelial cells and pneumocytes may be a target of HHV- 8 infection out of the KS setting, at least {{in the presence of a}} chronic inflammatory process...|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that cancer/testis (CT) antigen, CT 45, {{is expressed in}} various epithelial cancers at a frequency of < 5 % to ∼ 35 %. In this study, the protein expression of CT 45 was examined in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas and classical Hodgkin lymphoma by immunohistochemical analysis. Serological response to CT 45 was also evaluated by ELISA using CT 45 recombinant protein and sera from patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. None of the 80 low-grade B-cell lymphomas, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, expressed CT 45. In comparison, CT 45 was expressed in 28 of 126 (22 %) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). A remarkably high percentage (42 / 72, 58 %) of classical Hodgkin lymphoma contained CT 45 -positive Reed–Sternberg cells. Nodular sclerosis and mixed-cellularity subtypes had similar frequency of CT 45 expression, but most EBV-positive cases were CT 45 negative. Gray-zone lymphoma (cases with features of both DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma) also showed frequent (64 %) CT 45 expression. Evaluation of reactive lymphoid tissues showed scattered CT 45 -positive lymphocytes in a single case of <b>florid</b> <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> raising the possibility that this case was an evolving malignancy. Despite frequent CT 45 expression, only 1 of 67 Hodgkin lymphoma patients had detectable anti-CT 45 antibodies in the serum, suggesting that the immune response to CT 45 may be suppressed. In conclusion, classical Hodgkin lymphoma has the highest frequency of CT 45 expression among all malignancies tested to date, the frequency of CT 45 expression in DLBCL {{is similar to that}} seen in epithelial cancers, and low-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas do not express CT 45...|$|E

40|$|The {{defects in}} {{lymphocyte}} apoptosis {{that underlie the}} autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) are usually attributable to inherited mutations of the CD 95 (Fas) gene. In this report, we present the histopathological and immunophenotypic features seen in the lymph nodes (n = 16), peripheral blood (n = 10), bone marrow (n = 2), spleen (n = 3), and liver (n = 2) from 10 patients with ALPS. Lymph nodes showed marked paracortical hyperplasia. Interfollicular areas were expanded and populated by T cell receptor-αβ CD 3 + CD 4 −CD 8 − (double-negative, DN) T cells that were negative for CD 45 RO. CD 45 RA+ T cells were increased in all cases studied. The paracortical infiltrate {{was a result of}} both reduced apoptosis and increased proliferation, as measured by in situ detection of DNA fragmentation and staining with MIB- 1, respectively. The paracortical proliferation may be extensive enough to suggest a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Many of the paracortical lymphocytes expressed markers associated with cytotoxicity, such as perforin, TIA- 1, and CD 57. CD 25 was negative. In addition, most lymph nodes exhibited <b>florid</b> <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> often with focal progressive transformation of germinal centers; in some cases, follicular involution was seen. A polyclonal plasmacytosis also was present. The spleens were markedly enlarged, more than 10 times normal size. There was expansion of both white pulp and red pulp, with increased DN T cells. DN T cells also were observed in liver biopsies exhibiting portal triaditis. In the peripheral blood, the T cells showed increased expression of HLA-DR and CD 57 but not CD 25. CD 45 RA+ T cells were increased in the four cases studied. Polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis with expansion of CD 5 + B cells was a characteristic finding. Taken together, the histopathological and immunophenotypic findings, particularly in lymph nodes and peripheral blood, are sufficiently distinctive to suggest a diagnosis of ALPS. Of note, two affected family members of one proband developed lymphoma (T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin’s disease, respectively) ...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} examine the {{distribution}} of parenchyma, follicles, and lymphocyte subsets in the thymus of patients with myasthenia gravis and to identify determinants of remission after thymectomy. MethodsSixty patients with myasthenia gravis who underwent thymectomy were examined. The thymus was divided into upper, middle, and lower parts. The upper part {{was defined as the}} superior horn, the lower part as the inferior horn, and the middle part as tissue located between the 2 horns. The percentage of parenchyma was measured morphometrically. The degree of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> was classified into 5 grades. The densities of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes were classified into 5 grades. The remission of myasthenia gravis after thymectomy was examined with those variables in each part of the thymus. ResultsThe middle part had the highest percentage of parenchyma, the highest grade of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> and the highest density of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes among the 3 parts (P <. 001 -. 05). The grades of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> in the middle and lower parts were significantly higher in patients with improvement of myasthenia gravis than in those without (P <. 05). The densities of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes in the cortex of the middle part were significantly higher in patients with improvement than in those without improvement (P <. 01 -. 05). ConclusionsThe thymus has a heterogeneous distribution of parenchyma, follicles, and lymphocyte subsets. The middle part had the largest parenchyma, the highest grade of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> and the highest densities of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes among the 3 parts of the thymus.

40|$|International audienceThe {{most common}} form of Myasthenia gravis (MG) is due to anti-acetylcholine {{receptor}} (AChR) antibodies and is frequently associated with thymic pathology. In this review, we discuss the immunopathological characteristics and molecular mechanisms of thymic <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> the effects of corticosteroids on this thymic pathology, and the role of thymic epithelial cells (TEC), a key player in the inflammatory thymic mechanisms. This review is based not only on the literature data but also on thymic transcriptome results and analyses of pathological and immunological correlations in a vast cohort of 1035 MG patients without thymoma. We show that among patients presenting a thymic hyperplasia with germinal centers (GC), 80 % are females, indicating that thymic <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> is mainly a disease of women. The presence of anti-AChR antibodies is correlated with the degree of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> suggesting that the thymus is a source of anti-AChR antibodies. The degree of hyperplasia is not dependent upon the time from the onset, implying that either the antigen is chronically expressed and/or that the mechanisms of the resolution of the GC are not efficiently controlled. Glucocorticoids, a conventional therapy in MG, induce a significant reduction in the GC number, together with changes in the expression of chemokines and angiogenesis. These changes are likely related to the acetylation molecular process, overrepresented in corticosteroid-treated patients, and essential for gene regulation. Altogether, based on the pathological and molecular thymic abnormalities found in MG patients, this review provides some explanations for the benefit of thymectomy in early-onset MG patients...|$|R

In lymph nodes with <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> cytokeratin and/or desmin expressing reticulum cells displayed a characteristic dendritic meshwork in the subcapsular, perisinusoidal, and paracortical regions. In other forms reactive lymph nodes, they were similarly distributed but were less prominent. By SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, cytokeratin polypeptides were identified. In necrotizing lymphadenitis, they were increased and the pattern of distribution was disturbed. In tuberculous lymphadenitis, they were also increased and located at nongranulomatous {{as well as in}} perigranulomatous areas. In lymphomas the reticular meshwork was entirely obliterated. Cytokeratin or desmin expressing reticulum cells were rarely seen within tumors. The reticular meshwork was also obliterated in metastatic carcinoma. However, the meshwork was maintained in uninvolved areas. In conclusion, extrafollicular reticulum cells displayed characteristic patterns of distribution under various pathologic conditions, and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of those pathologic conditions in human lymph nodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of core antigens of retrovirus HTLV-III/LAV, {{referred to as}} “AIDS-related virus” (AV), has been sought in lymph node samples of patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL, 28 patients), prodromal AIDS (1 patient) and AIDS with Kaposi sarcoma (3 patients). In 30 patients the deposition of viral antigens, detected by monoclonal antibodies to HTLV-III and LAV, could be observed within the germinal centers (GCs) primarily within the extracellular network of immune complexes, and the two patients who were negative were atypical. No AV {{could be found in}} normal tonsil or in samples with <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> of unknown etiology (20 cases). These findings, taken together with the ultrastructural identification of typical retrovirus particles in all 9 PGL and 2 AIDS cases studied, indicates that the network of follicular dendritic (FD) cells is an important reservoir of AV virus antigen at this site. The persistence of this retrovirus inside the GCs helps explain how the <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> affecting FD cells and B blasts in PGL may in progressive cases be accompanied by destruction of FD cells and gradual development of T 4 + lymphopenia. T 4 + T cells may circulate through the GCs and become infected with AV there. In addition, the identification of retrovirus antigen in situ may be of diagnostic value...|$|R
40|$|The {{etiology}} of the lymphadenopathy and <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> associated with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) infection has remained unclear. To determine whether the B-lymphocyte expansions characteristic of this syndrome represent polyclonal and virus-specific processes, the antigen specificity of B cells in lymphoid tissues of monkeys infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) chimeras was assessed using an inverse immunohistochemical assay with biotinylated HIV- 1 envelope gp 120 (Env) as an antigen probe. Env-binding B cells were found aggregated in lymph node and splenic germinal centers (GCs). Most Env-binding GCs also contained an unstained population of B cells, suggesting the GCs were formed by a polyclonal (oligoclonal) process. By day 42 following infection, Env-binding B cells were present in 19 % of all lymph node GCs. Env-binding cells were present in 25 % of GCs even during chronic infection. This extraordinarily high frequency of Env-specific B lymphocytes suggests that the expansion of virus-specific B cells may largely account for the <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> in AIDS virus-infected individuals. Striking alterations in B-lymphocyte populations occur in secondary lymphoid tissues of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected individuals. B cells in lymph nodes and spleens become activated early {{in the course of}} infection, resultin...|$|R
