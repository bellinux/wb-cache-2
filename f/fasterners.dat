Today the mechanical anchoring belongs to the most widespread way of how to stabilize the layers of roofing material against the effects of wind uplift particularly in indoor buildings. However some malfunctions occur more and more frequently which cause leaking into the constructions or even the destruction of the whole roof in the worse cases. The practical part of this thesis is going {{to concentrate on the}} <b>fasterners</b> which belong to the most important elements of the mechanical anchored system. The aim of the experimental measurement is to draw a comparison of the quality of fasteners which are distributed on the Czech market. Thereafter the obtained figures are going to be compared with the theoretical calculating procedures according to the valid designed standards...|$|E
