Fifteen days after he had left San'a, al-Badr sent a man ahead to the Saudi Arabia to announce that he was alive. He then went there himself, crossing the border near Khobar, at the north-eastern edge of the kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the raid, {{tensions}} {{had been}} building between the Iraq army and Ashraf residents, who feared an impending attack as soldiers built up their forces outside the camp.

25|$|Indonesian {{nationalist}} {{and military}} hardliners, particularly {{leaders of the}} intelligence agency Kopkamtib and special operations unit, Opsus, saw the Portuguese coup {{as an opportunity for}} East Timor's annexation by Indonesia. The head of Opsus and close Indonesian President Suharto adviser, Major <b>General</b> <b>Ali</b> Murtopo, and his protege Brigadier General Benny Murdani headed military intelligence operations and spearheaded the Indonesia pro-annexation push. Indonesian domestic political factors in the mid-1970s, however, were not conducive to such expansionist intentions; the 1974–75 financial scandal surrounding petroleum producer Pertamina meant that Indonesia had to be cautious not to alarm critical foreign donors and bankers. Thus, Suharto was originally not in support of East Timor invasion.|$|E
25|$|Major General Jamil Al Sayyed, {{then head}} of Lebanese General Security, Brigadier General Mustafa Hamdan, Major <b>General</b> <b>Ali</b> Hajj and Brigadier General Raymond Azar were all arrested in August 2005 {{at the request of}} German {{prosecutor}} Detlev Mehlis, who was carrying out the UN investigation about the assassination. Sayyed was one of the persons who decided to assassinate Rafik Hariri according to a leaked draft version of the Mehlis report along with other Syrian high-rank intelligence and security officers and officials, namely Assef Shawkat, Maher Assad, Hassan Khalil and Bahjat Suleyman. However, later reports about the assassination did not repeat the allegations against Jamil Al Sayyed and other three Lebanese generals. Four Lebanese generals were held in Roumieh prison, northeast of Beirut from 2005 to 2009. They were released from the prison due to lack of evidence in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Houthis boycotted a single-candidate {{election}} in early 2012 meant to give Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi a two-year term of office. They {{participated in a}} National Dialogue Conference, but withheld support from a final accord in early 2014 that extended Hadi's mandate in office for another year. Meanwhile, {{the conflict between the}} Houthis and Sunni tribes in northern Yemen spread to other governorates, including the Sana'a Governorate by mid-2014. After several weeks of street protests against the Hadi administration, which made cuts to fuel subsidies that were unpopular with the group, the Houthis came to blows with Yemen Army forces under the command of <b>General</b> <b>Ali</b> Mohsen al-Ahmar. In a battle that lasted only a few days, Houthi fighters seized control of Sana'a, the Yemeni capital, in September 2014. The Houthis forced Hadi to negotiate an agreement to end the violence, in which the government resigned and the Houthis gained an unprecedented level of influence over state institutions and politics.|$|E

25|$|Yemen is a {{developing}} country, and the poorest {{country in the}} Middle East. Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen was described by critics as a kleptocracy. According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed. In the absence of strong state institutions, elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance, where competing tribal, regional, religious, and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced. The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal between three men: president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who controlled the state; Major <b>General</b> <b>Ali</b> Mohsen al-Ahmar, who controlled the largest share of the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces; and Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar, figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players, including tribal sheikhs. The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes' autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which {{to weigh in on}} Yemen's political decision-making.|$|E

2500|$|General Sumitro, the Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces, {{was blamed}} for inciting the rioters, {{and forced to}} resign. His {{supporters}} were removed from command positions, being made ambassadors or receiving staff jobs.

He also cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects—some {{for the benefit of the}} Suharto family—and tried to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty. Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom which changed the face of the city.|$|E

2500|$|The Islamic belief differs {{in regards}} {{to whether or not}} there are any fallen angels. Since angels are {{described}} as creatures with no urges or lower desires (nafs), several scholars refused the existence of fallen angels in Islam. Otherwise, the fallen angels are considered to oppose mankind {{as a result of their}} superior nature in comparison to them. If this case is assumed, the fallen angels of Islamic theology (unlike the Christian fallen angels) did not fall because of envy or rebellion against God, but rather due to their hard feelings towards humans in <b>general.</b> <b>Alī</b> ibn Abī Tālib explained, the worship of angels is a consequence of their awareness of God, but they may stop worshipping, by misunderstanding the orders of God, due to their limited knowledge. If they abandon their worship, they fall.|$|E

However, activities of the society slowed down with Nurettin Pasha's departure from İzmir. In order to weaken Turkish defense against Greek landing at İzmir, Allied Powers, especially the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, wanted to remove Nurettin Pasha from İzmir. Before the Occupation of İzmir, nationalist general Nureddin Pasha was recalled the Governor, who had fallen foul of Chrysostomos of Smyrna.
