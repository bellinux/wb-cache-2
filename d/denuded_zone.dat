50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, coherent island formation during SK {{growth has}} attracted increased interest {{as a means}} for fabricating epitaxial nanoscale structures, particularly quantum dots (QDs). Significant effort has been spent developing methods to control island organization, density, and size on a substrate. Techniques such as surface dimpling with a pulsed laser and control over growth rate have been successfully applied to alter the onset of the SK transition or even suppress it altogether. The ability to control this transition either spatially or temporally enables manipulation of physical parameters of the nanostructures, like geometry and size, which, in turn, can alter their electronic or optoelectronic properties (i.e. band gap). For example, Schwarz-Selinger, et al. have used surface dimpling to create surface miscuts on Si that provide preferential Ge island nucleation sites surrounded by a <b>denuded</b> <b>zone.</b> In a similar fashion, lithographically patterned substrates have been used as nucleation templates for SiGe clusters. Several studies have also shown that island geometries can be altered during SK growth by controlling substrate relief and growth rate. Bimodal size distributions of Ge islands on Si are a striking example of this phenomenon in which pyramidal and dome-shaped islands coexist after Ge growth on a textured Si substrate. Such ability to control the size, location, and shape of these structures could provide invaluable techniques for 'bottom-up' fabrication schemes of next-generation devices in the microelectronics industry.|$|E

The <b>denuded</b> <b>zones</b> are predicted to be at grain boundaries that are orthogonal to {{the direction of the}} applied stress. Furthermore, their dimensions should account for the accumulated plastic flow. In the present article, the evidence for such <b>denuded</b> <b>zones</b> is critically examined.

Recently, the present authors refuted this evidence and instead concluded that the deformation process in these materials was one of diffusion-controlled dislocation creep. It was further postulated that the experimentally-observed <b>denuded</b> <b>zones</b> developed {{as a result of}} tensile-stress-directed grain boundary migration during creep; a process which dissolves hydride precipitates as the boundary moves. The evidence and conclusions regarding <b>denuded</b> <b>zones</b> given in reference [4]have been challenged by Burton and Reynolds [5], by Greenwood [6], by Bilde-Sorensen and Smith [7], and by Langdon [8]. A response to Burton and Reynolds and to Greenwood has been given by Ruano et al [9].

These debates are recorded in eleven papers over the past seventeen years. ln these papers {{it has been shown}} that the creep rates of materials in the so-called �diffusional creep region� are almost always higher than those predicted by the diffusional creep theory. Additionally, the predictions of grain size effects and stress exponents from diffusional creep theory are often not found in the experimental data. Finally, <b>denuded</b> <b>zones</b> have been universally considered to be direct evidence for diffusional creep; but, those reported in the literature are shown to be found only under conditions where a high stress exponent is observed. Also, the locations of the <b>denuded</b> <b>zones</b> do not match those predicted. Alternative mechanisms are described in which diffusion-controlled dislocation creep and/or grain boundary sliding are the dominant deformation processes in low-stress creep. It is proposed that <b>denuded</b> <b>zones</b> are formed by stress-directed grain boundary migration with the precipitates dissolving in the moving grain boundaries.

In this work, we study the denudation of metal powders that is observed near the laser scan path {{as a function of}} laser parameters and ambient gas pressure. We show that the observed depletion of metal powder particles in the zone immediately surrounding the solidified track is due to a competition between outward metal vapor flux directed away from the laser spot and entrainment of powder particles in a shear flow of gas driven by a metal vapor jet at the melt track. Between atmospheric pressure and ∼ 10  Torr of Ar gas, the <b>denuded</b> <b>zone</b> width increases with decreasing ambient gas pressure and is dominated by entrainment from inward gas flow. The <b>denuded</b> <b>zone</b> then decreases from 10 to 2. 2  Torr reaching a minimum before increasing again from 2. 2 to 0. 5  Torr where metal vapor flux and expansion from the melt pool dominates. The dynamics of the denudation process were captured using high-speed imaging, revealing that the particle movement is a complex interplay among melt pool geometry, metal vapor flow, and ambient gas pressure. The experimental results are rationalized through finite element simulations of the melt track formation and resulting vapor flow patterns. The results presented here represent new insights to denudation and melt track formation that can be important for the prediction and minimization of void defects and surface roughness in additively manufactured metal components...|$|E

40|$|Material {{components}} for the nuclear fusion and the advanced nuclear fission reactors {{are exposed to}} high levels of radiation energy, high temperature, and high thermo-mechanical stresses. Radiation damage is inherently a multiscale phenomenon, with interactions encompassing time scales from femto-seconds to years and length scales from subnanometer to meters. In this study, multiscale modeling is used to investigate radiation effects phenomena using a series of specialized models (each tailored for examining a discrete range of length and time scales). Fractal dimension-based approach is used to link relevant length scale for multiscale simulation. Fractal dimension is a physical quantity to describe atomic arrangement of solid material. Physical mechanism obtained from lower length scale can be passed to higher length scale using fractal dimension. In this study, an ab initio study with a fractal dimension-based approach shows that the changes in atomic configuration nanostructures are correlated with the corresponding fractal dimensions. The relationship between fractal dimension and irradiation energy proposed in this study is used to derive free energy density for phase-field modeling formulation to investigate void nucleation and growth during W microstructure evolution under irradiation. By incorporating fractal dimension-based relation and the phase-field formulation, the model captures the influence of irradiation on the lattice mismatch between grains. Analyses on temporal evolution of porosity show that void structure development is found to follow three distinct stages: (i) incubation, (ii) nucleation, and (iii) growth. During the second stage, the void nucleation rate was found to be constant. In the latter stages, the nucleation rate drops to zero. Porosity is also calculated as a function of GB distance and irradiation energy. It was found that there exists the void <b>denuded</b> <b>zone</b> for all examined irradiation energies.

The second WL {{is different from the}} first WL that gives rise to the 1.344 -eV PL peak.

The presence of two WLs is thus unique to sample D, but we believe that it is a general phenomenon for all Stranski-Krastanow QDs grown on cross-hatch patterns. Their existence which has not been identified until now possibly explains the more complex carrier dynamics than those exhibited in conventional QDs [32, 33]. Sample D is subject to ex situ annealing, and the results are reported in the last subsection.|$|R

Epithelial restitution involves several humoral and cellular mechanisms that may potentially be affected by inhaled anti-asthma drugs. The present study examines {{the effect of a}} topical steroid on epithelial restitution in vivo in the guinea pig. METHODS [...] The airway epithelium was mechanically removed from well defined areas of guinea pig trachea without surgery and without damage to the basement membrane or bleeding. An anti-inflammatory dose of budesonide (1 mg) was administered repeatedly to the tracheal surface by local superfusion 24 hours before, at (0 hours), and 24 hours after the denudation. Migration of epithelial cells, formation of a plasma exudation-derived gel, and appearance of luminal leucocytes were recorded by scanning electron microscopy. Cell proliferation was visualised by bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry and tissue neutrophils and eosinophils by enzyme histochemistry. RESULTS [...] Immediately after creation of the <b>denuded</b> <b>zone</b> ciliated and secretory cells on its border dedifferentiated, flattened out, and migrated speedily (mean (SE) 2. 3 (0. 3) micron/min) over the basement membrane. After 48 hours the entire <b>denuded</b> <b>zone</b> (800 microns wide) was covered by a tightly sealed epithelium; at this time increased proliferation was observed in new and old epithelium and subepithelial cells. Budesonide had no detectable effect on epithelial dedifferentiation, migration, sealing, or proliferation. Immediately after denudation and continuously during the migration phase plasma was extravasated creating a fibrinous gel rich in leucocytes, particularly neutrophils, over the denuded area. Budesonide had no effect on either the gel or the leucocyte density.

We numerically evaluate the relative dispersion of surface coverage for several gate areas and compare the results to the fully random case. The coverage dispersion is related to the fluctuations from bit to bit of the threshold voltage window (Δ Vth) distribution of nanocrystal memories.

Lower effective defect concentrations have been found around grain boundaries which could be an effect of <b>denuded</b> <b>zones.</b> In the case of our sample, slight local process and material parameter variations, namely the local firing temperature, have a much stronger impact than the crystal structure...|$|R
40|$|Rebuttals to {{the recent}} criticisms of Burton and Reynolds and of Greenwood to our papers {{challenging}} the existence of diffusional creep are presented and responses by us to the following specific areas are discussed. (1) <b>Denuded</b> <b>zones,</b> universally to be considered direct evidence for diffusional creep, are seen only under conditions where a high stress exponent (as opposed to a value of unity) is observed, indicating that diffusion-controlled dislocation creep is the operative deformation process. (2) The creep rate of fine-grained superplastic materials is invariably orders of magnitude greater than predicted by diffusional creep; in these cases, the deformation process has been established to be grain-boundary sliding accommodated by slip (GBS) rather than diffusional creep. (3) The creep behavior of fine-grained copper measured by Burton and Greenwood can be described by a diffusion-controlled dislocation creep mechanism at high stresses, by GBS at intermediate stresses, and by Harper-Dorn creep at low stresses, with no clear evidence for diffusional creep.
