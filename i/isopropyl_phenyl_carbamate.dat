40|$|Besides the {{suggested}} {{role of a}} putative endocannabinoid membrane transporter mediating the cellular uptake of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), this process is intrinsically coupled to AEA degradation by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Differential blockage of each mechanism is possible using specific small-molecule inhibitors. Starting from the natural product-derived 2 E, 4 E-dodecadiene scaffold previously shown {{to interact with the}} endocannabinoid system (ECS), a series of diverse N-alkylcarbamates were prepared with the aim of generating novel ECS modulators. While being inactive at cannabinoid receptors and monoacylglycerol lipase, these N-alkylcarbamates showed potent to ultrapotent picomolar FAAH inhibition in U 937 cells. Overall, a highly significant correlation (Spearman's rho= 0. 91) was found between the inhibition of FAAH and AEA cellular uptake among 54 compounds. Accordingly, in HMC- 1 cells lacking FAAH expression the effect on AEA cellular uptake was dramatically reduced. Unexpectedly, 3 -(4, 5 -dihydrothiazol- 2 -yl) <b>phenyl</b> <b>carbamates</b> and the 3 -(1, 2, 3 -thiadiazol- 4 -yl) <b>phenyl</b> <b>carbamates</b> WOBE 490, WOBE 491 and WOBE 492 showed a potentiation of cellular AEA uptake inhibition in U 937 cells, resulting in unprecedented femtomolar (hyperpotent) IC 50 values. Potential methodological issues and the role of cellular accumulation of selected probes were investigated. It is shown that albumin impacts the potency of specific N-alkylcarbamates and, more importantly, that accumulation of FAAH inhibitors can significantly increase their effect on cellular AEA uptake. Taken together, this series of N-alkylcarbamates shows a FAAH-dependent inhibition of cellular AEA uptake, which can be strongly potentiated using specific head group modifications.

Thus, the distances between the substituents at nitrogen and <b>phenyl</b> of <b>carbamates</b> 1 and 2 are relatively longer. In the transition states of protonations of carbamates 1 and 2 in aqueous solution (pK(a)), those distances are also longer.

Racemic and enantiomerically pure R or S propranolol HCI were formulated with cellulose tris(3, 5 -dimethyl <b>phenyl</b> <b>carbamate)</b> (CDMPC) and applied to excised human skin using side-by-side Franz-type diffusion cells. When the pure enantiomers were used, there was a marked difference between the penetration rates of R and S propranolol (flux ratio: 2. 06; P = 0. 04). When racemic propranolol was used, the difference was reduced, although still statistically significant (flux ratio: 1. 2; P = 0. 08), particularly in view of the differential activities of the two enantiomers. Control experiments, in which no CDMPC was present, produced equal permeation rates. The results can be rationalised in terms of differential adsorption onto CDMPC within the vehicle, whereby S-propranolol is preferentially bound relative to R-propranolol. This causes an imbalance in the apparent donor phase concentrations that (in accordance with Fickian diffusion laws and thermodynamic activity) gives rise to differences in permeation rates. The diminished differential observed when the racemate was used, rather than individual enantiomers, is less easily rationalised. In this work, it was the permeation of the eutomer (S-propranolol) that was retarded, although the general principle of stereoselectively retarded skin permeation has been established...|$|R

It is suggested that the 3 -substituents exert both steric and electronic effects. The structures of the lactam alcohols (8 c-f, 12 c-f) have been confirmed by the chemical correlation with the known pyridones (11 c-f, 15 c-f) through the lactams (10 c-f, 14 c-f). The starting piperidinoethanols (7 c-f) have been synthesized from the 3 -substituted pyridines (5 c-f) by quaternization with 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenacyl bromide followed by catalytic and sodium borohydride reductions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDensity {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations {{were used}} to predict and rationalize {{the effect of the}} modification {{of the structure of the}} prototype 1, 3 -bis(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) imidazol- 2 -ylidene) (IPr) N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. The modification consists in the substitution of the methyl groups of ortho <b>isopropyl</b> substituent with <b>phenyl</b> groups, and here we plan to describe how such significant changes effect the metal environment and therefore the related catalytic behaviour by simple steric maps. Bearing in mind that there is a significant structural difference between IPr and IPr* ligands, that translated in different reactivity for several olefin metathesis reactions, here by means of DFT we characterize where the NHC ligand plays a more active role and where it is a simple spectator, or at least its modification does not significantly change its catalytic role/performance. Furthermore, this communication endeavours to modify further the skeleton of the IPr NHC ligand. The optimization of these bulky new systems go to the limits of the DFT computational method...|$|R
40|$|In {{the event}} of a bioterrorism attack using {{smallpox}} virus, there currently is no approved drug for the treatment of infections with this virus. We have reported previously that (S) - 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]cytosine (HPMPC) (also known as cidofovir [CDV]) has good activity against poxvirus infections; however, a major limitation is the requirement for intravenous administration. Two related acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs), adefovir (PMEA) and tenofovir (PMPA), are active against human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B virus but do not have activity against the orthopoxviruses. Therefore, we have evaluated a number of analogs and potential oral prodrugs of these three compounds for their ability to inhibit the replication of vaccinia virus or cowpox virus in tissue culture cells. The most-active compounds within the CDV series were (S) -HPMPA and (butyl l-alaninyl) cyclic HPMPC, with 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50 s) from 4 to 8 μM, compared with 33 to 43 μM for CDV. Although PMEA itself was not active, adefovir dipivoxil {bis[(pivaloyl) oxymethyl] PMEA} and bis(butyl l-alaninyl) PMEA were active against both viruses, and bis(butyl l-alaninyl) PME-N 6 -(cyclopropyl) DAP and (<b>isopropyl</b> l-alaninyl) <b>phenyl</b> PME-N 6 -(cyclopropyl) DAP were the most active compounds tested, with EC 50 s of 0. 1 to 2. 6 μM. In the PMPA series, none of the analogs tested had significantly better activity than PMPA itself. These data indicate that a number of these ANP derivatives have activity against vaccinia virus and cowpox virus in vitro and should be evaluated for their efficacies in animal models...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of proteins is often {{regulated by the}} formation of multi-protein complexes or translo- cation events. Over the last few decades, several methods {{have been developed to}} force proteins to specific locations or induce protein-protein interactions. One of these approaches is based on small bi-functional molecules, so-called chemical inducers of dimerisation (CIDs), which bind to two protein tags. Therefore, two proteins of interest fused to the tag protein, are brought into close proximity {{in the presence of the}} CID. Since the pioneering report by Schreiber and Crabtree in 1996, a variety of novel CIDs were designed and used to regulate protein dimerisation and translocation. However, most of these systems exhibit relatively low temporal resolution, deter- mined by the cell permeability of the small molecule. One of the few exceptions is rapamycin, a naturally occurring CID, which rapidly induces dimerisation between FKBP 12 and FRB. Due to its immunosuppressant properties, several researchers used the ”bump and whole” approach to design C 16 rapamycin derivatives, which do not bind to wild-type FRB, but to a geneti- cally engineered mutant. Although, various nucleophiles were introduced at the C 16 position, no general method to introduce carbamates was published. Here we describe an efficient Lewis acid- mediated method to substitute rapamycin at the C 16 position with various nucleophiles under mild conditions. Furthermore, we performed NMR experiments to elucidate the exact mech- anism of the mentioned method. We observed that treatment of rapamycin with the Lewis acid BF 3 -Et 2 O in CH 2 Cl 2, leads to the heterolytic cleavage of the C 16 methoxy group and the formation of a BF 3 -carbocation complex, which does not react with carbamates. The addition of THF further stabilises the carbocation, which results in a fast reaction with the nucleophile. To demonstrate the utility of this novel method, we introduced a series of representative carbamates at the C 16 position of rapamycin. One of the major challenges, when synthesising rapalogs, is that small impurities of rapamycin or rapamycin by-products still inhibit mTOR. Therefore, we extensively purified the diastereomers of C 16 <b>phenyl</b> <b>carbamate</b> (pcRap) with preparative HPLC. In a proof of concept, (R) -pcRap successfully induced dimerisation of FKBP and FRB fusion proteins without interfering with the mTOR pathway. The application of light controllable tools is an alternative approach to regulate the localisation and the activity of proteins with high spatiotemporal precision. Here we report the synthe- sis of a series of photoactivatable HaXS dimerisers, which contain a photocleavable linker be- tween the HaloTag-reactive chloroalkane ligand and the SNAP-tag-reactive O 6 -benzylguanine. Chemical modification of the photocleavable linker afforded three powerful photocleavable and cell-permeable CIDs, which could be cleaved independently and orthogonally. Furthermore, in a proof of concept, one of these photocleavable HaXS molecules was successfully used to translocate proteins of interest to the plasma membrane, late endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi, mitochondria and the actin cytoskeleton. Subsequent irradiation of a specific location with either a FRAP-laser or a mercury lamp with a DAPI filter set, readily liberated the anchored proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of photocleavable CIDs and explicitly MeNV-HaXS in kinetic studies of protein dynamics and the manipulation of subcellular enzyme activities. Therefore, MeNV- HaXS was used to anchor a nuclear probe to the Golgi. Subsequent irradiation of cells triggered the release and the relocalisation of the nuclear probe into the nucleus. ...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{esterase}} inhibitors, such as carbamates, phosphinates and sulfonyl halides, do {{not cause}} neuropathy as some organophosphates, {{but they may}} exacerbate chemical or traumatic insults to axons. This phenomenon is called promotion of axonopathies. Given the biochemical and toxicological characteristics of these compounds, the hypothesis was made that the target of promotion is a phenyl valerate (PV) esterase similar to neuropathy target esterase (NTE), the target of organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy. However, attempts to identify a PV esterase in hen peripheral nerve have been, so far, unsuccessful. We tested several esters, other than PV, as substrates of esterases from crude homogenate of the hen peripheral nerve. The ideal substrate should be poorly hydrolysed by NTE but extensively by enzyme(s) that are insensitive to non-promoters, such as mipafox, and sensitive to promoters, such as phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). When phenyl benzoate (PB) was used as substrate, about 65 % of total activity was resistant to the non-promoter mipafox (up to 0. 5 mM, 20 min, pH 8. 0), that inhibits NTE and other esterases. More than 90 % of this resistant activity was sensitive to the classical promoter PMSF (1 mM, 20 min, pH 8. 0) with an IC(50) of about 0. 08 mM (20 min, pH 8. 0). On the contrary, the non-promoter p-toluene sulfonyl fluoride caused only about 10 % inhibition at 0. 5 mM. Several esterase inhibitors including, paraoxon, <b>phenyl</b> benzyl <b>carbamate,</b> di-n-butyl dichlorovinyl phosphate and di-isopropyl fluorophosphate, were tested both in vitro and in vivo for inhibition of this PB activity. Mipafox-resistant PMSF-sensitive PB esterase activity(ies) was inhibited by promoters but not by non promoters and neuropathic compounds...|$|R

The reaction is a disproportionation to yield a hydroxylamine and a nitroso compound: 2 RNHO 7 2 ̆ 192 RNHOH + RNO. Rate constants for this reaction have been measured in several solvents. In benzene at 250 the rate constants {{are in the range}} 4 7 107 to 3 7 106 M- 1 sec- 1. For R = phenyl and R = tert-butyl the reaction was shown to be reversible and the equilibrium constants were measured over a range of temperature. The measured enthalpy change for the reaction with R = tert-butyl is in good agreement with that calculated (for R = CH 3) from the heats of formation of the various species involved. Evidence is presented for hydrogen bonding of methyl nitroxide in methanol. The rate constant for the slow conversion of phenyl nitroxide to azoxybenzene has also been measured over a range of temperature in benzene. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Birds {{involved}} in damage or nuisance situations also have beneficial qualities, and most species {{are protected by}} State and Federal laws. Programs designed to alleviate bird problems, particularly those involving blackbirds, should first seek to discourage the birds from using problem areas and not to eliminate populations by direct reductional control. Habitat manipulation and mechanical frightening devices are useful techniques for discouraging bird activity, but certain chemical frightening agents have distinct advantages in some situations. We have found these agents particularly effective when used to control blackbird damage. Chemical frightening agents {{can be divided into}} two groups, the lethal and non-lethal. The latter is obviously more desirable, since accidental deaths of upland game, waterfowl, and insectivorous songbirds are minimized. Whether lethal or non-lethal, the success of these agents is largely dependent upon eliciting the desired behavioral response from unaffected birds in the population. The extreme gregariousness of blackbirds makes them ideal subjects for demonstrating the utility of this type of chemical. Personnel of the Denver Wildlife Research Center have been actively searching for and developing safe and effective chemical frightening agents since 1360. Eighty-two potential agents have been screened, but only a few have warranted field testing. Certain substituted <b>phenyl</b> N-methyl <b>carbamates</b> have shown particularly wide safety margins between temporary immobilization and death (Schafer et al., 1967) - One of these, DRC- 736, has been field tested extensively and shows special promise for protecting livestock feedlots from problem blackbirds. A second compound, 4 -aminopyridine (DRC- 1327), described by Goodhue and Baumgartner (1965 a, 1965 b), has been tested at Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, South Dakota, since 1962 (De Grazio, 1964). This chemical frightening agent has been the most successful of the many control methods tested to alleviate blackbird damage to ripening corn...|$|R
