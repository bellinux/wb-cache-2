5|$|The surname Golding <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> {{a variety}} of hop known as Goldings and, {{although}} it is not certain who discovered the hop, it has been accredited to John Golding (who died some time before 1811), the great nephew of Thomas and the owner of Ditton Court, or to his son John (who died at Ditton Place in 1851).|$|E
5|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, {{they must}} be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50milliliters to 150milliliters gives 200milliliters. However, if a measure of 5feet is extended by 2inches, the sum is 62inches, since 60inches <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> 5feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3meters and 4square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis.|$|E

5|$|Curtis Gates Lloyd {{described}} the variety rochesterensis in 1909, originally {{as a new}} species, Phallus rochesterensis. It was found in Kew, Australia. A form with a pink-coloured indusium was reported by Vincenzo de Cesati in 1879 as Hymenophallus roseus, and later called Dictyophora indusiata f.rosea by Yosio Kobayasi in 1965; it <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> Phallus cinnabarinus. A taxon described in 1936 as Dictyophora lutea and variously known for years as Dictyophora indusiata f.lutea, D.indusiata f.aurantiaca, or Phallus indusiatus f.citrinus, was formally transferred to Phallus in 2008 as a distinct species, Phallus luteus.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Warriors release {{has been}} noted as a notable turning point in video game history. The game has been listed as a genre builder for RPGs. Its {{popularity}} in Japan <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> RPGs. While the game's elements had been present in previous RPG titles, Dragon Warrior set the template for others; almost all of its elements became the foundation for nearly every later game of the genre, from gameplay to narrative, replacing D as the model to follow. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the success of Dragon Warrior {{changed the nature of}} video game development by making scenario writers far more important.|$|E
5|$|Goodison Park {{is unique}} {{in the sense that}} a church, St Luke's, {{protrudes}} into the site between the Goodison Road Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand only yards from the corner flag. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church. The church <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.|$|E

5|$|Several {{forms and}} {{varieties}} of H.repandum have been described. Forms albidum and rufescens, found in Russia, were published by T.L. Nikolajeva in 1961; the latter taxon <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> H.rufescens. Form amarum, published from Slovenia by Zlata Stropnik, Bogdan Tratnik and Garbrijel Seljak in 1988, is illegitimate as per article 36.1 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, {{as it was}} not given a sufficiently comprehensive description. Jean-Baptiste Barla described H.repandum var. rufescens in 1859. Carleton Rea described the white fruit bodied version as a variety—H.repandum var. album—in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Shaffer {{defined the}} Russula brevipes {{varieties}} acrior and megaspora in 1964 from Californian specimens. The former {{is characterized by}} a greenish-blue band that forms {{at the top of the}} stipe, while the latter variety has large spores. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum does not consider these varieties to have independent taxonomical significance. In a 2012 publication, mycologist Mike Davis and colleagues suggest that western North American Russula brevipes comprise a complex of at least four distinct species. According to MycoBank, the European species Russula chloroides <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> R.brevipes, although Index Fungorum and other sources consider them distinct species.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grunwald is {{regarded}} as one of the most important in the histories of Poland and Lithuania. In the history of Ukraine, the battle is better associated with Vytautas the Great, who stood as the leader of Eastern Orthodox Christianity at that time. In Lithuania the victory <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> the Grand Duchy's political and military peak. It was a source of national pride during the age of Romantic nationalism and inspired resistance to the Germanization and Russification policies of the German and Russian Empires. The Knights were portrayed as bloodthirsty invaders and Grunwald as a just victory achieved by a small, oppressed nation.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Bovista craniiformis by Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1832. Elias Fries transferred {{it to the}} then newly circumscribed genus Calvatia in 1849, setting Calvatia craniiformis as the type and only species. Scott Bates and colleagues suggest that the name <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> Lycoperdon delicatum published by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1873 (not the L.delicatum published by Berkeley in 1854), as is Lycoperdon missouriense published by William Trelease in 1891. The form C.craniiformis f. gardneri, published by Yosio Kobayasi in 1932 (originally Lycoperdon gardneri Berk. 1875), since been elevated to the distinct species Calvatia gardneri.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius <b>is</b> <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> Agaricus blennius (the name {{under which}} Fries first {{described}} the species in 1815) and Agaricus viridis, a name given earlier by Heinrich Schrader, in 1794. Galorrheus blennius (a name proposed in 1871 by Paul Kummer), Lactarius viridis (proposed in 1888 by Lucien Quélet) and Lactifluus blennius (proposed by Otto Kuntze in 1891) are also now recognised as synonyms. Lactarius albidopallens was originally {{described as a}} form of L. blennius as Lactarius blennius f. albidopallens by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1928, before being classified as a separate species by J. Blum. Lange also described Lactarius blennius f. virescens, which is now recognised as nomen invalidum (an invalid name). Lactarius fluens is another species that has been included in L. blennius; originally described in 1899 by Jean Louis Émile Boudier, in 1999, German Joseph Krieglsteiner suggested that it is actually a variety of L. blennius, naming it Lactarius blennius var. fluens. The situation with Lactarius viridis is similar; first described as a separate species by Quélet in 1888, A. Marchand proposed that it is in fact a variety of L. blennius, naming it Lactarius blennius var. viridis.|$|E
