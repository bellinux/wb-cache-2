40|$|This paper bridges the {{gap between}} two-country Ricardian trade models where {{differences}} in environmental policies create pollution <b>havens</b> <b>in</b> a poorer region with weaker pollution regulations, and 2 [*]×[*] 2 Heckscher-Ohlin models that predict under certain conditions that pollution <b>havens</b> may occur <b>in</b> a richer region with tighter regulations. By relaxing the Heckscher-Ohlin assumptions of factor price equalization and no specialization, we show how creation of pollution <b>havens</b> <b>in</b> either region is possible, due to the interplay of policy and factor-endowment motives. We also analyze the conditions for creating pollution <b>havens</b> <b>in</b> the cases of exogenous and endogenous environmental policy. Copyright © 2008 The Authors.

5|$|The {{people of}} Milford <b>Haven</b> <b>in</b> 2001 {{identified}} themselves as being under 1400 Christian out of near 1900 in total. The earliest known religious building in the area was the Benedictine priory, known as Pill Priory, which was dissolved during Henry VIII's reign.

5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one {{factor in his}} royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a <b>haven</b> <b>in</b> France during his exile.|$|E
5|$|Alboin moved west in his march, invading {{the region}} of Liguria (north-west Italy) and {{reaching}} its capital Mediolanum (Milan) on September 3, 569, only to find it already abandoned by the vicarius Italiae (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with {{the administration of the}} diocese of Annonarian Italy. Archbishop Honoratus, his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the vicarius Italiae to find a safe <b>haven</b> <b>in</b> the Byzantine port of Genua (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of dominus Italiae (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences {{in the northern part of}} the Po plain, and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.|$|E

5|$|Between May and September 1943, Pennsylvanian made four transatlantic {{crossings}} between New York and Liverpool, making intermediate {{stops in}} Loch Ewe and Methil {{while in the}} United Kingdom. The cargo ship made two New York– Guantánamo Bay roundtrips between September and December before resuming transatlantic sailings. After two New York– Liverpool roundtrips between late December 1943 and April 1944, Pennsylvanian left the United States for the final time on 19 May 1944, arriving in Liverpool on 2 June. She called at the British ports of Methil, Loch Ewe, Clyde, and Milford <b>Haven</b> <b>in</b> late June and early July, and, sailing from Barry in mid July, Pennsylvanian arrived at Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, France.

5|$|Muhanna later {{commanded}} {{the right wing}} of the Mamluk army during the Third Battle of Homs in 1299/1300, during which the Mamluks were defeated by the Mongol Ilkhanids. In 1311, the Mamluk na'ib (governor) of Aleppo, Qarasunqur, defected to the Ilkhanids and was given refuge by Muhanna, who unsuccessfully attempted to mediate between Qarasunqur and Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341). These circumstances together with Muhanna's suspicions of an-Nasir's negative disposition toward him prompted Muhanna and Qarasunqur to seek safe <b>haven</b> <b>in</b> Ilkhanid-held Iraq. To that end, in 1312, Muhanna sent his son Musa to confer with Öljaitü of the Ilkhanate, and afterward he defected to the latter with his son Sulayman; unlike his father, Musa remained loyal to the Mamluks. Öljaitü gave Muhanna iqtaʿat (fiefs) in al-Hillah, south of Baghdad. An-Nasir Muhammad consequently dismissed Muhanna from his principality and appointed his brother Fadl ibn Isa the lord of Palmyra.|$|E

5|$|Northwest of Holland, {{the highway}} runs as a four-lane {{expressway}} and divided highway parallel, but inland from, the Lake Michigan shoreline.

There, US31 intersects {{the western end of}} M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) before continuing into the southern end of Grand <b>Haven.</b> <b>In</b> that city, the highway follows a four-lane boulevard with a grass median. On the northern edge of the city of Grand Haven, US31 crosses the Grand River on a bascule bridge that opens about 450–500times per year. North of the structure, US31 transitions into a freeway at the interchange with the western end of M-104 in Ferrysburg. This freeway continues northward through the suburban edges of the Muskegon area and meets the western end of I-96 near the Muskegon County Airport in Norton Shores.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} planned shuttle mission after the Columbia {{accident}} to be launched into a low-inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with the International Space Station. Due to the inclination and other orbit parameters of Hubble, Atlantis would {{have been unable to}} use the International Space Station as a safe <b>haven</b> <b>in</b> the event of structural or mechanical failure. To preserve NASA's post-Columbia requirement of having shuttle Launch On Need (LON) rescue capability, STS-400 was the flight designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by Endeavour in the event Atlantis became disabled during STS-125. After Atlantis performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, Endeavour was officially released from stand-by status on Thursday, 21 May.|$|E
