In particular, <b>elastomeric</b> <b>solids</b> which are of essential engineering interest are discussed.

40|$|Liquid {{polysulfide}} polymers (LPs) H(SCH 2 CH 20 CH 20 CH 2 CH 2 S) nH are of wide commercial {{importance in}} the sealants industry. Chemical oxidation of the mercaptan groups, by inorganic and peroxide catalysts, leads {{to the formation of}} durable, flexible and adhesive elastomers. Terminal modification of the prepolymers, by substituting a wide range of carbonylcontaining groups for the thiol protons, has {{led to the creation of}} photopolymerisable oligomers with certain of the desirable properties mentioned above. UV irradiation of all the modified polysulfides, which exist as viscous oils, resulted in the development of a <b>solid</b> <b>elastomeric</b> <b>material</b> with considerable powers of adhesion. The acylation process involves the addition of a slight excess of an acyl halide to the prepolymer in solution, followed by the addition of an amine to neutralise the HCI formed. This procedure has been adapted to react di- and polyfunctional termini with LPs to produce block copolymer polysulfides. When exposed to UV irradiation, the oligomers slowly photocrosslink, forming an insoluble elastomer. The increase in degree of polymerisation has been successfully monitored by 1 H NMR spectroscopy; this was achieved by irradiating the oligomers in NMR tubes containing a thin capillary tube containing a deuterium-lock solvent. These new materials were characterised by IR, 1 H and 13 C NMR, GPC, viscometry and, particularly electrospray and FAB-mass spectrometry. FAB spectra have also been obtained for the first time for the parent polysulfide as well as the modified forms; these enable characterisation of the polysulfide backbone and its irregularities. Characterisation of these cured products has been made by hardness testing, solvent resistance, flexibility and tensometry. Lap shear measurements have been made of all of the functionalised cured polysulfides; adhesion is greatly enhanced by the addition of an adhesion promoter (optimum level 2...|$|R

40|$|Application of Comsol Multiphysics 3. 2 to finite strain {{viscoelasticity}} of an <b>elastomeric</b> <b>solid.</b> Bohdana Marvalova* The paper {{presents an}} implementation in Comsol Multiphysics 3. 2 of Holzapfel's material {{model for the}} viscoelastic stress response of carbon-black filled rubber at large strains. The simulation in Comsol 3. 2 uses the Structural Mechanics Module finite strain formulation based on the material configuration with the right Cauchy-Green tensor as a strain measure. The time independent response of the rubber is modelled by the Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic material with uncoupled volumetric/deviatoric free energy function. In addition to the volumetric and isochoric elastic response function we use a configuration free energy, which drives the viscoelastic response. Thus we obtain a decoupled stress response which consists of equilibrium and non-equilibrium parts. The non-equilibrium viscoelastic stresses are evolving internal variables governed by rate equations which are modelled in PDE General Form. In our simulation we used some predefined SME variables and we defined several other suitable variables such as the isochoric elastic stresses and material tangent modulus.
