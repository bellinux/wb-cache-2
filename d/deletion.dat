40|$|Analyses of 113 {{putative}} Mutator-induced events {{involving the}} yg 2 locus of chromosome 9 revealed that 11 {{of these events}} were <b>deletions</b> that produce albino seedlings when homozygous.

Nine of the wd-Mu <b>deletions</b> were analyzed cytologically. Two {{were found to be}} terminal <b>deletions</b> and seven were internal <b>deletions.</b> Two of the seven had normal pairing throughout the terminal region involved in the pyd 1 and wd 1 <b>deletions.</b> Because genetic tests established that <b>deletions</b> were present in these two stocks, these <b>deletions</b> were probably too short to disrupt the pairing of the homologous chromosomes.

40|$|Homozygous <b>deletions</b> of {{recessive}} cancer {{genes and}} fragile sites {{are known to}} occur in human cancers. We identified 281 homozygous <b>deletions</b> in 636 cancer cell lines. Of these <b>deletions,</b> 86 were homozygous <b>deletions</b> of known recessive cancer genes, 17 were of sequenced common fragile sites, and 178 were in genomic regions that do not overlap known recessive oncogenes or fragile sites (“unexplained” homozygous <b>deletions).</b> Some cancer cell lines have multiple homozygous <b>deletions</b> whereas others have none, suggesting intrinsic variation in the tendency to develop this type of genetic abnormality (P < 0. 001). The 178 unexplained homozygous <b>deletions</b> clustered into 131 genomic regions, 27 of which exhibit homozygous <b>deletions</b> {{in more than one}} cancer cell line. This degree of clustering indicates that the genomic positions of the unexplained homozygous <b>deletions</b> are not randomly determined (P < 0. 001). Many homozygous <b>deletions,</b> including those that are in multiple clusters, do not overlap known genes and appear to be in intergenic DNA. Therefore, to elucidate further the pathogenesis of homozygous <b>deletions</b> in cancer, we investigated the genome landscape within unexplained homozygous <b>deletions.</b> The gene count within homozygous <b>deletions</b> is low compared {{with the rest of the}} genome. There are also fewer short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), and low-copy-number repeats (LCRs). However, DNA within homozygous <b>deletions</b> has higher flexibility. These features may signal the presence of currently unrecognized zones of susceptibility to DNA rearrangement. They may also reflect a tendency to reduce the adverse effects of homozygous <b>deletions</b> by minimizing the number of genes removed...|$|R

40|$|The {{structures}} of two unusual <b>deletions</b> from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are described. These <b>deletions</b> extend {{from a single}} Ty 1 retrotransposon to an endpoint near a repetitive tRNA(Gly) gene. The <b>deletions</b> suggest that unique sequences flanked by two nonidentical repetitive sequences, or bordered on only one side by a transposable element, {{have the potential to}} be mobilized in the yeast genome. Models for the formation of these two unusual <b>deletions</b> were tested by isolating and analyzing 32 additional unusual <b>deletions</b> of the CYC 1 region that extend from a single Ty 1 retrotransposon. Unlike the most common class of <b>deletions</b> recovered in this region, these <b>deletions</b> are not attributable solely to homologous recombination among repetitive Ty 1 or delta elements. They arose by two distinct mechanisms. In an SPT 8 genetic background, most unusual <b>deletions</b> arose by transposition of a Ty 1 element to a position adjacent to a tRNA(Gly) gene followed by Ty 1 -Ty 1 recombination. In an spt 8 strain, where full-length Ty 1 transcription and, therefore, transposition are reduced, most <b>deletions</b> were due to gene conversion of a 7 -kb chromosomal interval flanked by a Ty 1 element and a tRNA(Gly) gene...|$|R

40|$|Idiopathic hypogonadotropic {{hypogonadism}} (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders {{caused by a}} deficiency of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Mutations in three genes—KAL 1, GNRHR and FGFR 1 —account for 15 – 20 % of all causes of IHH/KS. Nearly all mutations are point mutations identified by traditional PCR-based DNA sequencing. The relatively new method of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) has been successful for detecting intragenic <b>deletions</b> in other genetic diseases. We hypothesized that MLPA would detect intragenic <b>deletions</b> in ∼ 15 – 20 % of our cohort of IHH/KS patients. Fifty-four IHH/KS patients were studied for KAL 1 <b>deletions</b> and 100 were studied for an autosomal panel of FGFR 1, GNRH 1, GNRHR, GPR 54 and NELF gene <b>deletions.</b> Of all male and female subjects screened, 4 / 54 (7. 4 %) had KAL 1 <b>deletions.</b> If only anosmic males were considered, 4 / 33 (12. 1 %) had KAL 1 <b>deletions.</b> No <b>deletions</b> were identified {{in any of the}} autosomal genes in 100 IHH/KS patients.

40|$|PolyA simple repeat {{sequence}} <b>deletions</b> {{are common}} in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI+). Such <b>deletions</b> occur one base {{at a time in}} DNA mismatch repair (MMR) -deficient yeast suggesting larger <b>deletions</b> in human MSI+ tumors represent multiple sequential stepwise losses. Sum total <b>deletions</b> in four polyA repeats were variable (between − 17 to − 45 bp) in 20 sporadic MSI+ colorectal cancers. Progressive but less extensive total <b>deletions</b> (maximum of − 12 bp) occurred in similar polyA sequences in MMR-deficient mice (mlh 1 −/−) up to 478 days old. PolyA repeat lengths were relatively stable but already shortened in the MMR-deficient cell line HCT 116. A transgene with 26 A’s transfected into HCT 116 shortened an average of 3. 8 bases pairs after 469 days in culture, less than average <b>deletions</b> of BAT 25 (− 5. 3) or BAT 26 (− 9. 0) in MSI+ cancers.

40|$|Microdeletions at exon 19 are {{the most}} {{frequent}} genetic alterations affecting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) and they are strongly associated with response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A series of 116 NSCLC DNA samples investigated by Sanger Sequencing (SS), including 106 samples carrying exon 19 EGFR <b>deletions</b> and 10 without <b>deletions</b> (control samples), were subjected to deep next generation sequencing (NGS). All samples with <b>deletions</b> at SS showed <b>deletions</b> with NGS. No <b>deletions</b> were seen in control cases. In 93 (88 %) cases, <b>deletions</b> detected by NGS were exactly corresponding to those identified by SS. In 13 cases (12 %) NGS resolved <b>deletions</b> not accurately characterized by SS. In 21 (20 %) cases the NGS showed presence of complex (double/multiple) frameshift <b>deletions</b> producing a net in-frame change. In 5 of these cases the SS could not define the exact sequence of mutant alleles, in the other 16 cases the results obtained by SS were conventionally considered as <b>deletions</b> plus insertions.

A pBR 322 -mini-oriC hybrid plasmid carrying two E. coli replication terminators (Ter sites) in opposite orientations was used. <b>Deletions</b> which remove at least the pBR 322 blocking site (named Ter 1) occurred at a frequency of 2 x 10 (- 6) per generation. They fall into two equally large classes: <b>deletions</b> that join sequences with no homology, and others that join sequences of 3 - 10 bp of homology. Some 95 % of the <b>deletions</b> in the former class resulted from the fusion of sequences immediately preceding the two Ter sites, indicating a direct role for blocked replication forks in their formation. These <b>deletions</b> were not found in a topA 10 mutant, suggesting a topoisomerase I-mediated process. In contrast, <b>deletions</b> joining short homologous sequences were not affected by the topA 10 mutation. However, the incidence of this second class of <b>deletions</b> increased 10 -fold in a recD mutant, devoid of exonuclease V activity. This indicates that linear molecules are intermediates in their formation. In addition, approximately 50 % of these <b>deletions</b> were clustered in the region flanking the Ter 1 site.
