40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the FF-LYNX project, {{undertook}} by DII-IET (Pisa) and INFN (Pisa) and relying on a collaboration with CERN (Geneva), and focuses on the development of a high-level SystemC model and simulator of a new communication protocol and interfaces {{to be used in the}} context of High Energy Physics (HEP). The FF-LYNX protocol is meant to provide the diverse and heterogeneous world of HEP experiments with a standard solution to common problems, such as Data Acquisition (DAQ) and Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC). The particle detectors used in HEP experiments generate unwieldy amounts of data following a particle collision (10 TB/s - 1 PB/s). To reduce the amount of data to shift from the detector to the central elaboration system a filter is applied. After a collision the detectors send only a small share of data to the central system. This data is used to ascertain whether the detectors caught interesting events (which are only a few percent of the total). If the results are positive a trigger signal is sent to the detectors to command the acquisition of the interesting events only. This way the data rate becomes manageable. Every HEP laboratory has developed its TTC/DAQ protocol, so no standard solution exists. FF-LYNX aims at defining a standard but flexible approach that could be employed in all the HEP contexts, therefore enabling savings on money, time and efforts. The proposed protocol sits at the data-link layer of the ISO/OSI stack, is serial and synchronous and makes use of Time Division Multiplexing to fit two channels in the same wire. One of these channels carries triggers, <b>frame</b> headers and <b>synchronisation</b> patterns, while the other transports data frames. Triggers undergo a scheduling process to make sure they have fixed and known end-to-end delay (a key requirement in HEP experiments). The high-level simulator has been used to validate the performance of the protocol and to support critical implementation decisions, such as the mechanism for keeping the receiver and transmitter synchronised. A useful set of guidelines have been thus provided for the development of a lower-level VHDL model. The scalable and modular architecture of the simulator will allow it to be reused to control the FPGA emulator that will implement the interfaces at a later project phase...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of imperfect syn-chronisation in optical orthogonal frequency division multi-plexing (OFDM) systems utilising intensity modulation (IM) / direct detection (DD). The use of IM/DD technique inherently eliminates the problem of carrier frequency offset.

Sampling clock offset causes irreducible intercarrier interference (ICI) and symbol timing offset. A technique to mitigate {{the impact of}} sampling clock offset is proposed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the received signal is oversampled at twice the Nyquist rate and the odd samples are punctured. The symbol timing offset is estimated using pilots and when the symbol timing offset exceeds 0. 5 of sample duration, the puncturing pattern ips between puncturing the odd series and the even series. This in effect, constraints the symbol timing offset within 1 sample duration. The residual symbol offset can be perfectly corrected using linear phase equaliser.

These new methods are shown to have some significant advantages over existing methods. Also reported is a new algorithm to determine the exact satellite position for the open-loop three ranging stations method.

40|$|The radio {{frequency}} spectrum for commercial wireless communications {{has become an}} expensive commodity. Consequently, radio access techniques are required which enable the efficient exploitation of these resources. This, however, is a difficult task due to an increasing diversity of wireless services. Hence, {{in order to achieve}} acceptable spectrum efficiency a flexible air– interface is required. It has been demonstrated that code division multiple access (CDMA) provides flexibility by enabling efficient multi user access in a cellular environment. In addition, time division duplex (TDD) as compared to frequency division duplex (FDD) represents an appropriate method to cater for the asymmetric use of a duplex channel. However, the TDD technique is subject to additional interference mechanisms in particular if neighbouring cells require different rates of asymmetry. If TDD is combined with an interference limited multiple access technique such as CDMA, the additional interference mechanism represents an important issue. This issue poses the question of whether a CDMA/TDD air–interface {{can be used in a}} cellular environment. The problems are eased if a hybrid TDMA (time division multiple access) / CDMA interface (TD–CDMA) is used. The reason for this is that the TDMA component adds another degree of freedom which can be utilised to avoid interference. This, however, requires special channel assignment techniques. This thesis analyses cellular CDMA/TDD systems used in indoor environments. A key parameter investigated is the interference in such systems. In the interference analysis a special focus is placed on adjacent channel interference since the jamming entity and victim entity can be in close proximity.

40|$|D. Ing. The digital {{transmission}} of information necessitates the compensation for disturbances introduced by the channel. The compensation method usually used in digital communications is error correcting coding. The errors usually encountered are additive in nature, i. e. errors where only symbol values are changed. Understandably, the field of additive error correcting codes has become a mature research field. Remarkable {{progress has been made}} during the past 50 years, {{to such an extent that}} near Shannon capacity can be reached using suitable coding techniques. Sometimes the channel disturbances may result in the loss and/or gain of symbols and a subsequent loss of word or <b>frame</b> <b>synchronisation.</b> Unless some precautions were made, a synchronisation error may propagate and corrupt large blocks of data. Typical precautions taken against synchronisation errors are: out-of-band clock signals distributed to the transmission equipment in a network; stringent requirements on clock stability and jitter; limits on the number of repeaters and regeneration to curb jitter and delays; line coding to facilitate better clock extraction; and - use of framing methods on the coding level. Most transmission systems in use today will stop data transmission until reliable synchronisation is restored. El multiplexing systems are still the predominantly used technology in fixed telephone line operators and GSM operators, and recovering from a loss of synchronisation (the FAS alarm) typically lasts approximately 10 seconds. Considering that the transmission speed is 2048 KB/s, a large quantity of data is lost in during this process. The purpose of this study is therefore to broaden the understanding of insertion/deletion correcting binary codes. This will be achieved by presenting new properties and coding techniques for multiple insertion/deletion correcting codes. Mostly binary codes will be considered, but in some instances, the results may also hold for non-binary codes. As a secondary purpose, we hope to generate interest in this field of study and enable other researchers to continue to deeper explore the mechanisms of insertion and/or deletion correcting codes...|$|E
40|$|Duobinary pulse-position {{modulation}} (PPM), a novel {{channel coding}} scheme, {{has been proposed}} in this thesis as an alternative method of improving bandwidth utilisation efficiency and sensitivity over existing coding schemes such as digital PPM, dicode PPM, multiple PPM and offset PPM while operating over slightly or highly dispersive graded-index (GI) plastic optical fibre (POF) channels of limited bandwidth. Theoretical investigation based on simulations of mathematical models with maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) at 1 Gbps on-off keying (OOK) data shows that duobinary PPM significantly outperforms optimised digital PPM at low fibre bandwidths by 8. 7 dB while only operating at twice the original pulse code modulation (PCM) data rate. It {{has also been shown}} at high fibre bandwidth duobinary PPM gives a sensitivity of - 42. 2 dBm which is favourably comparable to digital PPM seven-level coding sensitivity of - 44. 1 dBm. Results presented in the thesis also demonstrate that at very low normalised fibre bandwidths (below 1 and down to 0. 43) duobinary PPM outperforms dicode PPM by 1. 2 dB requiring 27 x 103 photons per pulse compared to 40. 3 x 103 required by Dicode PPM. Due to the use of MLSD at low bandwidths, wrong-slot errors are completely eliminated, and the effect of erasure and false-alarm errors are significantly reduced thus resulting in significantly improved sensitivity. Successful VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL) and field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of duobinary PPM coder, decoder and MLSD as a single system has been presented in the thesis. An FPGA embedded bit error rate (BER) test device has also been implemented for sensitivity measurements purposes and all the designs have been tested successfully with back-to-back testing.

An information theory analysis is presented in detail and also the band-utilization efficiency is determined. Results are compared to equivalent digital PPM and multiple PPM schemes and it is also shown that offset PPM gives an advantage over on-off keying (OOK). Bit error rate (BER) analysis has been presented numerically. The errors due to different coding techniques are compared. It has also been shown that offset pulse position modulation is more power efficient than multiple pulse position modulation. The spectral analysis of offset pulse position modulation coding scheme has been carried out. For an offset PPM sequence the spectral characteristics is presented both theoretically and numerically. The results show strong frequency components at the frame rate and, if return-to-zero pulses are used, the slot rate. Slot synchronisation has been taken into consideration {{for the first time as}} offset PPM spectrum exhibits discrete slot rate component. The effect of pulse shaping and modulating index on the spectrum has been shown. The dependency of slot component on the pulse shape is examined.

40|$|Pulse time {{modulation}} (PTM) {{techniques have}} drawn considerable attention {{over the years}} as suitable schemes for transmission of information over optical fibres. PTM schemes are known to utilise the vast optical bandwidth to provide efficient transmission characteristics. Pulse code modulation is one such modulation scheme that has been used widely in various communication systems. In this thesis digital pulse interval modulation (DPIM), a form of PTM, is proposed as a suitable modulation scheme for optical communication systems. In this scheme the information is represented by means of varying the anisochronous frame interval between two successive pulses. Each pulse fulfils the dual role of representing the frame boundaries and initiation of the next sampling event within the modulator or sample reconstruction in the demodulator. In this study DPIM frame structure is proposed and sampling criteria, information capacity, bandwidth requirements are discussed in depth. The spectral behaviour of the scheme is investigated and a mathematical model is developed to represent the spectra. The model was numerically evaluated and verified with the practical measurements to prove its validity. Spectral predictions were made for random as well as periodic information signals showing the existence of the distinct slot frequency component, which is used for slot synchronisation. <b>Frame</b> <b>synchronisation</b> is not required as DPIM has self synchronised frame structure. For random signals, slot component is found to be about 15 dB and for periodic single tone sinusoidal signal this was at about 5 dB. Dependency of this component on the various system parameters such as bit resolution, pulse width, pulse shape are discussed. A detailed account of the receiver performance is given. Receiver analysis was carried out for narrow band as well as for wide band channels. Possible error sources are presented and the system performance degradation with these error sources is discussed and a comparison is made with isochronous DPPM and PCM. For performance evaluation of analogue systems, signal-to-noise ratio was mathematically modelled and compared with PCM. This analysis showed that DPIM SNRs shows three important regions as compared to PCM. That is when the SNR is inferior, superior and identical to PCM performance. Threshold levels corresponding to the above regions vary depending on the system bit resolution. A prototype DPIM system was designed and implemented to transmit low speed analogue signal (≈ 15 kHz) at bit resolutions of 4, 5 and 6 where the slot frequencies are at 510, 990 and 1950 kHz, respectively. Measurements were carried out in order to verify the predicted performance. This results showed close agreement with the predicted. Receiver sensitivity of the prototype at bit error rate of 10 - 9 was found to be about - 45. 5 dBm at all three cases with transmitted average power of - 28. 8 dBm allowing high optical power budget. The signal-to-noise ratio threshold level of the system was at - 47 dBm. Finally, linearity measurements of the overall system were made at the above bit resolutions and the quantitative and qualitative results are presented. </p...|$|E
40|$|In DS-CDMA, {{spreading}} sequences are {{allocated to}} users to separate different links namely, the base-station to user in the downlink or {{the user to}} base station in the uplink. These sequences are designed for optimum periodic correlation properties. Sequences with good periodic auto-correlation properties help in <b>frame</b> <b>synchronisation</b> at the receiver while sequences with good periodic cross- correlation property reduce cross-talk among users and hence reduce the interference among them. In addition, {{they are designed to}} have reduced implementation complexity so that they are easy to generate. In current systems, spreading sequences are allocated to users irrespective of their channel condition. In this thesis, the method of allocating spreading sequences based on users’ channel condition is investigated in order to improve the performance of the downlink. Different methods of dynamically allocating the sequences are investigated including; optimum allocation through a simulation model, fast sub-optimum allocation through a mathematical model, and a proof-of-concept model using real-world channel measurements. Each model is evaluated to validate, improvements in the gain achieved per link, computational complexity of the allocation scheme, {{and its impact on the}} capacity of the network. In cryptography, secret keys are used to ensure confidentiality of communication between the legitimate nodes of a network. In a wireless ad-hoc network, the broadcast nature of the channel necessitates robust key management systems for secure functioning of the network. Physical layer security is a novel method of profitably utilising the random and reciprocal variations of the wireless channel to extract secret key. By measuring the characteristics of the wireless channel within its coherence time, reciprocal variations of the channel can be observed between a pair of nodes. Using these reciprocal characteristics of common shared secret key is extracted between a pair of the nodes. The process of key extraction consists of four steps namely; channel measurement, quantisation, information reconciliation, and privacy amplification. The reciprocal channel variations are measured and quantised to obtain a preliminary key of vector bits (0; 1). Due to errors in measurement, quantisation, and additive Gaussian noise, disagreement in the bits of preliminary keys exists. These errors are corrected by using, error detection and correction methods to obtain a synchronised key at both the nodes. Further, by the method of secure hashing, the entropy of the key is enhanced in the privacy amplification stage. The efficiency of the key generation process depends on the method of channel measurement and quantisation. Instead of quantising the channel measurements directly, if their reciprocity is enhanced and then quantised appropriately, the key generation process can be made efficient and fast. In this thesis, four methods of enhancing reciprocity are presented namely; l 1 -norm minimisation, Hierarchical clustering, Kalman filtering, and Polynomial regression. They are appropriately quantised by binary and adaptive quantisation. Then, the entire process of key generation, from measuring the channel profile to obtaining a secure key is validated by using real-world channel measurements. The performance evaluation is done by comparing their performance in terms of bit disagreement rate, key generation rate, test of randomness, robustness test, and eavesdropper test. An architecture, KeyBunch, for effectively deploying the physical layer security in mobile and vehicular ad-hoc networks is also proposed. Finally, as an use-case, KeyBunch is deployed in a secure vehicular communication architecture, to highlight the advantages offered by physical layer security...|$|E
