50|$|Other common <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> alloys {{commonly}} used for wafer bonding include Au-Sn, Al-Ge, Au-Ge, Au-In and Cu-Sn.|$|E
50|$|Silicon {{chips are}} bonded to {{gold-plated}} substrates through a silicon-gold eutectic by {{the application of}} ultrasonic energy to the chip. See <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding.</b>|$|E
40|$|Bond surface {{preparation}} {{is an integral}} part of all <b>eutectic</b> wafer <b>bond</b> processes currently used in high volume production. It is not unusual to have a requirement conflict between the bond surfaces and the device itself, especially in case of MEMS inertial sensors. A typical example of the issue at hand is the need of an anti-stiction coating material for the device and the interference of the material with the <b>eutectic</b> <b>bond</b> process. This paper reports on the novel usage of localized plasma in conjunction with an improved permanent wafer bonder to reconcile the conflicting needs in case of <b>eutectic</b> Aluminum-Germanium wafer <b>bonding...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{diffusivity}} and solubility of gold into {{silicon substrate}} increases with rising bonding temperatures. A higher temperature than the eutectic temperature is usually preferred for the bonding procedure. This {{may result in}} the formation of a thicker Au-Si alloy layer and further a stronger <b>eutectic</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{fabricating}} three-dimensional silicon micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) is presented, using selectivity thin film deposited Au-Si <b>eutectic</b> <b>bond</b> pads. Utilizing this process, complicated {{structures such as}} microgrippers and microchannels are fabricated. Bond strengths are higher than the silicon fracture strength and the bond areas can be localized and aligned to the processed wafer. The process and the applications are described in this paper...|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> procedure {{is dependent on the}} used material. The bonding happens at a specific weight-% and temperature, e.g. 370 °C at 2.85 wt-% Si for Au intermediate layer (compare to phase diagram).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eutectic</b> <b>bonding,</b> also {{referred}} to as eutectic soldering, describes a wafer bonding technique with an intermediate metal layer that can produce a eutectic system. Those eutectic metals are alloys that transform directly from solid to liquid state, or vice versa from liquid to solid state, at a specific composition and temperature without passing a two-phase equilibrium, i.e. liquid and solid state. The fact that the eutectic temperature can be much lower than the melting temperature of the two or more pure elements can be important in <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding.</b> [...] Eutectic alloys are deposited by sputtering, dual source evaporation or electroplating. It also can be formed by diffusion reactions of pure materials and subsequently melting of the eutectic composition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> is able {{to produce}} {{hermetically}} sealed packages and electrical interconnection within a single process (compare ultrasonic images). In addition this procedure is conducting at low processing temperatures, low resultant stress induced in final assembly, high bonding strength, large fabrication yield and a good reliability. Those attributes are dependent on the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} between the substrates.|$|E
50|$|Die {{attachment}} is {{the step}} during which a die is mounted and {{fixed to the}} package or support structure (header). For high-powered applications, the die is usually <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonded</b> onto the package, using e.g. gold-tin or gold-silicon solder (for good heat conduction). For low-cost, low-powered applications, the die is often glued directly onto a substrate (such as a printed wiring board) using an epoxy adhesive.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Our {{experiments}} highlight that gold-silicon eutectics {{are fairly}} {{influenced by the}} thickness of Au layer and the wastage of Si, i. e. the wasting thickness of the silicon die. In the experiments, a bonding intensity testing method, called Press-arm model, is used to verify the Au-Si <b>eutectics</b> <b>bonding</b> strength. Through the intensity value of the bonding interface, we analyze the eutectics condition of the bonding interface at different temperatures and discuss the optimum procession of the wafer capsulation...|$|R
40|$|The AuSi <b>eutectic</b> <b>bond</b> {{process is}} a well known and {{important}} technique {{in the field of}} single chip packaging. When it comes to low-cost and hermetic sealed packages for MEMS/NEMS sensors and actuators this technology has its decisive merits. The AuSi bonding is a low-temperature process with an electric conductive alloy. To achieve a reliable bonding with 100 % yield is quite difficult, especially for large areas. In our institute we made several analyses with different process parameters and surface properties variations. The results show that the surface condition of the silicon side of the wafer pair as well as the process parameters are very important factors in relation to the yield of the <b>eutectic</b> <b>bond.</b> We also did investigations on the thickness of the gold layer. Unlike conventional AuSi wafer bonding technologies [1] our technique does not need several m thick gold layers. We were able to achieve 100 % bond yield with 1500 nm and even 150 nm thin gold layers. Anoth er result we found was that a good bonding process is not only depending on the value of applied temperature and time, there is also an important influence because of the heat flow and applied pressure. In the presentation we would like to introduce our results and experience, plus we will present the coherences of parameter variations for achieving 100 % yield...|$|R
50|$|<b>Eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> {{is based}} on the ability of silicon (Si) to alloy with {{numerous}} metals and form a eutectic system. The most established eutectic formations are Si with gold (Au) or with aluminium (Al). This bonding procedure is most commonly used for Si or glass wafers that are coated with an Au/Al film and partly with adhesive layer (compare with following image).|$|E
50|$|The surface {{preparation}} {{is the most}} important step to accomplish a successful <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding.</b> This bonding procedure is due to oxide presence on the silicon substrates very limited based on the poor wettability of Au on the oxide layer. This leads to a poor adhesion of the eutectic bond. The oxide on the silicon surface acts as a diffusion barrier. The {{surface preparation}}'s main task is to facilitate the deposition of the eutectic metal by oxide removal or adhesion layer deposition.|$|E
50|$|Wafer Bonders join {{two or more}} aligned {{substrates}} {{to create}} an integrated circuit. The substrates can be joined, or bonded, using the following techniques: fusion bonding, anodic bonding, <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding,</b> solder bonding, glass frit bonding, adhesive bonding. Temporary wafer bonding is performed on thinned wafers that are placed on a carrier for support. It gets its name because the adhesive used for bonding is removed. This process is used mainly to manufacture 3D Integrated Circuits. SUSS MicroTec produces equipment that supports all of these bonding techniques.|$|E
40|$|Techniques were {{developed}} for assembling a linear array of optical fibers between two silicon plates and polishing the fiber {{ends in a}} plane perpendicular to the fiber axis. The silicon plates contained etched V-grooves for capturing the fibers. Optical fibers from two sources were evaluated, along with silicon plates supplied by two sources. Most of the arrays were assembled by epoxy bonding, but some {{effort was made to}} form a <b>eutectic</b> <b>bond</b> using gold metallized fibers with gold-coated silicon plates. Measurements were made of the uniformity of spacing of the fiber mode field centers in the linear array. The work was performed to develop a multi-fiber linear array connector to couple optical signals to and from optoelectronic devices...|$|R

40|$|TThis paper {{reports on}} the {{successful}} demonstration of a novel microfabrication method in which <b>eutectic</b> gold <b>bonded</b> microstructures are selectively electrochemically release etched. This method offers several advantages: both a strong permanent bond and a temporary bond is achieved on the same die, the footprint of the temporary bonded structures is allowed to be larger than the footprint of the permanently bonded structures and the used etchants provide a larger process compatibility than the etchants of other release etch methods. Eutectically bonded 350 mum wide silicon structures were fully released after 1 hour of electrochemical etching followed by 1. 5 hours wet etching of the TiW adhesion layer. QC 20101022 </p...|$|R
50|$|Further, {{the bonding}} has less restrictions, {{concerning}} substrate roughness and planarity than direct bonding. Compared to anodic bonding, no high voltages are required {{that can be}} detrimental to electrostatic MEMS. Additionally, the <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> procedure promotes a better out-gassing and hermeticity than bonding with organic intermediate layers. Compared to glass frit bonding, the advantage sticks out that the reduction of seal ring geometries, an increase of the hermeticity levels and a shrinking of device size is possible. The geometry of eutectic seals {{is characterized by a}} thickness of 1 - 5 µm and a wideness of > 50 µm. The use of eutectic alloy brings the advantage of providing electrical conduction and interfacing with redistribution layers.|$|E
40|$|Au/Si <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> is {{considered}} to BE a promising technology for creating 3 D structures and hermetic packaging in micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices. However, it suffers from the problems of a non-uniform bonding interface and complex processes for the interconnection of metal wires. This paper presents a novel Au/Si eutectic wafer bonding structure and an implementation method for MEMS accelerometer packaging. The related processing parameters influencing the Au/Si <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> quality were widely investigated. It was found that a high temperature of 400 °C with a low heating/cooling rate of 5 °C/min is crucial for successful Au/Si <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding.</b> High contact force is beneficial for bonding uniformity, but the bonding strength and bonding yield decrease when the contact force increases from 3000 to 5000 N due to the metal squeezing out of the interface. The application of TiW as an adhesion layer on a glass substrate, compared with a commonly used Cr or Ti layer, significantly improves the bonding quality. The bonding strength is higher than 50 MPa, and the bonding yield is above 90 % for the presented Au/Si <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding.</b> Furthermore, the wafer-level vacuum packaging of the MEMS accelerometer was achieved based on Au/Si <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> and anodic bonding with one process. Testing results show a nonlinearity of 0. 91 % and a sensitivity of 1. 06 V/g for the MEMS accelerometer. This Au/Si <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> process {{can be applied to}} the development of reliable, low-temperature, low-cost fabrication and hermetic packaging for MEMS devices...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an {{nickel-chromium}} (NiCr) alloy piezoresistive atmosphere pressure sensor, {{based on}} <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> is presented. Compared with conventionally silicon piezoresistive pressure sensor, {{it has the}} advantages with low cost and easy fabrication processes. First, NiCr alloy (80 : 20 wt%) is used as the strain detecting material, with a smaller but acceptable sensitivity and simpler processes. Second, <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> technology based on silver-tin (Ag-Sn) alloy, which is 3. 5 %wt Ag and 20 um thickness, is used as an alternative and easy bonding choice to complete the vacuum package. Bonding quality of <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> is evaluated by inspection through the deflection of diaphragm of silicon with more than 95 % of the area successfully bonded. The Pressure-Voltage characteristic test results suggest a precision within 0. 3 % in square fitting. The temperature characteristics is also tested and theoretically analyzed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a structural analysis and phonon transparency {{investigation of the}} Ge-Au-Ge <b>eutectic</b> <b>bond</b> interface. Interface development was intended to maximize the interfacial ballistic phonon transparency to enhance the detection of the dark matter candidate WIMPs. The process which was developed provides an interface which produces minimal stress, low amounts of impurities, and insures Ge lattice continuity through the interface. For initial Au thicknesses of greater than 1, 000 {angstrom} Au per substrate side, eutectic epitaxial growth resulted in a Au dendritic structure with 95 % cross sectional and 90 % planar Au interfacial area coverages. In sections in which Ge bridged the interface, lattice continuity across the interface was apparent. Epitaxial solidification of the eutectic interface with initial Au thicknesses < 500 A per substrate side produced Au agglomerations thereby reducing the Au planar interfacial area coverage to as little as 30 %. The mechanism for Au coalescence was attributed to lateral diffusion of Ge and Au in the liquid phase during solidification. Phonon transmission studies were performed on eutectic interfaces with initial Au thicknesses of 1, 000 {angstrom}, 500 {angstrom}, and 300 {angstrom} per substrate side. Phonon imaging of eutectically bonded samples with initial Au thicknesses of 300 {angstrom}/side revealed reproducible interfacial percent phonon transmissions from 60 % to 70 %. Line scan phonon imaging verified the results. Phonon propagation TOF spectra distinctly showed the predominant phonon propagation mode was ballistic. This was substantiated by phonon focusing effects apparent in the phonon imaging data. The degree of interface transparency to phonons and resulting phonon propagation modes correlate with {{the structure of the}} interface following eutectic solidification. Structural studies of samples with initial Au thickness of 1, 000 {angstrom}/side appear to correspond with the phonon transmission study...|$|R

Robust high temperature joining and integration technologies are enabling for the fabrication and manufacturing of large and complex shaped components. The development of a new joining approach called SET (Single-step Elevated Temperature) joining will be described along with the overview of previously developed joining approaches including high temperature brazing, ARCJoinT (Affordable, Robust Ceramic Joining Technology), diffusion bonding, and REABOND (Refractory <b>Eutectic</b> Assisted <b>Bonding).</b> Unlike other approaches, SET joining does not have any lower temperature phases and will therefore have a use temperature above 1315 C.

40|$|Abstract—Silicon fusion and <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> {{processes}} {{based on}} the technique of localized heating have been successfully demonstrated. Phosphorus-doped polysilicon and gold films are applied separately in the silicon-to-glass fusion bonding and silicon-to-gold <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> experiments. These films are patterned as line-shape resistive heaters with widths of 5 or 7 m {{for the purpose of}} heating and bonding. In the experiments, sil-icon-to-glass fusion bonding and silicon-to-gold <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> are successfully achieved at temperature above 1000 C and 800 C, respectively, by applying 1 -MPa contact pressure. Both bonding processes can achieve bonding strength comparable to the fracture toughness of bulk silicon in less than 5 min. Without using global heating furnaces, localized bonding process is con-ducted in the common environment of room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Although these processes are accomplished within a confined bonding region and under high temperature, the substrate temperature remains low. This new class of bonding scheme has potential applications for microelectromechanical systems fabrication and packaging that require low-temperature processing at the wafer level, excellent bonding strength, and hermetic sealing characteristics.

40|$|Well-logging and {{aerospace}} applications require electronics capable of withstanding elevated temperature operation. A {{key element of}} high temperature packaging technology is the Si die attach material, and a comparative study of two die attach systems for use in harsh environment has been performed. Die bond sample packages, using commercial adhesives and an Au-Si eutectic solder, have been manufactured and were subsequently thermally exposed for various times at 250 and 300 °C respectively. The adhesive die bond packages comprised a high temperature co-fired ceramic (HTCC) substrate with W, Ni and Au metallisations whereas the Au-Si die bond packages used thick film Au metallised on a Al₂O₃ substrate. Optimisation of the <b>eutectic</b> die <b>bonding</b> parameters was successfully performed for the Au-Si system by an experimental design method, which improved mean and spread of maximum bonded areas and consequently, the shear load to failure. Bonded area was systematically assessed by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) followed by digital image analysis (DIA).

40|$|The {{operation}} of electronic packages under exceptionally harsh environments presents a significant {{challenge for the}} microelectronics industry, for example, in down-hole, well-logging and turbo-machinery applications. High temperature Au based solders are one potential candidate for die attachment for harsh environments and is already used in limited cases. For Au-Si die bonding, some of the Si is provided by diffusion from the Si die itself. Therefore, the interfacial reaction between the Si and Au-Si thin foil solder preform is {{a key factor in}} the control of the die bonding process. Unfortunately, during the die bonding process, defects such as voids, delaminations, and impurities are not unusual. These defects are caused by the assembly process, chemical impurities, soldering reactions, and thermal stresses. Understanding these defects is critical for the reliable performance of the devices after bonding. In this paper, optimization of the Au-Si <b>eutectic</b> die <b>bonding</b> has been performed and near 100 % bonded area confirmed by scanning acoustic microscopy achieved consistently. Die attach reliability was investigated by thermal shock and thermal cycling treatments, after which the bonded area showed some signs of degradation.

Especially {{the role of}} integration technologies like packaging at different levels, combining MEMS with integrated circuits, and to realize 3 -dimensional packaged devices {{is more important than}} ever. Bonding technologies at wafer level are key factors for 3 -d integration, realizing the mechanical bond and fulfilling certain requirements like strength, hermeticity, and reliability as well as the electrical interconnection of the different functional components. From a great variety of bonding techniques <b>eutectic</b> <b>bonding</b> has got a special importance today because both hermetically sealed packages and electrical interconnects could be performed within one bonding process. Furthermore, there are some advantages such as low processing temperature, low resulting stress, and high bonding strength. These properties are mainly investigated up today. Since the early 90 -ies eutectic wafer bonding is known from very large scale integration (VLSI) and is used very often in industry.
