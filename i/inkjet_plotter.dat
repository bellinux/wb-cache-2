40|$|This paper {{reports on}} our recent achievements, using a {{hot-melt}} ink system, towards the fabrication of ceramic bodies by controlled droplet deposition. Key factors for jetting {{were identified and}} the rheological behaviour of fairly concentrated particulate suspensions was optimised to match the window of print-head operation. As a demonstrator, several unfired objects containing 30 vol. % colloidal Al 2 O 3 dispersed in paraffin were fabricated, using a three-dimensional <b>inkjet</b> <b>plotter</b> primarily developed for rapid prototyping. This platform is currently being improved to allow the fabrication of shapes with higher particulate contents. Preliminary studies using a 75 mum orifice diameter inkjet print-head have produced encouraging results...|$|E
50|$|Worldwide, most survey offices {{used this}} printer before color <b>inkjet</b> <b>plotters</b> become popular. Liquid ink {{electrostatic}} printers were mostly available in 36 to 54 in width and also 6 color printing. These {{were also used}} to print large billboards. It was first introduced by Versatec, which was later bought by Xerox. 3M also used to make these printers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} HP-GL language did {{not support}} definition of line width, as this parameter {{was determined by the}} pens loaded into the plotter. With the advent of the first <b>inkjet</b> <b>plotters,</b> line width for the [...] "pens" [...] specified within the HP-GL files had to be set at the printer so it would know what line width to print for each pen, a cumbersome and error-prone process. With Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language/2 aka HP-GL/2, definition of line width was introduced into the language and allowed for elimination of this step. Also, among other improvements a binary file format was defined that allowed for smaller files and shorter file transfer times, and the minimal resolution was reduced.|$|R
