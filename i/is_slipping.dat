Under Oregon, the Siletz terrane appears to extend 25 to possibly 35km into the trough between the subducting Juan de Fuca plate and {{the edge of the}} continent, where it <b>is</b> <b>slipping</b> over sediments accumulated {{in the bottom of the}} trough. [...] The Crescent terrane (under Washington) is believed to be thinner, from as little as 12 and 22km under the western and eastern ends of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but possibly as much as 20 and 35km thick.|$|E
500|$|Ian Inglis admires {{the song}} as [...] "one of Harrison's most {{haunting}} and mysterious compositions", and writes of the recording: [...] "The gentle, largely acoustic backing, and Harrison's achingly beautiful vocal give the song a nebulous, yearning quality, {{almost as if}} something barely understood <b>is</b> <b>slipping</b> out of sight." [...] Inglis likens [...] "Be Here Now" [...] to the performance monologue [...] "Time" [...] by English actress and author Joyce Grenfell, whose conclusion that [...] "there {{is no such thing}} as time – only this very minute, and I am in it" [...] he finds echoed in Harrison's [...] "sense of wonder and helplessness in the face of the spiritual, scientific, and metaphysical implications of time".|$|E

[...] Robert Lincoln in 1874 formally agreed to let Hay and Nicolay use his father's papers; by 1875, they were engaged in research. Hay and Nicolay enjoyed exclusive access to Lincoln's papers, which were not opened to other researchers until 1947. They gathered documents written by others, as well as many of the Civil War books already being published. [...] They at rare times relied on memory, such as Nicolay's recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated, but for much of the rest relied on research.|$|E

25|$|The LB {{appears to}} have invented {{slipping}} coaches {{from the rear of}} express trains at intermediate stations for onward transmission to smaller stations. The earliest recorded example was at Haywards Heath in February 1858, where coaches for Hastings <b>were</b> <b>slipped</b> from a London-Brighton express. Thereafter the practice was used by other railways. Before 1914, 21 coaches <b>were</b> <b>slipped</b> each day on the Brighton main line. Coaches <b>were</b> <b>slipped</b> at Horley and Three Bridges for stations to East Grinstead, Forest Row and Horsham, or at Haywards Heath for stations to Brighton and Eastbourne. The practice continued until electrification of the main line in 1932.|$|R

2500|$|A fairly recent {{innovation}} in automobiles is electronic traction control. Traction control typically uses a vehicle's braking system to slow a spinning wheel. This forced slowing emulates {{the function of}} a limited-slip differential, and, by using the brakes more aggressively to ensure wheels are being driven at the same speed, can also emulate a locking differential. It {{should be noted that}} this technique normally requires wheel sensors to detect when a wheel <b>is</b> <b>slipping,</b> and only activates when wheel slip is detected. Therefore, there is typically no mechanism to actively prevent wheel slip (i.e., you can't [...] "lock the differential" [...] in advance of wheel slip), rather the system is designed to expressly permit wheel slip to occur, and then attempt to send torque to the wheels with the best traction. If preventing all-wheel slip is a requirement, this is a limiting design.|$|E

2500|$|The sonnet {{begins with}} the speaker expressing lament to youth with [...] "O that you were yourself!" [...] More simply, the speaker deplores that youth isn't {{absolute}} and permanent, and with [...] "yourself", the speaker is referring to the figure of youth's soul. Following this, the speaker address the youth as [...] "love", further developing the speaker's theme of adoration and personal affection for youth. From there, the speaker tells this youth that [...] "you are / No longer yours, than you yourself here live", saying that the youth's identity is constantly fading away from him as he ages, {{as if he is}} unbecoming himself. With the lines [...] "Against this coming end you should prepare / And your sweet semblance to some other give", the speaker is simply saying that the youth's life <b>is</b> <b>slipping</b> away day after day, and if he doesn't get married and have children, he will lose his identity to his death. Continuing from this idea, the speaker says [...] "So should that beauty which you hold in lease / Find no determination; then you were / Yourself again after yourself's decease, / When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear", all meaning that whatever beauty the youth still has is only temporary (leased to him) and will be lost, unless he has children who continue the legacy and identity of his youthful beauty even after death. Continuing with [...] "Who lets so fair a house fall to decay," [...] the speaker refers to the youth as this [...] "house" [...] in reference to his fair body and his fair lineage. Adding to this, the speaker continues on with [...] "Which husbandry in honour might uphold, / Against the stormy gusts of winter's day / And barren rage of death's eternal cold?". [...] These lines suggest that by taking up marriage and becoming a husband and a father, the youth might be able to maintain his essence of youth against the devastations of time and age. This, the speaker compares to storms and winter, ending with the threat of the eternal nature of death, at which point the youth would be too late in renewing himself. In the ending couplet, the speaker mirrors his starting wail of lament in line 1 with [...] "O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know, / You had a father: let your son say so." [...] Here, the speaker is separating the youth figure he adores from those he considers foolish, or [...] "unthrifts", and connects that to the youth's inheritance, suggesting that only [...] "unthrifts" [...] would ignore their inheritance of life and youth and deny their own fathers' wish for continued lineage and legacy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day began}} well, {{and the weather}} was {{pleasant}} and sunny. Steve Waugh immediately unleashed his pack of fast bowlers, who posed a formidable threat to the Indian pair of Sehwag and Chopra. But the two openers, handled them with ease and looked {{the part of a}} top order pair. Sehwag took advantage of an ordinary bowling spell by Andy Bichel, flicking and driving confidently. He could not, however, negotiate the full and swinging deliveries and was dropped off one such delivery by Nathan Bracken. But the speedster had his revenge as he scalped Sehwag for his first wicket in tests. Sehwag departed for a fast 45 from only 51 balls. The score stood at 61/1. Later, Rahul Dravid batting on one, was tricked by a Jason Gillespie delivery into poking at a delivery that swung and seamed away. This produced a fatal edge that Hayden gleefully accepted. Dravid departed for 1 and the score was 62/2. In the very same over, Sachin Tendulkar came out to bat. After batting out two uneventful balls, Gillespie let loose a quick one. Picking the line of the ball early as the ball seemed like missing the off-stump, Tendulkar shouldered arms and the ball went and thudded onto his pads. Umpire Steve Bucknor looked blank for some time and finally raised his finger. Bucknor had already had a history of bad umpiring earlier in this match, overriding straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen in their first innings, and this decision made things worse for him. His decision did not go too well with Tendulkar's Australian fans. Some of them reportedly made remarks like: [...] ""Didn't he turn down two straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen on the first day? Don't they call him a batsman's umpire?" [...] and some others said, [...] "Hey mate, we came to watch Tendulkar bat, not Bucknor wag his finger." [...] But Tendulkar took the decision with grace. Robert Craddock, writing in The Australian, commented that, [...] "World cricket does not need electronic help to sort out lbw decisions. It just needs better umpiring. Steve Bucknor shouldn't have needed a camera to give Sachin Tendulkar not out when he was struck high ... Bucknor, a delightful fellow, was a great umpire at his zenith but there have been signs in recent times he <b>is</b> <b>slipping</b> and there is a gap emerging between his still high reputation and his performance." [...] Rajan Bala also wrote in the Asian Age:"In an earlier birth Bucknor might have been one of those Roman emperors who ensured that the crowds at the Coliseum were kept in suspense before he gave the thumbs-down signal to end the life of a gladiator or a Christian." [...] In fact, so annoyed were the fans that during Ganguly's innings, when he was struck in the shoulder, they said aloud: [...] "Give him out now." [...] The comment was noted to be quite sarcastic in nature.|$|E

50|$|<b>Slip</b> {{stitches}} may <b>be</b> {{used for}} an easier method of double knitting that requires only one yarn be handled at one time. As a concrete example, consider a two-color pattern with {{a multiple of}} four stitches (labeled ABCD) being knit on double-pointed circular needles. On the first row, using color 1, stitch A is knitted, stitch B is purled, stitch C <b>is</b> <b>slipped</b> wyib and stitch D <b>is</b> <b>slipped</b> wyif. The knitter then slides the stitches {{back to the beginning}} (recall that the needles are double-pointed). Then, using color 2, stitch A <b>is</b> <b>slipped</b> wyib, stitch B <b>is</b> <b>slipped</b> wyif, stitch C is knitted and stitch D is purled. The knitter then turns the work and repeats indefinitely. The knitted and slipped wyib stitches come forward, whereas the purled and wyif stitches recede, resulting in a (very warm!) double-knit scarf alternating in the two colors with beautiful drape. The knit and purl stitches produce the front and back fabrics, respectively, of the double-knitted fabric while the slipped stitches allow for the alternation of color.|$|R
