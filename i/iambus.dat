25|$|First of all, he is {{the author}} of the {{standard}} manuals of Textual Criticism (1978), Greek Metre (1982) and Greek Music (1992). In case 'manual' suggests a second-hand compilation, it should be explicitly stated that all three books represent a deeply original viewpoint. Secondly, in the editing and explication of Greek poetic texts, West has contributed exemplary editions of the fragments of Hesiod (with R. Merkelbach, 1967); of the Greek Iambic and Elegiac poets (1971-2; 2 1989, 1992); of the Anacreontea (1984; 2 1993); of Aeschylus (1990); and of the Iliad (vol. I, 1998). His contribution to <b>Iambus</b> and Elegy was reinforced by invaluable adversaria in Studies in Greek Elegy and <b>Iambus</b> (1974), and his papers on Greek lyric poetry would in themselves make a substantial volume. He celebrated the millennium with a new text of the fundamental poem of Western civilisation, Homer's Iliad. In addition, there are critical texts, with magisterial commentaries, of Hesiod's Theogony (1966) and Works and Days (1978), and The Orphic Poems (1983) and The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women (1985), which reconstruct with great acumen and ingenuity two literary genres familiar to the Greeks but lost to us except in fragments. Thirdly, his interest in the Greeks and the Orient, first exemplified in Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient (1971), recently re-emerged in The East Face of Helicon (1997), a comprehensive and timely investigation of parallels between Greek literature and the literatures of the Ancient Near East based on first-hand acquaintance with the texts.|$|E

25|$|The poem is skilfully structured. There is an {{introduction}} briefly outlining the situation (lines 1–2), a large midsection {{made up of}} curses (lines 3–14) and predictions (15–20), and finally an epilogue (21–24). Three winds (Auster, Eurus, Aquilo) are the chief figures in {{the main body of}} the poem and also at the very end (Tempestates). Each wind is assigned its own couplet (lines 3–8), but only the south wind is addressed. The south wind gets another mention, though by a different name, 'Notus' (line 20), so that these two mentions provide the poem with the kind of symmetry found in Ring composition. By the latter part of the poem, however, the south wind is no longer being addressed, a change that happens when Mevius is addressed instead (lines 15–20). This change in addressee is preceded by a mythological episode taken from the heroic Ajax legend, occurring exactly in the middle of the poem (lines 11–14), where it functions as a sort of piano nobile, with curses before and predictions afterwards. In some versions of the poem, Mevius continues to be addressed right to the very end, i.e. iuverit has been taken to be iuveris instead (line 22). Some scholars prefer iuveris since it implies that only Mevius ends up as rich spoil for the gulls, but other scholars argue that it is quite consistent with <b>iambus</b> for the whole crew to be punished on account of one offender, a result implied by the impersonal ending iuverit in the version here. Moreover, the impersonal ending marks a clear break between the epilogue and {{the main body of the}} poem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spread of}} {{literacy}} impacted on all ancient poetry, <b>iambus</b> included. Its influence was already becoming evident in Athens {{by the fifth}} century BC, gradually changing the nature of poetry from a performance before a local group to a literary artifact with an international reach. By the Hellenistic period, the librarian/scholar Callimachus claimed to be following the example of Hipponax yet introduced {{a wider range of}} content and a more literary and intellectual focus. He also aligned <b>iambus</b> more closely with other genres such as curse poetry (Ἀραί) and farewell poetry (propemptika, [...] ). <b>Iambus</b> was taken up as a political weapon by some public figures in Rome, such as Cato The Elder, who, in an account by Plutarch: ...|$|E
2500|$|It isn't {{clear what}} role Archilochus {{played in the}} {{development}} of the literary genre at the beginning of the seventh century. Demeter was a significant deity in his home island, Paros, but she isn't prominent in his surviving poetry. Possibly he became involved in <b>iambus</b> via the cult of Dionysus. This cult's association with <b>iambus</b> seems to be indicated etymologically by the poetic form associated with Dionysus, the dithyramb, a term which appears to include the same root as [...] "iambus". Early dithyrambs were a [...] "riotous affair" [...] and Archilochus was prominent in the controversial development of Dionyssian worship on Paros (possibly in relation to phallic rites).|$|E

2500|$|It is {{not known}} who Mevius is nor what he is {{supposed}} to have done wrong. The name could be of a real person but it could also function like [...] "John Doe" [...] and thus it might be a stock figure with some special significance for the original audience. Some scholars identify him with the Maevius rubbished as a contemptible poet by Virgil in Eclogues 3.90 but there is no proof for such an identification. He could represent an imaginary scapegoat intended to avert the gods' anger from the poet's circle of 'friends', a device common in the archaic <b>iambus</b> of Hipponax and Archilochus: in this case, the [...] "friends" [...] may be understood to be Roman citizens at a time of social and political decay.

2500|$|<b>Iambus</b> or iambic poetry was a {{genre of}} ancient Greek poetry that {{included}} {{but was not}} restricted to the iambic meter and whose origins modern scholars have traced to the cults of Demeter and Dionysus. The genre featured insulting and obscene language and sometimes it {{is referred to as}} [...] "blame poetry". For Alexandrian editors, however, <b>iambus</b> signified any poetry of an informal kind that was intended to entertain, and it seems to have been performed on similar occasions as elegy even though lacking elegy's decorum. The Archaic Greek poets Archilochus, Semonides and Hipponax were among the most famous of its early exponents. The Alexandrian poet Callimachus composed [...] "iambic" [...] poems against contemporary scholars, which were collected in an edition of about a thousand lines, of which fragments [...] of thirteen poems survive. He in turn influenced Roman poets such as Catullus, who composed satirical epigrams that popularized Hipponax's choliamb. Horace's Epodes on the other hand were mainly imitations of Archilochus and, as with the Greek poet, his invectives took the forms both of private revenge and denunciation of social offenders.|$|E

2500|$|There is no sure {{evidence}} about the original venue for iambic poetry but the drinking party (or symposium) and the cult festival were probably the main occasions. Nor do we know clearly what role iambic poetry played in ancient society. It was certainly complex. It seems to have found voice during times of social change and political dissent, when the poet felt entitled or empowered to preach and condemn. Semonides, probably about {{the middle of the}} seventh century, composed iambic verse on a misogynist theme, but without the invective and obscenity of Archilochus. A hundred years after Archilochus, Hipponax was composing choliambs, a deliberately awkward version of the iambic trimeter symbolizing mankind's imperfections and vices, yet by then <b>iambus</b> seems to have been performed mainly for entertainment (our understanding of his work however might change significantly when and as more fragments are unearthed). The genre's religious and moral value was evidently not appreciated by the fifth century lyric poet Pindar, who condemned Archilochus for being [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] and [...] "grown fat on the harsh words of hate", yet Archilochus's brand of <b>iambus</b> could still find sympathetic audiences even in the first century AD, when the philosopher, Dio Chrysostom, compared him with Homer in these terms: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature of}} <b>iambus</b> changed from one epoch to another, as becomes obvious if we compare two poems that are {{otherwise}} very similarHorace's Epode 10 (around 30 BC) and the [...] "Strasbourg" [...] papyrus, a fragment attributed either to Archilochus or Hipponax (seventh and sixth century respectively). The modern world {{became aware of}} the Greek poem only in 1899, when it was discovered by R. Reitzenstein among other papyri at the University Library of Strasbourg. He published it straight away, recognizing its significance and its resemblance to Horace's poem. This study however begins with Horace and it is based on comments by Eduard Fraenkel.|$|E
2500|$|Neoteric poets such as Catullus {{combined}} {{a native}} tradition of satirical epigram with Hipponax's pungent invective to form neatly crafted, personal attacks. Hipponactean choliambs were among Catullus's {{most often used}} meters but the spirit of <b>iambus</b> seems to have infused much of his non-iambic verse as well. Horace nominally modelled his Epodes {{on the work of}} Archilochus but he mainly followed the example of Callimachus, relying on painstaking craftsmanship rather than instinctive vitriol and broadening the range of the genre. Thus for example he introduced a panagyric element in support of Augustus (Epodes 1 and 9), a lyrical element (Epode 13), and a suggestion of love poetry (Epodes 11 and 14). Moreover, his iambic persona is deliberately presented as powerless, in contrast to the swaggering persona of Archilochus. Horace's weak iambic persona is not inconsistent with the genre. Traditionally the iambic poet, though he bullies others, is a victim too. Thus Archilochus was said to have driven his would-be in-laws to suicide by his invectives after they had cheated him out of a promised marriage, and Hipponax was said to have driven Bupalus to suicide after being caricatured by him in a sculpture. Similarly the author of the Strasbourg fragment below is motivated by revenge. Moreover, Horace's thematic variety is not without parallel among archaic poets such as Archilochus and Hipponax: the mood of the genre is meant to appear spontaneous and that inevitably led to some [...] "hodepodge" [...] contexts. Whatever his unique contribution may have been, Horace still managed to recreate something of the ancient spirit of the genre, alerting his companions to threats facing them as a group, in this case as Roman citizens of a doomed republic: ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Masson's {{remarks on}} the versification of Milton are, in the main, judicious, but when he ventures on particulars, one cannot always agree with him. He seems to {{understand}} that our prosody is accentual merely, and yet, {{when he comes to}} what he calls variations, he talks of the [...] "substitution of the Trochee, the Pyrrhic, or the Spondee, for the regular <b>Iambus,</b> or of the Anapaest, the Dactyl, the Tribrach, etc., for the same." [...] This is always misleading. The shift of the accent in what Mr. Masson calls [...] "dissyllabic variations" [...] is common to all pentameter verse, and, in the other case, most of the words cited as trisyllables either were not so in Milton's day,[375] or were so or not at choice of the poet, according to their place in the verse. There is not an elision of Milton's without precedent in the dramatists from whom he learned to write blank-verse. Milton was a greater metrist than any of them, except Marlowe and Shakespeare, and he employed the elision (or the slur) oftener than they to give a faint undulation or retardation to his verse, only because his epic form demanded it more for variety's sake. How Milton would have read them, is another question. He certainly often marked them by an apostrophe in his manuscripts. He doubtless composed according to quantity, so far as that is possible in English, and as Cowper somewhat extravagantly says, [...] "gives almost as many proofs of it in his 'Paradise Lost' as there are lines in the poem."[376] But when Mr. Masson tells us that ...|$|E

A great number of the respondents stated that the disease is transmitted through mosquito bites, but they did not know the mode of the transmission. A small number of the respondents were of the opinion that the disease was hereditary and this knowledge was adopted from the local inhabitants. The attitude of the respondents towards filariasis control measures was positive, and it was shown among others, by their willingness to be bled for filariasis examination. Their behaviour in its connection with filariasis transmission was not supportive towards filariasis control e. g. they used to stay in the ladang, and chat outdoor during the night without protection against mosquito bites. From this study it was also known that they exposed themselves to the mosquito bites mainly in the ladang when they take guard of their crops from pests damages. Their low education affected their perception towards filariasis and will hamper health education on filariasis control. </p...|$|R
