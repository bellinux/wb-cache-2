40|$|Harvesting {{of highly}} {{valuable}} {{non-timber forest products}} (NTFPs) has been considered a win-win strategy where local people profit while conserving forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. Nevertheless the sustainability of NTFP harvesting has been debated as the nature of NTFPs, harvesting regimes, and scale of commercialization are highly heterogeneous and few studies have evaluated the cumulative ecological and economic effects of such regimes. Here, we assessed the medium-term (10 years) sustainability of NTFP harvesting, using Chameadorea palm leaves, a major NTFP from Mesoamerica that is highly valued in the international floral industry, as a case study. We used an experimental ecological study and an economic assessment to analyse the sustainability of leaf harvesting in C. ernesti-augustii. A four-year leaf removal experiment was conducted to assess effects of increasing levels of defoliation (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % leaf removal, biannually) on palm survivorship, leaf production and leaf quality. Results of this experiment were combined with estimations of harvest economic value to make projections {{of the availability of}} leaves and profit per unit area. Finally, we determined harvesting regimes that maximize profit while maintaining medium-term viability of exploited populations. Palms tolerated up to 50 % chronic defoliation, but higher defoliation levels reduced survivorship, leaf production, and leaf quality. In the long-term, this 50 % defoliation level maximized harvest volume and profit without significantly affecting palm survival and leaf quality. Our results show that harvesters face the dilemma of either maximizing short-term income leading to rapid <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks,</b> or maintaining exploited populations but maximizing income in the long-term. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that intermediate harvesting levels (≤ 50 % leaf removal) are needed to achieve long-term sustainability of Chameadorea palm leaves. Results of this study have an immediate application for the amendment of the official Mexican law, which enables higher harvesting intensities of Chamaedorea leaves, and for the design of sustainable management strategies. Applications of such strategies should consider community-based management, fair markets, regulating norms, as well as a thorough communication among stakeholders...|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} {{pictorial}} designs {{is governed by}} a combination of anniversaries, required annual issues (such as Christmas stamps), postal rate changes, <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> existing stamp <b>stocks,</b> and popular demand. Since postal administrations are either a branch of government or an official monopoly under governmental supervision, the government has ultimate control over the choice of designs. This means that the designs tend to depict a country as the government would like it to be perceived, rather than as it really is. The Soviet Union issued thousands of stamps extolling the successes of communism, even as it was falling apart, while in the US the only contemporary stamp hinting at the unrest of the 1960s is an issue exhorting Americans to support their local police.|$|R
40|$|I {{hold that}} the {{essential}} distinction between statics and dynamics, if the terms must be used, {{is not the}} same as, nor even closely related to that between stocks and flows. In fact the most perfect instances of statical problems are those which deal with "steady flows " of labour capital and goods, of wages, interest and prices in a stationary country: in which each year is just like the past, in which each generation is like that which went before. It may be noted, as an incidental confirmation of this opinion, that our choicest illustrations of the statical or stationary state relate to agricultural and not to mineral prices. Now the annual output of a farm is a true flow: but the annual output of a mine is not a true flow, it comes out of stock: and, if the mineral veins are not practically unlimited, the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> will disrupt the statical rest.

40|$|We {{incorporate}} a non-renewable resource {{in a standard}} framework of endogenous growth through expanding varieties. Moreover, we allow for a backstop technology that is able to produce a perfect substitute for the resource. Our model is used to analyze resource extraction and technological progress over time. Three consecutive regimes of energy use can emerge in the economy: only resource extraction, simultaneous use, and complete reliance on the backstop technology. The introduction of the backstop technology crucially affects the time paths of fossil fuel extraction and technological progress. We provide conditions under which either peak-oil emerges, or the extraction path is monotonically increasing or decreasing until <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> the resource <b>stock.</b> The rate <b>of</b> technological progress is non-monotonic over time: it declines initially, starts increasing when the economy approaches the regime change and jumps down once the resource stock is exhausted...|$|R

60|$|But {{there are}} two errors in it. First of all, Germany's annual savings, after what she has {{suffered}} in the war and by the Peace, will fall far short {{of what they were}} before, and, if they are taken from her year by year in future, they cannot again reach their previous level. The loss of Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and Upper Silesia could not be assessed in terms of surplus productivity at less than $250,000,000 annually. Germany is supposed to have profited about $500,000,000 per annum from her ships, her foreign investments, and her foreign banking and connections, all of which have now been taken from her. Her saving on armaments is far more than balanced by her annual charge for pensions now estimated at $1,250,000,000,[132] which represents a real loss of productive capacity. And even if we put on one side the burden of the internal debt, which amounts to 24 milliards of marks, as being a question of internal distribution rather than of productivity, we must still allow for the foreign debt incurred by Germany during the war, the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> her <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> raw materials, the depletion of her live-stock, the impaired productivity of her soil from lack of manures and of labor, and the diminution in her wealth from the failure to keep up many repairs and renewals over a period of nearly five years. Germany is not as rich as she was before the war, and the diminution in her future savings for these reasons, quite apart from the factors previously allowed for, could hardly be put at less than ten per cent, that is $200,000,000 annually.|$|R
40|$|Immediately {{after the}} Liberation the Netherlands {{were faced with}} a severe {{shortage}} of all essential goods, particularly in the Western part of the country, where the period of famine had led to a complete <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> all <b>stocks,</b> and where the Germans had deliberately destroyed the railway system. At that time there was no alternative to a policy of rigorous planning, approaching that of a war economy. After the worst damage had been repaired and the shortages partially alleviated, {{it became apparent that}} the pent-up demand (backed by abundant liquid reserves), was so much larger than production and imports together, that an allocation and rationing system would be necessary to prevent inflation. It was not a matter of principle, but the compelling nature of the circumstances which led to the continuation of a policy of detailed planning. Even now the situation in the Netherlands, as compared with that of the other North-Western European countries, makes rigorous planning more necessary than elsewhere. The combined effect of (a) war damage, (b) the loss of income from overseas investments, (c) the chaos in the German hinterland, and (d) the large increase in population, is affecting the Netherlands more seriously than any other North-Western European country. The primary object of this planning is to restore equilibrium between : (a) Imports and exports; (b) Supply of consumers' goods and a tolerable standard of living for the mass of the population; (c) New investment; and (d) The increase in population. In the more remote future it is probable that the economic policy of the Netherlands will gradually tend towards an employment policy which will use more indirect methods of influencing production, consumption and prices. It is the intention of this paper to give a short account of the chief features of the present system of drawing-up the nation's economic budget...|$|R

40|$|Filaments are {{intrusions}} of upwelling {{water into}} the sea, separated from the surrounding water by fronts. Current knowledge explains the enhanced primary production and phytoplankton growth found in frontal areas by external factors like nutrient input. The question is whether this enhancement is also caused by intrinsic factors, i. e. simple mixing without external forcing. In order to study the direct effect of frontal mixing on organisms, disturbing external influx has to be excluded. Therefore mixing was simulated by joining waters originating from {{inside and outside the}} filament in mesocosms (tanks). These experiments were conducted during two cruises in the northern Benguela upwelling system in September 2013 and January 2014. The mixed waters reached a much higher net primary production and chlorophyll a (chla) concentration than the original waters already 2 - 3 days after their merging. The peak in phytoplankton biomass stays longer than the chla peak. After their maxima, primary production rates decreased quickly due to depletion of the nutrients. The increase in colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) may indicate excretion and degradation. Zooplankton is not quickly reacting on the changed conditions. We conclude that already simple mixing of two water bodies, which occurs generally at fronts between upwelled and ambient water, leads to a short-term stimulation of the phytoplankton growth. However, after the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> the nutrient <b>stock,</b> external nutrient supply is necessary to maintain the enhanced phytoplankton growth in the frontal area. Based on these data, some generally important ecological factors are discussed as for example nutrient ratios and limitations, silicate requirements and growth rates...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{a series}} of maxims, widely known in policy and {{academic}} circles as the ‘principles of good governance’, which state that policymaking in the European Union (EU) should be participatory, conducted as close to citizens as practicable, transparent, accountable, effective and coherent. These maxims were introduced into EU fisheries management {{as part of a}} radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 2002. This reform was instituted in response to criticisms of a prevailing management regime alleged to be inefficient, undemocratic, and potentially responsible for an environmental crisis: the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> key fish <b>stocks.</b> The research for this work has found that there are limits to the actual achievement of good governance in EU fisheries. In practice governance innovations are very often contradictory and rife with tensions. I reason that such problems result not merely from policy implementation failures; they constitute a more endemic feature of the CFP reforms. We can begin to understand these limits to good governance principles by looking to Agamben’s permanent state of exception thesis. Agamben’s theory helps to show how these contradictions and tensions occur under new governance regimes, because the relationship between democratic norms (like good governance) and political power is no longer clear. I argue that this blurring has been exploited by groups seeking influence in these new regimes. They do this through citing a supposed need for emergency measures to mitigate crisis. Although this research broadly supports the state of exception thesis, my analysis leads me to question some aspects of its application in contemporary governance spaces...|$|R
