30|$|The {{folding process}} in the {{automobile}} industry has to be simplified {{in order to obtain}} a general model for master samples. These probes are used to validate the ultrasonic system with defined errors. To do this, specimens were defined that have a sufficiently long (150  mm) and straight seam line. The <b>flange</b> <b>length</b> produced is 8  mm (seam bonding area a and c) and therefore within the limits of 4  mm to 12  mm for typical seam bond <b>flange</b> <b>length</b> [20]. According to the technical drawing, the geometrical dimensions of the seam bond are two adhesive layers of 200  μm and two steel sheets of 700  μm thickness. Glass spheres of a defined size are mixed together with the adhesive to ensure the correct adhesive layer thickness [21]. Because of the low percentage by volume of 2 % the effect of the glass spheres on the ultrasonic wave is negligible. Both the inner and outer sheet metal panels have two holes cut by laser to use as reference points for fixing the position of the metal sheets in the folding tool. For estimating the minimum defect sizes and defect classes [7] that can be detected by the system, the seam bond has been produced with a Viton foil in place of the adhesive in seam area a and b. This film, which has similar acoustic properties as the adhesive, has laser-perforated holes of various different diameters ranging from 1 to 6  mm. The overlapping of these defects is excluded by the minimum of 9  mm distance between the individual holes. This distance is greater than the length (8  mm) of the ultrasonic transducers used. The use of the Viton foil instead of the adhesive is necessary since the real manufacturing process cannot produce defects with defined dimensions.|$|E

Availability of a proven prosthetic vein valve could provide such an option by reducing venous reflux while permitting normal antegrade flow. Methods A new prosthetic vein valve design has been developed which mimics the function of a natural valve by ensuring complete closure of the leaflets with minimal obstruction for antegrade flow. A 2 : 1 mock-up of the device was tested to evaluate its ability to prevent regurgitation and several key modifications were made. A subsequently re-designed 1 : 1 prototype was then built in 4 slightly different size configurations and then each tested under physiologic conditions of pulsatile flow in both supine and standing positions. Results Each of the configurations showed acceptable amounts of antegrade resistance and effective orifice area and showed low values of regurgitation and % reflux with two of the prototype configurations (<b>flange</b> <b>lengths</b> of 2. 5 mm and 3. 75 mm) having corresponding values of 97 %, 11 mL, and 36 %, respectively. These values are particularly striking when compared to the corresponding regurgitation and % reflux values of 60 mL and 205 %, respectively, when no device is present. Conclusion The results of this study show that this prototype vein valve design is capable of providing significant relief of reflux under realistic conditions without inducing any increase in antegrade flow resistance and warrants further testing with in vivo models. </p...|$|R

Influences due to a deviation of the seam loop position in the sensor can be excluded because of the good coupling. The red marked areas in coupling evaluation in the upper seam bond area b arises due to the larger active sensor area (6.5  mm) in contrast to the <b>flange</b> <b>length</b> of seam area b (6  mm). Consequently, the inner sheet is sounded in this area, whereby the echo resulting from the material transition is generated outside the gate for an OK coupling. A change in the orientation of the seam bond loop of the sample within the sensor can be excluded as a further factor influencing the result. For this purpose, the straight edge of the laboratory sample has been investigated in this series of tests. Consequently, it can be ensured that the ultrasound results are solely related to the adhesive distribution and not to the geometrical shape of the seam bond or the orientation of the seam loop. Further investigations must show the extent to which this can be ensured later in the series process.|$|E

40|$|The {{deck load}} {{capacity}} of new offshore platforms is increasing as these marine structures {{continue to increase}} in size. As a consequence, the structural weight has become a concern. The current investigation contributes to a solution of a more weight-effective structural design of shell-plated marine structures. The structural weight of a shell-plated structure can be reduced in various ways. In the current investigation, an alternative design is presented {{by means of a}} corrugated structure. By the introduction of corrugated panels, a structure may be constructed lighter and cheaper compared to traditional structures with stiffened panels. The welding work during manufacturing can also be reduced substantially. Even though the idea of using corrugated shell plating has been practiced in various applications for a long time, such as in corrugated bulkhead and deck plating, it is yet unexplored in shell structures. Thus, the aim with this study is to compare corrugated shell plating with conventional stiffened panels with respect to strength, weight and cost. A methodology is presented where various solutions are analyzed and compared with regard to strength characteristics, weight and cost. Here, strength characteristics include ultimate tensile strength, buckling stability and fatigue life calculations. Detailed numerical analyses are presented using a realistic and reasonable area of a panel structure of an offshore platform. The structure analyses are carried out using linear finite element analyses. A number of design criteria have been evaluated and verified by comparing predictions obtained in an extensive parametric study of basic structural strength following classification rules. Two alternative designs with corrugated shell plating are proposed with respect to corrugation symmetry. The first one had unequal flanges and the same thickness as that of the reference stiffened model. The second had equal <b>flange</b> <b>lengths.</b> The weight reduction values achieved using these designs were 38 percent and 59 percent in shell plating, respectively, compared with a reference model for traditional stiffened shell plating.

For example, {{in the field of}} the body in white construction the metal forming-specific process steps in the press shop and the hemming processes in the body shop are designed with the aid of finite element simulations. Even though the computing speeds of the latest finite element solvers are increasing constantly, there is still a huge effort in time to do the pre- and post-processing of a hemming simulation. In order to improve the response time of the hang-on-parts ’ manufacturing process verification, a metamodel-based part analysis is aspired. Based on a categorization of the part outline, which has to be analysed, a validation of the hemming process is carried out by using mathematical metamodels in terms of predicting failure probability and production feasibility. By splitting up the part outline into individual segments a fast analysis can be achieved. Here, an automated process is evaluating each segment individually with a special diagnostic technique. The system delivers output results, such as plastic strain values, the tendency of wrinkling, <b>flange</b> <b>length,</b> roll in, etc. Especially in an early development phase, this procedure is advantageous to compare and evaluate different hemming concept alternatives in an efficient way.

40|$|Cold {{rotary forging}} is an {{innovative}} incremental metal forming process whose main characteristic {{is that the}} workpiece is only partially in contact with a conical tool, reducing therefore the required forging loads. However, in spite of many benefits of such a process, wide industrial implementation of rotary forging is not possible without proper understanding of material behaviour. In the present work, the capability of rotary forging process was explored for the manufacturing of flared cylindrical parts by cold forming. Another main aim {{was to assess the}} cold formability of high-strength materials for aerospace applications (martensitic stainless steels) under incremental processes. In order to understand the impact of rotary forging on the final properties of formed components, microstructural and mechanical analysis were performed. Microstructural and hardness analysis were conducted on both axial and transverse sections along the cold formed flange in order to study the grain flow orientation and strain distribution. In a similar fashion, mechanical test specimens were machined from different positions and orientations along the rotary forged component. Further analysis was performed on the components in the as-treated condition {{in order to understand the}} response of cold-worked Jethete M 152 components to subsequent heat treatments. Microstructural and hardness analysis clearly reveals a strong grain reorientation and strain localization around “pickup” defects (material attached to the upper tool) observed on the flange top surface, close to the flange edge. These results suggest that an excessive deformation is localized during the early stages of the flange formation. Another characteristic feature found in the rotary forged parts is the presence of a buckling phenomenon which appears in later stages of the rotary forging process. Strain hardening along with the increasing <b>flange</b> <b>length</b> requires higher levels of forging loads to keep forming the flange. This results into a significant accumulation of compressive stresses in the transition region between the flange and the straight region. Gradually the resultant compressive force exceeds the critical buckling load, leading to the occurrence of the buckling phenomenon. This latter issue determines the limit of the cold flaring process. This can help to determine the maximum length of the flange part, achievable in this process, which is of great importance for the design of these manufacturing technologies. From the mechanical testing results, large differences were found as a function of both position and orientation (axial, transverse) throughout the rotary forged components (anisotropic properties). Concerning the impact of heat treatments on cold-worked components, no differences were found in the as-treated condition, in terms of microstructural and mechanical properties between regions with a large difference in strain distribution. These results denote the normalizing effect of conventional hardening treatments on cold-worked Jethete M 152 components, restoring the homogenous and isotropic properties across the whole componen...|$|E

Three grades of stainless steel are considered: duplex EN 1. 4462, austenitic EN 1. 4404 and ferretic EN 1. 4003. In total, 2218 finite element models were analyzed. From the results of the parametric study, strength reduction factors for load bearing capacity are determined, where these reduction factors are applied to the bearing capacity calculated for a web without openings, to take account the influence of the web openings. The strength reduction factors are first compared to equations recently proposed for cold-formed carbon steel lipped channel-sections. It is shown that for the case of the duplex grade, the strength reduction factor equations for cold-formed carbon steel are conservative but only by 2 %. However, for the cases of the austentic and ferritic grades, the cold-formed carbon steel equations are around 9 % conservative. New strength reduction factor equations are proposed for all three stainless steel grades...|$|R
