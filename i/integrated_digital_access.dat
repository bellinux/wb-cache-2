40|$|Abstract. <b>Integrated</b> <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> to {{multiple}} collections is a prominent issue for many Cultural Heritage institutions. Metadata describing diverse collections must be interoperable to achieve integrated access. Aligning the controlled vocabularies {{that are used}} to annotate objects in different Cultural Heritage collections could provide such interoperability. In this paper, we present an experiment where we apply Semantic Web techniques to match the vocabularies of two collections. We discuss the steps that are required for such matching, namely formalizing the initial resources using Semantic Web languages, and running ontology mapping tools on the resulting representations. In addition, we present a prototype that enables one to browse the two collections using the obtained alignment while still providing the user with the original vocabulary structures. ...|$|E

40|$|The Cellular <b>Access</b> <b>Digital</b> Network (CADN) is {{the access}} vehicle through which {{cellular}} technology {{is brought into}} the mainstream of the evolving integrated telecommunications network. Beyond the <b>integrated</b> end-to-end <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> and per call network services provisioning of the <b>Integrated</b> Services <b>Digital</b> Network (ISDN), the CADN engenders the added capability of mobility freedom via wireless access. One key element of the CADN network architecture is the standard user to network interface that is independent of RF transmission technology. Since the Mobile Satellite System (MSS) is envisioned to not only complement but also enhance the capabilities of the terrestrial cellular telecommunications network, compatibility and interoperability between terrestrial cellular and mobile satellite systems are vitally important to provide an integrated moving telecommunications network of the future. From a network standpoint, there exist very strong commonalities between the terrestrial cellular system and the mobile satellite system. Therefore, the MSS architecture should be designed {{as an integral part of}} the CADN. This paper describes the concept of the CADN, the functional architecture of the MSS, and the user-network interface signaling protocols...|$|R

40|$|Archaeologically site {{catchment}} analysis produces {{valuable information}} regarding prehistoric subsistence strategies and social organization. Incorporating archaeological data into catchment analyses {{is an effective}} strategy to develop regional models of prehistoric site selection and settlement patterns. <b>Digital</b> <b>access</b> to data permits the incorporation of multiple layers of information into the process of synthesizing regional archaeology and interpreting corresponding spatial patterning. GIS software provides a means to <b>integrate</b> <b>digital</b> environmental and archaeological data into an effective tool. Resultant environmental archaeology maps facilitate interpretive analysis. To fulfill the objectives of this thesis, GIS software is employed to construct site catchment areas for archaeological sites and to implement multivariate statistical analyses of physical and biological attributes of catchments in correlation with assemblage data from sites. Guided by ecological, anthropological and geographical theories hypotheses testing evaluates patterns of prehistoric socio-economic behavior. Analytical results are summarized in a model of prehistoric settlement patterns in North Central Texas...|$|R

In the receive path an interpolative A/D converter gives the high accuracy which is prerequisite for effective digital echo cancellation. Various additional features like power-down capability with wake-up signal detection will ease the design of the complete ISDN interface module. (IMS...|$|R
40|$|This book {{chapter is}} {{published}} in the IGI Global book series Advances in Electronic Government, Digital Divide, and Regional Development,The concept of e-Government sub-assumes that of <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> to activities {{of public and private}} sector organisations. Explicitly, <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> includes improving government processes, connecting citizens, and building external interactions. Following the formation of the inclusive government as determined by the Global Political Agreement (GPA), Zimbabwe established the Ministry of Information Communication Technology whose mission is to promote the deployment and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to intensify national competitiveness and growth. Driving the <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> and e-Government agenda in Zimbabwe is a Modernisation Unit within the Office of the President and Cabinet and the Ministry of Information Communication Technology guided by ?Zimconnect,? the e-Government framework, and other enabling instruments. Particular attention is paid to instruments that enable <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> and e-Government in Zimbabwe. The chapter attempts to contextualise <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> and e-Government, outlines e-Government policy objectives and constraints, explains the e-Government framework, including ?Zimconnect? and others, and concludes with a section on strategies for enabling <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> and e-Government with a special focus on the possible role of library and information services...|$|R
