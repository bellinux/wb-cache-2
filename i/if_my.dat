I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.|$|E

And, you know, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> success means that other presses will {{take a second look}} at these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, then our ship will come in.|$|E

But when he chooses, {{in the course of his}} economies, to economise at the expense of human life, when his economy involves the withholding from his employees of reasonable remuneration, or reasonable conditions of human existence, then, as I understand the Act, Parliament insists on the payment of the Excise duty.|$|E
25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy <b>if</b> <b>my</b> testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|Due to his non-ideal size as a pitcher, {{some have}} seen issues in Loup's stamina and durability. His pitches can also {{come across as}} [...] "a bit too hittable." [...] He is, however, {{especially}} effective when pitching against left-handed batters. In 2013, Loup was viewed by the Blue Jays' manager John Gibbons as [...] "not necessarily a long guy; he's more a situational, one-inning guy." [...] Despite his shortcomings, Loup has the lowest walk rate among all major league pitchers who have pitched at least seventy innings since 2012, having walked only 2.6% of the batters he has faced. His consistency and endurance have made Loup the Blue Jays' most-used reliever, and he says [...] "I'm {{one of those guys}} that <b>if</b> <b>my</b> body would let me, I would pitch every day." ...|$|E

Le Mesurier died in November 1983 from a stomach haemorrhage; his last words before slipping into a coma were: [...] "It's all been rather lovely." [...] The Guardian noted that Le Mesurier gave the impression of an [...] "inimitable brand of bewildered persistence under fire which [...] made his own", while Philip Oakes considered that Le Mesurier single-handedly [...] "made more films watchable, even absorbing than anyone else around".|$|E
500|$|Rap-Up {{magazine}} {{reflected on}} the lyrics of the song, calling them a personal reflection of Diddy's life and career thanks to lines like [...] "What am I ‘posed {{to do when the}} club lights come on/ It’s easy to be Puff, but it’s harder to be Sean/ What <b>if</b> <b>my</b> twins ask why I ain’t married their mom?" [...] Scott Schetler from AOL Radio Blog noted how Diddy referenced a different popular song in each verse. Lamb particularly noted the strong autobiographical lyrics, and the references to the 1979 hit song [...] "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now" [...] by McFadden & Whitehead. Other songs referenced include Dionne Warwick's [...] "A House Is Not a Home" [...] (1964) and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' [...] "The Tears of a Clown" [...] (1970). Rodriguez said [...] "Diddy do some soul-searching in his rhymes as the chorus echoes his need for salvation." ...|$|E
