5|$|The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has {{established}} ten disability categories. Athletes are divided within each category {{according to their}} level of impairment, in a <b>functional</b> <b>classification</b> system which differs from sport to sport.|$|E
5|$|The move to <b>functional</b> <b>classification</b> {{coincided with}} the rise of sports science. The first {{detailed}} international swimming sport science project was conducted at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was followed by a similar project at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors involved in high performance swimming.

25|$|Warning {{signs are}} often used where sight {{distance}} is insufficient. The US MUTCD requires Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead or Signal Ahead signs at intersections where the traffic control device is not visible from a distance equal to the stopping sight distance at speed of approaching traffic. Hill Blocks View signs can be used where crest vertical curves restrict sight distance. However, many jurisdictions still expect drivers to use ordinary care regarding conditions readily apparent to a driver, without the prompting of a sign. The care and focus ordinarily required of a driver against certain types of hazards may be somewhat amplified on roads with lower <b>functional</b> <b>classification.</b> The probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of access points, and this density should be readily apparent to a driver even when a specific access point is not. For this reason, full corner sight distance is almost never required for individual driveways in urban high-density residential areas, and street parking is commonly permitted within the right-of-way.|$|E
500|$|While {{there is}} no clear date when the shift occurred, a <b>functional</b> <b>classification</b> system became the norm for {{disabled}} athletic classification in the 1980s. [...] In a functional system the focus is on what effect the athlete's impairment has on his or her athletic performance. [...] Under this system, athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports, because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial. [...] The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by International Blind Sport Federation (IBSA), which still uses a medically based system.|$|E

500|$|Going {{into the}} 1992 Summer Paralympics, the International Coordinating Committee and the Technical Committee of the IPC {{push for a}} move towards a <b>functional</b> <b>classification</b> system. This {{came to a head}} at the November 1989 meeting of the Barcelona Olympics Organising Committee (Comite Organitzador Olimpic Barcelona - COOB), when a {{discussion}} started about what events and classifications should be eligible for the Games. [...] A study by the organising committee and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in the lead-up to the meeting looked at the results of recent international competitions. It proposed a series of classes, based on the competitive results, for use in Barcelona. COOB insisted that such a system be implemented to ensure the sport at the Paralympic Games was serious and competitive, instead of recreational. [...] The suggestions were implemented for sports such as swimming and athletics. [...] The Games were the first ones where swimmers of different types of disabilities competed against each other, swimmers had a guaranteed right to appeal their classification.|$|E
500|$|All {{disability}} types {{were eligible}} to participate at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC oversaw classification based on functional disability. General and <b>functional</b> <b>classification</b> {{took place in}} the Paralympic Village, with functional swimming classification taking place on the same dates at the Piscines Bernat Picronell. The process became a contentious issue at the Paralympics because of on-the-spot reclassifications that resulted in changes to the competition schedule. On-the-spot classification or re-classification was viewed as a negative aspect of the 1996 Summer Paralympics, and the Paralympic movement overall. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 54 assessments were conducted, resulting in 13 class changes. There was one Paralympic New Status (PNS) protest and two Paralympic Permanent Status (PPS) protests by a national Paralympic committee, with one classification upheld and two denied. Six classification appeals were lodged for swimming at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving four athletes, resulting in two class changes. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. [...] This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. [...] In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, swimming classification was scheduled to take place at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, with visually impaired swimmers getting classified from September 4 to 6 and all other swimmers being classified from September 3 to 5. [...] For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through [...] classification or reclassification in Rio, their in-competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.|$|E
2500|$|Going {{into the}} first winter Paralympic Games, the 1976 Winter Paralympics, the organisers had a {{difference}} of opinion with Paralympic Games founder Ludwig Guttmann, because they wanted a <b>functional</b> <b>classification,</b> not medical classification system, from the onset. [...] They largely succeeded, although the system that was developed in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, that ended up being used was based on equipment utilised by the skier instead of a true <b>functional</b> <b>classification</b> system. During the 1970s, equipment was first being developed for skiers with spinal injuries and a classification system had yet to become fully developed for the sport.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} this, {{classification}} of vessels by type or function can be difficult. Even using very broad <b>functional</b> <b>classifications</b> such as fishery, trade, military, and exploration fails to classify {{most of the}} old ships.

40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>classifications</b> {{have been}} seen as a {{necessary}} tool for the simplification of floristic complexity in global vegetation models (Neilson et al. 1992; Prentice et al. 1992; Foley et al. 1996; Woodward & Cramer 1996), for mapping vegetation patterns at key times in the past (Prentice and Webb 1998; Prentice et al. 2000), and for monitoring effects of global change or management on vegetation distribution and ecosystem processes (Díaz et al. 2002 a, Cruz et al. 2002). Plant <b>functional</b> <b>classifications</b> were first designed by grouping plants a priori based on knowledge of their function, or based on observed correlations among their morphological, physiological, biochemical, reproductive or demographic characteristics (Woodward & Cramer 1996; Smith et al. 1997). It was assumed that these classifications would allow to predict changes in ecosystem processes directly from projected changes in plant species composition in response to global change. This idea was challenged by the recognition that functional effect groups (species with a similar effect on one or several ecosystem functions; e. g. primary productivity, nutrient cycling, Gitay & Noble 1997, Walker et al. 1999) and functional response groups (groups of species with a similar response to...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic lethals are to {{pairs of}} non-essential genes whose {{simultaneous}} deletion prohibits growth. One can extend {{the concept of}} synthetic lethality by considering gene groups of increasing size where only the simultaneous elimination of all genes is lethal, whereas individual gene deletions are not. We developed optimization-based procedures for the exhaustive and targeted enumeration of multi-gene (and by extension multi-reaction) lethals for genome-scale metabolic models. Specifically, these approaches are applied to iAF 1260, the latest model of Escherichia coli, leading to the complete identification of all double and triple gene and reaction synthetic lethals {{as well as the}} targeted identification of quadruples and some higher-order ones. Graph representations of these synthetic lethals reveal a variety of motifs ranging from hub-like to highly connected subgraphs providing a birds-eye view of the avenues available for redirecting metabolism and uncovering complex patterns of gene utilization and interdependence. The procedure also enables the use of falsely predicted synthetic lethals for metabolic model curation.
