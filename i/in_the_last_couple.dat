5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, {{as well as other}} mediums. Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> of years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters {{and at the same time}} not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E

The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.|$|E

In a long case study, 8 patients were given spinal cord stimulation via insertion of a percutaneous lead at the appropriate level of the cervical or thoracic spine. Between 36 and 149 months after the stimulations, the patients were interviewed. 6 of the 8 had received initial pain relief, and three experienced long-term pain relief. Spinal cord stimulation is cheaper than brain stimulation and less invasive, and is thus a more promising option for pain treatment.|$|E

25|$|After 14 {{golden years}} at Werder Bremen, Rehhagel left to manage former hated rivals, Bayern Munich, {{before the start}} of the 1995–96 season. Prior to Rehhagel's arrival, Bayern had a disappointing, but financially lucrative season in 1994–95 (a very poor sixth place in the Bundesliga, but semi-finals in the Champions League). In the summer of 1995, Bayern spent a lot of money, buying Jürgen Klinsmann, Andreas Herzog, and others, and Rehhagel was brought in as manager to replace Giovanni Trapattoni. It was widely {{expected}} that Munich would steamroll the opposition in 1995–96, but from Day 1, Rehhagel clashed with the team and the team environment. His single-minded and occasionally eccentric ways did not mesh at all with Bayern, who quickly felt that Rehhagel was too rural at heart and had no clue about how to interact in the fancy environment of Munich. Moreover, Rehhagel's old-school tactics and patronising of the Bayern players caused major antipathy in the Bayern team, especially from Klinsmann, who never missed an opportunity to take shots at Rehhagel. Despite Rehhagel getting Bayern to the UEFA Cup final, Bayern's results in the Bundesliga dropped alarmingly in the second half of the season, and Rehhagel was famously sacked just 4 days before they were due to play in the first leg of the 1996 UEFA Cup final. Rehhagel's job was taken over by Franz Beckenbauer, who led the team to victory in the 1996 UEFA Cup final, and oversaw an upturn in form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks in the Bundesliga, but Bayern finished second, as Borussia Dortmund won their second German championship in a row.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{automotive}} area, a {{huge number}} of different technologies were developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couples</b> of years. <b>The</b> car manufacturers have to meet the challenge of selecting the most suitable components for their purpose. One way of doing so is to evaluate these components by the help of a car simulation model. Because of the huge number of different technologies, also a lot of simulation models are needed to be able to compare all of those innovative technologies. In this paper, a system is described, with which it is possible to automatically generate simulation models. This system is used to generate varied simulation models which represent different car configurations. After the generation of a model for each car configuration, a parameter optimization is automatically executed. The result is a chosen car simulation model with its set of parameters, which presents an optimal solution for the regarded aim, e. g. efficiency. ...|$|R
