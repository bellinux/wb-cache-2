25|$|Of course, we may <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{more about}} {{this part of the}} question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|Prior to broadcast, Colfer {{anticipated}} that the episode's sexual themes and content would prove controversial among television watchdog groups. He said, [...] "I absolutely <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from them, but I think it's handled very sweetly and very emotionally. They're expecting this big, raunchy, suggestive, brainwashing storyline when, really, it's very sweet." [...] Before the episode aired, the conservative Parents Television Council called the show [...] "reprehensible" [...] and the Fox network reckless for [...] "celebrating teen sex".|$|E
500|$|Many {{men come}} to church to save or gain a reputation; {{or because they}} will not be singular, but comply with an {{established}} custom; yet, all the while, they are loaded with the guilt of old rooted sins.

500|$|In August 2007, Microsoft {{issued its}} Game Content Usage Rules, a license {{intended}} {{to address the}} legal status of machinima based on its games, including the Halo series. Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, you can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from Microsoft's lawyers who will tell you that you have to stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pusher Love Girl" [...] {{opens with}} a [...] "swirling" [...] of [...] "luscious" [...] strings, which Nate Jones of Popdust cited as being [...] "straight from a Hollywood classic". Allan Raible of ABC News wrote that the [...] "stringed fanfare" [...] is {{something}} you would <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{on the red carpet}} of an awards ceremony. Jim Farber of the Daily News called the opening [...] "classic enough" [...] for Michael Jackson. After the [...] "sweeping" [...] orchestral intro, the song transcends into a [...] "funky main section", which, according to Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, is a [...] "sweet slice of funk-soul seduction". According to Thomas, [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] starts off like a [...] "classic Sinatra song": with a [...] "rise of strings" [...] that [...] "hit a pitch before dropping into a neo-soul sound".|$|E
500|$|Alan Baker broadly agrees, stating, [...] "There is no {{evidence}} that this was common practice among gladiators. As far as we know, the only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by Claudius." [...] Plass notes that [...] "it is hard to see why or how the phrase came to be used on this occasion if it was not a regular formula. On the other hand, if it was something that Claudius might <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible gaucherie." [...] He comments on the distancing effect of the Latin source and the first person of the Greek source and notes that the interpretation and response by the fighters [...] "seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in the arena".|$|E

500|$|The {{reception}} of Impressionist {{art at the}} Gallery got off to an exceptionally stormy start. In 1906, Sir Hugh Lane promised 39 paintings, including Renoir's Umbrellas, to the National Gallery on his death, unless a suitable building could be built in Dublin. Although eagerly accepted by the director Charles Holroyd, they were received with extreme hostility by the Trustees; Lord Redesdale wrote that [...] "I would as soon <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of a Mormon service being conducted in St. Paul's Cathedral as to see the exhibition {{of the works of}} the modern French Art-rebels in the sacred precincts of Trafalgar Square". Perhaps as a result of such attitudes, Lane amended his will with a codicil that the works should only go to Ireland, but crucially this was never witnessed. Lane died on board the RMS Lusitania in 1915, and a dispute began which was not resolved until 1959. Part of the collection is now on permanent loan to Dublin City Gallery ("The Hugh Lane") and other works rotate between London and Dublin every few years.|$|E
500|$|On November 5, 2011, Ocean {{performed}} [...] "I Miss You" [...] at the House of Blues in New Orleans. Dressed in a {{black suit}} with a red-and-white bandana around his head, {{he sat down at}} an electric piano to perform it live to end the evening. The crowd also sang along. Alex Rawls of Rolling Stone found his performance to be [...] "warm and soulful". British indie pop band The xx covered the song on February 14, 2013 during their concert in Austin, Texas and later posted the cover on their official blog. Their cover of the song was a duet between Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim accompanied by spare guitar and bass. Their cover of the song was described as [...] "great" [...] by Jenn Pelly of Pitchfork Media, while Sam Weiss of Complex magazine praised the performance saying that the band made the song sound similar to their own material from the album Coexist (2012). Chris Martins of Spin magazine commented that [...] "It's exactly what you'd <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> and it's exactly as beautiful as you'd hope it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|While Ozzy Osbourne {{was working}} on new solo album {{material}} in 2006, Rhino Records released , a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single [...] "The Devil Cried" [...] reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about {{the name of the}} group, Iommi stated [...] "it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [...] so people won't <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again." ...|$|E

[...] Consequence of Sounds Harley Brown felt that Ocean did an uncanny impression of Stevie Wonder, and placed the song amongst Channel Orange's essential tracks. Nathan Slavik of the DJBooth called the vocals [...] "appropriately sweet, softly painting {{a picture of a}} life lived in the black Beverly Hills", and commented [...] "just in time for the weekend, <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> this one played at pool side barbecues nationwide." [...] The Huffington Posts Alan Pyke called it one of the album's standout tracks, writing that the [...] "bubbling keys and bass" [...] of the track [...] "show how captivating beats elevate Frank Ocean to best-in-class status", praising the production by Williams. Aidin Vaziri of the San Francisco Chronicle listed the song as one of the [...] "swoon worthy" [...] tracks off the album, and felt that Ocean [...] "managed to evoke the carefree feeling of Saturday mornings {{in front of the television}} watching Soul Train. The track charted on the South Korea Gaon International Chart at number 124.|$|E
500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often is a sign that you're not doing it right. I thought, I'm not getting this. So he said, 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|Azaria did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{from the}} show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going}} to be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E

500|$|In the comics, the Rippers are {{considerably}} more kangaroo-like. However, Talalay wanted real actors rather than stuntmen in suits playing the roles. She asked Hewlett to redesign the Rippers {{to make them}} more human, allowing them to have the actual actors' facial expressions. Requests were sent out to [...] "all the major make-up and effects people", including Stan Winston, whose prior work included the Terminator films, Aliens, and Jurassic Park. Talalay said that while she considered Winston to be the best, she did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> back from him. When she did, she still did not think that {{she would be able to}} afford his studio on her budget. A meeting was arranged and Winston insisted on being given the project, saying the Rippers would be: [...] "the best characters we've had the opportunity to do." [...] Winston's studio cut their usual prices in half to meet the film's budget. Eight Rippers featured in the film: half were given principal roles, the others were mainly in the background. Each Ripper had articulated ears and tails which were activated by remote control, and the background Rippers also had mechanical snouts which could be activated either by remote control or by the movement of the actors' mouths. Each Ripper's make-up took about four hours to apply. Three technicians from Winston's studio were required to work on each Ripper's articulations during filming; no puppets or digital effects were used for the Rippers.|$|E
500|$|... "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] {{garnered}} {{very positive}} reviews from most music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine for Allmusic was complimentary of the pop song, writing {{that it is}} [...] "giddy" [...] and [...] "delirious". Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that Aguilera is [...] "ramping up the romance and sexual energy" [...] on [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", which will make the listener {{need to take a}} cold shower. He also wrote that the listener should <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> [...] "lots of 'oooh', 'aah', and 'la la la' in her usual Mariah Carey-shrilling manner." [...] Sam Hine for Popjustice described the song as [...] "a welcome blast of upbeat pop following the rather serious start to the album. There are lots of good [...] "oooh" [...] "lalala" [...] hooky bits that all fit together and make a for an enjoyable listen." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard described it as the [...] "standout song on Lotus" [...] which sees her [...] "at her most relaxed and playful." [...] He also noted that Secon's production takes [...] "precedence" [...] on the song. Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club called it a [...] "dancehall-tinged, vibrant party jam," [...] while Sarah Rodman for The Boston Globe named it a [...] "kooky horn-and-yodel fest". Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "care-free" [...] and [...] "a bit cheeky." [...] Sarah Godfrey for The Washington Post praised Aguilera for sounding more like herself on the [...] "frenzied" [...] track. Jim Farber for Daily News wrote that [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] contains [...] "a can't-miss gimmick of a chorus". He also wrote that Aguilera [...] "hits the clubs in horny revenge." ...|$|E

[...] During a different interview, the girls talked about how different this album was from their shelved debut: [...] "Well it's very different coming out now because with this album we have more creative control. When we came out in 2003, we were young and we didn't {{have much of a}} say in what went down. But this time around, we were able to write every song on the album, which makes this album very personal for all of us."
